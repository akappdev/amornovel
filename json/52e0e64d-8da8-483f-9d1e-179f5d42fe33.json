It\u2019s the only word I can think of to describe how I\u2019m feeling \u2013 vivisected. As though someone has cut me open with a scalpel, the pain not sinking in until the flesh begins to separate and my blood bubbles out. I can hear the crack as my ribs are flayed open. Slowly, my organs, wet and sticky, are pulled out of me one at a time. Until I am hollow. Hollow and yet, in excruciating pain \u2013 still alive. Still. Alive.</p> <p>Above me, there are sterile and industrial fluorescent lights. One of the bulbs is threatening to go out and it flickers, buzzes, and struggles to stay alive. I\u2019ve been transfixed by its Morse code for the last hour. On-off-buzz-buzz-on-off. My eyes hurt. I keep staring. Following along with my own Morse code: Don\u2019t think about him. Don\u2019t think about him. Caleb. Don\u2019t think about him.</p><p>Somewhere, I\u2019m being watched. There\u2019s always someone here. There\u2019s someone to tug on my various cables. One to watch my heart, another my breathing, one to keep me numb. Don\u2019t think about him. Cables. They extend from my hand, where I receive my liquids and my drugs. They wind from my chest to monitor the beating of my heart. Sometimes I hold my breath, just to see if it will stop. Instead, it beats harder and faster in my chest and I gasp for breath. Buzzzzz-on-off.</p><p>There\u2019s someone who tries to feed me. She tells me her name, but I don\u2019t care. She doesn\u2019t matter. No one does. Nothing really matters. She asks me my name as though her kindness and gentleness will move me to speak. I never answer. I never eat.</p><p>My name is Kitten and my master is gone. What could possibly be more important?</p><p>In the corner of my mind, I see him, watching me in the shadows. \u201cDo you really think begging is going to work?\u201d asks Ghost Caleb. He smiles.</p> <p>I cry. Loud, horrible, sounds come out of me, so violent they shake my whole body. I can\u2019t make it stop. I want Caleb. I get drugs instead. The food comes through a tube while I sleep.</p><p>There\u2019s always someone watching.</p><p>Always.</p><p>I want to leave this place. There\u2019s nothing wrong with me. If Caleb were here, I\u2019d walk out of this place, happy, smiling and complete. But he\u2019s gone. And they won\u2019t let me grieve for him in peace.</p><p>Day 3:</p><p>I close my eyes and open them slowly. Caleb is standing over me. My heart races and tears of pure joy flood my eyes. He\u2019s finally here. He\u2019s finally come for me. His face is warm, his smile broad. There is a familiar tilt to his lips and I know he\u2019s thinking something naughty.</p> <p>A familiar tingle spreads throughout my belly and creeps down toward my pu**y making it swell and throb. I haven\u2019t had an orgasm in days and I\u2019ve become very accustomed to them.</p><p>\u201cShould I let you go? You look so sexy when you\u2019re tied down,\u201d he says through a smile.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I try to say. My mouth is unbelievably dry. My tongue feels heavy and dead in my mouth. My lips seem to have fared no better. They are chapped and when I scrape my tongue over my bottom lip, I can\u2019t help but think of sandpaper.</p><p>The tube they have been using to feed me is crammed up my left nostril and fed down the back of my throat. It itches. I can\u2019t scratch it. It hurts. I can\u2019t shake it free. I feel it every time I swallow and it tastes of antiseptic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Caleb says.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I whisper. I want him to tell me he\u2019s sorry for not telling me sooner...that he loves me.</p><p>\u201cFor the restraints,\u201d he says.</p><p>I frown. He loves restraints.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as we can be sure of your mental state, we can remove them.\u201d</p><p>This is wrong. Really wrong.</p><p>It\u2019s the drugs.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why you\u2019re here, Olivia?\u201d a woman asks, softly.</p><p>I am not Olivia. I\u2019m not that girl anymore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Janice Sloan. I\u2019m a forensic social worker for the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\u201d she says, \u201cThe police were able to identify you from your missing person\u2019s report. Your friend Nicole reported your abduction. We\u2019ve been looking for you. Your mother has been very worried.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to speak, so I can tell her to shut the f**k up. I can practically feel my skin crawling. Stop! Stop talking to me. But she won\u2019t. There will be more questions, the same questions, and this time I might have to answer them. I know it\u2019s the only way they\u2019ll let me go. They keep me strapped down and pumped full of drugs; they say I tried to hurt my nurse. I tell them they tried to hurt me first. I never asked to be brought to the hospital. The blood wasn\u2019t mine and the original owner wouldn\u2019t miss it. I was fairly certain he was dead. I should know \u2013 I killed him.</p><p>\u201cI know this can\u2019t be easy for you. What you\u2019ve been through...\u201d I hear her swallow. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it,\u201d she continues. It reeks of pity and I don\u2019t want it. Not from her. She reaches her hand out to touch mine and I instantly recoil. The harsh clang of my hands smacking against the railing of my bed is like a threat of violence. I am more than willing to inflict violence if she tries to touch me again.</p><p>She holds up both her hands and steps away. My breathing begins to settle and the black ring surrounding my vision dissipates, until the world is once again in high definition, color. Now that she has drawn my attention, I notice she isn\u2019t alone. There is a man with her. He cocks his head and stares at me like I am a riddle he wants to solve. The look is heartbreakingly familiar.</p><p>I roll my head toward the window, staring at the light filtering through the horizontal blinds. My stomach clenches. Caleb. His name whispers through my mind. He used to look at me that way. I wonder why, since he seemed so capable of reading my mind. My body aches. I miss him. I miss him so much. I feel tears again, sliding down the corners of my eyes.</p><p>Dr. Sloan, doesn\u2019t relent, \u201cHow are you feeling? I\u2019ve been briefed by the social worker who was present during your initial exam, as well as the events witnessed by the Laredo Police Department.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. Memories assault me, but I fight them. This is exactly what I didn\u2019t want.</p><p>\u201cI know it doesn\u2019t seem like it, but I\u2019m here to help you. You\u2019re being held on charges of assault against federal border patrol officers, possession of a weapon, resisting arrest, and suspicion of felony murder. I\u2019m here to determine your competency, but also to assist you. I\u2019m sure you have your reasons for what happened, but I can\u2019t help you if you won\u2019t talk to me. Please, Olivia. Let me help you,\u201d Dr. Sloan says.</p><p>My panic is rising. Already my chest is heaving and the world is black around the edges. Tears choke me around the tube in my throat. The f**king pain of the post-Caleb world is endless. I knew it would be.</p><p>\u201cYour mother is trying to find someone to take care of your brothers and sisters, so she can come see you,\u201d she says.</p><p>NO! Stay away.</p><p>\u201cShe should be here in the next day or two. You can talk to her on the phone if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>I am whimpering. I want her to stop. I want them all to go away \u2013 this woman, the man in the corner, my mother, my siblings, even Nicole. I don\u2019t want to hear them. I don\u2019t want to see them. Go away, go away, go away.</p><p>I scream bloody f**king murder. I won\u2019t go back!</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d I scream. \u201cHelp me!\u201d My body wants to curl in on itself but can\u2019t. I am bound, like a caged animal on display. They want to know what\u2019s wrong, but they will never, and can never understand. I can never tell them. This pain is mine to keep.</p><p>I scream and scream and scream until someone rushes in and presses all my magic buttons.</p><p>The drugs take over.</p><p>Caleb.</p><p>Day 5:</p><p>I\u2019m fully aware I am in the psych ward of the hospital. I\u2019ve been told many times. I can\u2019t help but laugh inwardly at the irony. They will let me go once I\u2019m able to tell them to release me. But I won\u2019t speak. I am literally holding myself hostage. Maybe I am crazy. Maybe I belong here.</p><p>The bruises on my wrists and ankles are an angry shade of purple. I suppose I fought pretty hard. I miss the restraints. In a way, they allowed me the freedom to writhe and flail. They gave me something and someone to fight against. Without them...I feel like a traitor. No longer a prisoner, I seem to be allowing them to keep me here.</p><p>I eat when they bring me food, to keep me from having that f**king tube in my nose. I shower when they say I must. I get back in my bed like a good little girl. I float away with the drugs. Oh, how I love the drugs.</p><p>But, they never leave me alone. There is always someone here, watching me like I\u2019m a lab experiment. Whenever the fog of the drugs lifts, they are here: Dr. Sloan, or her \u2018associate\u2019, Agent Reed. He likes to stare at me. I stare back.</p><p>The first one to look away is the loser.</p><p>Often, it\u2019s me. His glare is unnerving.</p><p>In Reed\u2019s eyes I see a familiar determination and a cunning I have never been a match for.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked, soft and low.</p><p>I feel as though he is telling me I have no choice but to break. Eventually, he\u2019ll get what he wants from me. I taunt him with my silence. Sometimes he smirks at me. And then, Caleb\u2019s specter seems much more pronounced.</p><p>When I failed to respond, the fingers of his right hand trailed across the underside of my right breast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On this particular day, he looks away from me first and returns his attention to the laptop in front of him. He types, and then scrolls through information I can\u2019t see.</p><p>I took a sharp breath and leaned away from his touch, forcing my tightly shut eyes into the skin of my upraised arm.</p><p>Slowly he reaches for his briefcase on the ground, next to his chair and pulls out a few brown folders. He opens one and makes some notes while furrowing his brow.</p><p>His lips caressed the shell of my ear...</p> <p>I know.</p><p>I know Caleb is not here. I\u2019m f**ked in the head. Factually, I take stock of the fact Agent Reed is a very good-looking man. Not as handsome as Caleb. Still, he strikes me as equally intense. His pitch black hair seems a little too long for his profession, but he keeps it impeccably groomed. He wears the A-typical, movie G-man outfit: white shirt, black suit, dark-colored tie. He makes it look good though, like he\u2019d be wearing it even if it weren\u2019t a requirement. I wonder what he\u2019d look like without it on\u2014</p><p>Caleb has made me into this. He admitted it. I am everything he wanted me to be. And in the end, what did I get in return?</p><p>I knew he smiled, though I couldn\u2019t see it. A shiver, so strong my body nearly jerked toward his, ran down my spine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mother should be here today,\u201d says Agent Reed. His tone is detached, but he keeps glancing at me sidelong. He\u2019s eager for my reaction.</p> <p>My heart stutters, but the jolt is over quickly and once again I simply feel...nothing. She is my mother; I am her daughter. It\u2019s inevitable. Eventually, I will have to see her. I know I\u2019ll have to say the words when I do. I\u2019ll have to tell her I don\u2019t want to go back with her. I\u2019ll have to tell her to forget all about me.</p><p>I\u2019ve been grateful for the reprieve, but really \u2013 it\u2019s taken her five days to get here? Perhaps telling her to leave me alone will be easier than I thought. My feelings are ambiguous on the subject.</p><p>\u201cTell me about where you\u2019ve been for almost four months. Tell me where you got the gun and the money, and I\u2019ll see to it your mom walks you out of here today.\u201d Reed says. His tone is salacious, as though he wants me to buy what he\u2019s selling.</p><p>No thanks. They know about the money \u2013 it didn\u2019t take them long. I look at him with confused eyes and an innocent head tilt. Money? He stares at me for a second, then looks down at his folders and writes something mysterious. Agent Reed isn\u2019t buying my bullshit. He isn\u2019t impressed. At least he isn\u2019t a complete fool.</p><p>His lips caressed the shell of my ear, \u201cAre you going to answer? Or must I force you again?\u201d</p><p>Tick-tock \u2013 I can\u2019t hide behind my silence forever. There are some pretty serious charges against me. I guess one does not simply walk into the U.S. from Mexico. I know I should cooperate, tell him the story and get him on my side, but I just can\u2019t do it. If I break my silence, I will never be able to leave this behind. My entire life will forever be overshadowed by the last four months. More than that, I don\u2019t know what the f**k to say! What can I say? For the hundredth time today, I miss, Caleb.</p> <p>Something drips onto my neck and I realize I\u2019m crying. I wonder how long Agent Reed has been watching me, waiting for me to break down and give in. I feel lost and his flicker of concern suddenly seems like a lifeline. It\u2019s hard not to see Caleb, in his stead.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I stammered, \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>It is a few long, tense, seconds before he breaks the unending silence. \u201cYou may not believe me, but I have your best interests in mind. If you won\u2019t try to help us, help you, things will get out of your control. And quickly.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI need information. If you\u2019re afraid, we can protect you, but you have to give us a sign of good faith. Every day you say nothing, your window of opportunity shrinks.\u201d He stares at me, and I can feel him willing me with his powerful, dark eyes, to give him the answers he is looking for. For a moment, I want to believe he really does want to help me. Could I afford to trust a stranger?</p><p>What did he want from me that he couldn\u2019t just take?</p><p>My mouth opens, words are crouched on the tip of my tongue. He\u2019ll hurt him if you tell. My mouth slams shut.</p><p>Agent Reed looks frustrated. As well he should be, I suppose. He takes another deep breath and delivers me a look that says, \u2018Okay, you asked for it.\u2019 He reaches down and grabs one of the brown folders he was looking at earlier. He opens it, stares at it, then at me.</p><p>He leaned forward and held the delicious smelling morsel to my lips.</p><p>For a moment he looks unsure, but then determined. He removes a sheet from the file and walks toward me, the paper held loosely in one hand. I almost don\u2019t want to see what it is, but I can\u2019t help it. I have to see. My heart lurches! Every fiber of my being is suddenly singing. Tears sting my eyes and a sound mimicking both sorrow and joy bubbles out my mouth before I can keep it in check.</p> <p>It\u2019s a picture of Caleb! It\u2019s a picture of his beautiful, scolding face. I want it so badly I reach for it, fingers stretching to get closer to his image.</p><p>With an almost unabashed relief I opened my mouth, but he snatched it away.</p><p>\u201cYou know this man?\u201d Agent Reed says, but his tone makes it obvious he knows I do. This is his game. It\u2019s a good one. Through choked sobs, I reach for the photo again. Agent Reed keeps the photo just out of my reach.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d I whisper hoarsely, staring at that one piece of paper. If I blink, would it disappear?</p><p>He offered again.</p><p>I don\u2019t reach for the photo again, but I can\u2019t keep from looking at it. Caleb is younger in the photo, but not by much. He\u2019s still my Caleb. His blond hair is being blown up in the back and his Caribbean-blue eyes are glorious as they scowl at the camera. His mouth, so full and perfect for kissing is set in an annoyed line across his perfect face. He wears a buttoned up shirt, in white, the obviously billowing wind offers tantalizing glimpses of his sun-kissed throat. It\u2019s my Caleb. I want my Caleb. I glare at Agent Reed. With my rage in every syllable, I break my vow of silence. \u201cGive. Me. That.\u201d</p><p>Agent Reed\u2019s eyes go wide for a fraction of a second. Smug satisfaction is there, then gone. . Round one goes to the Agent. \u201cSo you do know him?\u201d he mocks.</p><p>I glare at him.</p><p>He steps closer, picture held out.</p><p>And again.</p><p>I go for it and he pulls it back.</p><p>Each time I crawled closer and closer, until I was pressed between his legs, my hands on either side of his body.</p><p>Caleb taught me a few things about starting fights I can\u2019t win. He would want me to use my head and exploit anything I have to offer to get what I want. I force myself to portray calmness and sorrow. The sadness comes easy.</p><p>\u201cI...I knew him.\u201d I purposely stare at my lap and let my tears fall.</p><p>\u201cKnew him?\u201d Agent Reed says curiously. I nod and let sobs fill the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d he asks. I want him curious.</p><p>\u201cGive me the picture,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cTell me what I want to know,\u201d he counters. I know I have him where I want him.</p><p>\u201cHe....\u201d I am overcome by grief. I don\u2019t have to manufacture my pain...I am my pain. \u201cHe died in my f**king arms.\u201d My mind immediately recalls seeing Caleb, expression blank, his body covered in dirt, and blood. It was the moment I lost him. Only hours before, he\u2019d held me in his arms and I had thought everything was finally going to be okay. One knock on the door...and everything changed.</p><p>Agent Reed takes a tentative step forward, \u201cThis isn\u2019t easy for you, I can tell, but I need to know how, Miss Ruiz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the picture,\u201d I sob. He takes another step.</p><p>\u201cTell me how,\u201d he whispers. He\u2019s played this game before.</p><p>I look up and glower at him from under my tear-soaked lashes, \u201cProtecting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d He steps closer, so close, and so eager.</p><p>\u201cFrom, Rafiq.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Agent Reed turns away to remove another photo from the file and turns it toward me, \u201cThis man?\u201d</p><p>I hiss. Actually, f**king hiss. We\u2019re both shocked by my reaction. I never knew I could be so feral. I rather like it. I feel capable of anything.</p><p>Suddenly I threw my arms up around his hand, wrapped my mouth around his fingers to get the food away from him. Oh my god, so good.</p><p>Agent Reed is close and he isn\u2019t prepared when I grab him by the collar of his suit and crush his f**king mouth with mine. He drops the folder.</p><p>Mine!</p><p>Despite his shock, Agent Reed is able to wrestle me onto the bed. He snaps his cuffs on my wrist and secures me to the bed. Before I can reach for the folder, he snaps it away.</p><p>He moved quickly, his fingers found my tongue and pinched viciously while his other hand dug into the sides of my neck.</p><p>Confusion and anger twist his features. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he whispers and wipes his lips slowly, looking at his fingers as though the answer is somehow written across them.</p><p>The food fell from between my lips to the floor and I howled around his fingers at the loss.</p><p>When I try to speak, instead, I scream my frustration, tears of anger filling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very proud and very spoiled and I\u2019m going to beat it out of you twice.\u201d</p><p>When the nurse scrambles in, bewildered and a hand to her heart, Agent Reed politely tells her to get lost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asks me, raising a brow.</p><p>I stare at my cuffed hands. \u201cNot even close...\u201d</p><p>Vivisected.

Caleb, I miss you.</p><p>\u201cHelp me catch him, Olivia.\u201d He pauses; his expression is calculated but he needs something too. \u201cI know I\u2019m not a nice guy, but maybe you need someone like me in your corner.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb.</p><p>Go away, go away, go away.</p><p>My heart aches. \u201cPlease...give me the picture,\u201d I plead.</p><p>Agent Reed steps within my line of sight, but I only stare at his tie. \u201cIf I give you the picture, will you tell me what happened? Will you answer my questions?\u201d</p><p>I suck my bottom lip, running my tongue across it as I hold it between my teeth. It\u2019s now or never and never isn\u2019t truly an option. The inevitable is upon me. \u201cUncuff me.\u201d</p> <p>The agent\u2019s eyes flicker over me. I know his mind must be racing with ideas on how to make me talk. Trust is a two way street. Show me yours, and I\u2019ll show you mine. He steps toward me, slowly, and cautiously removes the cuff from my wrist. \u201cWell?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. Only, you. In exchange, you\u2019ll give me any pictures you have of him and get me out of here.\u201d My heart is beating a frantic tattoo in my chest, but I gather my courage. I\u2019m a survivor. I hold my hand out. \u201cGive me the picture.\u201d</p><p>Agent Reed\u2019s mouth twists with disappointment at the knowledge he cannot win this point from me. Reluctantly, he gathers his folder and hands me the photo of Caleb. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me what you know first, and then I can talk to my superiors and make a deal. I promise I\u2019ll do whatever I can to protect you, but you have to start talking. You have to tell me why it looks like you\u2019re more involved in this than any eighteen-year-old-girl has any right to be.\u201d</p><p>No one else exists as I stare at Caleb\u2019s face. I sob and trace the familiar lines of his face. I love you, Caleb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go get some coffee,\u201d says Agent Reed, his voice resigned but still determined, \u201cbut when I come back, I expect answers.\u201d I don\u2019t notice when he leaves, or care. But I know he\u2019s giving me time to grieve in peace.</p><p>He walked out of the room and shut the door. This time I heard the lock.</p> <p>For the first time in five days, I am left alone. I suspect it will be the last time, for a while, Caleb and I will have to spend together. With trembling lips, I kiss him.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>It seemed to Caleb, the nature of human beings revolved around one empirical truth: we want what we cannot have. For Eve, it was the fruit of the forbidden tree. For Caleb, it was Livvie.</p><p>The night had been a fitful one. Livvie whimpered and trembled in her sleep and Caleb\u2019s chest seemed to contract with every sound. He had given her more morphine and after some time, her body seemed to quiet down though there still seemed to be frenzied movement behind her eyelids. Nightmares, he assumed. Without fear of awkwardness or reproach, he felt a compulsion to touch her. He held her close and comforted them both, but he could not get Rafiq\u2019s text out of his mind:</p><p>How soon would he land in Mexico?</p><p>How would he react to Livvie and her broken condition?</p><p>How long did he have with Livvie before she was taken away from him?</p><p>Taken. Away. Strange, horrible, and foreign words. He closed his eyes and set his mind to reality. You\u2019re giving her away. He opened his eyes. And the sooner, the better.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t argue with logic. It had kept him alive for longer than he could remember. He was cold and efficient. He did not dally with questions of morality. Still, he wanted to argue with logic. He wanted to find reason in what he felt to pacify the hardened man inside his head. But he couldn\u2019t. The truth was \u2013 he wanted her. The truth was also, it was never meant to be. He pulled Livvie even closer, careful not to crush her ribs or injured shoulder and buried his nose in her long hair, trying to smell her scent.</p><p>He had told her he wasn\u2019t her Prince Charming, but what he hadn\u2019t said, was he wished he could be. Once upon a time, he may have been...normal. Before he had been stolen, before the beatings and the rapes and the killing \u2013 he could have been something different than what he was. He had never thought like this, never wondered about the roads taken or not taken. His life was lived in the present and without the angst of fantasies. But he fantasized now. He fantasized about being the sort of man who could give, Livvie, all she ever wanted. The kind of man she could....</p><p>But you\u2019re not that man, are you?</p><p>Caleb sighed, knowing the answer. The fantasies of others had never confused him, but his own, left him dissatisfied with the life he\u2019d accepted and even enjoyed from time to time. He wanted it to go away, the longing, and the feelings of regret. He wanted to live for the hunt and kill \u2013 it had been the only thing to make sense to him for so very long. Even in those moments of darkness, when his drive had flagged and he questioned the possibility of ever finding Vladek \u2013 he had never thought to be anything other than what he was.</p><p>Yet, in just three and a half weeks with Livvie, most of which, she spent locked in a dark room, it all seemed to be evaporating. It was stupid, na\u00efve, and dangerous. A person was incapable of changing fundamentally in such a short period of time. He wasn\u2019t different. And yet, he felt different and not even logic could alter that. If it hadn\u2019t been for the memories, those awful, f**king memories of Narweh, beating and raping him. If he hadn\u2019t seen Livvie, covered in blood, bruised and shuddering in that biker\u2019s arms \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t feel like his entire world was caving in on him.</p><p>God! What he\u2019d done to make them pay. It had been the kind of rage he hadn\u2019t felt in a very long time. He didn\u2019t regret it either. He\u2019d savored the look on those biker\u2019s faces as he\u2019d plunged his knife deep into Tiny, and his blood sprayed Caleb, the walls, everything.</p><p>Revenge! That was his purpose.</p><p>It felt good to have a purpose. He was certain he\u2019d feel the rush again. He\u2019d feel it the second Vladek\u2019s eyes dawned with realization and it would carry through until Vladek took his last, gasping breath. Caleb shivered. He wanted to feel the satisfaction of that moment. He wanted to feel it more than anything. He wanted it more than he wanted the girl.</p><p>She\u2019ll hate you. Forever. She\u2019ll want vengeance.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Caleb whispered into the darkness of the room. Unable to resist the numbness sleep offered, he let himself be carried into the dark.</p><p>The boy refused to bathe.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, I will not tell you again! You stink! You stink, horribly. It\u2019s been days and you\u2019re still covered in blood. Someone will see you and then you will have real trouble on your hands, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am K\u00e9leb. Dog! I\u2019ve ripped my master to pieces. I\u2019ve tasted blood and I like it! I will not wash it off. I want to wear it forever, as a badge of honor.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq\u2019s dark face became drawn, eyes narrowed. \u201cBathe. Now.\u201d</p><p>The boy squared his young shoulders and glowered at his new master. Rafiq was handsome, much, much, more so than Narweh, the trained whore in him was stirred by this. Rafiq was also much stronger than Narweh, capable of more damage, but the boy would not allow himself to be afraid, to cower before a man set on being his new master. He was a man now, a man! He could make his own damn decisions about when he\u2019d wash the blood from his face.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Rafiq stood. His eyes were hard and menacing. The boy swallowed deep and hard, and despite his best efforts, he could not deny the fear he felt. As Rafiq approached, the boy quelled his desire to shrink away. Rafiq\u2019s calloused hand landed firmly on the back of the boy\u2019s neck and squeezed with enough force to make him wince, but not enough to trigger his fight or flight instinct.</p><p>Rafiq leaned and growled into the boy\u2019s ear, \u201cWash yourself now, or I will strip you down and scour your skin until you would never dream of defying me again.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung the boy\u2019s eyes. Not because he was in pain, but because he was suddenly very afraid and wished Rafiq was not angry with him. He had no one else. He was still young, unable to truly fend for himself. His race and appearance put him at a sharp disadvantage with the locals. Unless he wanted to be a whore again, Rafiq was all he had.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d He pleaded with a whisper. The hand at the back of his neck loosened a little and the boy screwed his eyes shut to stave off the threat of tears. He refused to cry.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know he\u2019s dead. It was over so fast, Rafiq. It was over so fast and he...he deserved to suffer! I wanted him to suffer, Rafiq. All the pain he put me through, all those things...I wanted him to feel all those things. If I wash away the blood...\u201d The boy\u2019s eyes pleaded with Rafiq.</p><p>\u201cIt will be like it never happened?\u201d Rafiq said, softly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was a choked sound.</p><p>Rafiq sighed. \u201cNo one knows how you feel more than I do, Caleb. But you cannot continue to defy me; you cannot continue to act like a petulant boy! You are not K\u00e9leb any longer. Wash. I promise you, Narweh will still be dead when you are finished.\u201d</p><p>The boy pushed away from the grip on the back of his neck. \u201cNo! No! No! I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq\u2019s face went from cautiously warm to stone cold. \u201cHave it your way, K\u00e9leb.\u201d His grip on the boy\u2019s neck intensified and as he winced with pain and tried to struggle away from Rafiq, his other hand came down with a meaty thud across the boy\u2019s face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caleb was not new to pain, he could easily take a harsh slap to his face, but he was stunned nonetheless. He tried to stagger away from Rafiq, but he was held firmly in the older man\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cBathe!\u201d Rafiq growled with enough force to vibrate Caleb\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Caleb cried, tears falling down his face.</p><p>Rafiq bent his body and threw his shoulder into Caleb\u2019s stomach and hoisted him over his shoulder. Ignoring the pounding fists on his back, he strode purposefully into the bathroom and all but tossed the boy inside. He ignored the angry screaming and invective curses coming from Caleb\u2019s twisted mouth and turned the knob to release cold water into the tub.</p> <p>Caleb\u2019s body jolted at the feeling of cold water soaking his clothes and touching his skin. Unable to resist and full of anger, he managed to punch Rafiq in the face and scramble halfway out of the tub. He had only ignited more of Rafiq\u2019s rage. He felt Rafiq\u2019s hand fisting in his hair, then the pain on his scalp and in his neck as he was wrenched backward. The bathtub filled around him as Rafiq pressed him to the bottom of the tub.</p><p>Fear and dread gripped him.</p><p>\u201cYou will obey me, boy! You will! Or I will drown you, here and now. You belong to me. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mouth and nose filled with water. He could not make out words clearly and he heard only the angry shouting of the man holding him prisoner in the water. The feeling of impending death held him paralyzed with fear. Anything. He would give anything to never feel this brand of fear again.</p><p>Air!</p> <p>Caleb gasped and heaved as he was pulled up, his arms scrambling for purchase and finding Rafiq\u2019s shoulders. He pulled himself toward the warmth and safety of Rafiq\u2019s body. He fought the arms trying to shrug him off. Caleb thought nothing of his panicked cries, he only wanted out of the tub. He wanted only to breathe and to be warm.</p><p>Strong arms gripped his shoulders and shook.</p><p>\u201cCalm, Caleb. Calm. Breathe,\u201d Rafiq said. His tone was soothing despite its intensity. \u201cBe calm, Caleb. I will not put you in the water again if you\u2019re prepared to listen. Still!\u201d</p><p>Caleb worked hard to do as Rafiq asked. He held firm to Rafiq\u2019s shoulders, telling himself over and again he could not be thrown into the water so long as he held on. Caleb stilled and shuddered, taking his first calm breath. He took another and another, until at last, only his anger remained. Slowly, he released Rafiq\u2019s shoulders and slumped into the tub. He shivered at the cold, his lip trembling, but he wouldn\u2019t ask Rafiq for hot water.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Caleb spat, teeth chattering.</p><p>Rafiq\u2019s eyes were calm and collected. With a smirk, he stood and left the room.</p> <p>Caleb\u2019s eyes stung with angry tears and because he was alone, he let them fall. Sure Rafiq would not return, he turned the tap for the hot water and huddled close to it, hoping it would warm him all the faster. He dragged his sopping wet clothes over his head and threw them in a heap on the bathroom floor with a sense of satisfaction over the mess he was making.</p><p>Pure, unfettered, anger rolled through his body like a physical thing. Pulling his knees to his chin he bit into the flesh of his knees, scraping them with his teeth. The tears would not abate! They continued to leak from his eyes. He felt weak and pitiful. He could not stop Rafiq from doing this to him. He bit harder, longing for the physical pain to release him from his suffering.</p><p>He wanted to scream.</p><p>He wanted to hit things.</p><p>He wanted to kill again.</p><p>He scraped his fingernails along the flesh of his arms, simultaneously feeling pain and relief as his skin broke and small drops of blood appeared on his flesh. He repeated the process \u2013 more pain \u2013 more release. In the water, Narweh\u2019s blood swirled with his. He didn\u2019t know what to feel at the sight of it. Numbness assailed him. He stared, transfixed as the blood of the man who tortured him for so long, dissipated into the water surrounding him.</p><p>Who was he now?</p><p>He was no longer K\u00e9leb, no longer Narweh\u2019s Dog. It was the only name he had ever known, the only thing he had ever been.</p> <p>He\u2019s dead. He\u2019s truly dead.</p><p>His thoughts returned to Tehran, returned to the night he murdered his owner, his tormentor, and his caretaker. K\u00e9leb had lifted the gun and Narweh\u2019s face had registered shock, then fear, only for a moment. Then, he had given, K\u00e9leb, the look \u2013 the one to remind him he was less than human in Narweh\u2019s eyes \u2013 and then K\u00e9leb squeezed the trigger. He was thrown by the force of the powerful weapon.</p><p>He missed it.</p><p>He missed the moment of Narweh\u2019s death.</p><p>Bits of gore sprayed his hair, face and chest, but he did not register them. He scrambled toward the body. No gurgling, no gasping...only a corpse. And he felt...sorrow. Narweh had never begged. He had never knelt at K\u00e9leb\u2019s feet and begged his mercy and forgiveness.</p><p>No, Narweh had never begged, but he was dead. And under the sorrow, there was blessed relief.</p><p>But you have a new owner now, don\u2019t you? Caleb.</p><p>He screwed his eyes shut for a moment and took a deep breath. Then, he did as Rafiq asked and washed his old life from his skin.</p><p>Caleb woke, startled and anxious. He reached for the dream as it raced to abandon his conscious mind. There was something...something important. It was gone.</p><p>Frustrated, it took him a moment to realize Kitten\u2019s eyes were scanning him. She looked like shit. The bruises on her face were much more pronounced than they had been the night before. Her eyes were swollen and purple against her russet skin. Her nose, free of tape, also looked inflamed. Under the damage, he could still see Kitten, surviving despite it all.</p><p>His heart again \u2013 it seemed to pinch in his chest. He kept it from registering on his face. He struggled for words. After their encounter last night and still reeling from Rafiq\u2019s text, what could he possibly say? All he had to offer was more bad news.</p><p>He settled for stating the obvious, \u201cIt\u2019s morning.\u201d</p><p>Kitten\u2019s brows furrowed and she winced from the effort. \u201cI know. I\u2019ve been up for a while,\u201d she said morosely.</p><p>Caleb glanced away, feigning interest in his surroundings. He\u2019d nearly f**ked up\u2014nearly f**ked her. That could never happen. A sense of urgency filled him. They had to leave this place, as soon as possible, but he couldn\u2019t make himself say the words. The night had been intense.</p><p>\u201cAre you...in pain? Can you sit up?\u201d Caleb whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m in too much pain to try,\u201d Kitten whispered just as softly.</p><p>They stared at each other, a second too long, gazes touching too closely before they both quickly, almost frantically, darted their eyes away, choosing to look anywhere but at one another.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I\u2019m just too terrified to think about what\u2019s going to happen today. Or tomorrow. Maybe I just want to go back to sleep and wake up from my life.\u201d There was pain in her voice and he knew it wasn\u2019t physical. Caleb glanced in her direction and noticed she wasn\u2019t crying. She was simply staring off into space, too numb for tears, Caleb supposed. He knew the feeling well.</p><p>And now this. Limbo. A state of existence he\u2019d never experienced. He felt immobilized by what had happened, about everything, because as f**ked up as it had been before, he\u2019d been in control and removed. Now, their situation was untenable. Their continued existence around each other would only cause more pain and agony. Caleb scratched his face, digging his fingers into his stubble, as if, by distraction, he would never have to look at Kitten again, never have to tell her they had to leave, and, despite last night...she was still his prisoner. He was still her master.</p><p>\u201cFuck it,\u201d she huffed, her voice strong, as though awakening from the numb void and becoming vibrant and willful again, \u201clet\u2019s get this over with, Caleb. What the hell happens, now?\u201d</p><p>Caleb. He just looked at her. There it was again, the use of his name. He knew he should correct her, force her to address him as Master, and restore the delineation, the barriers between them, but he just couldn\u2019t, f**king, do it. He was exhausted! So, damn, exhausted.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast, I suppose. Afterward, we have to leave. Beyond that, I don\u2019t care to discuss it,\u201d he said. He tried to force some semblance of levity, but it fell flat and Kitten knew it.</p><p>\u201cAnd last night?\u201d She tried to keep her tone neutral, but Caleb knew her too well now and he didn\u2019t have to guess at what she was really asking. She wanted to know if she meant something to him, if the fact they\u2019d almost...fucked, changed his mind about selling her into slavery. The answer was yes...and, no. Vladek still needed to pay, and Kitten, still had her part to play. They were past the point of no return.</p><p>\u201cI told you everything you wanted to know.\u201d He paused, tempering his tone. \u201cI\u2019m not saying any more. So, stop asking.\u201d He bolted out of bed and rushed toward the bathroom. Inside, he avoided his reflection and searched for a toothbrush. Two of them sat near the sink. He chose the least chewed and put some toothpaste on it. Germs were the least of his concerns. Although he\u2019d showered only hours ago, he turned on the hot water, only the hot water, and set about stripping from his borrowed clothes.</p><p>The water scalded him and his own body fought to remove itself from the punishing temperature of the water, but Caleb, wouldn\u2019t allow it. He forced himself to feel the stinging pain. He gritted his teeth and ignored the fact his skin would probably blister in places. Placing his hands against the shower wall he let the torrid water and multiple shower heads beat his confusion out of him. His back felt tight, already sensitive. The scars he wore tingled and came alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was the feeling he was looking for. The scars reminded him who he was, where he\u2019d come from and why he needed to move forward with his mission. The water stung against his ass and his genitals, and he felt the lump in his throat building and rising into his mouth. He would never let it out. He would swallow it down and keep it prisoner in his chest. He allowed his hands to come down and shield his c**k and balls from the punishing heat of the water.</p><p>There was a knock on the door and Caleb\u2019s head whipped toward it. Kitten had stepped inside, announcing herself with a knock, but not waiting for his answer. Shock assailed him. He couldn\u2019t keep it from his face and without thinking he scrambled to turn the cold water on. This was private!</p><p>Well, at least she didn\u2019t run. But where would she have gone anyway?</p><p>Kitten looked at him...everywhere. Even through the intense amount of steam, he could see her fierce blush. Blushing virgin or not, her eyes did not deviate from his person.</p> <p>Their eyes finally met.</p><p>\u201cI...,\u201d Kitten, cleared her throat and she began again, but nothing came. She wasn\u2019t blushing, anymore.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something,\u201d Caleb snapped. He\u2019d been trying to rebuild his composure but her interruption left him feeling exposed somehow, even vulnerable, and he didn\u2019t like it. However, she was also naked, never having dressed again since last night, and that was confusing as well. His eyes took her in, inch by inch, and all sense evaporated. Beneath his hands, his c**k stirred. He wanted to wince at the stinging sensation of his punished flesh stretching and expanding but it didn\u2019t hurt as much as it should have because pain and pleasure were suddenly almost one in the same.</p><p>Kitten straightened her spine, her posture confident. \u201cYes. I need something. Lots of somethings. Where do you want me to start?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, shocked. Had she really just said that? To him? He knew he should be angry, but instead, he turned his head to hide a smile. This banter was familiar, and oddly, it quelled whatever distracting emotions had just been storming through him moments before. He knew this part of the game\u2014it was his game, no matter how much, Kitten, participated. He spoke to the shower wall and tried to keep the amusement from his voice, \u201cWell, can it wait until I\u2019m at least out of the shower?\u201d And because he couldn\u2019t help himself, he added, \u201cUnless you\u2019re looking to climb in here and return last night\u2019s favor?\u201d He hazarded a glance in her direction.</p> <p>She blushed heatedly, but held herself high, \u201cActually? Sort of. I mean...no, but....\u201d She huffed, \u201cI would like to take a shower and since I\u2019m practically crippled, I could use your f**king help. But not if you\u2019re going to be an ass**le about it.\u201d She nodded, as if to say: There, I said it.</p><p>Caleb couldn\u2019t resist laughing, his mood much improved, and he decided to let her antics amuse him. It was much safer and less complicated. He knew his reaction was counter to the one he would have normally had, another day, another situation, another girl. But right now, he was just f**king relieved to feel something similar to joy, instead of what he\u2019d woke up to. He grabbed it and held on tight.</p><p>He opened the shower door and gave her his best and most salacious smile, \u201cWell, come on in then. I\u2019ll try my best not to be an ass**le.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile back, opting instead, to hold on to her anger. It was a sort of challenge to him and he accepted it because one day, her hate for him might keep her alive. She needed him and he was determined to do what he could for her. He owed her at least that much.</p><p>He stepped backward into the shower as she approached. Her head was down and her cheeks were tinted with pink, but also, hues of purple, green, yellow and blue as she carefully maneuvered toward him. Suddenly, flashes of her beaten, and bleeding body, and of his own past, merged like one vision, like one person reliving a horrible memory. Powerful emotion swept through him and he was glad the steam of the shower and the sound of the water pounding against the walls hid it all.</p><p>Caleb blinked, fighting the thoughts and voices streaming through his brain. When Kitten reached out toward him, using his arm and shoulder as a brace, he only saw and thought about her.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, it\u2019s like a sauna in here,\u201d said Kitten. She looked up, her expression strained. \u201cCan you make it so it isn\u2019t so hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Can you say, please?\u201d Caleb\u2019s tone still held humor, but unease was creeping its way back in. The feeling of differentness between them hung heavy and dense in the air.</p><p>Kitten finally gave him the tiniest of smiles, just a quirk of her full lips but her eyes were direct. \u201cPretty please, Caleb?\u201d And instantly, she was the girl from the night before: seductive, predatory...Livvie.</p><p>Caleb slowly sucked in a breath and turned to adjust the water. He didn\u2019t realize his error until he heard her startled gasp and felt her hand on his back. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it,\u201d he growled and turned to face her. Her eyes were wide, filled with both terror and horror, and her hand covered her mouth. Caleb clenched his fists and she turned her face away from him. It hurt. The idea she believed he would hit her with a closed fist. He strained to unfurl his fingers from his palm, but it became easier as he watched her relax with his progress.</p><p>When he finally stood in front of her, hands open at his sides, his face, one of deliberate calm \u2013 she finally brought her hand down from her mouth and smoothed the fear and horror from her eyes. She studied him warily, looking for a way to approach him without setting him off. Cautiously, she reached for his hand. Her fingers brushed against his, silently asking permission.</p><p>He pulled his arm back slowly, a few inches, issuing his denial of the intimacy between them. He watched as she stared down toward her feet, but inched forward and traced her index finger along Caleb\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Caleb,\u201d she whispered softly. Her head remained down, allowing him the privacy of his reaction.</p><p>His skin crawled. If she weren\u2019t so injured, he might have pushed her away. Instead, he let her keep coming. Two fingers touched him now; they trailed slowly from his wrist toward his hand. He allowed it. With a deep breath, he let her fingers find his and interlace. Caleb stared over her head.</p> <p>His hand was lifted. He felt his fingers brush against Livvie\u2019s ribs. And then her shoulder. And at last, her cheek.</p><p>Here.</p><p>They hurt me, here.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s body swayed a little.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she whispered. It was an offer of distraction.</p><p>He took it.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s chest rattled with the force of his sigh and his lips swept down to meet Livvie\u2019s upturned face. They moaned into each other\u2019s mouths. Fuck! Yes! He wanted nothing more than to hoist Livvie up into his arms, slam her against the shower wall and f**k her until he forgot all of his frustration, anger, lust, and remorse.</p><p>Unlacing their fingers, Caleb reached for Livvie\u2019s br**sts with both hands and squeezed. His touch was rough, needy, but she responded with equal intensity. His thumbs traced her areolas. Her flesh puckered beneath his skilled touch. The pebbled tips of her ni**les dragged across the pads of his thumbs and she keened softly into Caleb\u2019s ravenous mouth.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s trembling hands found his waist. Her fingers gripped his hips and her fingernails dug into his sensitive flesh. It was Caleb\u2019s turn to groan. His flesh was tender from the hot water, but he welcomed the pain, especially when it mingled with the pleasure. He wanted more. He wanted it all.</p><p>Caleb stepped forward. Livvie stepped back without breaking their feverish kiss. It was a dance their bodies already knew. She nipped at Caleb\u2019s tongue, his lips, stunning him for short seconds before she slid her tongue along his. With her back against the wall, Caleb took the opportunity to come closer, kiss harder. His c**k brushed her belly and he thrust against soft, slippery flesh.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Livvie cried. She broke the kiss and braced her arms around her body, bending slightly as she processed her pain.</p><p>Caleb instantly backed away. \u201cShit. I didn\u2019t think,\u201d he panted, clenching his hands, and with his arms by his side. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, but didn\u2019t sound it, \u201cI\u2019m okay, just give me a second.\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt silly, hovering over her with his massive erection between them. What the f**k was he even thinking?!? He shouldn\u2019t be doing this. He vacillated between what he should be doing and what he wanted to do. He should stop. \u201cWe need to stop.\u201d</p><p>One of Livvie\u2019s hands reached up and Caleb gave her his arm to use as a support. He wasn\u2019t expecting it when her other hand wrapped around his c**k and squeezed. Caleb groaned loudly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. Her tone brooked no argument. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stop. I don\u2019t want to think. I want to stay here and pretend nothing\u2019s waiting for us when we get out.\u201d Livvie\u2019s words seemed to touch something deep inside him, something he couldn\u2019t touch on his own. Of course, there was also the very physical touch of her palm against his cock.</p><p>He hissed through his gritted teeth. Her hand was wrapped tight around him; her fingers not long enough to touch. She squeezed again. More pleasure. More pain.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t. I\u2019ll hurt you,\u201d Caleb said.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s hand released him just barely and the sensation of blood rushing toward the head of his c**k was almost enough to make him thrust into her hand. He moaned as her fingertips skimmed his hard flesh. \u201cWell, I can see that, Caleb. Are they all...like this? I mean...are all men this big?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caleb put his hand over hers and held them still. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about other men right now, Livvie. Not when you have my dick in your hand.\u201d He wasn\u2019t jealous. He wasn\u2019t the kind to care enough for jealousy. But her question reminded him how much he knew about other men and he didn\u2019t f**king like it.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered and blushed. \u201cI guess no one would like that, would they?\u201d</p><p>Livvie smiled at Caleb, cautiously, beautifully, despite the bruises.</p><p>My tough girl.</p> <p>Livvie\u2019s brown eyes still drew his interest, more than ever before. As he let himself take his fill, her eyes seemed to do the same. Her fingers twitched beneath his hand and against his cock. He moaned and watched her pupils dilate, deepening the depths of her stare; he wondered if his did the same.</p><p>Caleb watched as her kitten tongue slid slowly across her bottom lip. Slowly, the supple flesh disappeared into her mouth and he watched as she bit down. He swallowed hard. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse, \u201cespecially when in this sort of position.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cStill, I assure you, my dick is very special.\u201d</p><p>Livvie grinned. \u201cI can\u2019t believe...you had this in me.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s hips rocked forward at her words. His c**k remembered f**king her in the ass, it recalled the tightness, and warmth waiting inside her. He remembered her whimpers and sighs, the way she undulated against his chest when she came apart under him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. We can\u2019t.\u201d Caleb was surprised to hear the rasp in his voice. He wanted this bad and he was doing a poor job of hiding it.</p> <p>Livvie stepped closer to him, until her head touched his chest. Caleb\u2019s arms went around her, as if by instinct. \u201cI want to make you come,\u201d she whispered against his chest. Shyly. Seductively. Her hand still held him and she slid her hand up and down his length.</p><p>Caleb went up on his toes and groaned, unable to resist the delicious friction of her hand, but fought the urge to thrust against the softness of her br**sts as they met with the head of his cock.</p><p>\u201cKeep doing that,\u201d he rasped. He placed one hand against the wall behind Livvie, his arm extended as a reminder not to crush her. His other arm held her loosely against him. He noted her injured shoulder was braced against him, her hand on his tender, scalded hip.</p><p>She stroked him. He opened his mouth and silently drew breath to keep from moaning, his stomach tightened sharply. Her touch felt inexperienced, disjointed, like heaven one second and an assault the next, but he was enjoying it. She was touching him because she wanted to, and for no other reason. What the f**k are you doing to me, Livvie?</p><p>The next minute, his mind went blank. Unable to resist, he rocked into her hand, his hips snapping forward to touch his c**k against Livvie\u2019s amazing f**king tits.</p><p>You\u2019re ruining my life...</p> <p>So soft. She was so f**king soft.</p><p>\u201cOh...god,\u201d escaped his mouth, but Caleb didn\u2019t give a shit. Against his chest, Livvie panted with her arousal and exertion. The fingers against Caleb\u2019s hip tightened and pulled his hips closer and then pushed them back.</p><p>More. Oh f**k! Please, more.</p><p>\u201cHarder Livvie, hold me harder,\u201d he panted. Livvie complied, sending Caleb into a state of nirvana. He felt like he was going to burn from the inside out. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, god, Caleb. You\u2019re so hard,\u201d Livvie\u2019s voice was pure lust. \u201cI want you to come. I want to watch you come.\u201d She tried to pull back, but Caleb held her closer.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t watch me, watch my cock. Watch it come all over you.\u201d</p><p>Livvie\u2019s hand tightened and sped up.</p><p>Caleb couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer. With a cry, he rose up on his toes and came all over Livvie\u2019s bountiful tits. As he panted and tried to keep from passing out, Caleb listened to Livvie squeal in shock.</p> <p>\u201cOh. My. God!\u201d She whispered and laughed. She looked down at her body, her expression, priceless. \u201cIt\u2019s all over the place. Eww. Caleb \u2013 it\u2019s...sticky.\u201d</p><p>Caleb laughed and watched as she poked at his se**n and tried to wash it off.</p><p>He snickered. \u201cIt\u2019s stickier when it\u2019s wet,\u201d he warned. He turned and reached for the soap. He stilled at the touch of her hand against his back. He sighed deeply. In the glow of his orgasm, he didn\u2019t have the energy to argue or fight.</p><p>He tensed as she came closer. He shut his eyes while she traced the harsh white lines crisscrossing his back. His skin was red from the heat of the water and he knew the scars were more pronounced because of it. This wasn\u2019t the first time anyone had seen his scars. He wasn\u2019t necessarily ashamed of them and it wasn\u2019t like he hid his body from lovers. But he never talked about it, not ever.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The whisper was so soft, Caleb, might have missed it if he didn\u2019t know it was coming.</p><p>\u201cFucked up childhood,\u201d he said tonelessly.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s breath skated across his skin. She kissed his scars.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Livvie got in the car and slammed the door. She tried to hide it, but Caleb saw the way she winced and rubbed her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cHappy? Have we taught the door a lesson?\u201d Caleb taunted through a gentle laugh.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed in his direction, her rage unmistakable. \u201cI can\u2019t believe what you did to those people Caleb. You\u2019re just...never mind. Can we just go please?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s ire, dormant because of his unexpected orgasm earlier, now rose to the surface. \u201cWhich part can\u2019t you believe?\u201d he snapped, jamming the key in the ignition of the stolen car and turning it. \u201cThe part where I rescued you from a bunch of would-be ra**sts that beat you half to death? Or perhaps the part where \u2013 at great risk to myself \u2013 I kidnapped a doctor to help save you? Which part is it, because I\u2019d like to know which of those things I should never do for you again?\u201d He threw the vehicle in gear and took off. For a moment, he didn\u2019t care Livvie had been jostled in her seat.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Caleb sat back, satisfied. It wasn\u2019t like he killed them. The doctor and his wife were free to live their lives, no worse for wear. Livvie had been mortified to find the couple exactly as he had left them the night before \u2013 taped to their dining room chairs. Granted, the fact they had urinated on themselves during the course of the evening was distasteful, but they were otherwise unharmed. In a different situation, he might not have let them off so easy. He wondered how Livvie would have reacted to such a thing.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Livvie muttered from the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Caleb was still irritated.</p><p>\u201cFor saving my life. Even if you\u2019re just going to put it in danger again,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Caleb had no response. It was exactly what he was going to do. Drive her to Tuxtepec, bring her to Rafiq, train her, sell her...lose her forever.</p><p>And kill Vladek. Don\u2019t forget that part.</p><p>The thought didn\u2019t assuage the guilt taking up residence inside him. His heart was heavy, his thoughts scrambled. Still, he couldn\u2019t allow himself to show weakness. All the turmoil within him had to be hidden, from every one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Kitten,\u201d he scoffed. From the corner of his eye, he watched Kitten swipe at her eye and flick her tears toward the floor of the car. Ruining my life!</p><p>Things had been so much easier in the shower, easier when it was just the two of them and the outside world seemed irrelevant and beyond the reach of his thoughts. The world was in the car with them now and it was Kitten who seemed beyond reach.</p><p>After she\u2019d made him feel more pleasure than he\u2019d ever had \u2013 with a hand job, no less \u2013 he\u2019d reveled in soaping her skin, watching intently as water sluiced over the taut peaks of her ni**les, down the slopes of her tan belly and hips, and descending past the raven triangle between her thighs. He\u2019d touched her there as well, sifted his fingers through her sparse hair until he felt her slippery flesh part under his fingers. It was like opening a flower, her petals pink and vibrant, shiny with dew and lust.</p><p>He\u2019d knelt before her, worshipful. She\u2019d opened for him, hungry, full of want. His every sense had been engaged and focused on her. He could smell her arousal, he could see the way her flesh darkened, and against his fingers he had felt her tremble, he had heard her soft whimpers. She had begged him to taste her. Slowly, he had licked her tiny bud.</p><p>Oh! How she had wanted him.</p><p>She\u2019d spread wider and placed her fingers in his hair and pulled him closer.</p><p>\u201cBeg me,\u201d he\u2019d whispered the words against her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caleb. Please, lick me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d obeyed. One long, wet, lick across her open petals.</p><p>She sobbed, \u201cAgain. Please. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you want me to lick your pu**y.\u201d</p><p>She gripped his hair tighter, \u201cCaleb!\u201d she\u2019d grated.</p><p>\u201cSay it. I want to hear more filth from your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. Her hips rocked toward his mouth, but he\u2019d do no more than kiss her with his lips.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caleb. L-lick my...pussy.\u201d</p><p>Nothing had ever turned him on more. He\u2019d pushed her legs wide, cradling her thighs on his shoulders and pressed his face into her pu**y. Lick her? He f**king devoured her.</p><p>Pain had no longer seemed to be an issue for her as she undulated and rocked her hips against his rapacious mouth. Her hands held his head, pushing him deeper, demanding more, even as he gave and gave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she\u2019d come, her pu**y had gripped his tongue. Wet, pulsing, flesh, fluttering against wet, pulsing, flesh. Her juices saturated his mouth, a rush of honey he not only swallowed, but sucked from her flesh long after she had begged him to stop.</p><p>But that had been then. This was now.</p><p>Caleb sighed heavily, frustrated by the turn of events. More bothersome than Kitten\u2019s demeanor was the prospect of Rafiq\u2019s impending visit. He had tried to call Rafiq earlier, while Kitten was getting dressed and combing her hair, but there had been no answer. Caleb could only assume Rafiq was either on his way or ignoring him. He hoped it was the latter. The last thing he needed after what was sure to be a very long and taxing car trip was a confrontation with Rafiq.</p><p>Their relationship was beyond complicated. Rafiq was many things to Caleb. At one time, his guardian. Later, a friend. Now? Rafiq called him brother. But Rafiq was also much more. Rafiq held a power and a sway over Caleb he\u2019d never felt comfortable with. Caleb had been a difficult teenager. After Narweh, he was left with a lot of fear that had turned to anger. There had been times when they had argued and Caleb had seen things in Rafiq he wished never to see again.</p> <p>Rafiq would stop at nothing to have his plans carried through. Everyone was expendable; anyone, collateral damage. If ever it came down to it, Rafiq would kill him, and therefore, Caleb had to be prepared to strike first. The truce lay in the fact neither of them would relish the task.</p><p>As Caleb made his way through the narrow roads, he spared a thought to think about what he would do if Rafiq were waiting for them in Tuxtepec. He gripped the wheel tighter. He knew. That was the problem. He knew exactly what would happen.</p><p>Prepare her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take us all day and part of tomorrow to reach our destination.\u201d He relaxed his grip on the wheel and leaned into the back of his seat. He had to stop being soft with her. He had to make her tough, make her hard, and he knew better than most how the coldness of reality would sober any wide-eyed hopeful. The first step had been telling her the truth about her future, but he had to push her further. He had to make her understand. There was no future for them. \u201cI suggest you take the time and wrap your mind around the seriousness of your situation. I forgive you for running away, but only because fate has done a better job of punishing you than I could.\u201d Caleb kept his eyes forward, refusing to acknowledge the heartbroken girl next to him. He didn\u2019t have to see her to know how much his words hurt her. An echo of her pain seemed to reverberate through him. At least, that\u2019s what he wanted to believe it was \u2013 an echo.</p><p>He recalled the press of her lips against his scars. She kisses my scars and I create new ones for her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still going through with it?\u201d Kitten\u2019s tone was anguished, but also angry and determined.</p><p>He told himself over and over: She\u2019s plotting her revenge already. She\u2019ll never care for you. If he reminded himself enough, perhaps he could get the truth through his head. So, he repeated the words like a mantra. She\u2019s playing you. She\u2019s just bidding time until she can be rid of you.</p><p>\u201cI never said otherwise, Kitten. I\u2019ve broken no promises to you,\u201d Caleb replied, his tone harsh and unyielding. He had to slam the door shut on everything between them. It was the only way to move forward and ensure her survival. It\u2019s your survival, too.</p><p>Caleb expected her sobs at any moment. It was their dance: she fought him, he hurt her, and she cried...he felt like shit. Repeat. He was surprised to hear the steel in her voice when she snapped at him.</p><p>\u201cYou promised me if I did as you asked, I would always come out better for it. Do you still believe that, Caleb? Do you really think selling me into sexual slavery, will make me better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d she spat.</p><p>Anger surged and flared on the heels of his guilt. He had promised her, but not in the way she proposed. \u201cI mean to teach you how to survive this. I have always intended to arm you with what you\u2019ll need. In that way, yes,\u201d he hissed. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my promise. But I\u2019ve made other promises as well \u2013 to someone who has earned my loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to earn your loyalty, Caleb?\u201d She sneered at him. \u201cWhy? What about my loyalty? What have you done to earn that?\u201d Caleb clenched his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re worse than those bikers,\u201d she spat, her body tense and coiling, ready to attack. \u201cAt least they knew they were monsters. You\u2019re pathetic! You\u2019re a monster who imagines he\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>Heat surged up Caleb\u2019s spine and radiated down toward his fingers. He held the steering wheel in a white-knuckled grip. His first instinct was to hit her, to release the wheel, and slap her across the face, but what would it prove? Only that she was right, which of course, she was. Only a monster could do the things he\u2019d done. Only a monster would have the instincts he had, and only a monster would feel indifferent to his nature, or try to rationalize it.</p><p>\u201cI know what I am,\u201d he said, calmly. \u201cI\u2019ve always known.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a quick up and down look. She slouched back in her seat, as though his gaze were venom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you, who thinks otherwise,\u201d Caleb said. He watched Kitten flinch. His words apparently hurt her feelings, but they were the truth. The truth stung them both. She had seen him as something else, something she deemed better. For a little while, he\u2019d shared her imagination. He had never realized how much it meant to him, until it was no longer true. No one had ever seen him as someone capable of being more and he had just hurt the one person who did.</p><p>It was just as well. He wanted to return to the time before he had ever known she existed, a time when his life was black and white, and the gray didn\u2019t matter. He ached for the simplicity of his life, free of moral quandaries, guilt, shame, overbearing lust, and the worst sin of all, longing. He wanted to go to bed at night and know exactly what to expect when he woke up. He wanted Kitten out of his life and out of his head.</p> <p>The space inside the vehicle was silent, but loud and clear. Caleb was glad to stare out of the windshield as stretches of road disappeared under them, taking them thousands of kilometers from that shower, their confessions, and all the possibilities of what might have been between them.</p><p>After a while, they finally ventured onto paved city roads. Civilization surrounded them. Caleb didn\u2019t miss the way Kitten sat up straighter in her seat, her head turned to view everything passing her window. She raised her uninjured arm and pressed her palm to the window.</p><p>Caleb swallowed and ignored her, eyes front.</p><p>The sun was shining brightly, burning off what was left of the morning chill. Caleb reached for the air conditioner and set it low. He would roll down the windows when there weren\u2019t quite so many people around to hear Kitten\u2019s impassioned pleas for help. He had to get rid of the vehicle as well, just in case the doctor didn\u2019t keep his word and the Federales were already looking for them. He had a few hundred U.S. dollars on him, and a few hundred pesos, courtesy of the doc. It wasn\u2019t enough to bribe a cop, but plenty for your average trouble maker. Regardless, the sooner they arrived in Tuxtepec, the better. Caleb pulled into a roundabout and took the exit leading toward Chihuahua. He\u2019d have to stop and get everything he needed near the city.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t change your mind, can I?\u201d The soft spoken words pulled Caleb back into the car. He didn\u2019t want to do this anymore. He didn\u2019t want to talk. \u201cThis is all really happening. Isn\u2019t it? And you\u2019re going to let it happen...aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry and go to sleep, Kitten.\u201d His voice was detached, wooden. \u201cWe have a long way to go.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t relent, though her manner was casual and airy, as though she were only speaking aloud, not expecting an answer, \u201cI admit...at first I thought...\u201d she shrugged. \u201cI thought you really were my \u2018knight in shining armor\u2019. Stupid, I know.\u201d</p><p>Her ironic sadness, as she repeated Caleb\u2019s words tried to make him feel guilt. Instead, he worked to ignore her. He didn\u2019t want to give her the satisfaction of badgering him into an argument.</p><p>\u201cI was so shocked when I saw you again. Shocked to discover...I thought you were a monster then. You terrified me. But now? Now, I don\u2019t know how I feel about you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Caleb gripped the wheel tighter with one hand and flipped on the stereo, flooding the vehicle with loud Banda music.</p><p>Kitten turned to face him, the once far-away look gone from her face and replaced by narrowed eyes and a mouth set into a stern line. She reached for the knob and switched the radio off. \u201cSo that\u2019s your answer?\u201d</p><p>Caleb took a deep breath and tried to control his anger, \u201cYou think you\u2019re so f**king clever, don\u2019t you?\u201d He gave a mirthless, condescending laugh. \u201cDo you honestly believe for one second I\u2019m not aware of what you\u2019re doing? You\u2019re trying to make me feel guilty, trying to make me believe you have feelings for me.\u201d She winced, her jaw clenching. \u201cYou know you\u2019re trapped and you\u2019re trying to find a way out. Trying to seduce me with your show of caring and sharing won\u2019t work on me.\u201d He scoffed when he saw the way Kitten feigned surprise and hurt. \u201cYou can drop the act. I\u2019m not impressed. You\u2019re attempts are laughably transparent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He anticipated her rage, braced for it, but he hadn\u2019t given her enough credit. Instead of invective, Kitten attacked him with cold and resolute reason.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Caleb. I am trying to seduce you. I am trying to find a way out of this f**ked up mess you\u2019ve gotten me into. What else can I do? What would you do in my place?\u201d There were no tears in her eyes, nor was there anger. There was only truth, and the truth was always more powerful. And painful, too.</p><p>Caleb knew exactly what he would do in her place, because he\u2019d done it. There were times when he had tried to get men to help him, free him, and deliver him from Narweh\u2019s treachery. He\u2019d listened to the men who bought his body swear they loved him. He\u2019d allowed himself to put stock into the endearments they whispered in his ear. But when it was over, when they\u2019d taken all they could from him, they\u2019d betrayed his trust to Narweh. He remembered the way his heart had broken when Narweh had used his own words to taunt him as he was beaten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so bad at it. I\u2019m sorry you find my attempts laughable, but I don\u2019t know how to do it any better. You\u2019re all I know. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m not trying to make you believe anything. I\u2019ve never lied to you. When I asked you to make love to me, it wasn\u2019t a ploy, and it hurts like a bitch to hear you think otherwise, because \u2013\u201d her voice finally broke, tears bursting past her fa\u00e7ade.</p> <p>Caleb felt panic. He had no idea what to do. Her words, her presence, and her pain, affected him. He hated it. His memories, the ones he worked so hard to push deep into forgotten recesses of his mind, banged on the door of his consciousness. They connected with Livvie, they connected to her suffering, and together, they threatened to undo him.</p><p>A shuddering breath and Kitten seemed in better control of herself. She wiped at her eyes, took another breath and retreated to her side of the vehicle, her eyes once again focused on the world passing her by. Every now and again her chin trembled and she would take another breath to will her tears away.</p><p>She had more dignity than even she was aware of and Caleb decided, he would never again say otherwise. He wished he had never said it in the first place. His heart was racing, banging harshly in his chest and creating a thumping in his temples that made his head ache. His stomach was also affected, a strange kind of tingling pain churning in his gut.</p><p>He had an impulse to offer Kitten comfort, to tell her the truth: her attempts were anything but laughable. However, he knew telling her would be putting himself at an incredible disadvantage. Just acknowledging how much he wanted to comfort her was disconcerting. Still, the thought of hurting her any more than he already had, was too much \u2013 too much by far.</p><p>\u201cKitten, I \u2013\u201d</p> <p>She leaned over and twisted the knob for the radio and the annoying voice of the announcer cut Caleb short. She avoided his eyes as she returned her focus to the window.</p><p>Caleb sighed in relief. He had no idea what the hell he had been about to say. The important thing for him to focus on was there would be no more talking for the moment. He wished he could say the same for the next twenty-four hours they would spend together on the road.</p><p>It had been an exhausting day. What should have been a nine hour drive had turned into twelve because Caleb had had to stop for Kitten every so often. With her bruised ribs and collarbone, she needed to stretch frequently, so he stopped along scouted roadways. When they reached the city of Zacatecas, Caleb had breathed a weary sigh and decided he could finally stop for the night and get some much needed sleep.</p><p>Kitten had spoken very little during the drive, which proved to be a great relief to Caleb. He had traded the doctor\u2019s luxury sedan for a sturdy, but dented farming truck, and some groceries. It would offer quite the profit for the farmer, so he asked as few questions as possible, going so far as to pointedly ignore Kitten and her bruises.</p><p>She slept most of the way. The drugs in her system seemed to numb her pain, though it left her drowsy. Caleb made sure to keep a bottle of water next to her and also, that she drank from it whenever she was awake.</p><p>Zacatecas was a full-blown city, filled with hundreds of thousands of people, many of them tourists. Caleb took great care in finding a motel for them to spend the night. Kitten had said she wouldn\u2019t run from him again, but the look in her eyes, whenever they passed American tourists with families, spoke differently. She would run again, given half the chance. Not that he could blame her. \u201cI need to take a shower,\u201d Caleb said into the silence of the room. \u201cYou can either sit in the bathroom with me, or I can tie you up. Option\u2019s yours.\u201d</p> <p>Kitten stared at him hard. \u201cDon\u2019t trust me?\u201d she taunted.</p><p>\u201cNot when you\u2019re looking at me like that, no.\u201d</p><p>She sat stiffly on the edge of the bed, her anger emanating off of her like a toxic fog intent on choking him. \u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t run. Go take your f**king shower and leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Caleb closed his eyes and took a deep breath to settle him. They were back to this. Well, he thought, this was just as good a time as any to reestablish the rules between them. When he opened his eyes, a warm tingle drifted down his spine and he finally felt like himself again. His gaze fell on the girl and he smiled when she flinched.</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d he said calmly, the threat in his voice muted but still present. The girl looked at him for a moment and swallowed harshly. It was obvious her anger had quickly turned to fear.</p><p>\u201cCaleb?\u201d Her voice was small, meek.</p><p>\u201cGet up. Now.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Kitten cast her eyes toward the floor and stood on trembling legs. In fact, her entire body trembled. Caleb, at last, felt no remorse, no pity for the girl in front of him. She was his to do with as he pleased. The thought was an aphrodisiac on its own.</p> <p>\u201cStrip,\u201d was his command and the girl flinched though his words had been softly spoken. A whimper escaped her lips, but she didn\u2019t hesitate to follow his command. Slowly, she reached for the waistline of the flowing skirt Caleb had selected for her to wear and pushed it down over her hips until it pooled at her feet.</p><p>She ignored the panties and slid her trembling fingers to the top button of her blouse, there were more whimpers, but Caleb ignored them. He watched, painfully aroused by the adrenaline coursing through him as she gingerly let each button slip through its hole until she reached the bottom. The fabric parted, exposing a tantalizing line of flesh between her naked br**sts. She looked up at him briefly, eyes pleading.</p><p>\u201cOff with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat!\u201d he growled with menace, \u201cis not how you address me. Do it again and I\u2019ll not forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Kitten began to weep, but still stood. \u201cYes.... Please...don\u2019t....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you a choice. If you cannot make it, then I will make choices for you. Understood?\u201d</p><p>She sniffled, \u201cYes...Master.\u201d The words seemed painful for her to say, but Caleb cared nothing for her pain at the moment. She had defied him for the last time. He watched dispassionately as she slid the shirt from her shoulders and the panties from her legs. She stood, shaking and sobbing, but finally compliant.</p><p>\u201cKneel!\u201d he barked for the sake of watching her scramble to obey. He smiled as her knees hit the threadbare carpet and her hands went to cup her br**sts to hide them from view. His heart raced and he nearly groaned at the touch of his palm against his erection, trapped inside his pants.</p><p>He stepped slowly and deliberately toward her, watching with sadistic pleasure as she closed her eyes and her lips moved; she made no sound. He pulled at the tie holding her hair back, letting her long, dark mane cascade down her naked body, but hiding nothing.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what happened the night you decided to scream out my name?\u201d he asked casually. The girl sobbed as she nodded. He lifted a piece of her hair and wound it around his hand, each turn bringing his hand closer to her scalp and tugging softly, but with ominous implication. \u201cIf I wanted you to nod, I\u2019d move your f**king head myself. Answer...please.\u201d</p><p>Kitten\u2019s chest heaved with the force of her sob, but the answer came through, \u201cYes, Master.\u201d Caleb undid the top button of his pants, jeans, pilfered from the good doctor. \u201cOh. No. Please, no, Master. Please, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak unless it\u2019s to answer a question you\u2019ve been asked!\u201d Kitten became silent, lips pressed together. \u201cBreathe through your mouth; the last thing I want is for you to pass out without my permission.\u201d She gasped, but didn\u2019t speak. \u201cHow did I punish you?\u201d</p><p>The words seemed to affect her like a physical blow and she pulled away from his hand, panicked, but with no place to go. Caleb pulled her hair hard enough to force her back into position, but not hard enough to injure. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you...I can\u2019t!\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou f**ked me!\u201d</p><p>Caleb slid his zipper down slowly, drawing the moment out for the benefit of them both. \u201cYes, I f**ked you. Right in your sexy little ass**le.\u201d She gasped at his words, her face a puffy mess from her open-mouthed sobbing. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, \u201cNo, Master. No.\u201d</p><p>Caleb tsked and brought her head toward his erection, still secure in his underwear, but undoubtedly hot against her skin nonetheless. \u201cLiar. You came more than you had a right to. I know because I felt you, hot and clutching at my cock, begging me to come inside you. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The girl shook her head, no, but she whispered, \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>Memories played through Caleb\u2019s mind as a series of erotic flashes. He remembered how good it had felt to be buried inside her and feel her push against him. It would be so easy to have her again, to have her in any way he wanted and to bring her to the heights of unbearable ecstasy until she no longer knew how pain or pleasure differed. However, he had a different point to make.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitten!\u201d she shouted without hesitation.</p> <p>\u201cTo whom do you belong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo, you,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cYes. To me. Now, tell me what I could do with you?\u201d His tone was urgent.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know! Tell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCal\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare! I am not your lover. I am not your friend! Who am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster! You\u2019re my.... I want to stop. Please make it stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer my question, what could I do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything! Fucking anything!\u201d she sobbed wetly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I could do anything to you. I could throw you face down and f**k you until you can\u2019t stand and there would be nothing you could do about it. You\u2019re beaten, bruised and damn near broken. I could kill you. Those bikers could have killed you, but you keep provoking!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! No, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you prideful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Yes, Master, I\u2019m prideful. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your pride worth the situation you are in?\u201d</p><p>Caleb let her go and watched as she placed her hands on the floor and cried with her head bowed. \u201cNo, Master.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d done what he set out to do. \u201cExactly, Kitten. Your pride isn\u2019t worth it. It\u2019s not worth the pain. It\u2019s not worth the torture me, or anyone else, could put you through. It sure as f**k isn\u2019t worth your life. Be smart! Fight the battles you can win and accept the ones you can\u2019t. That\u2019s how you survive.\u201d That\u2019s how you avoid being tied to a f**king mattress and soaked in your own blood.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry! Please...just stop. Don\u2019t be this way anymore. I can\u2019t stand it! I can\u2019t stand being with you and not knowing who you are from one moment to the next!\u201d Kitten cried.</p><p>Caleb buttoned his pants and crouched with one knee on the floor and pulled Kitten into his arms. She offered no resistance, her arms wound around his neck as though she had been desperate for them to be there all along and she sobbed into his neck.</p><p>\u201cI like you so much better when you\u2019re like this,\u201d she whispered as she pressed her lips to his neck softly, over and over as though she sought to calm him, when it was her in need of calming.</p><p>\u201cWhat you like or don\u2019t like is irrelevant, Kitten,\u201d he answered, gently. She went still, not tense, just lax. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need to start expecting.\u201d Without another word, Caleb lifted her into his arms and carried her into the bathroom. They both needed to rinse the day away.</p><p>They would start fresh in the morning.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Day 6:</p><p>I look around the room and feel let down by the lack of darkness and sterility. I had an image of what an interrogation room might look like: two-way mirror, scratched metal table, a high watt bulb lighting my face and making me sweat. Instead, the room looks more like a kindergarten classroom with art projects and motivational sayings glued onto bright construction paper on the walls. I am sitting on a plastic chair, staring at Reed across the round, faux-wood, table in front of me.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Reed says. He releases a breath, \u201cjust to get the chronology right: After you were kidnapped, you spent approximately three weeks, locked in a dark room, in a city you can\u2019t recall. You escape the man known as \u2018Caleb\u2019, and are, almost immediately, held for ransom by a man named \u2018Tiny\u2019, and his motorcycle gang. You contact your friend, Nicole Freedman, and ask her to obtain your ransom of one-hundred-thousand-dollars and meet \u2018Tiny\u2019, in Chihuahua, Mexico, to exchange your freedom for the money. You never make it to the drop because you are rescued, by \u2018Caleb\u2019. In the morning, you discover he has kidnapped two people and held them hostage in their home. He leaves them alive, but steals their car and you both drive into Zacatecas, Mexico. You are there for approximately three months.\u201d</p><p>There is a long pause, as though he expects me say some other thing that will amaze him. He\u2019ll be vastly disappointed. He ought to start expecting disappointment.</p><p>\u201cIs that all correct?\u201d Reed asks.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you want to spit every time you say his name,\u201d I say, without inflection.</p><p>\u201cMy feelings are irrelevant,\u201d Reed says.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re relevant to me.\u201d</p><p>Reed shakes his head and can\u2019t seem to stop himself from giving me his two cents, \u201cHe\u2019s a human trafficker, Miss Ruiz, a murderer, and a ra**st. He didn\u2019t rescue you. He captured you. There\u2019s a wide distinction between the two. Have you considered you might have Stockholm\u2019s Syndrome? Otherwise, I can\u2019t see how you can defend him on any reasonable level.\u201d</p><p>My vision is blurry. \u201cHe was a lot of things, that\u2019s true enough,\u201d I say. My voice is raspy and my lips tremble with the force of my sorrow. \u201cBut he was also more than what you\u2019ve written in your damn reports.\u201d I blink, and glare at Agent Reed. \u201cIt was the bikers who tried to rape me. It was the bikers who nearly beat me to death! If Caleb hadn\u2019t stopped them, I\u2019d probably be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he the one who killed them?\u201d Reed asks, insistently.</p><p>I take a deep breath and lean back in my chair, wiping the tears from my face, \u201cHow would I know?\u201d I shrug. \u201cI was unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not defending what those men did to you. Especially, if it happened the way you said it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you implying it didn\u2019t happen that way?\u201d</p><p>Reed lets out an exasperated breath, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m interested in the truth and nothing more.\u201d There\u2019s a long pause, both of us regrouping. \u201cThe auction. When is it supposed to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb said about a week from now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Pakistan, somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Reed\u2019s questions come at me quickly. I have no choice but to answer just as fast. I don\u2019t want him to mistake my pauses for answers. Worse, I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m taking time to form a lie \u2013 which I am. \u201cSo, according to Caleb and Muhammad Rafiq, Demitri Balk, also referred to as, Vladek Rostrovich, is supposed to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I grind out.</p><p>\u201cWill, Rafiq, be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the f**k would I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, Caleb, be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb\u2019s dead!\u201d I pound my hand against the table. \u201cHow many times do I have to say it?\u201d Reed sits back, unconvinced, \u201cHow did he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you already!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose blood was on your clothes when they brought you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it get there?\u201d He leans toward me.</p><p>\u201cI told you! He died in my f**king arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it was all very romantic, who killed him?\u201d</p><p>I burst out of my chair and throw it behind me, knocking it into another table and littering the floor with art supplies. \u201cStop asking me! I\u2019ve answered already.\u201d</p><p>Reed stands quickly and circles the table. Before I can run, before I can even react to the fear racing through me, he has me face down on the table with my arms behind my back. I feel the cold from his cuffs, and then hear them click as he cinches them around my wrists. It occurs to me I should never have asked to be alone with him. There\u2019s no one to watch him. There is only my word against his.</p><p>I struggle, but he holds me very easily. He\u2019s obviously done this before. Caleb would be impressed. I am less so, \u201cGet the f**k off me, you ass**le!\u201d</p><p>His voice is calm, but filled with authority, \u201cI\u2019ll let you go as soon as you calm down. I don\u2019t like being threatened, Miss Ruiz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013\u201d I start to say and am interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t throw the furniture around. I take that as a threat.\u201d I am furious! But his tone is so calm and collected. I know if I don\u2019t settle down, he\u2019ll hold me like this forever. It\u2019s almost tempting, but I force myself to let my body go soft. This is a battle I can\u2019t win.</p><p>Reed releases his hold on me in degrees, the calmer I am, the looser his hold and soon I am free of him and standing. He\u2019s much taller than me; I don\u2019t even reach his shoulder, so I have to crane my head all the way back to glower at him.</p><p>\u201cIf you spit at me, you won\u2019t like what I do next,\u201d he says very seriously, but I can see the barest trace of a smile. Caleb.</p><p>\u201cWhat about what I asked for?\u201d I whisper the words, taking advantage of our closeness. I\u2019m not nearly as bruised as I used to be and I know what men like him, men with power, like from beautiful women like me. I sway my body toward him, trying to make it seem incidental. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He frowns and gives me a strange look. Slowly, his hands come up to rest on my shoulders, they\u2019re warm. I wonder if his mouth is too. I lick my bottom lip and his eyes track my tongue. He reminds me. He reminds me so much of him. It\u2019s been days since someone has touched me in a way I might enjoy.</p><p>He pushes me back gently. This man is all business. \u201cEntry into Witness Protection isn\u2019t guaranteed,\u201d he says. He grabs the chair I threw and motions for me to sit. \u201cThis crosses international lines, not just federal. The DOJ is currently reviewing this case and it depends on other complicated factors.\u201d He sets it down where he wants and looks at me. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>I look at the chair and raise my arms from behind my back, wiggling my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to leave those on. Forgive me if I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p> <p>I force a smile just to piss him off, \u201cI won\u2019t sign anything until you come through. I\u2019ll say I lied about everything.\u201d</p><p>He steps closer, \u201cHave you been lying, Miss Ruiz?\u201d His gaze is hot and smoldering \u2013 intimidating as hell. If it weren\u2019t for the fact I\u2019ve been with Caleb for so long, I\u2019d probably piss like a puppy, but after Caleb, Reed\u2019s threats feel like a caress. \u201cSit. Down,\u201d he orders less nicely.</p><p>I sit slowly, giving him the sultriest look I can muster. He holds my eyes the entire time, trying to maintain his authority, his control. I slowly lean over and spit on his shoe. I look up at him, lips wet, and smile.</p><p>His hand wraps around my bicep with enough force to make me wince and he hauls me to my feet. \u201cWe\u2019re done for today. You can go back to your room.\u201d He shoves me toward the door and I go without a fight.</p><p>I want to go back to my room. I\u2019m too close to falling apart and I don\u2019t want Reed to see it. I don\u2019t want anyone to see me falling apart.</p> <p>Day 7:</p><p>The ache in my chest is ever-present. I dream of Caleb whenever my eyes are closed. I can touch him in my dreams. I can run my hands along his smooth, sun-kissed skin. He\u2019s always so warm; he has so much heat inside him.</p><p>I press my nose to his chest and inhale deeply. There is a familiar tug of arousal as my ni**les pebble and my pu**y swells. Standing up on my toes, I press my lips to his. He won\u2019t open his mouth to me. He wants me to beg. My Caleb loves it when I beg. With him, I always have a reason to. I hear myself whimper softly and then I brush my nose against his. Against my lips, I can feel him smile. He opens his mouth and lets me sweep my tongue inside. Mmmm. I could spend a lifetime trying to describe the decadence of Caleb\u2019s mouth. He tastes like everything I\u2019ve ever wanted to eat. Unlike biting into a tender, warm, juicy piece of meat \u2013 Caleb\u2019s flavor never fades. It builds. I want him more with every slide of his tongue against mine. I whimper louder. Beg harder. More. Please, give me more.</p><p>I can hear him. He moans against my lips. Softly, he inhales and exhales as we kiss. He never stops kissing me; he simply continues to steal my breath, returning it to me only when he\u2019s infused it with his essence. Pure lust lives inside him. Every breath I take should come from his lungs.</p><p>This is what it\u2019s like to dream of him.</p><p>This is what I lose when I wake.</p> <p>The situation is uncomfortable to say the very least. In fact, it\u2019s closer to insufferable. Agent Reed is not here. His invitation has been revoked by Dr. Sloan. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m unhappy about it. Still, it means I am alone with Dr. Sloan, and I can be unhappy about that.</p><p>She found me crying yesterday. Gripping Caleb\u2019s picture to my chest and rocking.</p><p>I rather like rocking. I\u2019m doing it now.</p><p>She asked about the photo of course, asked about what had happened between Agent Reed and me. I refused to respond to her questions \u2013 she had nothing to offer me \u2013 no photos to dangle in front of me. I haven\u2019t said a word since I was brought back to my room yesterday.</p><p>Agent Reed returned this morning, ready for another round of what he calls an interview, and I refer to as, an interrogation. Dr. Sloan got here an hour before he did. I watched, detached, as she asked Agent Reed to step outside with her. He gave me the stink-eye as he turned to leave. I guess he thinks I\u2019m a rat. I don\u2019t really care though, because it means I can keep quiet a little longer. When Dr. Sloan returned, she was obviously tense. Whatever was said left her in a huff. If I weren\u2019t so grief-stricken, I might have smiled.</p><p>She\u2019s much calmer now. She has shut the door to my room, entombing us, but she hasn\u2019t asked me any questions...yet. I rock back and forth, cradling Caleb\u2019s photo in my hands, as I sit on my bed. He is so beautiful. I love him so very much.</p><p>Dr. Sloan is sitting in a chair near the corner, knitting a sweater of all things. It\u2019s a strange design \u2013 unless she has a pet octopus she likes to put clothes on. A few times, I\u2019ve been tempted to ask her what the f**k that is about.</p><p>She catches me watching her.</p> <p>\u201cIt gives me something to do with my hands,\u201d she says through a rueful smile. \u201cA lot of times I am the last person people want to talk to. So I just sit down and knit. I understand the mechanics of it, but I haven\u2019t really learned how to make anything. I guess you could call it \u2018free-form knitting\u2019.\u201d She laughs at her own joke.</p><p>This woman is ridiculous.</p><p>For a moment there is a pause and I think we\u2019ve reached the end of our one-sided conversation, but then she sighs and keeps right on talking.</p><p>\u201cI never really had anyone to teach me how to knit. I think most people learn from their mother or grandmother, but I grew up in foster care, so I had to learn on my own. I picked it up a few years ago when a friend of mine suggested I get a hobby. A mindless hobby. I\u2019m a bit of an over-thinker. If I don\u2019t find a way to shut my brain off I just keep thinking and thinking and thinking. Mostly about work. My job can be pretty thankless sometimes.\u201d She glances up at me and smiles again.</p><p>I roll my eyes. She\u2019s obviously trying to annoy me to death.</p><p>\u201cSee, told you. Thankless.\u201d</p><p>For the love of Christ, shut \u2013 up! Let a bitch enjoy her mental breakdown in peace.</p><p>\u201cI liked it so much I picked up a few other hobbies.\u201d</p><p>Oh god. Please don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI make my own beanie babies. Well, not really my own, because we already know I can\u2019t knit or sew worth a damn, but I like to buy them, take them apart, and then put them back together in some pretty interesting ways. I like to call it \u2018interpretive taxidermy\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Kill me. Just, f**king, kill me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little redundant I guess, since most taxidermy involves putting things together in an interpretive way. Still, I\u2019m the only one who calls it that. It\u2019s my own little spin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any hobbies, Olivia?\u201d she looks up at me.</p><p>I can\u2019t help the way my eyes narrow. I wish she\u2019d stop calling me that.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it, do you? When I use your name?\u201d</p><p>I give an infinitesimal shake of my head that isn\u2019t really voluntary. The moment I catch myself do it, I scowl and stare down into my lap, at my handsome Caleb.</p><p>Caleb.</p><p>Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t think about him.</p><p>Once again, I am a fragmented person. I am divided between the soft, sentimental, girl who loves Caleb at all costs and the hard, logical, version of me determined to survive \u2013 even at the cost of pushing Caleb from my heart.</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer Livvie? Your mom says everyone calls you Livvie.\u201d</p><p>Tears sting my eyes as I look up toward Dr. Sloan. She is studiously avoiding eye contact, focusing on yet another \u2018arm\u2019 of her strange outfit.</p><p>I wonder, against my will, if my mother is here. I don\u2019t want to see her, but...why hasn\u2019t she come to see me? Everyone I love betrays me.</p><p>Oh, god. Caleb.</p><p>Yes, him too. Don\u2019t think about him.</p><p>\u201cI spoke with her a great deal yesterday; she wanted to see you.\u201d Dr. Sloan says casually. My heart is skipping every other beat. Panic is rising, but I breathe through it. Barely. \u201cBut when I stopped by to ask if it was something you might want....\u201d She frowns and shakes her head angrily. I know she\u2019s thinking about Reed. \u201cI figured I\u2019d wait for you to tell me what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>I nod shallowly and feel manipulated when I see her nod, too. She\u2019s getting in my f**king head and I haven\u2019t even said anything.</p><p>Caleb says all your emotions are on your face for all to see.</p><p>Shut up and stop thinking about him. Be smart for once. Listen to me.</p><p>I sigh. Thinking about Caleb hurts, but trying to move beyond my love for him, hurts more. There\u2019s no getting past the pain. There is only a different brand of pain available for my eager consumption.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to see your mother?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether the question is real, or a threat. I carefully abstain from signaling my emotions through my body language or facial expressions. I suppose it works because Dr. Sloan resumes her ridiculous monologue about her hobbies.</p><p>\u201cI know what you must be thinking.\u201d</p><p>You have no f**king idea.</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m a silly woman with ridiculous hobbies.\u201d</p><p>Or maybe you do.</p><p>\u201cThough, you\u2019d be surprised to learn, I\u2019m not all free-form knitting and interpretive taxidermy. I have a dark side.\u201d</p><p>Hmm...doubtful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m really frustrated with things,\u201d she giggles \u201c...I like to get online and change things in Wikipedia!\u201d</p><p>This, bitch...is weird.</p><p>\u201cI once made up a whole entry based on someone called, the Christmas Amoeba. You see, I\u2019m not much of a baker and I made these holiday cookies for the people at the office. They came out horribly deformed. They tasted fine, mind you, but they were misshapen. Not a round cookie in the bunch.\u201d</p><p>I look at her octopus sweater. I\u2019m fairly sure nothing this woman does with her hands is meant for people to see, let alone consume.</p> <p>\u201cSo I left a note next to the cookies. It was a story explaining how a small village near K2.... You know that big mountain, right?\u201d She looks at me to make sure I\u2019m following along.</p><p>I lie down on my bed and huff at the ceiling. Where the hell is the nurse with my drugs?</p><p>\u201cAnyway, they made a movie about it. Not my cookies,\u201d she cackles, so f**king amused with herself, \u201c...the mountain. Can you imagine if they made a movie about my cookies? So, I made up this story about how this village near K2 celebrates someone called the Christmas Amoeba instead of Santa Claus. He sneaks in undetected \u2013 amoebas are microscopic, so it stands to reason someone who\u2019s an amoeba would be very stealthy \u2013 on Christmas Eve and leaves presents for everyone. In return, the people of the village leave a variety of oddly shaped cookies for the amoeba to eat. Amoeba\u2019s come in a variety of shapes, so it makes sense.\u201d</p><p>She can\u2019t see my face, so I don\u2019t feel like a traitor for smiling at this preposterous woman\u2019s story.</p><p>\u201cWell, the people in my office are just sticklers for the truth. You know, everything must be verified, blah, blah, blah. So sure enough, they do a Google search and \u2013 BOOM \u2013 up pops my entry on Wikipedia about the Christmas Amoeba.\u201d</p> <p>She dissolves into peals of laughter.</p><p>Oh my god, she really is crazy. I bite the inside of my cheeks to keep from laughing. She is laughing so hard. It\u2019s infectious, but I resist it. My shoulders are trembling with withheld laughter. I shut my eyes to assist in the effort.</p><p>Caleb is there the moment I shut my eyes.</p><p>Joy turns to grief and before I can control it, my emotions just spill over. I open my eyes and bolt up in my bed. I laugh for a second before I burst into tears.</p><p>I can hear Dr. Sloan moving. Her steps are coming toward me, cautiously. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m too tired to care. After so many months of being careful, and hiding every emotion as best I can, and fearing the future, and not knowing what\u2019s going to happen next, and thinking I might die, and fighting for my life, and hating Caleb, and loving him....</p><p>For f**ksake \u2013 I watched a man die!</p> <p>When Dr. Sloan silently puts her arms around me, I crush her to my body. I hold on to her with all my remaining strength. I cry all over this ridiculous f**king woman.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say a word and I\u2019m grateful. Please, just hold me. Please, just hold me together.</p><p>I\u2019m so tired of holding myself together.</p><p>She rocks me.</p><p>I rather like rocking.</p><p>Back and forth we sway for endless minutes while I cry and sob all over Dr. Sloan\u2019s suit jacket. She smells nice. Her scent is light and almost fruity. It is distinctly feminine and therefore, far removed from Caleb. With this feminine scent saturating my nostrils, my brain cannot connect to memories of Caleb and the way he smelled when he held me. It feels nice, being free of the pain of missing him.</p><p>Reluctantly, I pull away from her. I am still humming with shame. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s come over me. I wrinkle my brow in confusion and shake my head.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s scowling face is staring up at me from the photograph in my lap. I feel a pang of longing. Dr. Sloan pushes my hair from my face and I can\u2019t help but think of it in a sexual way. In another time, I\u2019d have thought nothing of it, but now all my interactions seem tainted by my newfound lust. Caleb trained me well.</p> <p>\u201cI want to help you, Livvie. Talk to me,\u201d she says, softly. I know she doesn\u2019t want to startle me, but already, I feel the tension creeping back into my shoulders. She\u2019s standing too close and the fact she\u2019s talking to me makes me feel cornered.</p><p>She must be able to tell, because she backs up. I relax, just a little.</p><p>\u201cI would like to see the charges against you dropped, but you have to talk to someone. Agent Reed is...\u201d she searches for the word she wants to use, \u201cvery good at his job, and despite his behavior yesterday, he\u2019s a great guy. However, his first priority is solving his case. My first priority is you. He shouldn\u2019t have pushed you the way he did.\u201d</p><p>I look up at her from beneath my lashes. I wish she would hold me again</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a lawyer,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cOf course. If you\u2019re ready to talk, I\u2019ll find a lawyer for you. But, Livvie, the things you need to talk about go far beyond the legal charges. I\u2019m here to help you with that.\u201d</p><p>I nod, but say nothing else.</p><p>Dr. Sloan returns to her chair and sits. She looks at me expectantly with her green eyes. She\u2019s pretty, in a very down-played sort of way. With her red hair, the brown suit she is wearing does her no favors. Still, there is something about her, something warm and pleasant.</p><p>When it becomes obvious I won\u2019t be the one to keep our little conversation going, she reaches for her knitting and resumes the mindless design.</p><p>Dr. Sloan presses her lips together, searching for words.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to see your mother?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She stops knitting. \u201cLivvie, the people who love you, accept you for who you truly are. No matter what has happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell there you go. My mother doesn\u2019t love me, Dr. Sloan. She wants to love me, I think, but...I just don\u2019t think she does.\u201d</p><p>She nods, but I can tell she doesn\u2019t believe me. What would she know?</p><p>\u201cI think your mother loves you a great deal.\u201d</p><p>I stare down at my picture of Caleb. I thought he loved me. Could it be the one person I discounted, loves me more than the one I trusted completely? My heart aches. It\u2019s a question I am not prepared to have answered.</p><p>Slowly, I crawl under my covers. I want to go back to sleep. I want to be with Caleb again. In my dreams, there is never a reason to doubt my heart. In my dreams, he is everything I want him to be. He is mine.</p><p>As if on cue, Dr. Sloan stops asking me emotionally charged questions and once again regales me with tales of free-form knitting and interpretative taxidermy.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Day 8:</p><p>I\u2019m feeling somewhat better today. I still miss Caleb, I don\u2019t think the feeling will ever go away, but I can get through several minutes without wanting to break down and weep for him; it\u2019s progress. Dr. Sloan says one day I\u2019ll make it to an hour...a day \u2013 but that\u2019s as far as I let myself hope. The thought of one day not thinking of him at all is just too much for me. It feels like a betrayal to ever hope for such things.</p><p>Once again, I am sitting in the dreadfully cheery room they use to interrogate Kindergarteners. This time, I don\u2019t have to do very much talking. I have a lawyer to do it for me. He and Agent Reed have been battling it out for the last hour. David, my lawyer, isn\u2019t much to look at, but he\u2019s very smart and incredibly aggressive. There\u2019s something super hot about watching the two of them argue...or maybe I just like Reed when he\u2019s unsettled.</p><p>His hair is somewhat disheveled from where he\u2019s run his fingers through it so many times to keep from punching David in his face. Every now and again, his eyes flick to me and I feel a dark thrill just thinking about what he\u2019d like to do to me if only he could. If he were Caleb, I would assume a spanking is most certainly in order!</p><p>\u201cWhen exactly did you imagine yourself as...? My lover?\u201d My heartbeat vibrated my skull. \u201cWas it the first time I made you come with my mouth? Or one of the many times since, that I\u2019ve put you over my knee? You seem to like that.\u201d</p><p>And there he is \u2013 Caleb, in my thoughts, in my blood. I can feel my face getting warmer, my stomach getting tighter and already there is the drumbeat of my arousal pulsing between my legs. I squeeze them together and get so lost in my thoughts it takes me a second to realize Reed is still staring at me. When our eyes finally meet, I blush \u2013 hard. I smile when he blushes too.</p><p>Agent Reed clears his throat and takes a drink of water. It\u2019s enough to bring back his control. I sigh through my disappointment.</p><p>\u201cAgent Reed,\u201d David says, reclaiming Reed\u2019s attention, \u201cmy client is being held on ridiculous charges that would never stand up in court. She was living with her mother and attending high school at the time of her kidnapping. Even though she\u2019s eighteen, the U.S. Attorney would be hard pressed to try her as an adult. If she\u2019s considered a minor and involved in a human trafficking case, under Section 107 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, she\u2019s protected from the FBI\u2019s tactics of investigation. There\u2019s no point in us even sitting here. I should be talking to the U.S. Attorney, not you.\u201d</p><p>Reed does not look happy, but he doesn\u2019t look beat either. \u201cYour client has two-hundred-fifty-thousand dollars in a foreign bank account. How did it get there? She won\u2019t say. Also, she\u2019s been living with suspected terrorists. She\u2019s admitted to it. Then, there\u2019s the small matter of her knowledge of a meeting between enemies of the United States taking place in less than a week! We need information and her refusal to give it qualifies as an obstruction of justice \u2013\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat terrorists!?!\u201d I yell at Reed and move to stand, but David calmly pushes me back into my seat.</p><p>\u201cMuhammad Rafiq, Jair Baloch, Felipe Villanueva, and of course Caleb,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you or do you not, also have information about Demitri Balk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I knew him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you knew where he\u2019d be,\u201d Reed says with a raised eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Ruiz, please stop talking and let me handle this,\u201d David says in an irritated tone.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d begins Reed anew, ignoring my lawyer and focused on me, \u201cBalk is suspected of having ties to arms dealing and narcotics trafficking. And until I know how you,\u201d he jabs his finger in my direction, \u201care involved, you\u2019re a suspect too. You can deal with me or I can let the DEA and Homeland Security in here and when they use Patriot Act against you, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is enough,\u201d David said firmly, glaring at us both.</p><p>\u201cCaleb is not a terrorist. I don\u2019t know about the rest of them, but he\u2019s not a terrorist! And neither am I! And\u2013\u201d A cold wave crashes over me. Felipe. I never said anything about Felipe. Reed knows things he\u2019s not saying.</p><p>Caleb! Fuck!</p> <p>I can\u2019t breathe; all of the oxygen is suddenly being sucked from the room, from my f**king lungs! I keep taking deep, deep breaths, lots of them, but I can\u2019t get any air.</p><p>My heart is racing.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe!</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d says Reed and I can hear him shuffling around.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done here, Agent Reed. I\u2019ll be speaking to your superiors.\u201d David reaches for me and tries to get me to stand. I don\u2019t like his hands on me. I can\u2019t breathe! He\u2019s suffocating me. I need to think. I need to breathe.</p><p>\u201cShut up! Everybody just shut up!\u201d Reed and David go silent and I ignore them as I put my hands on the table in front of me and try to catch my breath.</p> <p>You f**ked up, girl. Don\u2019t make it worse.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut and will myself to breathe slower, deeper, calmer. My heart starts to slow in degrees until finally I feel only a fraction of my panic. Without looking up, I think about what I need to do.</p><p>How does Reed know about Felipe? Does he know more about Caleb? Is he really going to charge me with murder? It was self defense!</p><p>I have a feeling Reed would be a lot more amenable if my lawyer weren\u2019t here. Still a prick, but less likely to push this hard. Dr. Sloan said he was a good guy and would do right by me. I don\u2019t have much faith in anything anyone says to me lately, but a glimmer of hope is better than none. I take a sip of water when Reed slides the paper cup beneath my face. I hope he feels guilty, the son of a bitch.</p><p>David puts his hand on my shoulder and I shrug it off, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should take you back to your room now, Miss Ruiz,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI want you to leave,\u201d I whisper with my eyes still fixed on the table.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d David says, indignantly. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good idea, Miss Ruiz. I strongly advise you to keep silent and let me do my job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe wants you leave.\u201d Reed says. He knows he\u2019s won this round. He boxed me in a corner and I let him. I realize I should have assumed he knew a lot, not just about me, but other things too. I feel stupid, and angry and scared. But right now, I need time to think and Reed is the devil I know.</p><p>They argue for a bit, puffing their chests at each other in some National Geographic display of machismo. In the end David gathers his things and leaves. Reed and I are alone again. I have a feeling it\u2019s what he wanted all along.</p><p>He sits quietly, relaxed and patient, unwilling to break the silence. He doesn\u2019t want to lose ground. He wants me to come to him, and I know it\u2019s exactly the way it\u2019s going to play out. I need him on my side. Just the way I once needed Caleb.</p><p>My voice is soft on purpose. I need him to see me as fragile again. I need to bring out the alpha male in him. I need him to believe I\u2019m his to protect, even if I already belong to someone else. Caleb would have been proud. I remind myself that I am now my own master. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really let them take me to jail would you? After everything?\u201d I let the threat of tears simmer beneath the surface of my words.</p><p>Reed exhales deeply through his nose and I hear his fingertip tapping softly against the table. \u201cI would never put an innocent person in jail, Miss Ruiz, but I still need you to convince me you\u2019re not guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I was innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles a little, but it doesn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. He really is stunning. \u201cI think most people subscribe to the better-safe-than-sorry philosophy these days.\u201d He leans forward, conciliatorily, \u201cThe truth is, I think you\u2019re just a girl who got caught up in a whole lot of awful shit. I think you did what you had to do to get back home and I think that makes you incredibly smart, and incredibly brave. You don\u2019t have to be brave anymore, Miss Ruiz. You don\u2019t have to protect anyone. You\u2019d save yourself, and me, a whole lot of grief if you\u2019d just tell me the truth so I can make sure what happened to you doesn\u2019t happen to someone else.\u201d</p><p>It would be so easy to believe him. I\u2019m more tempted than I\u2019ve ever been to just spill my guts to Reed and let him figure out what to do. It\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s so good at his job. \u201cI wish I could trust you, Reed, but I know I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrows in confusion, but there is a wry tilt to his lips, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I give him a small smile of my own, \u201cYou think you\u2019re different from men like Caleb. You see everything in black and white, you don\u2019t care about the whole story; you don\u2019t care about the gray. Some stories aren\u2019t black and white, Agent Reed.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head a little, obviously amused, but still professional, \u201cIn my experience...the only time a woman wants to tell you \u2018the whole story\u2019, is when she wants you to make a decision based on emotion instead of logic.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrow and I stare at the surface of table, the scars not visible at first glance but clearer as I stare, unblinking, \u201cMaybe,\u201d I begin, my voice hollow and far away, \u201cbut if it weren\u2019t for emotions overriding logic, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>Reed\u2019s smile is gone, his gaze intent, \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb. It wasn\u2019t logic...what he did for me.\u201d The words are a revelation. I hadn\u2019t been expecting to say them, but I know they\u2019re true. Caleb might not love me, but he cared. He kept his promise to keep me safe, even if it meant we couldn\u2019t be together.</p><p>It makes the pain so much worse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time \u2013 manipulating people to get my way. That\u2019s why you think you love me. Because I\u2019ve broken you down and built you back up to believe it. It wasn\u2019t an accident. Once you leave this behind...you\u2019ll see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Please Caleb. Don\u2019t make me do this, don\u2019t make me go back to trying to be someone I don\u2019t know how to be anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go, Kitten...\u201d</p><p>Reed\u2019s voice jolts me back into reality, \u201cWhat did he do for you?\u201d</p><p>I wipe my eye, sweeping away the tears pooled there, \u201cEverything,\u201d I say through a pained smile, \u201cbut it had nothing to do with logic and everything to do with emotion \u2013 revenge, honor, betrayal, lust, even love...all of these things stem from our emotions.\u201d I paused. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re not doing what you do without some kind of emotion, Agent Reed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made your point,\u201d Reed says softly and leans toward me, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been around and seen some shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should that matter to me? Is that supposed to make me trust you?\u201d</p><p>Reed shrugs. \u201cWhat other choice do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about Felipe?\u201d</p><p>He smiles, \u201cI thought that might get your attention. I\u2019m good at my job, Miss Ruiz, and I\u2019ve been digging through anything I can find on Muhammad Rafiq. What I\u2019ve found so far is pretty damn disturbing. Looking through his known associates, and cross-referenced with those in Mexico, it didn\u2019t take me too long to find Felipe. As far as I can tell, the man is quite...eccentric.\u201d</p><p>Eccentric wasn\u2019t quite the word I would have used. \u201cWait...if you know where he is, why haven\u2019t you\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cMexico, isn\u2019t the US, Miss Ruiz, we can\u2019t go rounding up every criminal in another country based on suspicions we can\u2019t substantiate. Also, he\u2019s left the country and gone who knows where. Maybe Pakistan?\u201d</p><p>I look up and shake my head. \u201cHard to say.\u201d I wonder if they\u2019re all dead: Felipe, Celia, Kid, and Nancy. I\u2019d like to believe Caleb wouldn\u2019t hurt Celia, but then I remember the blood and I wonder if.... No, I can\u2019t handle it.</p><p>\u201cMiss Ruiz, where\u2019s the auction?\u201d Reed\u2019s words are sharp and serious. This is his end game. I really would have to make a choice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know, Reed. I don\u2019t. Not specifically, but I could probably give you an idea. Maybe if you listened to the whole story you could figure it out for yourself.

If you get us there, get us to the auction, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p> <p>My heart is in my throat. I want to leap over the desk and hug the hell out of him. He\u2019s given me hope. Hope for all the things I want most in the world. With great care, I lick my lips and prepare to tell Reed what he wants to know.</p><p>Where to begin?</p><p>So much was different between Caleb and me.</p><p>So much remained the same.</p><p>He was still the man who had hired ruthless men to kidnap me. Still the cruel person who had locked me in the dark for weeks, forcing me to become dependent on him, crave him, rely upon him until even my own instincts stood no chance. He was the man who had saved my life, and the one who had put it in danger. Finally, he was still the man who planned to sell me as a sex slave. A whore.</p><p>He\u2019d had his own reasons for wanting me back and they\u2019d had nothing to do with my well-being and everything to do with revenge. Did I know why he wanted revenge? No. Trust did not run both ways between us. There were certain things I had no choice but to trust him with: keeping me alive, fed, safe, and unless it was him \u2013 untouched. It didn\u2019t leave much, but I refused to trust him with the most important thing of all, my future.</p> <p>I guess things between us were the same and the differences didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>What mattered is I was different. The na\u00efve girl in me had been bitch-slapped into womanhood. I\u2019d been razed by pain, grief, loss and suffering, and honed by lust, rage and an acute awareness of my need to survive.</p><p>I understood things I couldn\u2019t fathom before. I understood Caleb\u2019s need for revenge: because the seed had been planted in me. I recognized how he often turned my body against me: because the desire for him had always been there. Above all else, I had learned the one thing every person has to learn to make it through life: the only person you can truly count on is yourself.</p><p>I was still reeling from Caleb\u2019s display of dominance over me when he finally laid me down to sleep. I should have been angry with him, and in a very real way, I was, but the way he had unleashed on me made me realize how thoughtful and gentle he had been before. Dealing with Caleb was all about perspective. You couldn\u2019t appreciate his kindness until you\u2019d felt his cruelty. I had felt it, but even I, was smart enough to know he\u2019d still taken it easy on me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to explain himself to me \u2013 he\u2019d made it plain. However, I knew he wanted me to understand the danger I was in. He wanted me to think before I acted. He wanted me to pick and choose my battles, even if those battles were with him. He wanted me to survive. He\u2019d told me as much in the car, but then he\u2019d shown me. For Caleb, that was kind. He dosed me again and I drifted, thoughts swirling in my mind and none of them comforting. Then Caleb was there, and his long, warm body was like a prayer I held onto as I tried to stay awake and did not succeed.</p><p>I woke up crying. I could hear the shower running and it was sickening how the relief washed through me, knowing he was close. I forced myself to lie back down, to find a position less aggravating to my injured shoulder or cracked ribs.</p><p>I didn\u2019t feel comfortable without his arm around me. I couldn\u2019t sleep without knowing he was near. He\u2019d done this to me. He\u2019d made me afraid. He\u2019d made me need him. And if he thought he was suddenly going to abandon me and clear what was left of his shriveled conscience, he was sadly mistaken.</p><p>A strange noise drew my attention away from my thoughts. Regardless of my renewed fear, it was a welcome distraction. I wondered for a moment if Caleb had hurt himself, slipped in the shower or something, but there was no loud crash, only a muffled sound. I listened intently, waiting for the noise to repeat itself and was annoyed by the apparent loudness of my breathing.</p> <p>\u201cUh!\u201d That was the noise. Like a grunt mixed with a whimper. \u201cUh!\u201d Something inside my belly tightened, muscle memory. I should have ignored it, but I couldn\u2019t. In spite of everything that had happened to me, and everything Caleb had put me through by deed or design, I still thought him the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cMin fadlik!\u201d he sighed loudly, but I didn\u2019t know what it meant. Whatever it was though, it sounded...needy. What did Caleb need? And why did I find the idea of his need so intriguing?</p><p>I needed him to touch me, not want, because I didn\u2019t want him to, I needed him to. Only his arms wrapped around me could make the nightmare dissipate, only the smell of him made me forget the fetid breath of the men who had attacked me. Only his. I was always grateful for his presence and resentful of it.</p><p>More sounds came from the bathroom and I couldn\u2019t resist. I couldn\u2019t stop the rush of adrenaline coursing through my veins urging me into some kind of action, anything that would reveal to me what was happening behind the closed door. What if he\u2019s f**king someone in there? The thought stopped me cold, a wave of something akin to nausea clogging my throat and tightening my stomach. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t,\u201d I whispered to myself in the darkness of the room. For whatever reason I just couldn\u2019t make it a possibility in my mind. He\u2019s done it before. Remember? Remember him f**king that woman while you were tied up in the other room. The voice in my head was cruel. I had to know! I had to know if he would do something like that to me again. Bastard!</p><p>I forced my steps toward the bathroom door, my body trembled and my palms were wet with sweat, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself from knowing.</p><p>\u201cFuck...\u201d The obscenity was little more than a whisper beyond the door as I pressed my ear against it. \u201cOh...yes baby\u201d then something in another language, then \u201copen your pu**y.\u201d I nearly fell against the door as my knees went weak. Between my legs I felt a gentle throbbing keeping pace with my heart. Please, please don\u2019t be f**king someone else.</p><p>I could hear the fan was on, which might have been why he felt safe making sounds. If I hadn\u2019t been awake, I wouldn\u2019t have heard him. Forcing bravery I didn\u2019t really feel, I pressed on the latch to open the door. I gripped the latch in my fist until sweat seemed to squeeze between my fingers. The shower was to the left of the door, and I worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to see without opening it fully and making my presence known, but there was a mirror to the right where I might be able to see his reflection. I could only pray he wasn\u2019t directly facing the door or mirror.</p><p>The door opened, just a crack, barely enough to get a finger through, but my heart felt crammed into my throat for those breathless seconds. I waited, hoping not to hear him yell at me or make a startled sound. I heard his heavy breathing and those same groaning sounds from before, accompanied by a wet staccato rhythm. I knelt on the floor, not trusting my legs to support me as I pressed my cheek flush with the door and peeked inside. The room was steamy and it aggravated me to no end. I waited while some of it cleared, but all I could see was a shape in the mirror.</p><p>I dared to open the door a little wider, my adrenaline pumping through me in proportionate degrees to the opening in front of me. More steam drifted out of the room and settled on my face and neck, dripping like sweat into the well of my br**sts before being absorbed by my shirt. The mirror was much clearer and finally, I could make out the image in the shower.</p><p>I gasped, but Caleb didn\u2019t hear me. I was sure he couldn\u2019t. He was much too absorbed in what he was doing alone in the shower, only a few feet away from my prying eyes. I should have felt embarrassed or guilty but there was no way I could feel those things. All I could feel was the throbbing between my legs and the sharp pang of lust that punched me in the belly. He was f**king...perfect. Sooo f**king perfect.</p><p>He was facing the shower so I could only see him in profile. His skin was pink and white from the intensity of the water. One arm was braced against the wall, his long legs spread for balance as his head dipped toward his chest and he panted. His other arm was rigid; the muscles tense while his large hand held his enormous erection in his hand. I swallowed hard and licked steam from my lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The head was thick and a deep dusky pink as it slipped through his fist. His shaft got thicker toward the base, until his fingers had to grip hard to keep him contained. I remembered his weight in hand.</p><p>He didn\u2019t shuttle his hand up and down the length of it. He rocked his hips into his fist, making the well-muscled globes of his ass hollow on each side as he thrust forward, his large, heavy-looking balls swaying between his splayed legs in a fluent rhythm. His c**k was the arrow and his fist, the quiver.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away, didn\u2019t even try. I wondered how much come he held inside those large balls and if he\u2019d given me all of it when he\u2019d come in my hand and on my br**sts. I thought about the only time he\u2019d been inside me and I could remember the sound of them slapping against the wet flesh of my pu**y as he held me bent over and drove his meaty c**k into me. The throbbing between my legs was intense. My own thoughts had me panting and wet. My thoughts were dirty and sexy and they flooded my body with every sensation imaginable.</p><p>\u201cMake him love you,\u201d Ruthless Me, whispered. \u201cMake it so he can\u2019t live without you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I whispered back. \u201cI tried. He said my attempts are laughable. He doesn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...mmm...come on.\u201d Caleb\u2019s eyes were shut tight; his beautiful mouth open and the sexiest sounds I\u2019d heard in my life were coming out of him. I wondered what he was thinking about. I wondered if it could be me. Could I be the one driving him toward this frenzied display of lust?</p><p>\u201cYessssss,\u201d Ruthless Me shuddered.</p><p>My ni**les were tight and painful, scraping against the suddenly rough fabric of my shirt. I wanted to take them out. I wanted to touch them against something cool. I pressed my body against the door, rubbing them against the hard wood as I continued to watch Caleb in all of his masculine and somehow vulnerable glory.</p> <p>I leaned back and pressed the palm of my hand against my mound rubbing in tiny circles I feared wouldn\u2019t get me where I wanted to go nearly quick enough. I didn\u2019t want to get lost in my pleasure. I wanted to watch Caleb. I wanted to see him come. The thought made me press against my clit even harder, the circles smaller, tighter and faster. I felt a flutter in my belly, then a warm tingle spread from my spine out to all my limbs until finally I felt my pu**y clench tight, then release and clench again. I let out a small cry before I sucked in my lips and bit down on them to keep in any other sounds. It hardly sated me. It was a sneeze compared to how Caleb made me come, but it was enough to force my focus toward Caleb.</p><p>His hips were thrusting faster, the cheeks of his ass flexing up and down as he put real effort into reaching his climax. He leaned his body forward resting his forehead against his forearm as he gritted his teeth and pumped that monstrous thing he called a c**k back and forth through his wet fist. Rivulets of water fell from all over his gorgeous body and I was suddenly so thirsty. I wanted to kneel at his feet and lick water off of him, especially his impressive cock. I wanted to lick water off of it and suck it.</p><p>I was thinking of all the things I wanted to do when he let out a grunt, followed by a painful whine as ropes of thick se**n burst out of his dick and covered his large hand before dripping down toward those heavy balls and eventually the shower floor. It was a lot of come and yet his balls didn\u2019t seem any smaller.</p><p>Caleb was panting hard, his shoulders rising and falling with the effort. His beautiful face was red with exertion, but if possible, it made him look even more handsome. I wanted to continue to admire him, but doing so felt like a betrayal \u2013 of me. The facts were still the facts. He didn\u2019t really care about me. He was using me.</p><p>My passion was quickly cooling and finally, I slowly shut the door and crept back into bed to nurse more than my physical injuries.</p><p>Sometime later I heard the bathroom door open and the soft scrape of Caleb\u2019s feet against the carpet as he made his way toward the bed. I felt the bed dip as he got between the covers, making sure no part of him touched any part of me.</p> <p>\u201cI woke up and you weren\u2019t here,\u201d I whispered, with my back toward him. I knew he tensed, but I can\u2019t say how, perhaps it was the air between us that was tense.</p><p>\u201cHave you been up long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just a few minutes.\u201d I felt him relax into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cAnother nightmare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I lied, but felt completely justified as his warm chest, covered in soft cotton, met with my back and his fingers, the ones covered in his se**n only minutes before, traced along my arm to soothe me. A vision of his powerful, sleek body straining toward orgasm made its way into my mind\u2019s eye. His fingers were long, influential and still damp as they charted their course along my flesh, leaving me tingling in their wake. I touched his skin. \u201cYou\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Kitten. I needed another shower.\u201d His voice was low, dopey with fatigue, but sincere nonetheless. One mention of the word shower and my throat was dry thinking of all the water sluicing off his perfect body and from that beautiful organ. I wondered what he would taste like.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I whispered. My throat was hoarse.</p><p>\u201cAnything I can do to make you feel better?\u201d All sorts of answers flitted around in my lust filled head. It was tempting to fall back on reliable tactics and pretend things were...perfect. To pretend he was only a boy and I was only a girl and we desired each other. I wanted him to hold and kiss me and pretend he would do anything to protect me. I wanted to pretend he felt a fraction of the things I couldn\u2019t seem to stop myself from feeling for him.</p> <p>My heart hurt. As much as my shoulder and ribs screamed with pain, they were eclipsed by the sorrow in my heart. I couldn\u2019t pretend anymore. The time for it had passed; there was only the reality of things left to deal with.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d I tried not to sob, \u201cThere\u2019s so much you can do to make me feel better.\u201d His body pressed deeper into mine and for a moment I just let him be close. \u201cYou could not sell me... I could stay with you... be with you?\u201d Caleb gripped me tight, not because he wanted to hurt me, but because I\u2019d shocked the hell out of him. I\u2019d shocked myself, too, but I\u2019d been through too much not to just tell shit the way it was. He swallowed audibly, fingers tentative, as they loosened their hold.</p><p>\u201cKitten...\u201d his forehead pressed hard against the nape of my neck, \u201cyou ask for impossible things.\u201d I wanted to ask which parts were impossible, but I knew the answer. He couldn\u2019t let go of his revenge, but he could let go of me.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Matthew tried very hard to concentrate on the computer screen in front of him, but as he typed, his mind couldn\u2019t help but wander off. Olivia Ruiz was most certainly suffering from Stockholm\u2019s Syndrome, pining over her lost lover, her kidnapper and abuser. Matthew didn\u2019t care for abusers \u2013 not one little bit. They were all the same. His mother used to try and apologize for beating him by taking him to the park. The best abusers could make you believe they felt guilty for what they\u2019d done, right up until you got in their way.</p><p>Still, he would be lying if he didn\u2019t admit, at least to himself, Olivia\u2019s storytelling abilities were quite...compelling. For four hours he\u2019d listened to her talk about her relationship with Caleb and he\u2019d watched as her cheeks had colored and her skin flushed with what he knew was arousal. How could he not be affected?</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d grown hard, painfully so, but he didn\u2019t like it. What kind of person got a hard-on while listening to a victim talk about her abuse? It made him feel sick. He was sick.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t necessarily a new problem. He had a long history of strange sexual proclivities. It was the reason he was thirty-one and still single with no viable prospects on the horizon. He was afraid of someone seeing him for what he was. Being alone didn\u2019t mean he was lonely, not really. He kept very busy with work at the Bureau. However, he often thought it would be nice to have someone to come home to, someone he could talk to that wouldn\u2019t make him feel like a freak \u2013 even though he knew he was. And like, attracted like.</p><p>He was attracted to damaged and fractured women as much as they seemed to be attracted to him. Olivia Ruiz seemed to be no different. She was drawn to him for some reason, he could intuit that much, but he knew it was an attraction that could only run the one way. He would never compromise an investigation, never take advantage of a witness, and never try to save someone who was so obviously broken. He\u2019d learned his lesson all too well.</p><p>He would do his job. That\u2019s why the Bureau kept him on board; because at the end of the day he could be counted on to do what needed to be done. He was a closer. Nothing got in the way of that. No one got in his way.</p><p>Bringing his attention back toward his screen, he continued to type up Olivia\u2019s statement about her time in captivity. He tried to remain impassive as he typed, but certain sentences continued to jump out at him:</p><p>\u201cHe made me beg for food...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpanked me repeatedly...\u201d</p><p>\u201c...forced me to come.\u201d</p><p>His report was reading more like an erotic novel than a case file. His mind was beginning to wander again, this time toward his last girlfriend, the one who couldn\u2019t come unless he called her a whore. He was starting to get hard again\u2014Stop! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He saved the file and decided to take a much needed break from Olivia and her relatively useless memoir and opened his browser to search for more information on Muhammad Rafiq. He was the lynchpin of the entire investigation.</p><p>According to the witness, Caleb had reported his involvement with Rafiq began because they needed to kill Vladek Rostrovich, A.K.A. Demitri Balk.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Matthew whispered to himself and then remembered the comment about Rafiq\u2019s mother and sister. Were they dead?</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter, he thought. The important thing was the auction, everything else was inconsequential. So why couldn\u2019t he get it out of his head? Why did the story seem relevant? It was motive, sure, but how did it lead to the location of the auction in Pakistan?</p> <p>Matthew let out a deep sigh and got up to pour himself another cup of coffee. He\u2019d heard the local cops gripe about the coffee on an almost daily basis, but unlike them, he actually enjoyed the coffee in the office. It was likely true the coffee machine had never been cleaned, but maybe the grit added something. He smirked. Back at his desk he grabbed his notepad and started digging through his notes to find a starting point for his research.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s jerk-off story didn\u2019t provide much of a jumping off point, but he did manage to learn min-fadlik meant \u2018please\u2019 in Arabic. Caleb apparently spoke Arabic with so much ease he used it in private. He would guess people typically spoke their native tongue while alone and certainly while engaged in that particular activity. Lord knew he\u2019d never yelled out in Mandarin while in the throes of ecstasy. Of course, he didn\u2019t speak Mandarin.</p><p>He flipped through more of his notes and found Caleb also spoke Spanish and his English was spoken with a strange accent, one characterized as \u201c...a mix of British, Arabic, and Persian...maybe on the Persian.\u201d Matthew pulled out a map of Pakistan and tried to narrow down an area with such a mix. It seemed highly unlikely he would find it. Still, an accent meant Caleb was either born or immersed long-term in an area where he\u2019d have heard those languages on a daily basis. Afghanistan, India, and Iran all surrounded Pakistan and each of those would certainly have similarities in demographics and social conventions. The Brits obviously had influence in each mentioned country, but he knew their influence would be more pervasive in India. Caleb was obviously not Indian, and if he had grown up there, he would have picked up the dialect.</p><p>He needed to narrow the list of possible locations for the auction and he had little more than experience, old case files, and the internet to work with. Pakistan was making strides toward reducing or eliminating the number of human trafficking crimes committed within their borders, but they were very much a long way from succeeding in any way as to impact their society or their politics. Slavery was very popular there, though most of it came from an indentured work force made up of women and children.</p><p>People were bought, sold, and rented in an almost casual way in Pakistan and it was about time the U.S. Government started to take notice and work with the U.N. to do something about it. Matthew was not na\u00efve; he knew the reason the U.S. had decided to take point on the change throughout many Middle Eastern regions had more to do with the resources abroad. Still, if it meant less women and children were sold into sexual slavery or bonded labor, then he was all for it. Oil and freedom for everyone.</p> <p>The Sindh and Punjab provinces were large hotbeds for human trafficking activity, but he temporarily opted to exclude them, as the area was mostly agricultural and the slavery predominately bonded labor. Certainly not the location for the world\u2019s elitist playboys and terrorists to arrange for a lavish pleasure slave auction.</p><p>Fuck! It was going to be a very long night.</p><p>Matthew checked his watch and decided to order his dinner before his favorite Chinese restaurant closed for the night. He was practically salivating over the thought of garlic noodles and crunchy eggrolls. There had been a time when he\u2019d have ordered for two, but it had been nearly a year since he\u2019d had a partner to share the long investigative hours with; these days, he worked alone. It was just as well since he wasn\u2019t really good with people. He was much too honest and people just didn\u2019t appreciate him for it.</p><p>He was good at his job and people respected him, but it didn\u2019t mean they jumped at the chance to work with him or wanted to go out for beers after work. Still, they did what he asked them to do and he couldn\u2019t fault them. If he\u2019d asked one of the analysts to stay behind and help him do some research, they\u2019d have begrudgingly done it and kept their disparaging remarks to themselves until the next time they found themselves in better company.</p><p>Matthew had asked for a special task force to assist on the case. There was a potentially short turn-around and the possibility of an international incident if they had a raid in Pakistan. Still, his boss refused to get a decent task force together unless Matthew had concrete proof suspected terrorists and political targets would be at the auction.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t know any better, he\u2019d accuse the Bureau of purposely letting this case fall between the cracks. Olivia Ruiz\u2019s face was splashed all over the news, complete with grainy surveillance and camera-phone videos of her standoff with the border patrol. Something like that didn\u2019t go away easily.</p> <p>He scrolled through the information he had available on Muhammad Rafiq and his accomplices. He was a Pakistani military officer and a high ranking one. He had fought beside U.S. forces as part of the coalition during Desert Storm. He was highly decorated and was rumored to be very close to the former Major General who assisted in the 1999 coup that overthrew Pakistan\u2019s president. In short, the man had some very powerful people in his circle.</p><p>If he wanted someone dead, he couldn\u2019t imagine it would be difficult for him to carry it out. Of course, he would have to do it without embarrassing himself or his superiors in front of the international community. Could his involvement be the reason the Bureau was hesitating on attacking this case full force?</p><p>Matthew picked up his pen and wrote down a list of things he needed to gather information on: military bases in Pakistan, air strips near or on such bases, customs locations and refueling stations. One thing was for certain, Rafiq wouldn\u2019t be flying in or out through commercial means, he\u2019d need a private plane, one that wouldn\u2019t have to contend with customs officials. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was a start.</p><p>The intercom buzzer startled him. His food had finally arrived. He took the elevator to the first floor and met the delivery guy, gave him a healthy tip and trudged back upstairs to enjoy his greasy, delicious treats.</p><p>Several hours later, Matthew decided to call it a night and drive back to his hotel. He planned on getting up early in the morning and going to visit Olivia in the hospital again. She\u2019d be expecting news on her request to join the witness protection program and he had no additional news to offer, but he still needed to get the rest of her statement.</p><p>If her information delivered the results he had proposed to his superiors, her request would likely be granted, but not for the right reasons. What the girl needed was justice. She needed the men responsible for her kidnapping, rape, and torture to pay for their crimes in the public arena. She needed for those men to be judged and found wanting of basic human decency, only then could she pick up the pieces of her life and move forward.</p><p>However, if he was correct in his assumptions, the Bureau would be more interested in the national security elements, rather than justice for one eighteen-year-old girl. There would be no official arrests, no public trials, because the information she could provide and the covert op that would garner evidence of involvement in human trafficking by wealthy and powerful military leaders, heads of state, and billionaire moguls would be an invaluable asset in the hands of the U.S. government.</p><p>It was somewhat of a moral conundrum as far as Matthew was concerned. Olivia was running away. She didn\u2019t want to face her former life or its inhabitants and it was a sentiment Matthew understood well, but couldn\u2019t agree with. At the same time, he was the last person to give advice on how a person should move beyond their personal traumas. He was still damaged, still sick in the head, no matter how many therapists he had talked to as a teenager. His records had been sealed and for all intents and purposes he was fit for duty, but he knew his own mind. He knew his own limitations and biases. He supposed it counted for something, his knowledge of his own shortcomings afforded him the semblance of perspective when dealing with his job.</p> <p>He entered his hotel room and set his briefcase down on the table provided. He emptied his pockets, careful to stack any loose change by denomination and place them in a row by size. His keys, wallet and watch were also placed with care. He unbuttoned his suit jacket and hung it up in the closet. Next, he sat and removed his shoes and socks, followed by his shirt and tie. Finally, he removed his belt, wound it, and placed it on the table with his other things before he removed his underwear. He lined up his shoes under the bed and placed the other items in the hotels dry-cleaning bag. It was his nightly routine and he took comfort in the repeated actions. Order was important.</p><p>He stood naked in the warm, slightly humid, Texas air and ignored the tingling sensation of his penis becoming more erect. He knew why he was getting hard and he wished he weren\u2019t. He\u2019d been unable to resist the temptation of perusing his interview notes, despite the promising information he\u2019d garnered through researching Rafiq in greater depth. That much of the girl\u2019s story was filled with violence was regrettable, that the violence was a direct result of sexually charged circumstances was contemptible, but the way she recounted the story with such devious and manipulating zest and obvious arousal was enough to put him over the edge. It pushed all of his buttons and on the heels of his distaste was the undeniable quickening of his pulse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wouldn\u2019t do it though. He wouldn\u2019t fantasize. He wouldn\u2019t masturbate. He wouldn\u2019t seek out sexual gratification. Doing so, would be a step in the wrong direction for him because he knew it would lead to the debilitating guilt that inexorably followed.</p><p>Instead, he got down on the floor and proceeded to do as many push-ups as he possibly could. He was tired and his muscles protested. Two in the morning was not the time for exercise, his muscles screamed at him, but it was better than the alternative. He pushed himself until sweat ran down his back and his stomach quivered, until his arms threatened to give out...until there was not a chance in hell he could inspire his lust. Then he took a shower and got in bed.</p><p>He slept peacefully and without dreams.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p> <p>Caleb couldn\u2019t sleep. He\u2019d done everything he could think of, he\u2019d taken a hot shower, he\u2019d masturbated, and he\u2019d sat in Rafiq\u2019s library and looked through his books. He couldn\u2019t read, but some of the books had pictures in them. He\u2019d walked around the house and discovered the snacks in the kitchen. He\u2019d eaten all the gulab jamun and even now, his fingers and the corners of his mouth were sticky. He still couldn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>Where was Rafiq, he wondered? His heart began to race at the thought of the older man. What if he didn\u2019t come back? What if something had happened to him? Caleb\u2019s stomach hurt. He\u2019d never been alone before. There was always someone near him, if not the other boys, then Narweh, if not him, then perhaps a patron.</p><p>Caleb stood and pushed his pillow and blanket onto the floor, his bed was too soft. He lay down on the thick carpet and swaddled himself in the blanket he\u2019d been provided. Outside, the wind howled. Why would Rafiq leave him alone? He drew his knees up to his chest and rocked. He wished RezA were with him. RezA was one of the British boys that often shared his bed. If he had a friend at all, it was probably RezA.</p><p>For the first time in a week he let himself think of someone other than himself. With Narweh dead, what had happened to the others, to RezA? It was true they often fought and sometimes threw one another into Narweh\u2019s angry path, but it didn\u2019t mean there was not affection there. Whenever one of them was mistreated by a patron or after a particularly savage beating, they would often comfort each other by applying bandages or offering arms that consoled instead of harmed. Caleb was smaller, younger probably, but he was a fighter where as RezA was more amenable and easily manipulated.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you anger him so often, K\u00e9leb? You know what he will do,\u201d he\u2019d often whispered to K\u00e9leb in the dark and applied ointment to his skin.</p> <p>\u201cI hate him. I\u2019ll let him kill me before I become his little lap dog. A dog I might be, but not his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a dog, K\u00e9leb,\u201d RezA kissed his forehead. \"You\u2019re a stupid boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a lap dog,\u201d K\u00e9leb countered with a half-hearted laugh.</p><p>RezA laughed too and put the cap on the ointment. He stood quietly and tip-toed toward his own bed on the floor.</p><p>\u201cRezA!\u201d K\u00e9leb whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him one day.\u201d</p><p>After a long pause, \u201cI know. Goodnight stupid boy.\u201d</p><p>Caleb had done exactly as he promised. He\u2019d killed Narweh in cold, efficient blood. But he hadn\u2019t bothered to look for RezA, nor had he told everyone they were free. He never told them to run. He would like to say it was because the thought had not occurred to him, but that wasn\u2019t true. He\u2019d been afraid. He\u2019d been afraid they\u2019d turn on him, because without Narweh, many of them would have to choose between poverty and a new and unknown master, perhaps even the drudgery of bonded slavery. He had also been afraid Rafiq would decide all of it, including Caleb, was too much of a burden and he would have to face the fate of the others. So he\u2019d simply let Rafiq lead him away. He\u2019d let himself be shocked and traumatized over what he\u2019d done. He\u2019d let himself be the victim. He deserved to be abandoned in return.</p><p>A noise startled him from his self-deprecating thoughts.</p><p>He was stone-like in his stillness, listening for any sounds to indicate whether or not he was alone in the house and furthermore, if a presence equated to danger. He heard the door shut somewhat gently and then heard the familiar shuffling sounds of someone removing their shoes and placing them near the door. Casual noises were a good sign, Caleb supposed, since someone intending harm would likely not care enough to remove their shoes.</p><p>Caleb wanted to leave his room, he wanted to investigate, but the fear he felt still lingered strongly. Rafiq was a stranger and his moods could be erratic. He remembered with perfect clarity the way he had been tossed into the bathtub and held down by Rafiq\u2019s strong arms. He shuddered.</p><p>Footsteps neared his door and Caleb tensed even more, his muscles quivering from being held so tight. The door opened slowly and he shut his eyes tightly. If Rafiq tried to rape him, he would fight back. Somewhere in his mind a voice whispered he should just do whatever was expected of him. He\u2019d survive. He\u2019d want to die, but he could survive it again.</p><p>\u201cCaleb?\u201d Rafiq\u2019s voice whispered into the darkness.</p> <p>Caleb held his breath and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cBoy? Are you sleeping?\u201d Rafiq whispered again and he seemed in control, not angry or predisposed to violence.</p><p>Caleb refused to answer though, he kept his eyes shut and tried to breathe as quietly, shallowly and as evenly as he could until finally, his door shut and Rafiq was gone. Caleb instantly felt relief, but also loss. He was alone again. Alone and frightened in a strange, dark room.</p><p>What was his life now? He\u2019d killed someone. He\u2019d murdered. He didn\u2019t feel bad about doing it, he would do it again given the chance, but what was he to do with his life, who could he be? Who was Caleb? He had always told himself one day he would be free, but he didn\u2019t realize freedom could feel...too vast, too open and uncertain. Now he was free, he felt devoid of purpose and without a purpose what did his life amount to? He owed a debt to Rafiq and he would honor it, but once his task was complete he would find himself in exactly the same place.</p><p>Caleb swallowed his fear and tossed back the blankets, determined to seek answers from the one person in his life who might have them: Rafiq. He slowly opened the door and tiptoed toward Rafiq\u2019s room. He hesitated at the door, but then tentatively knocked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in there,\u201d Rafiq said from behind him.</p><p>Caleb whirled around and stared into Rafiq\u2019s intense gaze, \u201cI-I-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he stammered. \u201cI was awake when you came in, but I....\u201d he looked at his bare feet, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what you came looking for.\u201d Caleb swallowed.</p><p>Rafiq smirked, \u201cAnd what did you decide?\u201d</p><p>Caleb shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought...I\u2019d get it over with and simply ask you.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq\u2019s loud sigh caused Caleb\u2019s shoulders to tense, but he didn\u2019t move to walk away from the older man. \u201cThat is very brave of you chab, but you have no need to be wary of me; I intend you no harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you intend?\u201d Caleb bristled at being called a boy.</p><p>\u201cI would hope I\u2019ve earned your loyalty by now. I only meant to see if you are well? I\u2019ve been gone since very early and I feared my absence was...stressful for you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb shrugged half-heartedly, but in reality, he wanted to weep with gratitude. No one in a position of power had ever concerned himself with his well-being. No one had ever just come to check on him. He took a deep breath and pressed his emotions down into his stomach. He did not wish to appear weak in front of the one man offering to make him strong. \u201cIt was strange to be alone. Before, with Narweh, there was always someone, but...it was...I don\u2019t know what to say. I ate all of the gulab jamun,\u201d he confessed sheepishly. \u201cI was also in your library. I\u2019ve never seen so many books! You must know a lot of things. But don\u2019t worry!\u201d he was suddenly nervous. \u201cI can\u2019t read. I wasn\u2019t trying to invade your privacy. I only looked at the pictures. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq laughed and the sound put Caleb at ease somewhat. He relaxed further when Rafiq\u2019s hand landed on his head and ruffled his long, blond hair. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Caleb. This is your home now. The food was left for you and you are welcome to the books. I will teach you how to read them.\u201d</p><p>Caleb shut his eyes tight to keep his tears from surfacing. Without warning, he lunged toward Rafiq and wrapped his skinny arms around him. He wanted to express his gratitude. He wanted Rafiq to know how much Caleb felt indebted to him.</p><p>Slowly and with shaking hands, Caleb reached up and pulled the older man\u2019s head toward his and pressed his lips to Rafiq\u2019s. The older man stilled, but didn\u2019t stop him when his tongue slid across the opening of Rafiq\u2019s mouth. Caleb had done this many times, with men he hated; surely he could do it once with someone whom he respected.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s youthful body responded to the kiss and he pressed forward, chasing Rafiq\u2019s mouth, his taste. Rafiq pulled away.</p><p>Caleb panicked. If Rafiq rejected him, he would die. He would die of shame because he was a whore and knew no other way.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fight you. I\u2019ll do as you ask,\u201d Caleb whispered. His words were shaky and full of fear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo as I tell you, now, and stop this.\u201d Rafiq\u2019s tone held the slightest bit of contempt.</p><p>Caleb pulled away and tried to run past Rafiq, but his path was blocked and soon Rafiq\u2019s firm grip held his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d This time the tears were present in his voice. He couldn\u2019t hide his shame.</p><p>Rafiq pulled him to his chest and held him tight, \u201cYou are, K\u00e9leb, no longer. You are not a dog, and no one\u2019s whore. You don\u2019t owe me that. You owe it to no one.\u201d</p><p>Caleb cried and held tighter to Rafiq. He couldn\u2019t speak.</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever been with a woman, Caleb?\u201d Rafiq whispered above him.</p><p>Caleb shook his head. He had seen them of course, there were female whores Narweh kept, but they were separated from the boys and never shared with them. He\u2019d caught glimpses of their bodies and wondered what it would be like to touch them, but it was a pleasure he\u2019d never experienced.</p><p>Rafiq led Caleb toward his own room and opened the door. Slowly, he released Caleb and urged him inside. Reluctantly, Caleb loosened his arms and meekly stepped toward the bed he\u2019d made for himself on the floor. \u201cTomorrow, then\u201d Rafiq said casually, \u201cTomorrow you\u2019ll begin to learn how to take your place at my side. You\u2019ll have your choice of them.\u201d He smiled as Caleb stared at him in shock and then he shut the door.</p><p>Caleb still couldn\u2019t sleep, but now the reasons were different. For the first time since he could remember, Caleb was excited about what the morning would bring.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s eyes opened in the dark. The dream, the memory, lingered. He suddenly felt like a boy again, scared of the dark, scared of the unknown, and lonely. It was strange how a dream could make itself real. It could take control of one\u2019s mind and invoke sentiment, so much so, it affected the body. Caleb felt a lump in his throat; it shouldn\u2019t be there, he was far removed from the scared boy he had been and yet there it was. His heart hammered strongly in his chest and his palms were sweaty.</p> <p>He told himself over and over it had been a dream, but the emotions clung to him like thick molasses. No matter how he tried to wipe them from his thoughts, they remained, shifting from one side of his psyche to the other, vacillating between the joys he had felt in experiencing his first moment of acceptance and the grief of knowing the future.</p><p>RezA had died. Rafiq had burned Narweh\u2019s body where Caleb had left it, inside the house. He had not looked for survivors, he had not warned anyone in the house. Rafiq had imparted the information to Caleb one morning after breakfast, when he\u2019d finally found the courage to ask about what had happened.</p><p>He had wept for RezA and the other boys in private after scalding himself with a hot spoon he\u2019d been using to stir beans. As his flesh burned, he tried to envision what RezA had felt in the last horrifying moments of his life. Caleb had killed his only friend and in the end the only scar he had to show for it was on the inside after his burned skin was cut away and new skin took its place.</p><p>Caleb wanted another shower, one so hot he wouldn\u2019t be able to think about anything else, but he knew the behavior was stupid and would likely cause more damage than could heal in time for him to continue with his mission. It had been some time since Caleb had had this many compulsive episodes. Yes, he sometimes needed the pain, but such needs were usually spread out over long periods of time. In the last few weeks, he\u2019d struggled not to give in to his impulses many times. It couldn\u2019t continue.</p><p>Rafiq had done what he needed to do. For Caleb to become the man Rafiq needed him to be; to become the man he wanted to be, there could be no witnesses that knew him as Narweh\u2019s dog. It was a harsh and debilitating truth at the time, but Caleb understood it as a man in a way he never could as a boy. RezA would have done the same.</p><p>Caleb rolled over on the floor and sat up to stare at the shape of Kitten\u2019s body sleeping on the bed above him. She moved around a lot, her legs jumping beneath the blankets occasionally. It appeared to Caleb she wanted to roll onto her side, or her stomach, but even in sleep, the pain kept her in a slightly upright position.</p> <p>Her words from earlier drifted toward him:</p><p>\u201cYou could not sell me... I could stay with you... be with you?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, wishing things could be so simple. What would Rafiq say to such a request? Did it even have to be a request? Caleb was a man after all, and a dangerous one at that. Perhaps Caleb need only inform Rafiq of the way it was to be and move on from there. The girl was beaten and bruised, her virginity in question as far as Rafiq would be concerned. How difficult would it be to simply call it a lost cause with Kitten? But honestly, it wouldn\u2019t repair anything. He would forever be her captor and she would forever be his prisoner. He had to stop going back and forth. He\u2019d made a decision, he would stick to it. End of story.</p><p>Kitten shifted some more on the bed and whimpered for a few seconds before her eyes finally opened. Her lungs rose and fell deeply and harshly. Apparently, Caleb wasn\u2019t the only one suffering from nightmares. To her credit, she hadn\u2019t cried out or asked for him. She looked around the room and caught sight of him, then looked away and sat up slowly.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>She nodded, but otherwise didn\u2019t respond. She tossed her blanket off of her legs in a slow, taxing motion and stiffly stood before walking into the bathroom and shutting the door. Within seconds he could hear the water from the sink running. Caleb wondered how she was planning to use the facilities because the toilet was set into the ground and required the user to squat above it to do their business. It would be difficult for her to maintain her balance given her injuries, but he decided her need for privacy was perhaps greater than her need for help at the moment.</p><p>Caleb went about setting the room to rights and collecting the things he\u2019d need to get ready for the day ahead. Neither of them had much in the way of clothing, but they only had one more day to travel, so the point was moot. He looked through the groceries he had purchased and found the bananas as well as some raspberry pastries. That would do nicely for breakfast. There were plenty of bottles of water left as well. He checked his watch and noted it was only five-thirty in the morning. The sooner they were out and on the road the better. They could make it to Tuxtepec by dinner time, even if they took another twelve hours to get there. He would have to make a stop in town before they left.</p><p>Caleb reached for his cell phone and dialed Rafiq.</p> <p>\u201cSalaam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been answering your phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I to answer to you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the f**k not? We\u2019re partners, or has Jair usurped my position in the last two days?\u201d</p><p>Rafiq laughed. It was the kind of laugh Caleb had suffered through for years, a dismissive, derisive laugh, meant to put Caleb in his place, below his master. \u201cDon\u2019t be childish, Caleb. You\u2019re the one who made our last conversation so hostile. Jair is hardly in a position to incite your jealousy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous, I\u2019m irritated and you\u2019re only making it worse. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you, Caleb? Where is the girl?\u201d</p><p>Caleb took a deep breath and exhaled away from the phone. It was the moment of truth. \u201cWe\u2019re in Zacatecas. We should be in Tuxtepec by morning at the latest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe morning?\u201d Rafiq admonished, \u201cYou\u2019re less than a day\u2019s drive from Jair and your hostages, why would you be gone any longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the girl, her injuries slow us down. I keep having to stop for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to arouse suspicion by driving around with her like that.\u201d Rafiq paused, his breathing as grating as his voice. Caleb braced for it. \u201cShe is the final part of this, Caleb. She must be ready. She must be perfect. If you can\u2019t do this, I would be more than willing to take over.\u201d</p><p>Caleb clenched his jaw with so much force he could hear it popping. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Rafiq. I can do it,\u201d he bit out. \u201cStop questioning me. I know what I need to do. That\u2019s all I think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the hostages you\u2019ve taken? What are your plans for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge. Naturally.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq laughed, \u201cThere you are, Khoya. I\u2019d begun to worry. Do try to keep your head this time, from what I hear, the pair might prove useful to us.\u201d</p><p>A strange feeling bloomed in Caleb\u2019s chest, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I assume I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d He hung up, annoyed.</p><p>Kitten stepped out of the bathroom looking a bit lost. Last night had put them on different footing and now it was up to Caleb to maintain the status quo he had created between them. He set his phone on the table and walked toward his captive. She stilled as he approached, her eyes set upon the floor and her hands clasped in front of her. Her nervousness was obvious, but alluring nonetheless.</p><p>Caleb swept his hand down her face, careful not to press on her bruises and swept her hair back over her shoulder. \u201cWhenever you enter a room and your purpose is unclear, always kneel next to your master.\u201d Kitten did not hesitate to comply, though her movements were slow as she struggled toward the ground.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Caleb whispered, \u201cnow spread your knees and sit back on your ankles with your hands on your thighs and your head bowed. Your master should be able to see every part of you and know you will not move until you\u2019re told. Do you understand?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kitten whispered with some hesitation, \u201cMaster.\u201d Tentatively, she moved her limbs into position. She wore a nightgown and her body was not visible to Caleb, but he knew her body well enough to know what he was missing and his body unwittingly responded.</p><p>\u201cLeet sawm k\u2019leet sue is Russian. When you hear the command, you will lie on your back with your knees spread and lifted toward your chest. Hold your legs behind your knees.\u201d Kitten broke position and stared up at him with a pleading expression.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s breath stuttered into his lungs from his excitement. At last, she was compliant, and his to command. The feeling was heady, but made somewhat hollow because he was teaching her the commands in Russian. \u201cLeet sawm k\u2019leet sue,\u201d he repeated. His expression was hard, his eyes serious.</p><p>Kitten\u2019s mouth tilted downward at the corners in a slight grimace, her chin trembling with her effort not to cry, but she nodded. In achingly slow degrees, she put herself flat on the ground. She looked up at the ceiling and the tears she had been holding fell down the sides of her face into her hair.</p> <p>This was hard for her, Caleb knew it would be, but it was the easiest thing she could do compared to the journey ahead. There was guilt on his part, but also desire, intense desire that thrummed in his veins. The guilt was nothing when pitted against his desire to have Kitten at his mercy. If that made him sick and depraved, he\u2019d accepted it a long time ago. \u201cYour legs, Kitten. Let\u2019s have it.\u201d</p><p>He watched as her knees began to bend and he nearly doubled over with want as her hands pulled at the nightgown, raising it over her knees and up her thighs. He hadn\u2019t expected her to bare herself to him, but she was. His c**k began to stir to the beat of his speeding heart, filling, lengthening and begging to show itself. Kitten raised her knees toward her chest, her hands fisting the nightgown at her waist. Her pu**y was clearly visible, the pink lips spread and flushed, her tiny clit peeking out from beneath its hood. Caleb drew a sharp breath and swallowed.</p><p>He could stare at her forever, but his desire was not the purpose of this exercise. It was the most concise manner of re-establishing their roles. There would be no outbursts today, no arguments on the road, no confusion about whether or not he would spare her. \u201cYou really are beautiful there, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he snapped.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Master\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cVery good, Kitten. You can put your legs down now.\u201d Her movements were quicker than he thought possible with her injuries, but he declined to comment. He also ignored her sniffling. \u201cLye zhaash chee means, prone. Do you understand the word?\u201d</p><p>Kitten sobbed as she nodded, \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver on your stomach then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll hurt,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAttempt it at the very least. Always try to obey. Let me worry about what you can and cannot handle, return to the rest position, with your back to me,\u201d Caleb said. His words were clipped and brooked no argument. \u201cLye zhaash chee.\u201d</p> <p>A mewling sound burst past Kitten\u2019s lips, but she quickly pressed her lips together and held her breath as she struggled, like a turtle flipped on its shell, to roll over. Caleb hesitated to help her and it reminded him of the first time she had disobeyed him and he had slapped her br**sts a rosy pink until she obeyed. It seemed like ages ago.</p><p>It took a minute or two, but finally she was in the rest position. Caleb admired the way her ass rested on her bare feet. \u201cNow lean your body forward with your ass in the air. Normally, you have your arms stretched out in front of you, but for now, keep them wherever it\u2019s most comfortable.</p><p>Kitten was stoic as she did what she was told. She chose to keep her arms crossed over her chest, letting the side of her face rest against the ground. The nightgown obstructed Caleb\u2019s view. He stepped forward and gathered the fabric up over the soft cheeks of her ass.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kitten. I do like you like this. So much.\u201d His words held nothing but truth. He couldn\u2019t resist palming her lightly splayed cheeks and opening them slowly. Kitten trembled, but remained otherwise still beneath his questing fingers. \u201cCan I touch you?\u201d he asked, with a hint of challenge.</p><p>There was silence for a few seconds and then she answered, \u201cYes, Master.\u201d Caleb smiled, it was exactly the answer he wanted and exactly the one she should give. She was learning.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, Kitten. I\u2019m proud of you,\u201d he said. He stroked the soft flesh of her inner thighs. Kitten let out a gust of breath, Caleb, interpreted as desperation. This was a lot for her to handle so soon after the trauma of the last few days. She\u2019d done well, and he really was proud of her. It was enough.</p><p>He pulled the nightgown back into place and urged her back into her rest position. Tears tracked down her cheeks and her face was most definitely worse for wear, but Caleb kissed her wet cheeks anyway as he helped her regain her calm.</p><p>After he gave her more medicine for her pain, he calmly fed her breakfast while she sat quietly between his knees, accepting all he had to give her.</p> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Day 9:</p><p>Dr. Sloan doesn\u2019t ask me why I\u2019m crying and I assume it\u2019s because she figures she knows. I would rather she ask me. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d I say, but it sounds like an accusation.</p><p>Dr. Sloan clears her throat, \u201cWhat am I thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Caleb is awful, that he\u2019s cruel and I\u2019m stupid for loving him.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, somewhat wryly and responds in a way I perceive as clinical, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re stupid at all. If anything, I think you\u2019re extraordinarily brave.\u201d</p><p>I scoff. \u201cRight. I\u2019m brave. Reed said the same thing.\u201d</p><p>I hear the scratching of her pen as she makes more notes, \u201cWell then, you have a second opinion now. You don\u2019t think your actions were brave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot especially. I think I just did what I had to do. Caleb\u2019s always saying a person has to do what they must in order to survive. Survival is the only thing that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think surviving is brave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Do you think that guy who cut off his arm because he was trapped by a boulder was brave? It\u2019s just instinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called fight or flight and one is certainly braver than the other, depending on the circumstances. Under your circumstances, what you did was very brave. You\u2019re here, Olivia. You survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t call me that. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer, Miss Ruiz? Agent Reed says you don\u2019t mind that as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What else did he say about me?\u201d</p><p>She smiles coyly and suddenly I find myself suspicious of their relationship. I don\u2019t like the fact they talk about me. \u201cWe\u2019re required to discuss the case, Miss Ruiz. We exchange all notes and information as well as any insights we might have. I did tell you all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. What did he say about me?\u201d I have a strange curiosity about Reed that hasn\u2019t abated. I don\u2019t know what it is about him, but there\u2019s definitely something.</p><p>\u201cHe said you\u2019re a brat,\u201d she says, but her eyes smile. I smile a little too. Reed didn\u2019t say that at all.</p><p>\u201cBack to the subject. Why don\u2019t you think you\u2019re brave?\u201d</p><p>I sigh, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess...I\u2019m here and that\u2019s what Caleb wants.\u201d An uncomfortable silence settles between us. I\u2019m lost in my thoughts. What, Caleb, wants. I thought I did everything he wanted, I tried my very best to make him happy, but in the end...I guess it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cYou keep referring to him in the present tense, why?\u201d</p><p>I can see his face in my mind\u2019s eye, so beautiful, so sad. There\u2019s blood smudged across his cheek, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not squeamish any more. It\u2019s the face of the man I love, the only one I\u2019ve ever loved and it\u2019s difficult to imagine there will ever be another. I wipe more tears away. That bastard. \u201cIt\u2019s easier,\u201d I finally answer, \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea he\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Sloan nods. \u201cGo ahead, tell me what happened next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much really, after breakfast he helped me get dressed. Then he tied me to the bed, gagged me, and left for a few hours.\u201d I know where he went now \u2013 he went to the bank, but I don\u2019t know if I should tell Sloan or not. Then again, Reed already knows about the money. \u201cHe went to the bank,\u201d I add. Sloan flips through her paperwork and writes something down.</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Reed here? Why the both of you at different times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Reed and I have different job descriptions. He\u2019s interested in the case; I\u2019m interested in your well-being as well as the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he doesn\u2019t give a shit about what happens to me, is what you\u2019re saying.\u201d I\u2019m not shocked by the information; it\u2019s something I already knew to be true, but still, it stings to hear it from someone else.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. Please don\u2019t put words in my mouth,\u201d Sloan says. I think I\u2019ve made her uncomfortable, but I can\u2019t say for what reason. \u201cAgent Reed says you kissed him?\u201d</p><p>My eyes open wide and my mouth is slightly agape. I can\u2019t believe he told her! Why would he do that! \u201cSo!?!\u201d My face is heating up, and I\u2019m positive it stems in equal parts from anger and embarrassment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is a side of Sloan I haven\u2019t seen yet, her brow is arched and her mouth is a little tight at the corners. \u201cI\u2019m not your enemy. Please stop acting like I am. He told me because he\u2019s concerned for you and the only reason I bring it up is because you were just telling me he doesn\u2019t care about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine! I kissed him.\u201d I look away from Sloan and toward the windows. Only Reed uses the kindergarten interrogation room to talk to me. I probably make him nervous. Good.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he had something I wanted.\u201d The words fall right out of my mouth and although I know the picture they paint of me, I can\u2019t say I care. I\u2019m fixated on the pigeon walking back and forth outside my window. I\u2019m envious of the pigeon. It doesn\u2019t have a care in the world beyond eating, sleeping, and defecating on park statues. That\u2019s the life.</p> <p>\u201cIs that the only reason?\u201d She\u2019s trying to keep her words innocent, but I know nothing she says is innocent, not even her stories about interpretive taxidermy. It would be easy to forget Sloan is a member of the FBI and she\u2019s trained to handle cases like mine. She comes off as very empathetic, and even a little vulnerable herself, but she wouldn\u2019t be where she is today if she weren\u2019t a wolf under that wool suit.</p><p>My head swivels toward her and away from the window. I make myself smile brazenly, \u201cAre you jealous, Janice?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t miss a beat, \u201cOf what, Olivia?\u201d I smile again and this time there\u2019s an answering smile on her face. Yeah, Sloan has teeth. I like teeth.</p><p>We go back and forth for several minutes. She asks me a question and I turn it around to pose the same question of her and she turns it back on me again. It would seem like useless conversation, but I think we\u2019re both learning little things about one another with each exchange. Still, I\u2019d rather be talking to Reed. I tell Sloan as much.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t unusual, you know. Some victims of abuse tend to gravitate toward strong, authoritative men...like Agent Reed. They also tend to mimic the behavior expected of them by their abusers, especially when that behavior is of a sexual nature.\u201d</p> <p>I feel like she\u2019s just doused me in hot oil. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t do that bullshit psychotherapy crap on me. It was a f**king kiss, not a pledge of my undying devotion. And for the record, I\u2019m not some broken rape victim you have to put back together. I\u2019m fine.\u201d I\u2019m crying again and I hate myself for it. Why won\u2019t my face stop leaking!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Livvie. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you,\u201d Sloan says. She sounds sincere and that almost pisses me off more than her suggestion I\u2019m some basket-case.</p><p>Aren\u2019t you? You don\u2019t know who you are anymore. You have no place to go from here.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re good for today. Do you want to stop? We can go have some lunch in the cafeteria. Maybe play some cards in the rec room, or maybe checkers? I love checkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSloan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it again.\u201d I wipe the tears off of my face and blow my nose with some tissues \u2013 funny how they\u2019re ready and waiting by my bed.</p><p>Sloan lets out a deep sigh and leans back in her chair. Her expression is inscrutable, as though not even she knows what she is feeling, or thinking, or wanting to say. Finally though, she nods slightly to herself and opens her mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re broken. I don\u2019t mean to \u2018psychoanalyze\u2019 you, well...\u201d she laughs without humor, \u201cat least, not out loud, but I do think there are some cracks to be filled in. You\u2019ve been through so much in the last few months, and I\u2019m incredibly impressed all you have are cracks. You should be broken, but you\u2019re not. Cracks can be mended and believe it or not, you have a lot of people who want to help you mend.\u201d</p><p>I swallow really hard. I don\u2019t want to cry any more. I don\u2019t know what I want, except for Caleb. I think I would gladly go back to the mansion, if it meant I could be with Caleb again. I would live it, all over again. I know it isn\u2019t healthy and I worry that maybe, just maybe, Sloan and Reed are right. I\u2019m f**ked in the head and nothing I feel is real.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you want, Livvie, and what you think you want, you\u2019ve been brainwashed into wanting.\u201d</p><p>Even Caleb said my love isn\u2019t real, but...I feel it. I feel my love for him more strongly and deeply than anything I have ever felt in my life. I think if it turns out they\u2019re right and I am wrong...that will break me. Survival...it\u2019s the most important thing.</p><p>It\u2019s been an okay morning, I guess. I didn\u2019t care for talking with Sloan, but playing checkers with her was slightly amusing. I could tell she was still analyzing me as we played, asking loaded questions beneath the guise of conversation, but for the most part we just talked about life outside the walls of the hospital. I missed a lot of things over the summer.</p><p>For starters, I missed graduation. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that. I suppose I don\u2019t really care, but it\u2019s strange not to. It had seemed so important four months ago. I guess I\u2019m still a graduate. My grades were exemplary before I left.</p><p>Left, that\u2019s funny.</p> <p>Nicole started college. She\u2019s called the hospital a few times and we\u2019ve chatted a little \u2013 not about anything important. I avoid that. She\u2019s offered to leave school for a few weeks and visit me, but I asked her not to bother. I\u2019m fine and I have a lot of stuff going on anyway. It was shockingly easy to get her to agree not to come. Life goes on. Even if yours is over.</p><p>Sloan has left the building, but she says she\u2019ll be back later today. As if I\u2019d asked or even wanted her here; the woman is daft. I\u2019ll take: Answers to questions no one has asked, for $100, Alex. Still, I wish I had something to do besides lie in bed and watch TV. I\u2019ve raided the library, but it\u2019s all so unimpressive.</p><p>Reed is supposed to come interview (more like interrogate) me soon and I can\u2019t help but feel a little excited about seeing him and talking to him. When he gets angry with me I can almost see Caleb in his brown eyes. It\u2019s silly, but I almost live for those little glimpses.</p><p>I\u2019m not sore anymore, haven\u2019t been in days. My bruises are gone and my scrapes are scabbed over. When they heal, it will be as if all evidence of my time with Caleb has been erased. I wrap my arms around my stomach and squeeze until the thought passes. If you had told me a month ago, I\u2019d be sad to have unmarked skin, I\u2019d have called you stupid and smacked you around for good measure. But here I am: a girl without a mark, and without a reason to keep moving forward.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Pet. You have every reason,\u201d Caleb\u2019s specter whispers in my ear. I don\u2019t know if hearing his voice in my head makes me crazy, but I don\u2019t care either way. It\u2019s what I have left after the scrapes heal. I can\u2019t give him up. Besides, I know the voice isn\u2019t real, no matter how much I wish it were.</p><p>I like to play his voice in my head at night, when the hospital is quieter and I can concentrate on making him as real as I can. I spread my legs and finger myself to the memory of his mouth sucking on my tits and his fingers flicking back and forth over my clit. If I try really, really hard, I can hear him, feel him, even fabricate the smell of him \u2013 but I can never get him to kiss me. I usually cry after I come. That\u2019s exactly the kind of thing I don\u2019t tell Sloan. I\u2019m fairly certain she\u2019d have a field day with that information.</p><p>I make use of my time waiting for Reed; I take a shower and put on the oh-so-sexy hospital lunatic outfit they give me to wear: gray pants and shirt. You would think they\u2019d have something more cheerful given the scenery, but then I think of the crafts room and decide it\u2019s just as well. My skin tone does not do yellow. My lunch arrives and I pick through the soggy carrots, eat the gravy covered, yet still tasteless beef, and drink my milk. I eat the green Jell-O too. Caleb fed me better food during my kidnapping than these people. I laugh at my own joke.</p><p>\u201cSomething funny, Miss Ruiz?\u201d I look up from my tray and see Reed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, \u201csomething is very funny, Reed.\u201d He smiles, no teeth, but it\u2019s still pretty nice just the same. I wonder if Reed has a girlfriend. He\u2019s not wearing a wedding ring. What would Reed\u2019s girlfriend be like?</p><p>\u201cCare to share, or do you have to extort more concessions out of me first?\u201d he says and casually walks into my room and stands at the foot of my bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny, Reed. Me extort you, that\u2019s rich.\u201d He smiles again and shrugs. I mimic him. \u201cI was laughing because the food here is awful and Caleb fed me way better stuff. Seems like this place is real captivity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay the word and I\u2019ll have you transferred to The Pentagon; I hear they serve amazing spaghetti every Thursday.\u201d He sets his briefcase on the chair and leans against the wall.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks. But I think I\u2019ll just put up with the horrible food. If I\u2019m going anywhere from this place, it\u2019ll be to my new digs in whatever mid-western town you\u2019ve decided to hide me in.\u201d I give him my sweetest, condescending smile. \u201cHow\u2019s that going by the way?\u201d</p><p>Reed shakes his head, unfazed. Not that I really expected to get a reaction from him, this guy just doesn\u2019t lose his cool...unless you make out with him. I smile again, wider, all teeth, and my smile isn\u2019t remotely sweet. The idea has promise, as it seems to be the only thing we have in common. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get right down to it then, Miss Ruiz. I\u2019ve been doing some more research on your boyfriend and his terrorist friends and I have a few questions for you, starting with: When did you meet Muhammad Rafiq?\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Reed to ruin any semblance of a pleasant moment. The man is an automaton and his programming is set to one objective: get the bad guys by any means necessary. I would respect him if he weren\u2019t trying to ruin my whole life. Just another way he reminds me of Caleb. \u201cThat\u2019s not where we left off, Reed. You said I could tell you the whole story.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cDr. Sloan called me after she left the hospital. I\u2019ll get all of her notes later, but for now, she said the only thing to come out of your time with her today was an acknowledgment it was Caleb who left you the money in Zacatecas. Two-hundred-fifty-thousand dollars is a lot of money to transfer and deposit for a girl he planned on selling. I definitely want to talk about that, but for now the important thing is to find out more about Rafiq. When did you meet him?\u201d</p><p>Reed has been here for less than ten minutes and he\u2019s already managed to royally piss me off. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what he was doing. I didn\u2019t know until later he\u2019d left me the money.\u201d It takes me a second, but then the rest of his words sink in and then I\u2019m angry with Sloan as well, the only thing to come out of our three hour talk is that Caleb went to the bank? That\u2019s pretty cold. Everyone around me is just full of surprises lately.</p><p>\u201cRafiq, Miss Ruiz. When did you meet him?\u201d Reed has apparently decided to forgo the imposing environment of the craft room and interrogate me in my room. Fine with me.</p><p>\u201cHe was there when we got to Tuxtepec,\u201d I whisper. This isn\u2019t a part of the story I want to tell, but I know it\u2019s what I have to do. The truth is \u2013 I want Reed to make it to that auction. I want him to round up those bastards and free those slaves. I owe it to them. I owe it to myself. I owe it to Caleb. \u201cHe\u2019d been waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>Reed and I are silent for a moment. He pulls a recorder out of his jacket pocket, presses the record button and puts it down on the bed. \u201cIt\u2019ll help me go through your statement later. I know this is hard, Miss Ruiz. I also know, you think I want to make it that way, but I don\u2019t. I just want to do my job and make these people pay for what they\u2019ve done, to you, and to so many other women and children. There are children there too...did you know that?\u201d I shake my head. I hate him for putting that thought in my head. I can\u2019t stand the thought of a child suffering. No more jokes or banter. Reed quietly lifts his briefcase and sets it on the ground before he sits down.</p><p>I clear my throat and lick my lips. This is where the real story begins.</p><p>I don\u2019t know exactly what time it was when we arrived, but the sun had set not too long before. Caleb and I hadn\u2019t done much talking on the way. I didn\u2019t really have anything to say to him that wouldn\u2019t result in him punishing me.</p><p>My heart pounded a sharp tattoo in my chest as we made our way down the seemingly endless driveway. The person who owned this house definitely had a lot of money and demanded a lot of privacy. Large trees hid our destination, but I could see the glow of lights in the distance. Soon. Soon, I would lose everything that was ever important to me.</p><p>I berated myself for not making more attempts to escape, even if I could barely walk, let alone run. Still, even if I died in the process, I felt like I should have tried again. Death had to be better than what I had coming. I knew once he got me inside that house I would be a sex slave for the rest of my life. I know Caleb said two years, but I just didn\u2019t have any faith in that. How could I?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Kitten. I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you. Obey and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Caleb\u2019s words were supposed to soothe me, but his tone was somewhat deadpan. It seemed not even he, believed what he said.</p><p>I wrapped my arms tighter around myself and closed my eyes to try and find my bearing. I could do this, I kept telling myself. I could survive. I could get well enough to escape. I couldn\u2019t lose hope. Someone would come for me.</p><p>Abruptly, the truck stopped and a man wearing a tuxedo asked Caleb for his invitation. I was tempted to shout for help, but something told me the man knew exactly why I was being brought here and the last thing I needed was to prove to Caleb he\u2019d been right about me. I would try to escape at the first opportunity. It was true, but he didn\u2019t need to have that kind of certainty.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an invitation, but I was invited: Caleb.\u201d</p><p>His name, that\u2019s all it took. The man waved us on and a little further up the driveway Caleb stopped the vehicle, came around to my door and gripping me by the arm, pulled me slowly up the walkway while someone else took the truck.</p><p>\u201cI can walk!\u201d I shrugged out of Caleb\u2019s grasp, ignoring the pain in my shoulder. I was sobbing, completely unable to stop. I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening.</p><p>You\u2019re going to die in there. Stop marching to your own f**king doom!</p><p>I stopped walking. \u201cCaleb. Please, please don\u2019t make me go in there. Please. Please!\u201d I turned to run, but Caleb\u2019s arms surrounded me before I managed to take my first step. I struggled and pain radiated from every part of my body, but especially my shoulder.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s hand covered my mouth as he pressed his body against my back and held me immobile. \u201cKitten, don\u2019t you dare!\u201d he half whispered, half growled into my ear. \u201cI warned you not to use my name. I warned you not to run from me. You are going inside one way or another and there is nothing you can do about it. Accept it. Breathe and accept it.\u201d</p><p>I whimpered and sobbed behind his hand, but I had to admit being held by him was slowly bringing me back toward center. My panic was palpable, literally thrumming and pulsing in my veins, but Caleb\u2019s arms were strong. Caleb was solid. My muscles strained and the pain was approaching unbearable. I willed myself to relax my body in degrees and I noticed Caleb\u2019s fingers also relaxed.</p><p>He slowly withdrew his hand from my mouth. I gasped for breath and sobbed. \u201cShh.\u201d He stroked my hair as he continued to hold me up. \u201cI know it\u2019s terrifying. I know you\u2019re scared. I\u2019m trying to make this as simple as I can, but you cannot disobey me. If anyone believes I am not your master.... It will be bad, Kitten. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I gripped Caleb\u2019s arm, wrapped around my midsection. Don\u2019t leave me, I silently screamed. Don\u2019t leave me. I nodded slowly and let Caleb\u2019s touch comfort me and reassure me he wouldn\u2019t let anyone hurt me. So long as I obeyed Caleb, I was his and no one could hurt me. No one, but Caleb.</p> <p>We walked the rest of the way in silence, but Caleb let me hold his hand. I knew he\u2019d eventually punish me for my outburst, but that was later. At the moment, his anger was tempered and his hand was warm and strong against mine. Caleb was finished comforting me the moment we reached the large wooden door of the enormous estate. My entire body trembled, but I kept my head down and tried to breathe. My safety was assured, so long as my obedience could be expected. It could be a lie, but doubt was something my fragile psyche could ill afford.</p><p>Caleb rang the bell and after a few seconds, there was a metal clang and the door creaked open. \u201cBuenas tardes, Se\u00f1or....\u201d</p><p>I tuned out while Caleb and the man who answered the door talked. In the place of their conversation, I heard a high-pitched screech. I felt dizzy, too, but somewhere in my head, I knew it was only my panic and adrenaline doing this to me. I forced air in and out of my lungs at a steady pace, willing myself not to hyperventilate.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s hand at the small of my back urged me forward and somehow I did it: I took that first step toward my own annihilation. Then I took another and another, my eyes watched my feet as they continued to carry me.</p><p>Music played in the background as we walked and soon I couldn\u2019t help but notice the place looked like a lavish hotel. The floors were made of marble, and use of rich, wine colored carpets was also prevalent. I kept close to Caleb, especially since he didn\u2019t discourage it. Suddenly, I heard a loud slap, followed by a woman\u2019s whimper of distress from the left. My eyes followed the sound past the man in front of us and landed on the scene in the adjoining room.</p><p>A crowd of finely dressed men, and even some women, was loosely gathered to watch as another man in a white tuxedo held a naked woman over his lap. Her black hair was swept to the side, her pain-stricken face clearly visible. Her body seemed graceful, even in its debased position. A glaring red hand print stood out prominently against her pale white skin. The man stroked her spine and she undulated, lifting her behind higher into the air as if begging the man to strike her again. I looked away when he did and the woman once again whimpered, but did not scream.</p><p>Is that the kind of thing Caleb expects from me? I knew the answer. I also knew I would fail at the task miserably. No matter how many times Caleb had spanked me I always screamed and begged for him to stop, even as I surrendered to the orgasms he gave me.</p><p>\u201cThere is someone here to see you. I am taking you to him now,\u201d said our chaperone.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s fingers twitched against my spine and I felt a corresponding shock of pure panic. \u201cIs it the master of the house? I\u2019ve been eager to meet him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The chaperone kept walking as he answered, \u201cNo, Sir. The master of the house is Felipe Villanueva. We passed him in the den with his slave, Celia. The se\u00f1or often has guests; he enjoys the attention.\u201d</p><p>Another slave. Another woman being held against her will in this same house. It makes me sick. That poor woman, being humiliated in front of all those strangers and knowing none of them will help her.</p><p>Caleb stopped and I jumped when his hand pushed me forward. Our eyes met. His blue eyes were cold and they hid something very dark. I did not want to know what he was thinking. I forced myself to keep going.</p><p>The music and the sound of the other guests slowly drifted away with each twist and turn we took into the labyrinth. Unfortunately, they were drowned out by the sound of a woman screaming. I couldn\u2019t help but start crying then. I found Caleb\u2019s arm and gripped it with both arms, wrapping my body around it. I looked up to see the chaperone slide two doors apart and the screaming only got louder. The man and Caleb exchanged a short nod and then the man left. Caleb dragged me inside as he walked.</p> <p>Caleb stopped after a few steps and I could feel the way his body tensed. Something had startled him. The woman was still screaming.</p><p>I looked up and the sight in front of me finally forced me to faint. Nancy, the girl that had assisted in my attempted rape, the one who had watched while those men held me down and tried to go at me from both ends. The one that had stood by while they punched, slapped, and kicked me! She was the one doing all the screaming. She was naked and tied face down onto some kind of wooden horse while an Arab looking man rammed himself into her over and over.</p><p>When I regained consciousness, I realized Nancy wasn\u2019t screaming any more. I was lying on a burgundy leather sofa and Caleb\u2019s angry face was looking down on me. He said nothing as he lifted a glass of water to my lips. I didn\u2019t even think of speaking. I\u2019d seen what could happen if Caleb left my side and I was determined to endear myself to him.</p><p>Suddenly, a man\u2019s voice broke the silence. He spoke a language I didn\u2019t understand. It was the same fast, clipped speech I recognized as being similar to Jair\u2019s. He and Caleb\u2019s exchange was heated and forceful. The other man laughed at Caleb. I dared not look in the direction of that voice.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s brow furrowed, and his eyes focused above and behind me, \u201cShe\u2019s scared. I hardly see how terrifying her further will serve anyone\u2019s purpose.</p> <p>The man let out an eerie chuckle, \u201cEnglish, Khoya? Do you want her to understand our conversation?\u201d His words were thickly accented, but understandable. \u201cShe should be afraid. After the chase she led you on and the trouble she has caused, she obviously wasn\u2019t terrified enough to begin with. Jair mentioned you\u2019ve been soft with her,\u201d said the man.</p><p>I could tell the man had to be someone with a lot of power. I couldn\u2019t imagine Caleb would let anyone speak to him that way.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s voice rose and he rattled off a bunch of words in another language I didn\u2019t understand; Arabic, I thought. If I had to guess, I would say he was giving the other man a piece of his mind. I sank into the couch and tried to become invisible as the two of them went back and forth.</p><p>Finally, Caleb said, \u201cEnough! Kitten, get down on the floor in your rest position.\u201d Though terrified, I didn\u2019t think twice about obeying and quickly found myself on the floor at Caleb\u2019s feet with my legs open and my hands on my thighs, head bowed, just as asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to look at her. Come here...,\u201d he chuckled again, \u201cKitten.\u201d</p><p>I whimpered and shook, but I couldn\u2019t make myself move. I inclined toward Caleb\u2019s leg, cowering and begging as much as I could without speaking or breaking my position. He had promised to protect me. I hoped he would, now.</p> <p>The man tsked, and I could almost feel Caleb\u2019s anger radiating off of him, but I didn\u2019t know whom the anger was directed toward. It didn\u2019t take long to figure out. Caleb\u2019s hand pushed my head away and he left my side.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Caleb said.</p><p>He stood next to the Arab-looking man. The man had put his clothes back on and I was somewhat surprised to see him in a dark, finely cut suit. His shirt was unbuttoned some of the way, exposing some of his deeply brown, and slightly sweaty skin. He was a few inches shorter than Caleb, but still tall by my standard. He was older than Caleb as well, perhaps in his forties. His eyes were dead and dark. They seemed to be rimmed in kohl but I could tell they weren\u2019t. It was an attribute associated with Middle Eastern men to have such long, thick, and dark lashes. However, I was not attracted to him in the least. He was a monster.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d said Caleb and I knew exactly what he wanted. It took quite a bit of effort on my part, but somehow I managed to crawl toward him without using my injured shoulder. In the process I saw Nancy was out cold in the corner, still strapped down, but with a gag in her mouth. I shuddered. I obviously didn\u2019t give two f**ks about Nancy, but no one deserved that.</p><p>More words were exchanged in Arabic before the strange man in front of me addressed me, \u201cLeet sawm k\u2019leet sue,\u201d he said.</p><p>I looked toward Caleb who repeated the command with some exasperation. With tears flooding my eyes, I lied back and opened my legs toward the pair, relieved I was wearing clothing. That was, until the man reached down and flipped my skirt up over my knees. Losing all composure, I flipped the skirt back down and struggled to move away.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are!\u201d yelled Caleb and I was helpless against accepting the command. He approached me at a fast clip and pushed me to the ground. Within seconds, I lay in the appropriate position with my most intimate parts displayed for this stranger. Betrayal burned hotly in my chest, but a voice in my head bade me to be smart and avoid confrontation. No one had hurt me \u2013 not yet and until then, Caleb still kept his promise.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hardly been broken. I\u2019ve had more obedient hounds!\u201d</p> <p>Caleb\u2019s eyes narrowed in my direction. He was embarrassed in front of this man on my account. I knew that now. I knew who the man must be. Rafiq, my mind offered. This was the man Caleb owed and he was the reason Caleb planned to sell me.</p><p>\u201cLye zhaash chee!\u201d ordered Caleb and once again I did as he asked. I rolled over and lifted my ass into the air, sobbing into the carpet as I struggled to demean myself fast enough.</p><p>Caleb and Rafiq spoke more Arabic as they ignored my sobbing and took stock of me. Caleb\u2019s hand traveled my body, exposing parts of me along the way. One of his hands played along my spine, trying to soothe me as the other trailed up the back of my thighs and palmed each of my ass cheeks in turn. It was almost as though Caleb were trying to convince Rafiq of something. I hoped it would end in my favor, but I had my doubts.</p><p>Finally, Rafiq let out a resigned sigh. \u201cFine, Khoya. Perhaps when she is healed and trained properly, I will see her as you do. For the moment, I am not so impressed.\u201d</p><p>Caleb urged me back into my rest position and put my clothing to rights with clipped and jerky movements that made me want to cringe. Despite my relief, I knew I\u2019d be paying for Caleb\u2019s embarrassment one way or another and soon.</p><p>A groan from the corner brought our collective attention back to Nancy. Rafiq laughed, \u201cNow this one, Khoya. This one is a whore. She\u2019s been had by almost everyone, but she continues to come no matter how brutally she is taken, or how many times. It would be a pity to kill her, but of course, the choice is yours. I would never deprive you of your blessed revenge.\u201d He walked over to Nancy and cut her loose.</p><p>She screamed as he lifted her and I cringed when I saw blood and se**n run down both of her legs as he forced her to walk toward us while he led her by her hair. It was my fault she was here. Ironically, I was glad she had been so cruel to me and had participated in my torture. Otherwise I would be beside myself for what had been done to her. It was difficult to stomach as it was. I couldn\u2019t imagine if this had been her penance for trying to help me.</p><p>Nancy collapsed when Rafiq threw her in front of me. She cried and whimpered, but what terrified me most was the way her hands reached out for me, \u201cHelp me,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cplease, help me.\u201d</p><p>I was frozen for a few seconds, but then I grabbed her hands and bent her fingers until she let me go. I didn\u2019t want any part in this. I scooted back and dared a glance up at Caleb.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your decision, Kitten. I don\u2019t know what happened between you. I don\u2019t know what role she played, but if you want her punished, if you want her dead, say the words and I\u2019ll see to it,\u201d Caleb said. He was deadly serious. I could see it in his eyes and I knew what he wanted me to say. He wanted me to order her death.</p><p>Broken sobs erupted from Nancy and surprisingly...from me. \u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d I wailed over Nancy. \u201cI can\u2019t do that! She\u2019s awful. She helped them. She held me down,\u201d I sobbed. \u201cBut I can\u2019t kill her. I\u2019m not a f**king murderer!\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s face was grave as I yelled the word murderer. He lunged forward and I flinched, but Nancy was his target. He lifted her head roughly, craning it in my direction. With his eyes fixed on me he whispered in Nancy\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she yelled, \u201cAnything...just don\u2019t kill me,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>Caleb let go of Nancy\u2019s head like he\u2019d just touched a piece of shit with his bare hand. \u201cYou hear that?\u201d He pointed his finger at me, \u201cShe just said she\u2019d kill you herself if we let her live instead. Is that the kind of person you want to spare?!?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head literally vibrated from the strength in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I sobbed, \u201cI can\u2019t, Caleb. I won\u2019t. Please, please don\u2019t do this. Not for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb?\u201d said Rafiq softly, his face twisting and another torrent of clipped Arabic followed.</p><p>Horrified, I realized what I\u2019d done. \u201cMaster\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d I pleaded, \u201cI know you\u2019re my master. Please forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me.\u201d I repeated the words as I rocked back and forth.</p> <p>Without warning, Caleb hoisted me to my feet, completely unconcerned with the pain it caused me. More Arabic was spoken and then he led me out of the room and away from Nancy and her belligerent screams.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>At Rafiq\u2019s request, Caleb led Kitten back to the party. It was not something he wanted to do, but in the unfamiliar space of the grandiose home of Rafiq\u2019s \u2018friend\u2019, he had no choice but to follow the butler in the direction of the other guests. Anger toward Rafiq ran rife through his thoughts and he needed time to process everything he was feeling. Why was Rafiq at the mansion and why would he deliberately ambush Caleb? It didn\u2019t make sense, except when Caleb considered the way Rafiq and Jair had been conspiring behind his back. He was tempted to count the incident as a betrayal, but the word was perhaps too strong, given all Rafiq had done for him in the past.</p><p>Kitten, also, had disappointed him. He had warned her about being obedient, warned her about what it might mean if she were found lacking in front Rafiq and the others, and still, she had humiliated him. Even now, her hand continued to search out his, seeking comfort in the most pedestrian fashion. She refused to stop weeping since she\u2019d seen the blonde woman.</p><p>Internally, Caleb flinched but he wasn\u2019t sure why. The blonde had surely deserved everything that had happened to her. He was certain now she had played a role in what happened to Kitten. She deserved no less than the fate she wished to impose.</p> <p>The woman had been beaten severely. Her body was littered with whip marks and bites, her throat was bruised and her eyes were bloodshot from the oxygen she had obviously been deprived. Rafiq mentioned she had been raped, roughly, and repeatedly. Tortured. Yet, despite feeling that she had had it coming, Caleb took issue with violent rape. He could not get the image of blood and se**n running down her thighs out of his mind fast enough to suit him. Finally, that his mentor had participated was difficult to accept.</p><p>He\u2019d meant to give Kitten a gift, one that meant everything to Caleb: vengeance. Caleb would have done anything to go back in time and see to Narweh\u2019s end in the slowest, most painfully degrading way possible, but the time had passed. Narweh was dead and Caleb had to live with the knowledge that even in the end, Narweh had never begged for his life or offered penance for what he\u2019d done to Caleb. It was a slap in the face that Kitten would not only forgo such an opportunity to get back at her tormentor, but also look on Caleb as some sort of monster for suggesting it. It wasn\u2019t as though he expected her to watch!</p><p>But here, now, especially so close to his objective, he could not allow himself to show weakness, especially where Kitten was involved. This time was very critical and Rafiq would be watching his every move, as expected. They had been partners for twelve years, working toward the singular goal of ruining Vladek Rostrovich\u2019s life in every conceivable way. It was a goal that had long ago cost both of them their proverbial soul\u2019s. Men had died. Women had died. And Caleb had killed. All to ensure their revenge would be carried out one day. Finally, their sights were set on their target and Caleb seemed to be suffering from some absurd crisis of conscience. One silly girl was trying to make him question everything he and Rafiq had worked so hard to achieve. It was absolutely asinine when Caleb put it in perspective. Kitten might not be one for vengeance, but Caleb most certainly was.</p><p>Caleb kept an eye on the butler\u2019s back as they took the seemingly endless number of twists and turns that would lead them to the others. He had no idea what the evening would entail, but his hackles were already up and he would have no pity for the next person who decided to trifle with him, even the sniveling girl next to him. Caleb could scarcely repress a snort of derision as he recalled the way Kitten had spat the word murderer in his direction. Yes, he was a murderer. He reminded himself he could no longer afford to be soft with her. No more leniency or favors. She would have to learn, right now, that mercy ended with him.</p><p>The murmur of loud voices finally reached Caleb\u2019s ears and he was relieved to know he wouldn\u2019t have to listen to Kitten\u2019s sobs echo around him much longer. At last, they reached the other guests and the butler asked Caleb to wait while he let the master of the house know they were joining the festivities.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t know a lot about Felipe Villanueva, other than the fact Rafiq obviously trusted him. Rafiq had told him they had come to know each other in the years after the coup in Pakistan when Rafiq\u2019s general had taken power. They were not, by Rafiq\u2019s own admission, very close, but his mentor was meticulous when it came to whom he decided to trust. Caleb didn\u2019t need any higher recommendation. He also, had no other choice either.</p> <p>Kitten, once again losing her composure, pressed herself to Caleb\u2019s back and wrapped her arms around him from behind. Annoyed, he pressed his fingers into the insides of her wrists until she released him. \u201cDo not embarrass me in front of these people again or I will be forced to make an example of you. What did I ask you to do when you\u2019re unsure of what is expected?\u201d</p><p>Kitten sobbed, rubbing her wrists, but had enough sense to get into her rest position. Caleb was momentarily satisfied when she was able to take slow breaths without drawing attention to herself.</p><p>He stroked the top of her head and spoke in a whisper only the two of them would be able to hear, \u201cGood girl, Kitten. Obey me and I\u2019ll continue to see to your safety.\u201d He felt her nod beneath his hand. He couldn\u2019t wait to be done with this day, even as he dreaded what the next might bring.</p><p>A Mexican man in his late forties, with dark hair, green eyes, and an impressive beard, made his way toward Caleb and Kitten. He was dressed in an outlandish white suit and his demeanor was vastly different from those around them. From the general description Rafiq had given him, Caleb knew it had to be Felipe. Only the owner of an estate such as the one they were currently occupying would dare wear such an ostentatious suit to an extravagant party. Caleb, in ill-fitting jeans and t-shirt, was vastly underdressed and he was slightly self-conscious at his disheveled appearance. He would have liked to meet the man on equal footing.</p><p>\u201cBueno! You must be Mister C,\u201d the man says, his tone formal but light. \u201cMister R has told me very good things about you. I am Felipe. Welcome to my home.\u201d</p><p>Felipe\u2019s accent was thick, but his words remained clear enough to understand. Caleb extended his right hand only after Felipe had offered his right hand first. They shook hands firmly. Rafiq had long ago taught Caleb the importance of never offering to shake hands first, or being the first man to enter a room. It established a subtle, but important power dynamic between two people meeting for the first time.</p><p>\u201cBuenas noches,\u201d Caleb offered in greeting. He slowly drew his hand away.</p><p>\u201cBuenas noches,\u201d Felipe replied. His face was strangely jovial and kind. Something Caleb would not expect from a friend of Rafiq\u2019s. However, appearances could be deceiving as Caleb well knew and he was in no rush to make judgments. Felipe\u2019s eyes darted down to Kitten and his smile became lecherous. \u201cPlease, use English. I like to practice whenever it is possible. You must like to practice as well. Where is your accent from, I cannot place it?\u201d</p> <p>Caleb tensed, \u201cI\u2019ve no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Felipe laughed and continued, \u201cIs this her? The girl you have been chasing all over Mexico?\u201d He laughed, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like so much trouble. Then again, neither did my little Celia, and she is a handful, that one.\u201d He laughed again, but there was a certain twinkle in his eye.</p><p>Caleb knew Felipe was very happy with his little Celia. Caleb could only hope little, did not translate into young. Even he had his limits and Rafiq damn well knew them. Then again, he had just walked in on Rafiq committing a rape.</p><p>Caleb forced himself to smile. \u201cYes, this is Kitten. I apologize for the way we are dressed. It was not by choice.\u201d</p><p>Felipe\u2019s expression was inquisitive, but Caleb offered no more information. After a few seconds, Felipe continued the conversation. \u201cHer face...your doing?\u201d</p><p>Caleb was realizing that Felipe\u2019s sense of etiquette was less than conservative, even familiar which he didn\u2019t approve of at all. He was rather insulted at the man\u2019s insinuation, but also at the audacity of this stranger to ask him such a question. Even if the house belonged to Felipe, as guests, Caleb expected a little more. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered coldly. \u201cBut I dealt with them.\u201d</p><p>Felipe smiled surreptitiously and nodded his approval. \u201cThe other slaves are appropriately undressed according to their owner\u2019s wishes.\u201d Caleb smiled stiffly, finding Felipe\u2019s unchecked mirth, and this conversation, somewhat grating. \u201cOne of them has a tail! Poor girl has been begging to have it removed, but Mr. B thinks it is too much fun. I have to agree.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cIt is not my place, even if I am the host, to tell you how your Kitten should be dressed, but perhaps it would help you both settle in if she were out of those clothes?\u201d His eyes once again landed on Kitten, surprisingly subdued. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caleb\u2019s ire was high, but he tried to remain respectful in his dissenting opinion. \u201cWe are tired. Also, the girl has been beaten very badly, as you can see. She isn\u2019t ready yet, perhaps another time.\u201d</p><p>Felipe\u2019s disappointment was obvious, \u201cAs you say. Please join us and have some appetizers with wine. I am not sure if Mr. R mentioned it, but I have been making use of the boy that was brought here. I hope you do not mind, but he seemed more...sensitive than the woman he was brought with. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt heat rush down his spine. Of course, he f**king minded. They were supposed to be his hostages, not a damn party favor for Rafiq, Felipe, or anyone else who wanted to have a go at them. However, Kitten seemed lacking in her thirst for revenge and he\u2019d shed enough blood to last him a while, so why the hell should he care? \u201cConsider him a gift. I only hope he\u2019s worthy of being kept in such luxury.\u201d Caleb tried to keep the sarcasm from his voice and only marginally succeeded.</p><p>Felipe smirked. The man was no one\u2019s fool. \u201cYou are very kind Mr. C. Please consider me your friend.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb nodded once as he followed Felipe past his curious guests and toward a set of red, velvet chairs in the corner.</p><p>\u201cSo you can see, but keep your privacy,\u201d Felipe gestured toward the chairs.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Caleb offered as humbly as possible, \u201cI\u2019m Caleb. Kitten is painfully aware of my name, so the formality is not necessary on my account.\u201d Caleb had no desire to be called Mister all night.</p><p>Felipe looked down at Kitten and smiled. \u201cAs you wish, Mr. Caleb,\u201d he said and then stepped away to attend to his other guests.</p><p>Caleb took a seat in one of the velvet chairs and stroked Kitten\u2019s hair when she quietly took her place next to him on the floor. She had followed him through the crowd on her hand and knees, carefully guarding her shoulder. Caleb sighed deeply as he stroked her hair, comforting them both. He didn\u2019t want things to be so complicated, but the time for wants had passed.</p> <p>Abruptly, Caleb heard the tinkling of a bell and a petite Asian girl with raven hair and almond shaped eyes commanded his attention. She crawled very slowly on her hands and knees, but a cursory examination revealed the need for her hesitant movements. The tinkling sound came from the tiny bell attached to the leather collar she wore. In addition to the collar, she wore a silver serving tray on her back, strapped across her midsection, but allowing access to her otherwise naked body. On the tray, tall, thin wine glasses were half filled with white wine.</p><p>Caleb knew the game. If she spilled her tray of drinks, she would draw the collective attention of the guests and her master would punish her for their amusement. It was wicked, but relatively benign as far as games went. The young woman\u2019s master didn\u2019t appear to be predisposed to violence. The girl\u2019s tawny skin was pristine.</p><p>Caleb looked at Kitten who seemed transfixed by the sight of the woman. Her slender hands were bawled into tight fists and her face appeared flushed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking, Pet?\u201d Caleb asked. It was the first moment they had to themselves and he was somewhat surprised at how much he enjoyed being in Kitten\u2019s sole company. He smiled gently when her big, puffy, eyes shyly met his.</p><p>Her lips trembled from her effort to keep fresh sobs from escaping. Caleb sighed. So much for a moment of peace. He pulled his fingers away from Kitten and stood up to get a glass of wine from the tray.</p><p>The girl was deathly still as he reached for the glass. Her lips were slightly open, allowing for slow and shallow breaths. Caleb did the girl a favor and carefully selected a glass that wouldn\u2019t disrupt her balance and returned to Kitten who immediately rubbed her head in supplication against his knee.</p> <p>\u201cScared I would leave you?\u201d he taunted.</p><p>Kitten nodded against his knee.</p><p>He was still angry from their showing with Rafiq earlier but it was directed mostly inward. He shouldn\u2019t let Kitten get to him. \u201cIt would be no less than you deserve.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered and pressed even closer.</p><p>Caleb knew he should correct her behavior, but he opted to reward the fact she wasn\u2019t crying. He was also oddly pleased that while she did not respond to Rafiq, or his orders, she had attempted to follow all of Caleb\u2019s. To varying degrees of success, he mused. He reached into his pocket and took two vicodin from the bottle he kept there. He was out of morphine and Kitten still had a lot of pain.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d he said. He offered her a smile when she immediately complied. He knew she was scared. He had no doubts it was the only reason she obeyed him, but having her yield was still incredibly arousing. He put the pills in her mouth and lifted the wine glass for her to drink. He watched the long graceful slope of her throat as she lifted her head to swallow greedily until the glass was empty. His c**k stirred.</p><p>Kitten\u2019s chocolate colored eyes looked on him in gratitude and supplication. She could say so many things with her eyes. All of her emotions were there for him to see. If she was an actress, she was a very good one.</p><p>Or perhaps you only see what you\u2019d like to see. Caleb\u2019s brow furrowed slightly and he noticed Kitten instantly returned her stare to her thighs. Perhaps Caleb also said things with his eyes. He needed to stop that. Caleb looked up just as Rafiq made his way over and sat in the seat next to him.</p> <p>\u201cI put the whore down,\u201d Rafiq said in Arabic.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Caleb was careful not to telegraph his mild surprise.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, please. We are guests here. I put her down in the cellar... to sleep.\u201d Rafiq\u2019s tone was meant to poke fun at Caleb.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t see the humor. He nodded and let the subject drop. \u201cHow much longer is this going to last? I want to get out of these ridiculous clothes. You deliberately didn\u2019t tell me you were here. Furthermore, you didn\u2019t mention there would be so many people bearing witness to our crimes. Yet, I\u2019m the sloppy one.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq laughed and smacked Caleb on the back of the shoulder. \u201cAh, Khoya. It\u2019s always betrayal with you. Even as a boy, you had to have things on your own terms. Do you remember the first time I took you to a brothel? You\u2019d never been with a woman, but you would not be content with just any woman. It had to be the \u2018perfect\u2019 woman! Then what happened, Khoya? I\u2019ll tell you: you lost control and finished in less than a minute!\u201d Rafiq laughed so hard, he shook Caleb\u2019s shoulder as he laughed.</p><p>He loathed that story and the way Rafiq took such enjoyment in its telling. He did not like being made fun of, even by someone he considered a friend, a brother, and most importantly, an ally. Caleb felt his face warming in equal parts anger and embarrassment. \u201cDamn you, Rafiq! If you want to reminisce with someone, why don\u2019t you find your friend, Jair? I\u2019m sure you\u2019d enjoy his company much better.\u201d Caleb shrugged off Rafiq\u2019s hand.</p><p>Rafiq wiped tears from the corners of his eyes as he slowly brought his laughter to a winding halt. \u201cSuch a child, Caleb. Jair is a source of information when you are less forthcoming. I know you well, Khoya, and I would be a fool to think you tell me everything. Besides, I wanted to see this girl you\u2019ve selected for Vladek. I want to be sure she\u2019s perfect for the task. Frankly, as of this moment, I am unconvinced.\u201d</p><p>Caleb drove his anger inward; absently, he reached out to stroke Kitten\u2019s hair. \u201cI take offense, Rafiq. I chose Kitten myself and just as in your story: I\u2019m content with my choice. Did it ever occur to you that a minute in that whore\u2019s arms was all I needed?\u201d Caleb finally relented and smiled, \u201cShe said it was perfect.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq chuckled, and Caleb couldn\u2019t help but laugh with him. They\u2019d known each other for a very long time. Rafiq was the only person who really knew Caleb, and despite their odd and often tense relationship, Caleb had to admit it was good to laugh with him again. It had been a long time since they\u2019d seen one another and their phone calls had been mainly business.</p><p>Caleb relaxed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was the best minute of her life, Khoya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Caleb smirked. He was sure Rafiq was about to offer another witticism when their host for the evening called the room to attention.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen. Tonight, I have a special treat for all of you. Thanks to some dear friends, I have recently come into possession of a glorious new slave. He is raw and unbroken, but I am sure you can appreciate the novelty of seeing one so inexperienced.\u201d He chuckled, \u201cAlas, I have given the pleasure of mastering him to my long-time slave: Celia.\u201d</p><p>A soft murmur of approval and applause rippled through the room. Caleb glanced at Rafiq who seemed amused by Felipe\u2019s antics. For Caleb\u2019s part, he was somewhat reticent given Kitten\u2019s reaction to seeing the blonde girl. He braced himself for whatever might come next. It was too late to leave the room.</p><p>\u201cMy Celia hails from Spain, and her English is very poor. I will be translating on her behalf and assisting. I hope you enjoy.\u201d Felipe waived his hand and a door opened, revealing Celia, dressed in a tight, white leather corset, with matching stockings and shoes.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s pants seemed tighter. Celia was a quintessential Spanish beauty. Her hair was jet black and her eyes were so dark, it would be easy for anyone to get lost in them. Her mouth had been painted a deep red to match the flower in her hair. Her skin was a milky expanse that would surely show every mark laid on it. Celia\u2019s br**sts were bare in the corset and her tiny br**sts were pale white against the deep raspberry color of her pebbled ni**les. Beneath the corset she wore no panties, leaving her bare pink flesh open to the scrutiny of prying eyes. She had been spanked earlier and the rounded globes of her ass showed it. Her stockings were white fishnet and created an alluring pattern as they hugged her thighs, and legs. Her leather half-boots were small and dainty with a tiny bit of lace at the top. Caleb had to give credit where it was due, Felipe\u2019s slave was glorious. He was suddenly aching to see what she could do with her whip hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Next to his chair, Caleb noticed Kitten was also transfixed by Celia. He stroked her hair, silently content when she inclined toward him and rest her head against his knee. He did not neglect to notice she kept her hands dutifully in her lap.</p><p>There was a slight commotion as two men escorted the boy Caleb knew as Kid, through the same door a few seconds later. Kid was obviously a man, no younger than eighteen, no older than twenty-three, but his face lent itself to a certain boyish quality that had obviously led to his nickname. Caleb had to agree it had been well chosen.</p><p>Kid entered the room blindfolded, bound and gagged, but otherwise naked. A cursory evaluation showed he\u2019d been beaten, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as Caleb would have thought. Almost as if someone had intervened on his behalf before the boy ended up like his girlfriend. Caleb shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Something about the boy was off-putting to Caleb.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like you a bit,\u201d said Rafiq.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Caleb said in English. Kitten\u2019s head snapped up, but came back down to Caleb\u2019s knee when he gently pressed.</p><p>Rafiq laughed, but offered no further comment.</p><p>Celia spoke her words with authority, \u201cPut him on his knees and lock his wrists to his ankles.\u201d As the men did as she asked, Felipe translated and the crowd clapped softly.</p><p>Kid noticeably trembled, but surprisingly, he did not struggle against the two men. Caleb wondered if he was naturally submissive, or if he\u2019d been brutally reminded of the punishment for disobedience. He hoped it was the former. If the boy had anything to do with Kitten\u2019s condition, Caleb would see to it he suffered: compliant or not.</p><p>\u201cTake the gag out of his mouth,\u201d Celia ordered. She sauntered over to Kid and ran her fingers through the boy\u2019s shoulder length hair, easing him into a false sense of security before she fisted the gold strands and snapped his head back.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d the boy yelled. He tried to pull out of Celia\u2019s grasp, but she held him easily in her tight little fist. Caleb was impressed.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt, Slave?\u201d She crooned. Laughter could be heard in the room.</p><p>The boy was silent. Behind his back his fists clenched and his arms strained against the restraints he wore. Celia pulled harder, wrenching his head back in such a way his throat was completely exposed. \u201cYes...Celia,\u201d he finally whispered.</p><p>Slowly, the soft music that had been playing began to fade until the room was stark in its silence. It drew the moment into sharper focus, each sound lending itself to an action. The room itself seemed to become a living thing, breathing, vibrating, and hungry. Even Caleb was not immune to the charm of one petite girl mastering someone twice her size.</p><p>\u201cVery good, Slave.\u201d Felipe\u2019s voice was scarcely above a whisper when he translated Celia\u2019s words. Caleb did not require the translation, but he could appreciate the way Felipe\u2019s voice, low, but full of authority, drew the others in as they strained to hear every word.</p><p>Celia released Kid\u2019s hair and he audibly sighed in relief. She stroked the gold strands for a few seconds. Her audience sighed in approval as they listened to Kid\u2019s ragged breaths.</p><p>Caleb had always marveled at the way a person\u2019s inability to see lowered their inhibitions sharply. Surely, Kid would be humiliated to know the sounds he was making were being heard and interpreted by a room full of people who lived for such things. Caleb was almost embarrassed for him, or perhaps he was only uncomfortable watching.</p><p>Slowly, seductively, Celia caressed the boy\u2019s face, his neck, and his shoulders. She let herself take the time to coax him into desiring her. Kid could probably smell her perfume; nearly feel her nipple make contact with his face as she stood in front of him, touching him like a lover in a room full of strangers. When Celia pulled away, the boy nearly fell on his face chasing after the smell of her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very good,\u201d Rafiq suddenly whispered in a hushed tone. Caleb nodded in assent.</p><p>Celia quietly circled the room, finally coming upon a squat, round man, wearing a cowboy hat and a bolero tie. She inclined her body toward him, rubbing her pert ni**les across his chest sinuously. The man chuckled and leaned forward in an attempt to kiss Celia, but at the last second, she reached for the flogger in the man\u2019s hand and sharply turned on her heel, slapping the man in the face with her hair.</p><p>The room erupted in laughter. \u201cDamn it, Felipe,\u201d said the man in a thick Texas drawl, \u201cYou are a lucky bastard. Go on honey, you teach that boy a lesson.\u201d</p><p>Celia smiled for the crowd and cheekily waved her flogger. \u201cPut your face on the ground and lift your ass in the air,\u201d she said.</p><p>Kid flinched and didn\u2019t move to obey, even after Felipe translated. The crowd hissed in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d said Celia.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Kid said, with a whimper. And it was most definitely, a whimper. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. No more.\u201d</p><p>Caleb shifted in his seat. He stroked Kitten\u2019s hair again and abruptly she shifted to sit between Caleb\u2019s knees, her head landed on his upper thigh and she pressed his hand to her ear.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s quite bold, Caleb. I\u2019m surprised you let her get away with things like that.\u201d Rafiq quietly scolded.</p><p>\u201cI told you Rafiq, she is not herself. Stop acting as though you\u2019ve never been lenient. I\u2019ve seen you train. Even you, have your moments.\u201d With that, the subject was momentarily dropped.</p><p>\u201cEnough? I\u2019ve barely started,\u201d simpered Celia. \u201cAnd of course...,\u201d she said as she raised the flogger. She waited a moment, letting her audience share in Kid\u2019s anticipation, before she brought the flogger down across his chest, \u201cYou forgot to say, \u2018please, Celia\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Kid groaned, biting hard on his lip as he attempted to rub his chest against his knees by doubling over.</p><p>Celia swished the flogger in the air and brought it back down across Kid\u2019s back and this time his groan was loud and open-mouthed. \u201cWill you obey me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Celia,\u201d the boy said through gritted teeth. The crowd applauded.</p><p>Caleb chuckled to himself. Yes, it was good to be surrounded by his peers. The debilitating guilt he had been feeling lately was practically non-existent. It had evaporated and was replaced with a more familiar sentiment: lust.</p><p>Kitten\u2019s head, resting on his thigh was so close to his dick he could almost feel her breath on it. He was tempted to take it out and make her suck it. He had yet to demand that particular act from her, but he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist forever. He\u2019d f**ked her ass, why not her mouth?</p><p>\u201cProve it, Slave, and lift that sexy ass in the air,\u201d Celia purred.</p><p>Caleb heard the catch in the boy\u2019s throat as he struggled to lower his head to the floor. He teetered on his knees before he finally managed the head-down-ass-up position Celia demanded. The crowd murmured; their excitement palpable.</p><p>Celia dragged the long, leather strands across the bare expanse of Kid\u2019s flesh. Naked and tightly bound, Kid had no control over what was about to happen to him. His breathing was quick and ragged and each breath moved his entire body. Celia gently flicked the tips of the flogger against Kid\u2019s balls which could be seen by those standing or sitting behind him. He hissed, writhing against the carpet as much as he could.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that, Slave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Celia.\u201d</p><p>Another tap, \u201cThat\u2019s not nice. Shall I hit you harder? Like a man?\u201d The audience was positively giddy over that idea.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, Celia. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kid pleaded.</p><p>Celia raised the flogger and whipped the boy harder, until he lost all control and sobbed into the carpet. \u201cHow was that, Slave? Hard enough?\u201d</p><p>Kid could hardly breathe, let alone speak, but he struggled to get the words out anyway, \u201cYes...Celia.\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t believe he was g*y, or even bisexual. It was a subject he spent time exploring after he left his life as a whore behind, but he had to admit Kid\u2019s submission was compelling. Celia also, was impressive in her approach.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing so well, Slave. Just a little more and I\u2019ll reward you,\u201d Celia crooned.</p><p>Caleb listened, as did everyone else in the room, to Kid\u2019s sobs catching in his chest. What Caleb didn\u2019t expect, was the answering sob coming from Kitten in his lap. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Pet?\u201d Caleb whispered. He traced the delicate shell of Kitten\u2019s ear with his finger; she shivered.</p><p>\u201cAll of these people....\u201d She trailed off.</p><p>The sound of the flogger slapping against naked flesh echoed through the room and was punctuated by Kid\u2019s pained growl. Again and again the flogger fell against Kid\u2019s increasingly warming skin. With each stroke, he lost more and more of his bearing, until at last his muscles stopped bracing for the blows and he ceased to temper the sounds pouring out of him.</p><p>Caleb should abhor the spectacle. Somewhere in his mind he knew that watching someone essentially getting whipped should disgust him, but nothing could be further from the truth. Whippings excited him in a way not much else could. His mind replayed the evening he had whipped Kitten. She had struggled, cursed at him, lashed out at him physically, but in the end she had come apart at his hands. He hadn\u2019t worried about her feelings then and he felt he shouldn\u2019t worry about her feelings now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leaned down and spoke to her, \u201cYou embarrassed me earlier. Should I strip you and return the favor in front of all these people?\u201d</p><p>Kitten muffled a cry by pressing her mouth against his leg. She shook her head fervently, \u201cNo, Master,\u201d she managed to say.</p><p>\u201cI would certainly like to see that,\u201d Rafiq interjected. \u201cAt the very least it would prove you haven\u2019t gone completely soft.\u201d Caleb spared a glance for his mentor and raised an eyebrow. \u201cAt least she\u2019s addressing you properly.\u201d</p><p>Caleb laughed, ignoring the way some of the other guests glared at him. He wasn\u2019t interrupting Celia. She was much too focused to notice him, or anyone else that wasn\u2019t the slave at her feet for that matter. \u201cI would, but I know she isn\u2019t ready. She\u2019d only cause me more embarrassment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, perhaps you should allow me,\u201d he said, in English.</p><p>Suddenly, uproar spread throughout the room and both Caleb and Rafiq craned their necks to see beyond the other guests blocking their view. Caleb gasped and unwittingly, his lengthening c**k brushed against Kitten\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Celia, the exotic little vixen, had stepped into a harness, and jutting out from her bare pu**y, stood one of the largest dildo\u2019s Caleb had ever seen. She let the crowd admire it, waiting for the noise to die down before she went any further.</p><p>Kid, still blindfolded, was rigid with apprehension. He was trying, unsuccessfully, to ball himself up tighter; as if he could crawl so deep inside himself he would disappear. All he succeeded in doing was building the collective lust of his voyeuristic audience.</p><p>\u201cPush him back. I want him sitting on his heels,\u201d Celia said and the men eased the boy back.</p><p>Kid\u2019s face was bright red and wet with tears. His chest, unlike his back, bore only one raised, red stripe from the flogger.</p><p>\u201cOpen your legs, Slave,\u201d said Celia.</p><p>Kid sobbed harshly, his chest shaking with the effort, but he complied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been such a good boy, Slave. I think you\u2019ve earned a gift.\u201d Celia trailed the flogger slowly across Kid\u2019s c**k and balls. Kid\u2019s breath stopped all together and didn\u2019t return until after Celia had made a few passes with the soft leather.</p><p>Slowly, his c**k began to stir, growing despite his shame and humiliation. Despite the fact his audience watched with bated breath for the moment Celia would unleash her dildo on him. Despite the fact he couldn\u2019t possibly know what was going to happen next.</p><p>Celia continued to coax Kid\u2019s erection, going so far as to lower herself to her knees and stroke him with her bare hand. Kid groaned as his sensitive flesh was expertly caressed. He\u2019d seemingly forgotten about the flogger, didn\u2019t know about Celia\u2019s cock, and his body swayed toward her slowly. Forward and back, following her fingers and whimpering when they didn\u2019t come back fast enough to suit him.</p><p>\u201cGreedy, slave,\u201d Celia said. \u201cI\u2019m greedy too and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve earned your present yet.\u201d She stood and Kid held his breath again. Slowly, Celia put her plump nipple to Kid\u2019s lips. It was brave, considering the boy could bite her, but Celia seemed unconcerned with such things. \u201cSuck.\u201d</p><p>Kid opened his mouth and accepted Celia\u2019s nipple. He groaned, loud and unabashed. His c**k jerked in midair. The pain seemed to be a memory to him as he latched on and suckled Celia in long, hungry pulls that had her gasping and pulling his mouth closer.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Celia yelled, and it required no translation on Felipe\u2019s part. \u201cSuck harder.\u201d</p><p>Kid obliged, only pulling his mouth away to breathe and occasionally switch br**sts, which Celia took great relish in.</p><p>Finally, the moment had arrived and she forced Kid\u2019s head away with a loud pop. Her ni**les were bright red and fat from having been sucked so hard, but she didn\u2019t seem to take notice or care. She grabbed her rubber c**k and brought it to Kid\u2019s mouth. \u201cNow, suck this.\u201d</p><p>Kid, obviously sensing something foreign, reared back and turned his head, \u201cNo, Celia. Please, no.\u201d</p><p>Celia didn\u2019t bother to respond, she raised the flogger and struck him across the chest with so much force there was a collective wince in the room. Kid tried to double over, but the men held him up.</p><p>Caleb wondered what it would be like to let a woman whip him. Aside from Rafiq, no one had dared strike him and lived after Tehran. Yes, Rafiq, had punished him in the very early years, when Caleb still needed it to remind him he had survived. It had been well over a decade, since Caleb had been on the submissive end of any encounter.</p> <p>\u201cSuck it!\u201d Celia repeated. This time, Kid opened his mouth and let Celia f**k his mouth with the enormous phallus.</p><p>The room was filled with the occasional chuckle whenever Kid choked, but even then, they were apparent in their lust. A look around the room would reveal some of the master\u2019s had decided to make use of their slaves mouths, mimicking Celia\u2019s movements and thrusting their very real cocks into the ravenous mouths of the slaves at their feet.</p><p>Caleb looked down at Kitten. She had abandoned her quest to not see or hear what was happening around her and was openly watching as others fornicated around her. Caleb reached for her hand and gently pressed it against his erection. His c**k leapt when her wide eyes darted to his. He expected her to try and snatch her hand away, but he felt her fingers tighten around him through the fabric of his pants.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to like you just fine. It must be me she doesn\u2019t care for,\u201d said Rafiq rather wryly.</p><p>\u201cUnlike some, she has taste,\u201d Caleb countered. He slowly lifted his hips and pressed deeper into Kitten\u2019s hand. He remembered the shower, the way she had eagerly wanted to please him. He wanted that again. He wanted Livvie. The thought jolted him back into the moment and he stilled Kitten\u2019s hand on his erection. She looked up at him.</p><p>Did I do something wrong? Her eyes asked. Caleb shook his head, but drew her hand away.</p><p>\u201cShy, Caleb? Really? You of all people,\u201d said Rafiq, mocking.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Caleb said, his tone pleasant.</p><p>\u201cLet him loose,\u201d Celia said and once again, drawing both him and Rafiq back to the scene in before them. As the men worked to unbind Kid, Celia shimmied out of her strap-on and seemed to brace herself.</p><p>The room was tense as Kid eagerly tried to get loose even faster. Still, once he was free of the locks, he remained on his knees and blindfolded in front of Celia. His c**k was still hard, which was impressive given the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you were good, Slave?\u201d Celia\u2019s voice had dropped to a whisper that Felipe mimicked as well as he could.</p><p>\u201cYes, Celia?\u201d replied Kid.</p><p>\u201cI agree. You were very good, for your first time. Would you like to f**k me?\u201d Kid jolted when Felipe repeated the words for him to understand and though he didn\u2019t seem capable of rendering a verbal response, the crowd witnessed his c**k bobbing up and down as it filled completely. Precome wept copiously from the tip. \u201cWell, Slave. Do you want to f**k me or not?\u201d</p><p>Kid nodded and stammered through his reply, \u201cY-y-yes, Celia.\u201d</p><p>Celia stepped in front of Kid and lifted his arms to put them around her. Kid let out a needy sound and greedily mauled the flesh offered to him. \u201cThen f**k me,\u201d Celia said.</p><p>Without further ado, Kid leapt on top of Celia, tossing her to the ground with brutish force. Celia cried out in abandon, but made no attempt to stop Kid from doing what he wanted. His hips tilted back for only a moment and then he thrust forward, savagely, into Celia\u2019s pu**y. He whimpered as he rutted against her.</p><p>Celia moaned, arching her back and spreading her legs as wide as she could, surrendering to the man pounding away on top of her. \u201c\u00a1S\u00ed, mi amor! Es todo para ti. .\u201d</p><p>Yes, my love. It\u2019s all for you.</p><p>Kid sought Celia\u2019s nipple blindly and finally pulled one into his mouth. He suckled Celia in rough, bruising pulls. His hips, moved like a piston. Indeed, the boy seemed violent in his need to come and by the way he gripped Celia, it was obvious he would fight anyone who attempted to stop him.</p><p>Finally, Kid let out a sound best reserved for a dying animal and thrust into Celia one final time. As the crowd applauded and cheered, the boy shuddered and collapsed on top of Celia.</p><p>Caleb quickly made his excuses, helped Kitten to her feet and left the room in desperate search of the butler and his room.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Matthew swallowed past the dryness in his throat. If he didn\u2019t know better, he would suspect Olivia of having some sort of telepathic ability. He sat still in the uncomfortable chair and tried not to draw attention to the raging erection he was sporting.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes were fixed on him, but her stare seemed to move through him and beyond to some place he couldn\u2019t see. Her eyes were brimmed with tears, but for whatever reason, Matthew doubted they had much to do with the story. In fact, she had told it with some fondness which he found disturbing given the situation.</p><p>Unbidden, the image of a young woman, dressed in white leather and wearing an enormous dildo flashed into his mind and right on its heels, he wondered what it might be like to be forced to suck it in front of a room full of strangers. Matthew\u2019s erection throbbed angrily and not for the first time, he was ashamed. He sighed, disappointed with himself, and crossed his ankle over his knee to better hide himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He clicked his pen a few times because his fingers were anxious for something to do and then he wrote down the names: \u2018Kid\u2019, Nancy, and Celia (No known last name). \u201cSo, that was the night you met, Rafiq, and Felipe. Do you know what happened to Kid or Nancy? How did they end up at the house? Did Caleb kidnap them, too?\u201d</p><p>Olivia glowered, but seemed unable to stop staring off into space long enough to direct it at him. He couldn\u2019t make sense of her feelings toward her captor, despite knowing how common it was. There just didn\u2019t seem to be anything there worth caring about as far as Matthew was concerned. However, he did acknowledge there was a lot about Olivia worth admiring. She had spent the last four months in the company of kidnappers, ra**sts, murderers, drug dealers, and human traffickers, but she\u2019d somehow maintained a certain naivety and triumphant strength that apparently, could not be stripped away from her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to them. The last time I saw them, they were both alive. Kid is probably fine; Felipe really liked him. Nancy...I don\u2019t know. Maybe she\u2019s still with Rafiq,\u201d she whispered without blinking.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright, Miss Ruiz?\u201d Matthew asked. His erection was finally starting to wane and he could focus on his questions.</p> <p>The girl finally blinked and swiped at the fat tears sliding down her cheeks as a result. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Reed. It\u2019s just...never mind.\u201d She looked up at him and tried to smile, but it was a weak effort and they both knew it.</p><p>\u201cTell me. I know I\u2019m not Sloan, but I have been around, Miss Ruiz.\u201d Matthew smiled when she finally let her smile reach her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSloan. I don\u2019t know what her deal is. She\u2019s always so nice to me, but it annoys me for some reason. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s disingenuous, but I just know there\u2019s more to her than she lets on. I mean, she works for the FBI, like you. Only, she\u2019s not like you, at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And what am I like?\u201d Matthew said.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re a jerk, Agent Reed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kind of a jerk, too, Miss Ruiz,\u201d Matthew said dryly. She laughed.</p><p>\u201cAww, that\u2019s so sweet,\u201d Olivia said, slightly mocking but she laughed again, unrestrained, almost like a girl without any problems.</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t like Sloan,\u201d he rephrased. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t like her, Reed. You\u2019re always putting words in my mouth,\u201d she admonished. \u201cDon\u2019t think I didn\u2019t notice you implied Caleb kidnapped Kid and Nancy. He couldn\u2019t have, he was with me, remember?\u201d</p><p>Matthew smiled wryly and shook his head, \u201cI didn\u2019t imply it, Miss Ruiz. I asked the question. That\u2019s my job. Also, we both know he did. Maybe he didn\u2019t do it himself, but he was there and he ordered it. Regardless, adding more kidnapping to the list of charges against him is hardly going to make a difference.\u201d Olivia was quiet for a long time after that, thinking, Matthew assumed.</p><p>\u201cYou keep talking about him like he\u2019s alive, Reed, and I told you...he\u2019s not.\u201d Her eyes were filled with unshed tears again and it was difficult for Matthew to remain unaffected by them. No matter what he thought of Caleb, Olivia obviously felt very deeply for him.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you care about him so much, Miss Ruiz?\u201d he demanded. He just didn\u2019t get it and it pissed him off, more than it should. \u201cHe was terrible to you. The things he did to you. Don\u2019t tell me you wanted those things. I can\u2019t believe you could have.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was staring off into space again, but she spoke through her tears, \u201cA lot of bad things happened to him too, Reed. His back was covered in whip marks and he told me he was very young when someone did that to him.\u201d Matthew couldn\u2019t hold back a scoff, and Olivia blinked and scowled at him. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Reed. I know the shit he did to me was awful, I f**king lived it. But I\u2019m telling you, monsters aren\u2019t born, they\u2019re made, and someone made Caleb. Someone beat him, someone did horrible things to him, and the only person who helped him, Rafiq, made him into a killer. He didn\u2019t have someone like you, or Sloan, or the goddamn FBI to help him. He had to survive all by himself and even though I can\u2019t forgive him, I understand him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to tell me he\u2019s the monster with a heart of gold?\u201d he said, disbelieving, \u201cCome on, Miss Ruiz. Really?\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed on her face. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a permanent mark on me, Reed, not one. And you don\u2019t know how many times he was there to hold me together when I was sure I was going to fall apart. He\u2019s a monster,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cI know he is. I know, and...it doesn\u2019t matter to me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Crying women left him bereft of action. They reminded him too much of his birth mother lying on the couch, shaking and begging him to find a way to score more drugs for her. He\u2019d panic at times like that, knowing if Greg came home and found her, he\u2019d beat her and then turn his rage on him. He\u2019d only been seven, but he knew how to get lost for a while. He would grab his coat, kiss his mother, promise her he\u2019d be back with her medicine and then he\u2019d leave. There was an older lady, Mrs. Kavanaugh, who lived a few blocks away. When things got bad, he would stay at her house, eating cookies and watching game shows until his mom, or Greg, came looking for him.</p><p>His mother had been a weak woman, a drug addict that cared more about being loved by an abusive man than she did her own son. Matthew had tried for years to help his mother get clean, but in the end, she couldn\u2019t stop using. One night, she was too high to defend herself, and Greg beat her to death. Matthew hadn\u2019t been home, he\u2019d been out with his friends, and when he\u2019d arrived at home he\u2019d found her: cold and still.</p><p>Matthew was thirteen and he went to live with Mrs. Kavanaugh\u2019s daughter, Margaret, and her husband, Richard Reed. Greg committed suicide in lieu of going to jail for murder, and Matthew had never gotten over the injustice of it, despite the fact his life had improved drastically after that. Margaret and Richard were his real mother and father as far as he was concerned. He tried not to think of those other people.</p><p>\u201cHorrible things happen to a lot of people, Miss Ruiz. Not everyone becomes a monster,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but the world is full of people who do. It\u2019s like those kids in Africa that get taught how to use machine guns and kill. Some of them can barely lift the guns, but they\u2019re killers. What about them, Reed? Do you hold them responsible? Would you lock them away or put them down?\u201d She wiped her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different, and you know it. The entire continent is rife with civil unrest and it\u2019s people like Muhammad Rafiq, Felipe Villanueva, and yes, even Caleb, that get those kids hooked on cocaine and then teach them how to kill. I hold those people responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the one\u2019s that grow up? What about the one\u2019s that survive long enough to become adults? Can you blame them for doing the only thing they know how?\u201d She had to stop and breathe, her anger making her shake. He could see it on her face. She wanted to hit him. \u201cDo you think that ten or twenty years from now, I\u2019m going to feel normal or be normal or have a normal life, like you?\u201d</p><p>Matthew let out an exasperated sigh, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Miss Ruiz. I don\u2019t have those kinds of answers for you. It\u2019s wrong, what happens to those kids, but it doesn\u2019t give them free license as adults to rape and murder just because they\u2019ve been doing it since they were young. Nor does it justify their actions because they had a f**ked up childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...what? Fuck \u2018em?\u201d she challenged, her eyes wild. \u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d</p><p>Matthew shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t see the comparison, Miss Ruiz. Even if I did, are you telling me if one of those kids pointed a gun at you, if one of them raped you, you\u2019d be willing to forgive them? Because I don\u2019t think I have that much compassion. Anyone who points a weapon at me is going to get brought down. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a f**king Girl Scout.\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed without humor, \u201cYou\u2019re f**king wrong, Reed. That\u2019s exactly what Caleb would say.\u201d She regarded him for a moment. \u201cYou are different from Sloan; she would never say anything like that.\u201d</p><p>Matthew shrugged, trying to find his calm. The conversation had gotten out of control, and really, it just wasn\u2019t necessary. \u201cI tell it like it is and believe me, you\u2019re not the first person to find it annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of...why would you tell Sloan I kissed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you did. Dr. Sloan would have asked and it\u2019s irrelevant to me but important for her to know.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes again, \u201cI just wanted to distract you. You wouldn\u2019t give me Caleb\u2019s f**king picture and I wanted it. Now, Sloan thinks I\u2019m some kind of sexual deviant who tries to seduce ass**le FBI agents that want to shoot Girl Scouts.\u201d</p><p>Matthew smiled in spite of himself, \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, you\u2019re joking.\u201d She stared at him, a startled, even comical expression on her face. \u201cNo one is that self-absorbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m joking. And I am that self-absorbed.\u201d They both laughed amiably, but the conversation was far from over and it was up to Matthew to bring it back around, but he wanted to give Livvie the time to get there. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered the question: Why do you care so much about Caleb?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sighed at that, her focus seemingly far away. When she spoke, her tone was soft and somewhat wistful. \u201cHe used to talk to me at night. It was almost like the dark gave us permission to be ourselves, to put aside the fact he was my kidnapper, and the man responsible for all the terrible things that happened to me during the day. But you have to understand, for all the bad Caleb did, he protected me too, in his own ways. It could have been so much worse for me without Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat night, after Celia had whipped Kid in front of everyone, Rafiq had tried to separate us. He wanted me to stay in his room and I was terrified Caleb would let it happen. I\u2019d seen what Rafiq had done to Nancy. I could still hear her screams in my ears and feel her hands grabbing for me. I didn\u2019t want to end up like her.</p><p>\u201cCaleb refused. He said I would scream for hours on end if I were separated from him. He said I was a danger to myself and Rafiq didn\u2019t know me well enough to know what I needed. He\u2019d said it all in English and the moment Rafiq reached for me I started screaming bloody murder until Caleb lifted me into his arms. I even threw in some feverish gibberish, clutching at him and begging him not to let me go. I didn\u2019t have to work hard to be panicked. I was panicked.</p><p>\u201cCaleb stroked my hair and I slowly relaxed into his arms, going so far as to \u2018faint\u2019. Maybe it was a little over the top, but it worked. Felipe had begged Caleb\u2019s forgiveness for not offering to have him shown to his room sooner and called the butler over to take us to Caleb\u2019s room.\u201d Livvie chuckled softly as she recounted the story and Matthew had to wonder if her sense of humor had always been so dark or if it was an aftereffect of her time spent in ruthless company.</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d Olivia suddenly exclaimed, \u201cI remember something. Felipe told Rafiq the boat would be arriving in four days and he asked if Rafiq would be leaving to meet it, or if he planned to stay and have someone else handle it.\u201d</p><p>Matthew leaned forward, pen poised over his notepad, \u201cHe said this in front of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought I was passed out. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s important. It was months ago, so the boat has obviously already come and gone, but I do remember it because I wondered if we were near water and if I was going to be on that f**king boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Matthew said, stating the obvious.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you didn\u2019t ask me if it happened. You told me to tell you everything I remember,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but Rafiq was gone a few days later, so I assume he went to meet the boat and whoever or whatever was on it.\u201d</p><p>Probably drugs, Matthew thought, and he made a note to look into locations near water and cross-reference them with his list of military installations in Pakistan. He would also have to call the Federal Investigation Agency in Pakistan. The FIA likely knew something; it was getting them to admit it and tell him. \u201cAnything else that might be useful?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot that I can think of right now. Besides, I was telling you about me and Caleb.\u201d</p><p>Matthew rolled his eyes. \u201cFine. It seems to be helping you remember things, but please, try to keep the sex stuff to a minimum. I really don\u2019t need to hear the blow-by-blow.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled, \u201cWas that a pun, Reed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHardly, just a poor choice of words,\u201d he acknowledged. The image he\u2019d manufactured of Celia thrusting that dildo into Kid\u2019s mouth once again assaulted him. He shook his head and it dissipated. He wished he\u2019d never heard that story. It wasn\u2019t the act he guiltily found intriguing, but the authority behind it. Matthew didn\u2019t care for weak women, but he certainly had a thing for domineering ones. And in the darkest recesses of Matthew\u2019s mind, he knew why.</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to listen? Will you at least try to see things the way I do?\u201d she requested earnestly.</p><p>Matthew\u2019s stomach did a strange flip-like thing at the sound of her begging tone. This was always the part of the job he hated. He liked solving the puzzle, putting the case facts together and tracking down the criminals, but this part, dealing with the victims and their myriad personalities and experiences, most of them tragic, he couldn\u2019t stand. He could stand Olivia more than some other people he\u2019d interviewed. Now that she wasn\u2019t so much of a basket case, she seemed made of much stronger stuff, but she was still in a strange limbo of victim and suspect.</p><p>Still. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a promise I can make, Miss Ruiz. I can promise I\u2019ll listen. I can promise I\u2019ll do my job. I can even promise to help you as much as I am able. But I can\u2019t promise you I\u2019ll ever see things the way you do.\u201d</p><p>His refusal really seemed to upset her. Olivia\u2019s shoulders slumped but she nodded for far longer than she needed to, lost in space again. When she spoke, she seemed to be talking to the room with Matthew as a set piece. Her words weren\u2019t for him and they both knew that. \u201cI figured you might say that. It makes sense I guess. It\u2019s just.... I don\u2019t think anyone is ever going to see it the way I do, Reed. No one is ever going to understand. If it ever comes out, everyone\u2019s just going to think I\u2019m crazy. That I\u2019m young and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about. That I\u2019m a victim and my feelings are all a result of my trauma. I think that\u2019s what hurts the most</p><p>\u201cI lived through all of it. I saw and felt and experienced more in one Summer than I think most people experience their entire lives, but in the end? I\u2019m just a girl who no one will ever understand. There\u2019s so much about me that will never be the same.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear about the sex stuff. I know that. I know how inappropriate it is to sit here and tell a complete stranger about people getting tied up and whipped, even f**ked in front of me. But...I have to tell someone. Someone who won\u2019t make me feel like a freak. Someone who won\u2019t analyze me like Sloan does.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t mean to make me feel like a freak, not on purpose. It\u2019s when she says I\u2019m drawn to you, because you\u2019re a strong man, like Caleb. When she says I kissed you because sex is the way I\u2019ve been conditioned to get my way, that it\u2019s all psychological, and it\u2019s all because Caleb f**ked with my head. I can\u2019t stand it. I can\u2019t have everything I feel, reduced to a textbook description that fits me, and millions of other broken idiots. More than that, I can\u2019t stand thinking that maybe...she\u2019s right.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t really love Caleb, maybe my brain made it up so I wouldn\u2019t kill myself or feel so scared and alone. Maybe I\u2019ll accept that one day and I won\u2019t be able to stop having nightmares. Maybe I\u2019ll never trust another emotion I ever have again. Who\u2019s going to love a girl like that, Reed? Who\u2019s ever going to love a freak like me?\u201d She collapsed onto her bed and rolled into a ball, crying and rocking.</p><p>Matthew\u2019s heart beat a frantic tattoo in his chest. He didn\u2019t know what to do to make her stop crying. He didn\u2019t want to touch her, that felt like the wrong thing. A hug? Not him either. He wished Sloan were here. She was the social worker. It was her job to deal with all the mushy shit. He remembered Olivia didn\u2019t care for mushy.</p><p>\u201cSomeone will love you, Miss Ruiz. Even if you\u2019re a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Reed,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>He laughed, \u201cAnd you\u2019re so charming, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass**le, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said as a matter of fact.</p><p>\u201cGod! Why are you so messed up?!?\u201d She sat up and glared.</p><p>\u201cEverybody is f**ked up and we\u2019re all freaks in our own ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d she shot back, sniffling and glaring at him. \u201cYou probably had a charmed life in suburbia. No cares. No worries. A perfect life.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a deadpan look. \u201cI was abused as a child. African militants forced me to snort gun powder and cocaine and plow villages with my Uzi. Feel sorry for me and stop whining about how no one will love you,\u201d he suggested calmly. Her shocked expression was priceless. He gave her a leveling look and softened his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re young, strong and you\u2019re an ass**le to boot. With your smarts, you\u2019re going to be just fine. Don\u2019t let anyone ever tell you different. Not even you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s expression softened and after a while she gave a little smile. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, I guess, Reed. No one\u2019s ever going to love you, but you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wry smile, \u201cThank you, Miss Ruiz. I\u2019ll remember that when you\u2019re begging for sympathy.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cCan we be done for today? I\u2019m really tired. Talking to you takes a year off my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to turn off the lights? Would the dark help you confess?\u201d he said, and he was only half joking.</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d He paused, and leveled with her. \u201cLook. We\u2019re running out of time, Miss Ruiz. We need to get to that auction and you\u2019re our best hope to rescue the others, like yourself, Nancy, Kid, Celia. All of them. I don\u2019t want you to lose sight of that. I\u2019ll listen to you, I\u2019ll even try to see things from your perspective, but at the end of the day...you\u2019re safe. Others aren\u2019t so lucky.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded, solemnly. \u201cI know, Reed. Trust me, I know. I don\u2019t want those evil bastards to get away with it either. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, Miss Ruiz. Get some sleep.\u201d Matthew stood and gathered his things, remembering to shut off the recorder and tuck it into his jacket where it couldn\u2019t get lost.</p><p>He left the hospital and decided to go back to the office for a few hours. It was still relatively early and the offices in Pakistan would be open. He had to make a few calls.</p><p>Back at the office, he got on the phone with the FIA and asked if they had any information about a slave auction happening in the next few days. As predicted, the FIA agents weren\u2019t pleased to be getting a call from the FBI, but after interweaving the standard threat-coax key words in his most polite voice, they begrudgingly said they\u2019d look into it and pass along any information.</p> <p>\u201cPlease keep an eye on the private airports for any high-profile people entering the country: billionaires, sheiks, anyone with a lot of money and power. Especially if they have any ties you know of to organized crime, including guns, drugs, and human labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell us how to do our job, Agent Reed.,\u201d said the agent on the other end. His accent was South African. \u201cWe\u2019re quite capable of gathering intelligence without the U.S. Government.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll expect a call from you boys in a couple of days?\u201d Matthew baited.</p><p>\u201cA pleasure, Agent Reed. We\u2019ll keep an eye out for Demitri Balk or anyone traveling under the name Vladek Rostrovich.\u201d The line went dead.</p><p>\u201cDickface,\u201d Matthew grumbled. He pressed down on his phone to make another call. He looked down a listing of government agencies in Pakistan and also put a call in to the office in charge of PACHTO. The Prevention and Control of Human Trafficking Ordinance had only been in place since 2002, but it was gaining steam. It was difficult to get a hold of someone who spoke English, but after a few redials he finally got in touch with a linguist who worked there.</p> <p>It was a little after eight when Matthew decided he\u2019d done all he could for the night. He gathered his belongings, including his recorder and headed for his hotel. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Olivia\u2019s story. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Celia.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d arrived at his room, set his briefcase down on the table, emptied his pockets, carefully stacked any loose change by denomination and placed them in a row by size, placed his keys, wallet and watch on the table and hung up his suit jacket, he\u2019d made up his mind to listen to the damn tape he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about. He was already so hard; he could barely sit down to remove his shoes and socks. He rushed through his process, eager to get his clothes off and touch himself.</p><p>Finally, he finished hanging his clothes and all that remained was his underwear, tented with his shameful arousal. Ordinarily, he had no problem with jerking off. However, it was the circumstances surrounding his hard-on that left him feeling guilty.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sick motherfucker,\u201d Matthew whispered, but gave in and pushed his underwear down his legs and put them in the laundry bag. He didn\u2019t bother showering, he was too needy. Instead, he pulled the bedspread down and flung himself onto the crisp cold sheets of the bed. He reached for the recorder on the nightstand and rewound it to Celia\u2019s entrance. His c**k leapt. He shut his eyes and put his hand on his hot flesh as Livvie\u2019s voice filled the room.</p><p>Matthew wasn\u2019t gentle with himself. He didn\u2019t like gentle. He grabbed his dick like it was some sort of enemy and squeezed it until it hurt. Margaret and Richard were great parents: kind, loving, and warm. They took a damaged kid whose mother had been murdered and gave him a great life, but they couldn\u2019t wipe his memories. They couldn\u2019t strip away the darkness in him. They couldn\u2019t make him stop liking this.</p><p>Matthew dragged his fingernails across his chest, sure to scratch his nipple hard enough to make him wince and buck his hips up into his fist.</p> <p>\u201cShe raised the flogger over her head and brought it down hard across Kid\u2019s chest. He cried out, doubling over, and when those men held him up, there was an angry red stripe across his chest. Kid sobbed...\u201d</p><p>Matthew imagined himself in Kid\u2019s place, ashamed the image was so arousing, so crushingly right, but Matthew had tears in his eyes because he knew it was wrong. It was wrong to listen to Olivia\u2019s voice. It was wrong to listen to Kid\u2019s misery. It was wrong. Wrong. Wrong!</p><p>Matthew came. Hard. His come spraying him across his chest, burning against the scored skin, and even that, was glorious. He panted loudly, alone in the dark, listening to Olivia\u2019s voice. His other hand, the one not covered in come, reached for the recorder and switched it off.</p><p>In the end, it didn\u2019t even matter. He was getting hard again. It had been a while since he\u2019d allowed himself to come and his dick wasn\u2019t going to be happy with a quick jerk-off session. He refused to listen to the tape again though. He refused.</p><p>He jolted out of bed and into the shower to rinse off. There was a club. There was always a club. And no matter how Matthew tried not to seek them out, he always did. He was constantly aware of where he could go to find what his subconscious demanded of him.</p><p>Out of the shower, he quickly dressed in a pair of jeans and button-up shirt. Nothing black, nothing that would suggest he was dominant. He hated when eager subs sat down next to him, thinking he\u2019d love nothing better than to put them over his knee. He always sent them away in tears, ashamed he couldn\u2019t give them what they wanted. He\u2019d tried. He\u2019d tried to be that guy. It always ended badly.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Day 10:</p> <p>Matthew woke up sore. Everything hurt. Slowly, he bent his head forward and grunted when pain shot down the back of his neck and settled in between his shoulders. He went limp and fell onto the mattress again. This was going to be more difficult than he thought.</p><p>With each passing second, more of his consciousness was regained and soon his heart picked up a frantic rhythm. He\u2019d gone out last night.</p><p>\u201cMatthew? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>Matthew groaned. No. No, no, no, nooooo. He pressed his face hard into the bed beneath him. He noticed his dick was hard. It wasn\u2019t just morning wood, either. He was remembering.</p><p>He was startled to hear a familiar voice. Her voice. \u201cFuck!\u201d he grumbled under his breath. How could he handle this? How could he explain?</p><p>Anyone else! Anyone else would have been fine. No, it\u2019d been her sitting next to him when he finally had the courage to turn on his barstool.</p><p>Her red hair was worn loose; soft waves cascaded down her back. She wore a white shirt wrapped around her waist and tied at the back. Her cle**age peeked out a little, just enough to make a man curious, but not enough to expose what she was hiding beneath her tight shirt. A black leather skirt at mid thigh and metal studded heels completed the ensemble.</p><p>Matthew\u2019s face was hot all over again, his cheeks colored with his embarrassment. Especially when he recalled the way he\u2019d tried to explain his presence.</p><p>\u201cI needed a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I understand that, believe me. I don\u2019t drink when I play, though,\u201d she said casually.</p><p>Matthew had wondered how the f**k she could be so casual. He\u2019d wondered all night actually. He knew most people thought he was cold, efficient and detached, but he had nothing on her. She\u2019d wrecked all of his carefully constructed control and she\u2019d done it without losing any of her cool.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to play. I just needed a drink,\u201d he said. His ears felt hot and he knew it would be spreading to his face and neck any minute. He wanted to leave, but she blocked his exit and stayed there, eyeing him with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cAnd you just ended up here? Forgive me, Matthew, but that\u2019s doubtful.\u201d She arched a red brow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m.... I\u2019m...,\u201d he started to say.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be shy, Matthew. I mean, I\u2019m here too, right? The only real question is: Who are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>Matthew\u2019s hips rolled and he felt the burn of his muscles protesting against the action. He\u2019d be surprised if he could sit today.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for anyone. I just \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cLying? Really? Of all the things I thought you might be, a liar didn\u2019t really cross my mind,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFuck what you thought,\u201d he countered and slammed his whiskey neat. He stood to leave, but Sloan blocked his path, trapping him between her body and the stool. She smelled sweet, like green apples. It certainly wasn\u2019t the kind of thing one expected. Not in a fetish club.</p><p>Knowing it would hurt, he braced himself and reached back to touch his ass with his fingers. Yes: there were raised welts all over his butt. He traced them with the tip of his finger, marveling at the fact there was a perfect handprint where her slender, whip-like fingers had landed. He\u2019d always wondered if the brilliant Dr. Janice Sloan would psycho analyze during sex. Now he knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rude, Matthew. You\u2019re trying to hurt my feelings. But I forgive you because I know you\u2019re embarrassed.\u201d She stepped closer, a hand on his chest urging him back onto his seat. Her hand felt hot, really hot, like it could burn a hole in his chest. Matthew relented and allowed himself to be pushed back onto the barstool.</p><p>Sloan rose up on her tip-toes and leaned over Matthew to whisper in his ear, \u201cYou\u2019re cheeks are red and your heart is beating really fast.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Matthew moaned and rubbed his ass cheek again. Yes, he\u2019d been embarrassed. He\u2019d never expected to see Sloan, dressed like a cross between the Madonna and the whore, smelling like apples and at the same time rubbing her tits against his chest. She\u2019d known what she was doing, that much was even more obvious now.</p><p>\u201cLook, Sloan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave Sloan for the office, Matthew,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cFine. What the hell do you want, Janice? You want to tell everyone you saw me here? That I\u2019m a freak? Go ahead. I don\u2019t give a f**k,\u201d he said. He whispered the words, half angry, half nervous. He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if she decided to tell people about him.</p> <p>He was still worried about that. The things he\u2019d let her do! The way he\u2019d begged her not to stop. He shook his head, trying to clear the memories, but it wasn\u2019t working, not when he was still so sore and her smell still lingered in his sheets.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a Dom.\u201d Janice shook her head, \u201cI didn\u2019t think so. I mean, you could be, you\u2019re so strong, so masculine and in control. But that\u2019s the problem. Isn\u2019t it, Matthew? It\u2019s a lot of work to be in control all the time.\u201d She raised her delicate hand and twirled her fingers in the hair at Matthew\u2019s nape. It was an intimate act, full of implications.</p><p>Ah, yes. The f**king psycho-babble. Olivia had had it right: Sloan couldn\u2019t help herself. She looked right into people and started tearing them apart. No matter that it hurt. No matter that she wasn\u2019t invited to do it. All night, she\u2019d done it to him, poked and poked and poked until he\u2019d given it up.</p><p>Janice\u2019s other hand grabbed Matthew\u2019s thigh and gently prodded. Matthew swallowed hesitantly, but then he let Janice in and she stepped between his spread thighs as if she just belonged there. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell anyone your secrets, Matthew. I keep a lot of secrets; it\u2019s my job. If you tell me to leave you alone, I will. It\u2019s just...I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Matthew croaked.</p> <p>Janice smiled against his ear and chuckled softly, \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t possibly think of anything I\u2019d enjoy more, than your sexy ass over my knee.\u201d</p><p>It was definitely sexy. Matthew had never come so hard, never begged so much. He\u2019d tried to be defiant, not caring for Sloan\u2019s invasive questions. But in the end, he wanted to come so badly, he\u2019d have done anything, said anything. Sloan made sure to take advantage. She\u2019d pulled confessions out of him that made him so ashamed he could barely breathe. She\u2019d been ruthless.</p><p>Her hand followed along the path of his thigh and turned inward to cup his balls. Matthew jumped, startled, but his hands stayed gripped to the barstool. Janice\u2019s fingernails scratched him through his jeans and he couldn\u2019t suppress the helpless sound that came out of him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t face her, not today, not ever. She knew him too well now. He\u2019d told her things he\u2019d never told anyone.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d she purred against his ear, her fingers alternately caressing and scratching.</p> <p>She\u2019d been so reassuring, stroking his hair and telling him it was okay, there was nothing wrong with him.</p><p>Matthew nodded, his eyes closed. Already, it was difficult not to come, right there in his jeans like a school kid having his dick touched by the head cheerleader.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t tell?\u201d he pleaded softly.</p><p>Janice gripped the hair at the nape of his neck with enough force to make his eyes sting, \u201cNo, Matthew. I won\u2019t tell anyone. Now get the f**k off this barstool and let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Last night it had been glorious and liberating. It had been a light to the darkness in his soul, but today...today it was all he could do not to call in sick and lie in bed and hide.</p><p>Matthew finally rolled over and let the pain have him. He closed his eyes and moved his body along the sheets, testing all of his muscles. His shoulders hurt quite a bit and his neck was stiff, but mostly it was his ass. His ass felt bruised all the way to the bone and he knew even after his hot shower the pain would remain. He\u2019d think about Sloan all day, all night, and every time he sat down until the pain went away. And suddenly, it was his pride that hurt the most.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes. He was supposed to go back to the hospital first thing this morning and get the rest of Olivia\u2019s statement. He wondered if Sloan would be there and his stomach hurt. No. He couldn\u2019t see Sloan. Ever. He couldn\u2019t stand the idea of facing her and encountering her smug face. And really, who wouldn\u2019t be smug?</p><p>Matthew was a notorious jerk. He knew plenty of people who would pay to hear about him being brought so low. Well, he wouldn\u2019t give Sloan the satisfaction of getting to him again. All he had to do was avoid her. It was the coward\u2019s way out, but Matthew figured he could be a coward every now and again. He wouldn\u2019t let it affect his case.</p> <p>With a loud sigh of resignation, Matthew rolled out of bed on unsteady legs and fumbled toward the table for balance and his phone. There was a note:</p><p>Dear Matthew,</p><p>Thank you. You were better than I dreamed. Difficult to leave you, but I know you need your space. I\u2019ll be at the hospital in the morning, stop by if you want, otherwise, I\u2019ll be sure to give you time in the afternoon to do your job. Of course, I hope I\u2019ll see you.</p><p>Agreement stands, my lips are sealed.</p><p>Jani</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Matthew sighed. Even in a note, he could sense how obviously smug she was about last night. If he didn\u2019t show up, then he was a coward. If he did, then he was trying to prove something. It was a catch-22. Angrily, he reached for his phone and fired off a text:</p><p>Reed: Intel @ office. Busy til lunch. Pls rcrd interview.</p><p>He figured his text was vague and yet succinct enough. He hoped she would get the hint and not discuss last night. It was better if they stuck to the work. The case would be over soon and the both of them would be reassigned. With any luck, he\u2019d have no reason to see her again. All he had to do was make it through the next few days. Less, if he could get Livvie to talk. It was all the motivation he needed.</p><p>Matthew took a long, hot shower. It helped loosen his aching muscles. The damage was fairly miniscule, only a few bruises and welts on his ass. It was a relief to know he had no marks on him that would be visible when he was dressed.</p><p>He stopped for coffee on the way to work. He didn\u2019t want to stand around the pot at the office. The officers sometimes tried to engage him in conversation and Matthew just wasn\u2019t in the mood. He walked in quietly, nodding in greeting to the desk sergeant and taking the elevator in silence to the chagrin of the building janitor who rode with him.</p><p>\u201cThis is Agent Reed.\u201d Matthew set his briefcase next to his desk and his coffee next to his keyboard before he turned to acknowledge the officer\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessage came for you late last night. The desk sergeant brought it up this morning,\u201d the young man handed the message to Matthew and walked away.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Matthew muttered toward the man\u2019s back and looked down at the message. The agent from the FIA had called. Matthew looked at his watch and hoped their offices were still open. He was cutting it close.</p><p>He rolled out his chair and picked up his phone to dial the long number. \u201cHello? Staff Sergeant Patel, please.\u201d He waited for a few minutes while they tracked the man down; relieved he\u2019d called in time.</p><p>\u201cStaff Sergeant Patel, speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthew Reed, FBI,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cYou left a message for me. What did you find out?\u201d</p><p>There was a deep sigh on the other end of the phone, \u201cWe looked into private planes with scheduled arrivals in the next three days.\u201d He hesitated, \u201cYou were right. There seems to be a lot more activity than usual. No information yet on Demitri Balk or Vladek Rostrovich, but we don\u2019t have all the passenger manifests yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you send me a list of all the information you have available? I\u2019d like to look through it if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do mind, Agent Reed. If there is something going on, then it falls within our purview and our office can handle it. Is there any other information you would like to share with us?\u201d</p><p>Matthew ground his teeth hard enough to make his head hurt. He wasn\u2019t in the mood for the bureaucratic games. \u201cI\u2019m willing to share information so long as we are coordinating. For that to be the case, information has to flow both ways. Time is limited, Staff Sergeant. Neither of us has time for a pissing contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Americans and your colorful slang,\u201d Patel said. \u201cNo one is \u2018pissing\u2019 on anything, Agent Reed, but I\u2019m sure you can see the political implications of this? The world\u2019s eyes are on Pakistan right now and we need to know the situation can be handled discreetly and without embarrassing either country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you won\u2019t share information, I\u2019ll have to contact my superiors and have them reach out to your government. It could take days and by then, the slave auction could be over,\u201d Matthew said.</p><p>\u201cI understand you have a job to do, Agent Reed. I do as well. I will continue to gather information on the private aircraft, passenger lists, arrival times and scheduled departures, etcetera. In the meantime, I suggest you get in contact with your superiors. I will do the same and perhaps we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d Matthew growled into the receiver.</p><p>\u201cUntil tomorrow,\u201d SSgt Patel replied coolly.</p><p>\u201cYou can bet on it,\u201d Matthew repeated and waited until the line went dead before he placed the handset back onto its cradle. He was careful not to slam it. He didn\u2019t need the attention.</p><p>He had a few hours before Sloan finished with Olivia, so he decided to dig out his research on Demitri Balk. If Rafiq and Caleb were set on getting to the elusive billionaire, then Matthew would have to do the same. He was hesitant to get too close to the man through traditional channels. He didn\u2019t want him spooked. He might decide to stay clear of the auction and then Matthew wouldn\u2019t be able to use him as bait.</p> <p>Demitri Balk didn\u2019t have much of an identity until the mid-90\u2019s. Balk Diamond\u2019s had appeared seemingly overnight with a long list of prominent investors that catapulted the price of the stock within minutes of it becoming public. Demitri Balk had been the primary share holder and was listed as the CEO of the company.</p><p>The large conglomerate was primarily billeted as a jewelry company, but was also supported by a myriad of other businesses. The company had its share of controversy surrounding it. More than one story claiming Balk Diamond\u2019s were mined in Africa could be found by doing a cursory search, but ultimately no formal investigation by any government had been conducted.</p><p>Blood diamonds were highly contentious, but no one had been able to directly link Balk Diamond\u2019s and any of the mines in Africa, probably due to the web of companies and subsidiaries associated with them. One of the subsidiaries caught Matthew\u2019s attention. AKRAAN was established in Russia and dealt in weapon\u2019s manufacturing and sales. More research revealed AKRAAN had been part of Balk Diamond\u2019s when it first went public, meaning the CEO would have direct knowledge of it.</p><p>Matthew wasn\u2019t surprised to see a diamond company involved in weapons. However, what was surprising was the weapons company existed first, as early as the 1960\u2019s. The manufacturer, run by the government, sold weapons to several countries, most notably Iraq and Pakistan.</p><p>How did Demitri Balk come to run both companies? As CEO, no less?</p> <p>Demitri was described by Forbes Magazine as a \u2018self-made billionaire with humble roots in soviet Russia\u2019.</p><p>Matthew scoffed, \u201cHumble, my ass.\u201d He winced at his own words, remembering the very real way his ass had been humbled the night before. Sitting was definitely a chore. He tried not to fidget.</p><p>Finally, inspiration struck and Matthew made a call to his home office. After a brief conversation with his boss, the man had finally relented and agreed to give Matthew all the resources he would need to put his case together. He also agreed to start cutting away at the red tape between Matthew and the FIA.</p><p>Within the hour, two techs were running every picture and story associated with Balk Diamond\u2019s, AKRAAN, Demitri Balk, Vladek Rostrovich, and Muhammad Rafiq through facial recognition software and the National Security Database. Matthew predicted something would show up sooner rather than later.</p><p>He looked at his watch. He should probably get to the hospital. He called the nurse\u2019s desk on Olivia\u2019s floor to make sure Sloan had left for the day and then he gathered his belongings and headed for the door.</p><p>Olivia was furiously writing when Matthew walked in. She seemed in better spirits than the night before. Matthew gave Sloan credit.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you writing?\u201d Matthew asked. He put down his briefcase and took a seat. The chair was far more comfortable than the one in the recreation room. Also, sitting in her hospital room had the added benefit of making her more talkative.</p><p>\u201cDr. Sloan gave me a journal. Pretty sweet, huh? It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve written anything, I almost forgot how much I love it,\u201d Olivia said. She smiled.</p><p>\u201cNot what I asked, Miss Ruiz,\u201d Matthew replied, but there was no bite in his words.</p><p>She sighed, \u201cI\u2019m...you know. I just want to preserve my memories before I stop trusting them.\u201d</p><p>Matthew really didn\u2019t know what to say, except, \u201cThat could get subpoenaed, you know?\u201d</p><p>She looked stricken, dropping her pen with a rattle. \u201cSeriously? Why would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he said easily, \u201cforget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, then down at her notebook and up at him again before she raised a suspicious brow and snapped the journal shut. \u201cI don\u2019t forget anything you say, Reed. Only an idiot would.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew inclined his head and winced, \u201cThanks for the compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your neck?\u201d</p><p>Matthew focused on not letting his embarrassment show and did a fairly good job of it in his estimation. \u201cHotel bed. Hurts my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww, poor Agent Reed,\u201d she teased gently.</p><p>\u201cFunny girl, but let\u2019s get this over with so I can go home and sleep in my own bed,\u201d said Matthew.</p><p>She sighed, \u201cAlways business with you. Is that why Sloan\u2019s mad at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Matthew snapped. \u201cShe talked about me?\u201d</p><p>Olivia gave him a confused look. \u201cShe asked if you were here this morning and when I said no, she seemed a little annoyed is all. You seem to bring that out in people, or just women. She didn\u2019t want to talk about it. What\u2019s going on with you two?\u201d Getting even more curious, Olivia raised her eyebrows. \u201cDid something happen between you two? Was there an FBI showdown?\u201d</p><p>Matthew let out a breath he hadn\u2019t realized he held. He was relieved, and felt foolish for overreacting. \u201cA showdown? No. Has anyone ever told you you\u2019re overdramatic?\u201d he dismissed coolly. \u201cDr. Sloan\u2019s usually more professional in keeping her focus on the case, not external distractions, whatever they may be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Reed. What the hell got up in your ass this morning?\u201d</p><p>Matthew\u2019s cheeks felt hot, but he forced himself to calm down before it could show. The things that could make him blush were limited, but damn it if the last few days weren\u2019t designed to expose his weaknesses to the world.</p><p>\u201cJust go on with your story. Please. I\u2019m exhausted, my neck hurts, and I feel a headache coming on, so can we just get on with it?\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s face was suddenly devoid of its light and humor. \u201cFine, Reed. Ask your f**king questions.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cWhat did you and Sloan talk about? I\u2019ll get her notes later, but just bring me up to speed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about Caleb. Nothing that would interest you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me anyway,\u201d Matthew insisted. He tried to work up a smile to re-establish their otherwise good rapport, but by the look on Olivia\u2019s face, it would take more than a smile.</p><p>\u201cI had a lot of nightmares when I first got to the mansion. Sometimes about Rafiq raping Nancy. Sometimes I dreamt about Caleb selling me. Mostly though, I had nightmares about the night the bikers almost raped me. I dreamt about them beating me, stepping on my stomach and slapping my face.\u201d She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI could almost feel blood pouring into my mouth. I would wake up gasping. When Caleb was there...\u201d Livvie sighed, \u201cHe would just hold me. Caleb liked sleeping next to me, I think.</p><p>\u201cMorning was our problem. I would lie in bed next to Caleb, watching him sleep and thinking he was so child-like when he wasn\u2019t so obsessed with training me, or proving how much control he had over me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Matthew interrupted, \u201cWas Rafiq still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He left a few days after I met him. He and Caleb had breakfast on the balcony. Rafiq used Nancy as a table and I don\u2019t know how many times I had to shut my eyes because I thought Rafiq\u2019s knife was going to go right through his steak and into Nancy. It never happened though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Nancy?\u201d Matthew asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it until later, but Rafiq took her with him when he left. And before you ask: No, I don\u2019t know where he went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo meet the boat. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, to meet the boat,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo where did you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the floor, next to Caleb. He cut things up for me and fed them to me as he ate. That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you, Reed: he was good to me. I didn\u2019t really appreciate it until I saw the way Nancy was treated. Even Kid. Celia was treated better than anyone though. Toward the end I\u2019d sort of hoped...\u201d She was starting to drift off.</p><p>\u201cHoped, what?\u201d Matthew said in an attempt to regain her focus.</p><p>\u201cThat Caleb and I could have what they did. Felipe isn\u2019t a great guy. He wouldn\u2019t be involved with Rafiq if he were, but.... I don\u2019t know, Celia loves him and Felipe seems to feel the same way. He\u2019s pretty protective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to call Sloan?\u201d Matthew asked patiently.</p><p>Her eyes drifted toward him, narrowing suspiciously. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you need a lot of therapy, Miss Ruiz. A lot.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at him, clearly amused by his bluntness. \u201cFuck you, Reed,\u201d she said through a smile.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Continue your story...\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>When I opened my eyes and realized it was morning it took me a few minutes to orient myself. The trepidation I felt during the night was slow to fade. I didn\u2019t remember falling asleep, only lying in bed for hours trying to think of a way out of my situation that wouldn\u2019t later involve Caleb having to rescue me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The room I slept in was beautiful and immaculate. Every morning the sun came spilling into the room when Celia came in to draw back the heavy curtains. I had told her I was more than capable of drawing back the curtains myself, but she simply ignored me as she went about her business of preparing the room for the day.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not allowed to speak to you,\u201d Caleb said as he sat on the edge of the bed. It was only our second week at the mansion and he looked so tired, like he wasn\u2019t able to rest at all. He complained he couldn\u2019t go on sleeping in all his clothes forever. Yet, every night, he did.</p><p>Caleb was more erratic than usual during those first few weeks. Yes, he was cruel. He put me through my paces, teaching me certain phrases in Russian and what actions to take when I heard them. He insisted I crawl, call him master, and that I go through a series of humiliations meant to make me get over my shyness.</p><p>For all that, he didn\u2019t really touch me. He kept me clothed. He protected me by not letting others near me. I knew he stayed with me at night because I had nightmares when he didn\u2019t. He slept in his t-shirt and shorts, seemingly content to just sleep next to me and not touch me unless I woke from some horrible nightmare and huddled close to him. He soothed me.</p> <p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she allowed to talk to me?\u201d I asked, in a sardonic tone.</p><p>Caleb glared at me for several moments before he replied. \u201cKitten, you should really watch the way you speak to me. Just because you\u2019re hurt, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not keeping score.\u201d He stared at me, squarely in the eyes, until I finally looked down.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Master.\u201d He eyed me strangely. \u201cCan I please know why she\u2019s not allowed to speak to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelia isn\u2019t just her master\u2019s lover, she\u2019s also his servant. It\u2019s not so unusual I guess. I\u2019ve never been involved with someone long enough to know the idiosyncrasies that go along with being in a relationship, but I know enough to say it makes sense. It\u2019s not like he can use her for sex all the time.\u201d My face must have shown my indignant shock because Caleb pressed his finger to my lips to keep me from speaking.</p><p>Even though I shouldn\u2019t and it might piss Caleb off, I spoke anyway, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a silly rule? It sounds pretty mean to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell trust me; sometimes talking to you is what is mean,\u201d he commented, but smiled.</p><p>I smiled back. Asshole. Perversely, I thought about how much I would miss him after he sold me, and I wondered if he would miss me, too, perhaps even enough to come for me. You\u2019re not a princess and he isn\u2019t the handsome prince come to save you. Or don\u2019t you remember? I sighed at my inner voice. I was talking to myself more and more. Not only was I going crazy, but I was bitchy company.</p><p>Some days I could almost forget I was being held against my will. I never did, but I flirted with the idea every now and then. Caleb would have Celia bring us breakfast and we\u2019d eat it outside, just the two of us. Out in the sunshine, eating fresh pastries from Caleb\u2019s hand and sipping hand-squeezed orange juice, I thought: This isn\u2019t so bad.</p><p>Of course, some days it was nearly impossible to forget I was Caleb\u2019s prisoner. I was still moving slowly from my injuries. The bruises had nearly faded away, but the pain in my ribs and shoulder was always there to remind me about a lot of things. It was a deterrent against running away again. It was also a reminder I had gotten off easy with Caleb. Still, leave it to Caleb to think of a way to use the pain toward his own ends.</p><p>One morning in particular, he\u2019d left me alone in the room with Celia and against my better judgment I decided to talk to her.</p><p>Celia\u2019s eyes avoided mine as she went about my room straightening things that didn\u2019t need to be straightened and dusting. I really pitied her. She was beautiful and her demeanor hinted at her immense inner strength and yet...she was a slave. I wondered if I would be half as graceful as she when my time finally came. I did note, with some hope, she didn\u2019t appear to be abused. There were no bruises on her, no outward signs to suggest she was suffering. Yes. There was definitely hope in that.</p> <p>\u201cCelia?\u201d I spoke her name haltingly, scared she would answer me and scared she wouldn\u2019t. Her gaze fell upon me kindly, with only a quirked eyebrow in question. It wasn\u2019t really a response, but it was more than I\u2019d gotten from her before. I figured since Caleb wasn\u2019t present she would speak to me. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>She stared at me for a long while, until I grew uncomfortable and squirmed. I didn\u2019t think it was a complicated question, though at some point I wanted to ask her those too. Finally, her mouth quirked to the side and she nodded briefly; neither was for my benefit. She looked at me with a smile in her eyes and held up six fingers.</p><p>I wanted to yell at her for not using her words, but I was sure it wouldn\u2019t get me anywhere good. \u201cSiiiiiix...months?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>I took a deep, fortifying breath for my next question, \u201cYears?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and smiled.</p><p>Fuck. Years? She\u2019d been Felipe\u2019s slave for six years. I couldn\u2019t imagine. \u201cDid you never try to escape?!\u201d My voice was apparently too loud. Her eyes were suddenly frantic and she looked at the door as if it would burst open and something horrible would happen. She scurried toward me and held her fingers to my lips.</p><p>I was stunned and still, waiting for the moment to settle. Her eyes scolded me and continued to scold me as she backed away from me shaking her head.</p> <p>She left the room before I could apologize or ask another question.</p><p>Nice going!</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I whispered to no one at all.</p><p>I had expected to face Caleb\u2019s wrath within minutes of Celia\u2019s exit, but no one came. I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave my new room, Caleb had made that clear. So I waited...and waited...and waited. Hours later, I was starving and the pain in my ribs and shoulder was becoming less bearable with each passing minute. Finally, I risked trying the door, but it was locked.</p><p>Eventually, I resorted to screaming and begging Caleb through the door to forgive me and give me my medicine. I wondered if I might be an addict, but given the level of pain I was in, I doubted it. I needed those f**king pills. I also, needed to eat! Of course, Caleb knew it as well, and his punishment, free of violence, was still cruel.</p><p>Gradually, it became dark outside. As I lay crying on my bed, I heard the sound of someone unlocking my door. I cried in stark relief when Caleb entered the room.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>I whimpered and nodded. \u201cYes, Master. I\u2019m so sorry. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always say that, Kitten, but then you refuse to follow the rules and I have to punish you all over again. Didn\u2019t I tell you Celia isn\u2019t allowed to speak to you?\u201d he chided.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master. I know you did. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you weren\u2019t before, at the very least I know you are now.\u201d He sat on the bed and held out a glass of water and some pills. \u201cSit up and take these.\u201d</p><p>I sat up slowly, sobbing. Part of it was the pain, but there was also a sense of shame involved. Caleb was disappointed with me. He\u2019d told me the rules, he\u2019d explained. I hadn\u2019t listened. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you left me this long. It f**king hurts.\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t choose to leave you, Kitten. You made that choice yourself,\u201d Caleb said. It came as a surprise he wasn\u2019t yelling at me, or promising me more pain. He was very matter-of-fact about the whole thing. I wondered if it was just another way to mess with my head.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d I asked before I could stop myself.</p><p>\u201cJust now? Bed. Earlier, I went out. Felipe has horses and I\u2019d never ridden one,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d I whispered. Now that Caleb was near, I felt calmer. I was angry with him, of course, but I\u2019d come to live for these moments with Caleb. I felt protected. I felt kept. Without him, my life was a giant question mark.</p><p>He smiled a little and pushed an errant lock of hair behind my ear, \u201cMaybe when you\u2019re better, I can take you.\u201d</p><p>My heart seemed to swell in my chest, \u201cWill I be here long enough? With you?\u201d I met Caleb\u2019s clear blue eyes and they appeared wistful. I would have given anything to know what he was thinking, but I knew better than to ask.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, Kitten. Sometimes...\u201d he paused.</p><p>\u201cSometimes?\u201d I tried to urge him along.</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d He smiled and stroked my hair with so much silent affection I felt like crying again. \u201cAre you hungry, Kitten?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I inclined my face into his hand and closed my eyes, trying to hold on to him and knowing there was no way I possibly could. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>Then we ate, Caleb feeding me pieces off his plate. It was strangely...comfortable. Afterward, he rubbed my sore body until I fell asleep.</p><p>I slept, but I was having that horrible dream again. My stomach felt like a tight, hot knot of pressure weighing me down from the inside. I turned and turned, the knot only getting tighter and hotter and heavier.</p><p>They held me down, and the smell of beer and cigarettes came off of them in waves. Their rough hands blazed a trail along my skin as they pulled at my clothes, and the sound of my protests fell upon deaf ears. The horror played in slow motion, coming in random flashes of what I remembered, and what I still felt. Then the nightmare took on a life of its own, no longer bound by the facts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I couldn\u2019t fight them. My fists moved in slow motion, unable to land solidly. My voice wouldn\u2019t rise above a whisper. One of them held me down as the other kissed me. I yelled for someone, but I wasn\u2019t sure who, all I knew was this person could only help me if I made a loud enough sound. I fought with every ounce of my strength. My wrists were limp and my voice was small, but I fought. I started crying.</p><p>The worst was about to happen when the dream unexpectedly changed again. It was faster now, faster even than real time. Caleb opened the door and asked what the hell was going on and the arms holding me let go. They backed into the corner behind me. Free, I stood and ran into his arms. I wrapped my arms around him and I told him what they had meant to do.</p><p>They tried to deny it. Caleb told them to shut their mouths. He lifted me into his arms, telling them to stay put and carried me past the decrepit room filled with air-mattresses and clothes, into a room I recognized as his.</p><p>He set me down beside the door as he looked me over. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked. I nodded, only slightly aware he ran his hands over my nakedness as he searched for injuries. He seemed satisfied I wasn\u2019t hurt and hugged me again.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d he asked. The moment slowed and I looked him in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cHurt them for me,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make them pay,\u201d he said. His hands continued to move over me, and my hands held on to his shirt tightly. The tension in my belly transformed from solid to liquid and it ran down toward my thighs. The knot came undone and now felt like a cord stretched taut from my ni**les to my sex. When he touched me, the cord tugged, and the feeling was overwhelming, savage, and strangely welcome.</p><p>I took my hands off of his chest and shrugged off the open top I wore. \u201cI could\u2019ve been really hurt if you hadn\u2019t helped me,\u201d I said. His eyes fixed on me, mixed with shock, and lust. He pinned me against the wall with his body, and the heat of his breath warmed and moistened my neck. I wanted to say something, but his right hand cupped me, down low, and my body felt paralyzed. The invisible cord inside me pulled taut. A lascivious yelp escaped my throat.</p><p>He pressed his lips close to my ear. \u201cDon\u2019t f**k with me,\u201d he growled.</p> <p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d was my only response.</p><p>He reached his arms between my thighs and lifted me against the wall. He fumbled with his pants for a second, before he pressed his way inside me. I groped for his mouth to distract myself from his size, and when our tongues connected a rush of heat flowed out of me.</p><p>A loud grunt escaped my lips as I jerked awake, panting, my heart pounding, and the now familiar feeling of my entire body contracting and expanding for several seconds. I was definitely coming. Beside me, Caleb sat up swiftly and turned on the light on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he said.</p><p>I was sweating, and still taking in deep gulps of air.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d his voice sounded more annoyed and tired than anything else.</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cBad...bad dream,\u201d I stammered. He looked at me for a few seconds, and just seeing his eyes wouldn\u2019t let me shake the dream. I looked down, and my breathing finally started returning to normal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing. Why?\u201d he asked softly and smoothed back my hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine...I...I was just having that dream again.\u201d My breathing evened out and the unexpected pulsing between my legs subsided. Finally able to, I looked in Caleb\u2019s direction. He was staring at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d I asked. His eyebrows knit together and a smile played on his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that \u2013 Master,\u201d he replied.</p><p>I bit my lip and looked away.</p><p>\u201cOh Kitten,\u201d he whispered, his hand still stroking my hair away from my sweat-slick forehead. \u201cIf only you were well enough to play\u2013 the things I would do. But if you must know....\u201d He leaned toward me and kissed my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m looking at you because I think you\u2019re sexy.\u201d He kissed me up higher toward my neck. \u201cYour face is all flushed and your hair is a mess.\u201d He kissed me higher and I closed my eyes and held my breath.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you touching me? You haven\u2019t....\u201d I said in a rush.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not touching, I\u2019m kissing. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d I sighed, my voice a little too airy to suit me; I\u2019d much rather have sounded firm and resolved.</p><p>\u201cSo...if I do this,\u201d he said, against the nape of my neck and cupped my right breast, rubbing it lightly through my nightgown. \u201cIt\u2019s just the same as this?\u201d He kissed my neck. I could barely move or breathe. He sucked up all the oxygen around me.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said, and this time I made it sound convincing. He rolled my nipple between his thumb and forefinger with just enough pressure to make me feel it in my belly. \u201cPlease stop...Master,\u201d I said through gently gritted teeth. To my surprise, he did actually stop.</p><p>He sat back and stared at me for what seemed like an eternity, but couldn\u2019t have been more than a few moments. Heat radiated from every part of my body, and my face must\u2019ve been a deep, deep shade of red. He rubbed his hands over his face and groaned. I was really nervous, and I wanted to say something, but I couldn\u2019t think of what it was. Abruptly, he threw his side of the sheet off to one side and stood up. My eyes were immediately drawn to the enormous erection straining against the fabric of his boxer shorts.</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep,\u201d he said. He picked up his pants and shoved his legs into them.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked, nervous.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t f**king worry about it,\u201d he said, and walked out the door.</p><p>Shocked, I watched him leave and gruffly shut the door behind him \u2013 but the shock stemmed from my desire to say something that would make him stop. Anxiety built up inside my stomach as I sat alone. All I could think about was my dream and how good it had felt to have him kiss me. What\u2019s wrong with me!</p><p>I didn\u2019t have too long to ponder my questions, or my body\u2019s response to them. My door abruptly opened and Caleb walked in. Celia came in behind him wearing nothing but a pair of black lace panties.</p><p>Caleb closed the door behind them gently, not in any hurry to address the question written all over my face: What the f**k is she doing here?</p><p>Celia had obviously been sleeping. Her hair was loose and gently disheveled. She stood silently, her hands covering her small br**sts. She didn\u2019t seem distressed, only a little shy and curious. It was a stark contrast from the night I\u2019d seen her dominate Kid in front of a room full of strangers. I looked at her eyes, and when hers met mine I thought she gave just the slightest hint of a mischievous grin.</p><p>\u201cDrop your arms,\u201d Caleb said in Spanish. He didn\u2019t speak it as well as English, but I was begrudgingly intrigued nonetheless. Celia immediately dropped her arms to her sides. Her ni**les were already hard.</p><p>Caleb turned his attention to me, \u201cYou remember, Celia, don\u2019t you, Kitten?\u201d When I said nothing, he snapped, \u201cAnswer me!\u201d Celia and I both jumped a little at the sharp sound of his voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBecause she\u2019s going to help you understand something. I\u2019m not yours to taunt. Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed the way you try to manipulate me. I invented that game.\u201d</p><p>My mouth was agape. What the hell is he talking about? \u201cManipulate? I don\u2019t\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do!\u201d he barked low. \u201cOne minute you\u2019re pressing yourself against me, trying to...I don\u2019t know. The next, you\u2019re telling me \u2013 telling me, not to touch you.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tell him he was being ridiculous. How could I possibly be the one manipulating him when he was so thoroughly the master of my fate?</p><p>\u201cCaleb, I\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Just watch,\u201d he said.</p><p>My mouth went completely dry and anxiety coursed through me, burning inside my stomach. I looked into Celia\u2019s eyes again. She smiled, just the tiniest quirk of her lips. A smile meant only for me. It shocked me.</p><p>Caleb stood behind Celia, and she shivered as he swept her hair over her left shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t look away, or I promise I\u2019ll find a way to punish you \u2013 injured or not,\u201d He said to me. I swallowed hard. Caleb turned his attention to Celia, who seemed to be swaying gently in anticipation of his touch. He kissed up along her shoulder and her neck, just as he\u2019d done to me. She let out a deep groan and tipped her head back against him. I couldn\u2019t believe I was watching this.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d he whispered into the dead silence of the room.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, Se\u00f1or,\u201d Celia whispered, in her breathy, accented voice.</p><p>My stomach knotted and I wanted to double over, yet I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away as he reached his arm around her and cupped her breast. She cried out as he massaged it, pulling her nipple between his fingers. Her ni**les were a deep apricot and looked like hard raspberries perched on the gentle upward slope of her bosom. My face burned, and something vaguely familiar and unsolicited took up residence inside me. Celia\u2019s moans grew a little louder. She made fists in the fabric of Caleb\u2019s pants and pressed her backside into him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wasn\u2019t quite ready when Caleb dipped his free hand into her panties and her knees buckled. My body moved all at once to stop her from falling and recoiled in pain. It turned out my efforts were wasted. Caleb held her firmly in his grasp. He looked into my eyes, which were now misted over, and kept his hand busy inside Celia\u2019s panties. I felt angry...and scared...and physically hurt...and...and...hot.</p><p>I wanted to curse at him, but why, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure. His chest rose and fell faster than usual, and I knew he was all worked up. Suddenly, he pushed Celia forward onto the bed and her arms reached out to catch her, landing on my knees. I heard her panties rip as Caleb pulled the delicate material in one swift jerking motion and discarded them.</p><p>\u201cTurn around and spread your legs,\u201d he said, huskily. Celia scrambled to obey and I sat in unabashed horror as her head rest on my knees.</p><p>Caleb undid his pants and slid everything down, his thick c**k sprang upward like something that shouldn\u2019t be there, and I couldn\u2019t help but close my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cDo not f**king look away,\u201d he sneered. I opened my eyes. My tears fell.</p><p>Caleb dipped his head between Celia\u2019s legs and said something about loving a bald pu**y before he buried his face between her thighs. Celia was somewhere else after that. She moaned and her head went from side to side. Her hands reached up toward me, and she made fists into the hips of my nightgown. I tried to pry her hands off of me to back away, but the bitch held on tight.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said on a sigh. \u201cPlease. Let me come.\u201d She repeated the word please like a mantra. My heart raced.</p><p>Caleb emerged from Celia\u2019s thighs and took absolutely no notice of me as he sucked and kissed his way to her nipple. He reached down and must have put himself inside her because Celia all of a sudden went perfectly still. Her face turned a ridiculous shade of red and an ungodly groan came out of her. Caleb looked at me, fire and hunger in his eyes.</p><p>He whispered, \u201cI could have made you come like that. If it were really what you wanted. If you weren\u2019t such a liar.\u201d Before I could grasp the words he\u2019d spoken, he grabbed the back of my head and kissed me \u2013 the taste of Celia saturated my mouth, and something in me snapped. I shook loose of the kiss and slapped Caleb across the face with so much force my hand stung.</p> <p>I ran into the bathroom before he could recover. I was breathless. I pressed my back against the door, terrified of him bursting through it and some horrible scenario playing out between us. I cried pitifully, and wiped at my mouth with my free hand to get the taste of Celia out of my mouth. It wasn\u2019t that the taste of her was altogether unpleasant, it had more to do with the fact it came from Caleb\u2019s mouth. Of all the emotions running through me, why was the nagging sense of betrayal one of them? I couldn\u2019t deny it, I was hurt, and I couldn\u2019t put my finger on exactly why.</p><p>Nearly fifteen minutes went by and Caleb still hadn\u2019t come to confront me. I pressed my ear to the door and I could hear them. They were still f**king. I could hear her moaning and the rough timbre of his voice. He was saying things, but I couldn\u2019t make them out. I should\u2019ve been happy he wasn\u2019t interested in making me pay for what I\u2019d done, but I wasn\u2019t. That familiar and unsolicited feeling I had earlier was still present, growing inside my chest, and keeping the flow of tears coming to my eyes \u2013 jealousy.</p><p>The idea I was jealous consumed me for several hours as I lay on the tile. Why was I jealous? Of whom? I don\u2019t think I was jealous of what Caleb was doing. I had no reason to care. No reason, except, for more than a month he\u2019d been trying to seduce me, and draw me in, and trying to make me feel something I didn\u2019t feel \u2013 for what? So he could turn around and f**k someone else? And her! Walking around my room as if she were some sort of victim. I actually felt sorry for her, up until I saw that smile of hers, up until she made it obvious she was better than me in some way. Tears of frustration rolled down my cheeks, and no matter how I thought about it, I still hurt.</p><p>Later still, after the tears faded, I finally decided to leave my self-imposed prison and face whatever sick punishment Caleb undoubtedly had in store for me. I opened the bathroom door. Light from the bathroom spilled into the dark room, and there was a deep pinch in the middle of my chest when I saw they were both cuddled up together in what I\u2019d come to think of as my bed. I stepped closer. They were both obviously naked and the sheet only covered them from the waist down. Celia\u2019s face was still flush, and her lips looked swollen from kissing. She looked content. Caleb held her in his possessive way, as if he didn\u2019t want her to get away, though I doubted she would try. I swallowed past the lump in my throat and looked around. Where am I supposed to sleep?</p><p>I paced around the room, knowing I\u2019d probably end up on the floor, but not able to accept it yet. I walked past the door to the bedroom, and my heart skipped at the thought the door might actually be open. I looked back toward the bed and saw Caleb\u2019s face within the sliver of light coming from the bathroom. He slept peacefully. I put my hand on the latch and pressed down, and I held my breath as I pulled back gently, and the door opened.</p><p>Soft light gave the long hallway an eerie glow and I almost had the feeling of being in a hotel, but my door seemed to be the only one down this hallway. At the end of the hall, I could make out a railing, and just beyond it, a large chandelier hung from the ceiling. I took a step forward onto the soft carpeting and I was suddenly overwhelmed by the urge to pee. What the hell are you doing? I crept further out into the hall, not knowing what I intended to do once I reached the end. As I reached the middle of the hallway, I looked back toward the bedroom door and was suddenly overwhelmed with the memory of the bikers. Immediately I knew I wouldn\u2019t be running away. More than anything, I just wanted to look around \u2013 but I didn\u2019t want to risk Caleb\u2019s temper any more than I already had. I turned back. I closed the door behind me, as gently as I had opened it.</p> <p>\u201cDid you find what you were looking for?\u201d said a husky male voice.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for anything,\u201d I replied, my anger gave my words a harder edge than I intended, and it belied my surge of fear at being caught. Caleb sighed. I watched as he disentangled himself from Celia and rolled over on his side to face me. Celia groaned and wrapped herself around my pillow and continued to sleep.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said softly, but I knew it wasn\u2019t a request. Conveying a confidence I didn\u2019t have, I crossed the short distance between us and stood next to the bed.</p><p>As I stood there, trying not to let my knees knock together, he looked me up and down, and from that alone my entire body grew uncomfortably warmer. He reached out with one hand and ran his fingers from my elbow to my wrist. He pressed his lips to the inside of my wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou slapped me,\u201d He said. He looked up into my eyes and I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d I whispered. I hoped addressing him properly would please him. He intertwined his fingers with mine, and pressed firmly. I winced.</p><p>\u201cBefore you, I\u2019ve never known a woman to get away with that.\u201d Tears fell from my eyes. I couldn\u2019t pretend to be brave.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t hurt me,\u201d I sputtered.</p> <p>He looked at me calmly, with a smile playing across his lips. \u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t take much would it? You\u2019re already broken as it is. It wouldn\u2019t be any fun for me.\u201d I let out a deep breath I didn\u2019t know I was holding, and took another. \u201cStill, I can\u2019t exactly let it go.\u201d Without thinking about it I squeezed his hand when he spoke. \u201cWhat are you bracing for?\u201d he asked. \u201cI already told you I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Inexplicably, sobs caught in my chest, but I managed to respond, \u201cYou\u2019ve already hurt me, Caleb. Why would you do that? Why?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a long moment before he responded, \u201cThis thing between us...it has to stop. I don\u2019t like it. I\u2019ve tried to make this easier for you, as ridiculous as it sounds. I can\u2019t keep you, Livvie. Stop trying to make me.\u201d</p><p>My heart clenched in my chest at the sound of my name. He remembered. I hadn\u2019t imagined those moments with him. They were as real to him as they had been to me and it was almost more than I could bear. Everything he had said was true. I\u2019d been trying to manipulate him since the night he\u2019d told me the truth. The night I realized I was nothing more than an object, a thing to be bought and traded.</p><p>I had no guilt over it, either. Caleb wanted me to survive and I was trying my f**king best. I\u2019d chosen my path and carefully placed my moments. Caleb was my way out of this whole thing and I was set on doing all I could to bend him to my side. What I had never anticipated was the way my feelings would develop.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d I finally replied.</p><p>He smiled sadly, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything. I shouldn\u2019t have. Just get in the bed.\u201d</p><p>A look of shock crossed over my face. \u201cI\u2019m not getting in there with the both of you,\u201d I said matter-of-factly. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re naked.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was a low rumble that made me feel like a petulant child, but I didn\u2019t care. He sat up, and the sheet did a bad job of covering his thickening penis. He put his hands on my hips and gently urged me forward. Heat spread through my belly and I looked up past his head, my eyes landing on Celia\u2019s sleeping form. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His breath touched my belly through the thin fabric of my nightgown as he spoke, \u201cI\u2019m not asking, Kitten.\u201d I was about to say I didn\u2019t feel right sleeping next to Celia when his hot mouth closed over my puckered nipple, and an unbelievably hard tug inside me quickened my pulse and made the lips of my sex swell.</p><p>He let go quickly, but the damage was already done. The residual wetness left by his mouth continued hardening my nipple as the air touched it. My breath was seemingly harder to come by, but Caleb seemed calm and in control.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said over the roar in my ears, \u201care you going to get in this bed and go to sleep, or are you going to give me a reason to torture you in a thousand different ways that don\u2019t hurt?\u201d A whine escaped my throat.</p><p>He coaxed me toward the bed, but I dug in my heels and gently refused to move. Caleb sighed deeply.</p> <p>I knew I was testing his patience, but I wouldn\u2019t relent. \u201cPlease make her go,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be mean?\u201d he teased me from previous conversation, and I smiled in spite of myself. He regarded me for a few moments, then rolled his eyes playfully and yelled, \u201cCelia!\u201d I jumped. Celia woke with a start and rubbed the sleep from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, Se\u00f1or?\u201d she said, alarmed and groggy.</p><p>\u201cGo back to your room.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p> <p>Matthew sat in silence for a few minutes, trying to soak in the story. What could he say? There wasn\u2019t necessarily any relevant information to be gleaned, but he was beginning to become curious about Caleb and the kind of man he was.</p><p>Caleb seemed like a very conflicted person. To Matthew\u2019s thinking, the conflict didn\u2019t excuse Caleb\u2019s actions, but as he sat in Olivia\u2019s hospital room struggling not to notice the throb of arousal he experienced every time he shifted in his seat and thought of Sloan, he wondered if he didn\u2019t share something in common with the man. It wasn\u2019t a comforting thought by any stretch, but there it was. He was curious.</p><p>As Olivia spoke, he recalled their earlier conversation about whether or not monsters were born or made. He believed they were made, as did Olivia, but Matthew had trouble with the notion that cruelty, justified further cruelty. Or a lust for it.</p><p>In Matthew\u2019s case, he felt he should be able to subjugate his need to be humiliated and dominated sexually. His desires were a remnant from a childhood spent taking care of a weak woman and getting verbally and physically abused by an even weaker man. That Matthew had become a strong-willed and self-assured person was a blessing, but his need to be abused from time to time was a curse he struggled with in every romantic relationship he had.</p><p>Matthew wondered if the situation were reversed between him and Caleb, if it would have made any difference in how either of them turned out. Would Matthew have been a kidnapper? Would Caleb feel the need to submit instead of dominate? Or were certain aspects of a person\u2019s personality ingrained in them from birth?</p><p>A loud ping from his laptop snapped Matthew out of his thoughts. He received an email from Agent Williams. It was probably rude to open it, but he was glad for the distraction and the information could be important.</p> <p>\u201cSorry. I have to read this email,\u201d Matthew said.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what it says?\u201d Olivia asked. She seemed to also need a distraction.</p><p>Matthew\u2019s finger scrolled through the email. His brows furrowed as he went over bits of information, his mouth quirking in different expressions depending on what he read. \u201cI suppose. It might be helpful if you can tell me anything new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try,\u201d she said and Matthew realized he believed her. He still strongly believed Olivia was suffering from Stockholm\u2019s Syndrome, but it didn\u2019t mean she was trying to stop him from doing his job.</p><p>\u201cDemitri Balk has gone through a lot of trouble to cover up his past. According to this, prior to 1988 he was known as Vladek Rostrovich. Allegedly, he was a small-time arms dealer out of Russia,\u201d said Matthew.</p><p>\u201cHe disappears after \u201988, and then reappears as Balk in \u201998. In 2002, his company goes public and he becomes a billionaire seemingly overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d asked Olivia.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Matthew said. He obviously couldn\u2019t give Olivia all the details. She didn\u2019t have a need to know. However, he hoped giving her some of the information might lead her toward divulging information she was either keeping or didn\u2019t know she had.</p> <p>Given the information, Matthew surmised that Pakistan, like many of their neighbors, bought weapons from Russian arms dealers in the 1980\u2019s. It was the most plausible explanation for Rafiq and Vladek crossing paths. For a moment, Matthew wondered if the bad blood between Rafiq and Vladek revolved around the sale of weapons to enemies of Pakistan, but that didn\u2019t seem like the kind of thing that would justify a vendetta spanning twenty years. It had to be personal.</p><p>At least now, Matthew had a timeframe for when it might have occurred. Also, given the fact Olivia had been kidnapped for the purpose of human trafficking and not drugs or guns, there was a large piece missing from the puzzle.</p><p>\u201cDid Caleb ever mention why he and Rafiq want Balk dead?\u201d</p><p>Olivia cocked her head slightly to one side and looked up toward the ceiling as if answers were written there. Matthew recognized the behavior of someone trying to remember something. He found it interesting how people, with all their differences, were still inherently the same. Olivia finally responded, \u201cYes and no. The night Caleb told me he was...,\u201d she suddenly looked sad.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Matthew asked.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right, Reed,\u201d she said, her voice rough at the edges. \u201cI\u2019m going to need a lot of therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said and meant it.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she whispered and took a deep breath. \u201cAnyway, the night he told me he planned on selling me, he said something about Balk needing to pay for what he did to Rafiq\u2019s mother and sister. Apparently, he did something to Caleb, too. I remember because later I wondered if that\u2019s where Caleb got the scars on his back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Matthew asked.</p><p>She looked away, getting choked up again. \u201cNo. He said it was some guy named Narweh. He wouldn\u2019t tell me much; just that he was the one who whipped him when he was younger. Caleb said his life was hell until...Rafiq rescued him.\u201d</p><p>Matthew wrote everything down, hoping all the pieces would fall into place for him soon. Every piece was valuable because he knew alone they meant nothing, but together they would lead him toward realizing the whole picture. That\u2019s what he loved. It was all he lived for: solving the puzzle.</p><p>\u201cDid he say anything else about this, Narweh, person? Do you have a timeframe?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head, \u201cSorry, no. I know Caleb was younger than me when it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me. We...we became very close by the end, Reed. Last time you were here and Sloan had just left, I was scared that maybe I made it up. I was scared that what I feel for Caleb was my way of surviving. Then I think about all the things he told me. I think about the way everyone gave him shit for being soft with me, and I.... I just don\u2019t think I made it up. It\u2019s real. The way I feel for him is real.\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you one way or the other.\u201d Matthew shrugged, \u201cMy job is the case, not to determine if your feelings are real. Not to say your feelings are irrelevant, it\u2019s just no one can answer that question but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Reed. I just....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Miss Ruiz,\u201d said Matthew. \u201cWhen this whole thing started, my job was to get your statement and bring someone to justice. It\u2019s become something much larger than I, or my superiors had anticipated. I don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings, or discount them, but the bottom-line is: Someone has to stop that auction. Everything else? I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Matthew said. He had done a lot of talking with Olivia over the last week. He\u2019d learned a few things, but whether or not it would lead him to the auction was still unclear.</p><p>Luckily, he had a team working on it now.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me the rest?\u201d</p><p>Olivia was staring off again, but she nodded. \u201cYeah, why not\u201d</p><p>My attachment to Caleb was evolving, but it wasn\u2019t just that. I found myself anticipating his needs and learning the meanings behind his many silences. Some days, he was brutal and I scrambled to obey his every whim as flawlessly as I was capable. Other days, he seemed content just having me near while he attended to mundane things.</p><p>Caleb liked to read, but when I asked, he never let me know what it was he was reading. When I mentioned how much I liked to read, he gifted me a copy of Shakespeare\u2019s, Hamlet. I thought it was ironic he gave me a story about one man\u2019s obsession with revenge and how it literally poisoned everyone around him. He didn\u2019t seem to find it amusing, but let me keep the book anyway. I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the gesture.</p><p>I thought a lot about the night he had sex with Celia in front of me. It was a painful memory for many reasons, but the worst seemed to be my nagging sense of jealousy. No matter the circumstance, I found having Caleb near was always better than not having him around. It wasn\u2019t only his presence I came to crave, but also the man himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Several weeks after the night with Celia, I was finally free of all tape and bandages. My ribs still hurt from time to time, but it wasn\u2019t the horrible kind of pain that stole my breath. I opened my eyes and it was still dark in the room, but light enough to suggest it was morning. Celia hadn\u2019t been in to open the curtains yet. I yawned and stretched out. I was careful not to hit Caleb as he slept beside me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have the nightmares as often anymore, but whenever Caleb opted not to sleep in my room I found myself terrified of the dark and unable to sleep. Such had been the case the night before and I\u2019d ended up yelling his name loudly over and over until he angrily opened my door in his boxer shorts and asked me what the hell I was screaming about.</p><p>As soon as I had seen him I relaxed. I ran toward him and put my arms around him. With my face buried against his chest I immediately breathed in comfort and security. He had seemed annoyed, but he\u2019d wiped my face and told me to get in bed \u2013 he\u2019d stay.</p><p>I knew morning would bring about a change in him, in the way he behaved toward me and I wasn\u2019t ready to accept it yet. It was ironic, because at first, I hated the dark. I had spent so much time those first few weeks of my captivity, craving the sun and the light on my face. Suddenly, it seemed the opposite. In the dark, my master let down his guard and he was Caleb again. He didn\u2019t correct me. He didn\u2019t punish me. He didn\u2019t push me away emotionally. Caleb was there to hold me until the nightmares passed. He was there to tell me I was beautiful. He was there to tell me I was going to be okay. In the dark, he seduced me. I didn\u2019t want the seduction to end.</p> <p>I turned toward Caleb slowly, staring at his back. I\u2019d seen his scars before, kissed them, but Caleb had never let me study them. With his eyes so firmly shut and him taking deep, even breaths, I took advantage of the situation to satisfy my growing curiosity. Even in the dim light, I made out the thick lines crisscrossing his tanned skin. They almost looked like welts, but I could tell they\u2019d been healed for a long time.</p><p>Unable to resist, I reached out with my fingertip and traced one from his shoulder to about the middle of his back. He groaned and shifted a little, and I withdrew my hand. I waited a few impatient seconds to see if he woke up, and when he didn\u2019t, I went over the same spot again. The skin was raised by the slightest of degrees and I marveled over how many there were. How did you get these? My curiosity made me bolder and I pressed my palm to his skin letting it travel the length and breadth of his back. There were dozens of the tiny welts. Who did this to you? Is this why you\u2019re the way you are?</p><p>Without thinking, I drew closer and pressed my lips to the ill-treated flesh. Caleb was soft, softer than I\u2019d expected him to be given the firmness of him. Tiny, invisible blond hair met my lips and I smiled against his flesh. I\u2019d never been so close to a man as I was to Caleb. Everything with him was a new discovery. Granted, most things I discovered about Caleb were horrible, but sometimes...sometimes I discovered he was soft.</p><p>I lingered over his bare skin, scooting closer and enjoying him. He never asked me to touch him anymore. I thought about the time he asked me to touch him. I\u2019d been hesitant at the time. I\u2019d hated him. I was surprised to realize I didn\u2019t hate him so much anymore. I felt so many things toward him, and yes, hate was perhaps among them, but there were others too, far more complex than simple hate.</p><p>Caleb planned to sell me. I hated him for that. Everything else? I was shocked to realize I could, perhaps, forgive him. I struggled against the idea every day, at every opportunity, telling myself it would only leave me in ruins...but my heart. My heart, independent of my logic, had reserved a place for my tormentor and my solace.</p> <p>I was lost in my thoughts, stroking Caleb\u2019s back when he let out a gruff sigh and swatted at his shoulder almost hitting me. I flinched and made a startled sound. Abruptly, he turned and grabbed the hand I had used to touch him. We stared at each other for a bit, my eyes wide and nervous, and his presumably confused and a little angry.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked suspiciously. He held my hand as if he\u2019d just pulled it from the proverbial cookie jar, and what could I say \u2013 I looked the part.</p><p>Brazenly, I pulled my hand free and asked, \u201cWhat happened to your back?\u201d He looked at me as if I\u2019d said something distasteful, and then fell back against his pillow as he expelled a big yawn.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Kitten, when I first decided to call you that, I didn\u2019t realize how aptly I\u2019d chosen.\u201d He read my perplexed expression and proceeded. \u201cCuriosity killed the cat.\u201d He smiled, but I didn\u2019t think it was too funny.</p><p>Jokes about killing me. Yeah \u2013 not funny.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop asking, if I tell you?\u201d he said. He stretched. I tried not to be distracted by his nearly naked body and the serious case of morning wood he had going.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I keep asking you if I had the answer?\u201d I said and boldly smiled when he glared at me.</p><p>\u201cThe better question would be: why do I put up with you?\u201d I knew he meant it to be banter, but all he\u2019d done was thrust our situation into awkward focus. We both knew why he put up with me and the answer was shitty.</p><p>I was just about to lie and tell him I wasn\u2019t really curious, but Celia finally came into the room with breakfast. Celia; things were surprisingly not strained between us. She hadn\u2019t been happy Caleb had used her and sent her packing, but the following morning she\u2019d come in, business as usual.</p><p>Once, when Caleb hadn\u2019t spent the night and therefore not been in my room the next morning, I spoke to her again. She\u2019d actually seemed a little frightened when I grabbed her arm and asked her just what that smile she\u2019d given me had been about.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be upset with me,\u201d she\u2019d said, and I felt a little snotty and let her go. \u201cHe brought me here for you,\u201d she continued. Her expression suggested I was stupid for not knowing \u2013 which apparently, I was.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cares for you. He cares for you the way I wish my master would care for me,\u201d she said in an almost sad and thoughtful tone. \u201cIn a way, I was glad you were jealous \u2013 I could see it on your face. It was a nice change from being jealous of you.\u201d</p><p>She had stunned me; I\u2019d never considered she was jealous. I\u2019d never considered my position to be an enviable one.</p> <p>After Celia concluded her morning business, Caleb and I still lay in bed, just the two of us. The feeling grew more and more comfortable as the days and weeks progressed. I still hadn\u2019t been able to convince him to let me roam the mansion \u2013 as Caleb informed me it was, but I could go out onto the balcony if he accompanied me. The view was breathtaking. It appeared to be the quintessential Spanish villa, surrounded by lush fields below and cactus in bloom in large ceramic pots, set on Spanish tile on an extravagant balcony. I\u2019d only dreamed of living places like this. Though, in my dreams, I was never living there as a captive. Semantics.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast on the balcony?\u201d I asked with more enthusiasm than necessary.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWhat do you think this is, a vacation?\u201d I felt a tight pinch in the center of my chest when he teased me. I think I\u2019d rather come to like it. Not the teasing, but the way he smiled when he did.</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d I said, coyly.</p><p>He stretched out again, and put his hands behind his head, then looked at me disbelievingly. He had a grin playing across his lips.</p><p>\u201cDid you...kiss me this morning?\u201d Instant heat rose to my face turning me what had to be at least eight different shades of red. I worked hard to resist the urge to bury my face in my pillow.</p><p>Kill me. Kill me, now!</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even speak, I just shook my head emphatically, but the look in his eyes told me he knew I was lying.</p><p>\u201cYes. You did.\u201d This time his teasing was a little painful. I was really embarrassed and I knew he just wouldn\u2019t let it go, tears started to well up in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t!\u201d I said on a rush of breath, and I felt the heat of my tears cutting across my cheek.</p><p>He rolled his eyes as he sat up. He put his finger under my chin and tilted my head upward. \u201cReally? Tears, Kitten? You kissed me. Against my will, I might add. Shouldn\u2019t I be the one to cry?\u201d he said. He laughed uproariously as I buried my face in my pillow again.</p><p>\u201cOh come on!\u201d he said in an annoyed tone and laid his face next to mine. \u201cI\u2019ll drop it okay.\u201d</p><p>Bringing my head up slowly and wiping away my tears I whispered, \u201cYou promise?\u201d He put his hand around my waist, pulled me close, and rolled me onto my back. Stunned, I simply looked up at him. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. Carefully, I tried to move, but his weight pinned me to the mattress. \u201cBy now, you should know I always get what I want.\u201d</p><p>As I stared up into his enigmatic blue eyes, it was hard to ignore the sensual line of his jaw. It showed the barest trace of his morning stubble. His hair was ruffled from sleep and while I thought it should make him look ridiculous, he was only more handsome. Caleb was a person, bed head and all. But of all the things difficult to ignore about the man on top of me, there was one that stood out...quite literally. He was incredibly hard between my thighs.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d I asked, softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We stared at one another for what felt like an eternity. He looked at me in a way I\u2019d never seen before. I didn\u2019t want to give it a name or classification. I was more than content to just have him look at me with that expression on his face.</p><p>Slowly, I brought my hands up to his face. I couldn\u2019t help myself. Knowing how soft he could be, the urge to touch him was something I didn\u2019t want to fight off.</p><p>He seemed taken aback by my touch and the playful smile he held fell from his face. Our eyes met for the briefest of moments, and my fingers sensed the gentle shake of his head just before I kissed him so hard we both made a hurt sound. My brain fired synapses to every part of my body, and heat flooded my skin and pooled between my thighs. His tongue begged to be allowed into my mouth and I opened up to him. My hands weaved through his hair. He moaned into my mouth, and my hunger for him exploded from a place I had begun to suspect was there for quite some time.</p><p>I started to get a little frightened when he reached down and pulled up my nightgown. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for this. He spread my legs with his body, cradling himself between my thighs. His c**k was incredibly hard. I wanted to say something, protest in some way, but then I felt the heat of him against the wetness I\u2019d created, and I could\u2019ve sworn I heard us sizzle. He withdrew his lips from mine and latched his hot, sucking mouth onto my neck. I threw my head back, surprised by the sensation of both pleasure and pain, a sensation that only became more powerful as the son of a bitch bit me.</p> <p>I gasped loudly and my hands instinctively flexed into fists in his hair and I pulled him backward. \u201cThat hurt!\u201d I said through gritted teeth.</p><p>He pulled my hands free from his hair and held them above my head with his left hand. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know?\u201d he said. The unmistakable look of lust had taken over his features and he appeared almost feral in his intensity.</p><p>I was a little frightened but my desire for him wouldn\u2019t let me care. I pulled his mouth down toward mine. My heart slammed around in my chest as the liquid fire in my veins seemed to burn me from the inside out.</p><p>Abruptly, his touch turned soft and he kissed me so gently I wanted to cry again. \u201cYou\u2019re so wet; my c**k is covered in you,\u201d he whispered against my mouth. I moaned loudly at his words, and I knew my mind was made up.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d I replied. My voice sounded alien to my own ears. His heart beat hard against me and his c**k twitched against my pu**y. He took a deep ragged breath and placed his forehead against my shoulder. In the silence, my hunger feuded with my growing shame over the idea he would say something cruel or make some silly joke. I would be undone.</p> <p>He finally picked his head back up and looked at me. I couldn\u2019t decipher the message in his eyes. He conveyed so many things at once: need, anger, confusion, and something else. \u201cFuck,\u201d he said.</p><p>His shoulders slumped subtly and I worried this was the part where he was going to say something to make me wish I could crawl inside myself and die. I wanted to say something, perhaps offer some preemptive strike, like \u2018I was just kidding\u2019, but I couldn\u2019t say anything. Then, to my relief, he let my hands go and slipped the straps of my nightgown down my shoulders, exposing my br**sts.</p><p>\u201cYou have the most beautiful tits.\u201d Heat crawled over my flesh, and my ni**les tightened.</p><p>\u201cThanks?\u201d I said, unsure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said through a smile and put his mouth around my aching nipple.</p><p>I attempted to wrap my arms around him, but they were trapped in the straps of my nightgown. Overcome by a rush of sensation, I pressed my thighs tightly in an effort to close them and crushed Caleb closer to my body as I writhed under his consuming touch. He sucked and bit at one nipple and then the other, and did not neglect any part in between. I closed my eyes and swam in a sea of pleasure, pain, and longing.</p> <p>I think I love you.</p><p>The thought swirled in my brain like an angry tornado begging me to say the words out loud, but I couldn\u2019t \u2013 I couldn\u2019t possibly. I felt like I might have an orgasm just then, before he was even inside me, before he\u2019d even touched me down there. I teetered on the edge, which felt both delicious and annoying.</p><p>Say it! I think I love you.</p><p>He reached down between our bodies and slid his underwear past his erection.</p><p>Oh my god! Oh my god!</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, breathless. Caleb paused.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. He sounded genuine in his concern.</p><p>\u201cBe gentle, okay,\u201d I whispered and resigned myself. The look in his eyes turned devastating. It was as if he wanted to tear me apart with his teeth, and I probably would have let him.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Kitten. I\u2019m not going to f**k you,\u201d he said through a rueful grin.</p><p>Before I could ask him why the hell not, the hot pulse of his thick shaft splayed the lips of my sex. He rubbed the hard, yet pliant flesh of his c**k against the swollen bud of my clit and I was paralyzed. Desperate, mewling sounds came out of my throat, and my hips instinctively rocked back and forth against the heat of him. I was going to come, and it was going to be incredible. Up and down he moved his c**k against my sensitive flesh, and all I could do was pine as I tried to get my stupid arms out of my nightgown so I could touch him.</p><p>His mouth traveled up my body and nestled at the nape of my neck. He bit me again, but this time I inclined toward him. \u201cDoes it feel good, Pet?\u201d he asked in a voice dripping with arrogance \u2013 I didn\u2019t care. I nodded fervently, and looked for his mouth. He let his lips dance just above mine, all the while keeping his rhythm against my clit.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear you say it. Tell me it feels good. Tell me how much you want me to make that little pu**y of yours come.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My. God!</p><p>Every muscle in my body tightened all at once. The opening of my pu**y contracted, and grasped at what wasn\u2019t there. My heart pounded and my hands grabbed at the sheets while my legs pressed against Caleb as hard as they could. Orgasm ripped through my body indiscriminately, engulfing everything in its path, and I was so overwhelmed, tears ran down my face.</p><p>\u201cI love you!\u201d I screamed. I couldn\u2019t help myself and I kept crying, even as Caleb\u2019s hot se**n splashed against my sex and belly.</p><p>He panted hard and grabbed at his cock, expelling everything he had onto me. Then he grabbed my ass tightly and squeezed me as his mouth once again found mine. He kissed me until we both settled some, and then gently collapsed against me.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Caleb knew his weight was probably crushing Livvie, but he wasn\u2019t quite ready to address this new and provocative situation. He supposed it was common for a person, especially a female person, to say incredulous things in the throes of passion, but he couldn\u2019t actually say it had ever happened to him before. She had said she loved him. She\u2019d said it during a very intense orgasm, but she\u2019d said it just the same. Even now, he felt the heat and wetness of her tears against his shoulder. She wasn\u2019t sobbing, or blubbering. In fact, the way she was caressing his thigh with her fingertips suggested she was quite content if not sated.</p><p>Wanting suddenly to put an end to his discomfort, stemming both from his own thoughts as well as the feeling of heat and stickiness, he moved to disengage himself from Livvie. She made a series of adjusting sounds as he peeled off of her, wiping the se**n off of his lower abdomen with the edge of her nightgown. She scrunched her nose, as if it were the most disgusting thing she\u2019d ever seen; he didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the feelings running through him. He replayed the incident in his mind, trying to find the exact moment in which he\u2019d lost control and fallen under the spell of the woman who was supposed to be his captive. She couldn\u2019t even move, yet it was impossible to ignore the hold she had over him with her big innocent eyes and pouty trembling mouth.</p><p>He pulled his boxers up and sat on the edge of the bed, trying to think of what to say. He heard her sigh contentedly just before the warmth of her cheek pressed against his back causing a mild tingle to spread through him. She wrapped her arms loosely around his waist.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t,\u201d Livvie whispered softly against his back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever something nice happens...between us...you\u2019re mean after.\u201d Livvie pressed herself against his back and held him tighter.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s confusion was turning toward anger, but he knew she was right. His instinct was to lash out in an effort to get distance between him and Livvie. He\u2019d called her a coward, threatened her with humiliation and violence, even f**ked another woman in front of her to try and stop whatever was happening between them. None of it worked. Here they were in yet another emotionally compromising situation. It was exhausting.</p><p>\u201cI love you!\u201d Livvie\u2019s words echoed through Caleb\u2019s thoughts. He looked down at Livvie\u2019s arms, the way she held him there. He realized it was a silent plea: \u201cI could stay with you...be with you.\u201d Caleb closed his eyes and let himself place his hand on her arm, holding her there in return.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he replied, knowing his words were odd. Livvie had neither asked a question nor requested a response, but he just knew she would understand what he was trying to say.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Caleb? Why can\u2019t you?\u201d she whispered. Caleb swallowed thickly. She did understand. He\u2019d known she would, but it affected him nonetheless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because none of this makes any f**king sense! He wanted to yell the words, but said, \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t, Caleb. You don\u2019t have to go.\u201d Her arms gripped him like a vise.</p><p>Caleb wanted to correct her, yet again, for using his name, but it felt ridiculous to do so at this point. Livvie was just too f**king stubborn. It didn\u2019t matter what he said or did. Ultimately, there were simply some orders she would not obey. If there was any compromise on the issue, it was she didn\u2019t do it in front of others.</p><p>\u201cI need to take a shower,\u201d he said in the hopes logic would prevail.</p> <p>\u201cI need to take one too,\u201d she countered. \u201cWe could take one together? I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Caleb laughed ruefully, \u201cYou don\u2019t need my help. You hate my help.\u201d</p><p>Livvie rubbed her cheek against Caleb\u2019s back as she laughed. \u201cAll the more reason for you to help me. You love doing things when I ask you not to, it\u2019s kinda your thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it,\u201d Caleb agreed.</p><p>\u201cIt is. Also...\u201d she shifted uncomfortably, \u201cthere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about.\u201d Caleb was begrudgingly intrigued by the hesitant, but excited tone of her voice.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what, exactly, might that be?\u201d Caleb asked.</p><p>Livvie shifted her body until she was on her knees behind him and then pressed her naked br**sts against his back to whisper in his ear. Caleb\u2019s eyes widened ever so slightly and his heart picked up speed.</p><p>Over the last few months, Caleb had taken advantage during their sexual encounters, and though she\u2019d always been incredibly wet when he touched her and she had several orgasms, he\u2019d always suspected her heart had not been in it \u2013 and he hadn\u2019t cared. Somehow, things were different now.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d intended only to play the game they\u2019d always played, the one featuring him as The Big Bad Wolf and her as frightened Little Red Riding Hood. He hadn\u2019t been prepared for the kiss or....</p><p>\u201cI love you!\u201d</p> <p>After she\u2019d been injured, he\u2019d treated her like spun glass. He\u2019d been careful not to injure her further, or cause her unnecessary pain. Unfortunately, it had also allowed her to work herself into more than his thoughts. For the first time since his life had descended into this dark place, something akin to caring for another person found a place to thrive inside him.</p><p>It seemed a lifetime had passed since Caleb had been made to submit to the will of another: It had nearly killed him the last time. Still, her hold on him...was far more than physical. \u201cKitten?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Livvie said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cI came on you,\u201d Caleb said through a laugh.</p><p>Livvie laughed, \u201cYep.\u201d She kissed Caleb\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sticky, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Livvie said.</p><p>Caleb walked into the bathroom and stared at first the shower and then the bath. Either would serve their purpose, but each had its own appeal. The shower had a bench, and the glass enclosure trapped steam to keep them comfortable when not under the direct spray. Caleb had a vision of pressing Livvie up against the glass. It left him light headed for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cThe shower or the tub?\u201d asked Livvie.</p><p>\u201cI was just asking myself the same. I suppose it\u2019s up to you. This is your fantasy after all,\u201d Caleb grinned and turned to watch Livvie blush.</p><p>She playfully slapped him on the chest. \u201cYeah, right! I\u2019m sure you\u2019re just gonna hate it.\u201d She smiled brightly, but then seemed to doubt herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Caleb asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just...\u201d she bit at her bottom lip then started picking at it with her fingernails.</p><p>Caleb pulled her hand away from her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s just, what? Change your mind?\u201d He was at once relieved and annoyed.</p><p>She shook her head slightly. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just...I\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d She looked down at her feet, up at him, then back down.</p><p>Caleb wanted to help her out, he really did. He wanted to let her know it didn\u2019t matter. Anything she deigned to do to him, or with him, would be perfect. But frankly, watching her squirm was too much fun to pass up.</p><p>\u201cNever done what before?\u201d he asked and went toward the shower to turn it on. This could get messy. The shower was perfect for messy.</p><p>Livvie rolled her eyes in exasperation, \u201cYou know what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitten,\u201d he said as the sound of running water echoed around the room, \u201cIf you can\u2019t say it, how do you expect to do it?\u201d Livvie blushed and Caleb smiled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me, Caleb. I don\u2019t like to be made fun of,\u201d she said and covered her br**sts. Caleb didn\u2019t like that so much.</p><p>He stepped closer, building his own arousal by taking Livvie in with his eyes. She was beautiful. She\u2019d healed almost completely and Caleb couldn\u2019t help but feel...grateful. There would be no scars for Livvie. At least, not on the outside.</p><p>The thought of Livvie\u2019s mental scars brought him up short. He\u2019d been having dreams lately, old memories bombarding him in the middle of the night. When he\u2019d first been rescued they had been an almost nightly occurrence, but after a year or two with Rafiq they had stopped. The stronger he\u2019d become, the more sure of himself and his destiny, the more peaceful his sleep. He hated to speculate on why the dreams would return now and why so many of them involved Rafiq.</p><p>Caleb stood in front of Livvie and pulled her head to his chest. \u201cI wasn\u2019t making fun, but Kitten...we shouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d Caleb was surprised to have Livvie squirm out of his arms and push him back. He stumbled back a step, but quickly set himself to rights.</p><p>Livvie glared at him, \u201cNo. We\u2019re doing this. You\u2019re going to take off those shorts and get in the shower,\u201d she pointed, \u201cand I\u2019m going to...to....\u201d</p><p>Caleb crossed his arms and watched in smug amusement as Livvie struggled to get the words out and blushed something furious in the process. \u201cTo suck my dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! That!\u201d Livvie said seriously.</p><p>Caleb laughed, \u201cNot until you say it. In fact, not until you beg me.\u201d</p><p>Livvie\u2019s eyes held a spark of outrage. \u201cYou want me, to beg you, to let me suck your dick? That\u2019s...that\u2019s...you\u2019re a pig.\u201d</p><p>Caleb straightened. \u201cNo, I\u2019m your Master.\u201d Some of the color seemed to drain from Livvie\u2019s face. \u201cDid you forget? Does allowing you to use my name when we\u2019re alone make it any less true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Caleb. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Caleb wasn\u2019t angry, a little unsettled maybe, but not angry. He reasoned that perhaps returning to some sort of normalcy would get them past their awkwardness. \u201cYou can call me by my name when we\u2019re alone, I\u2019ve come to expect it, but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re allowed to forget who and what I am to you. Understand?\u201d He pushed an errant lock of raven hair behind her ear. It had gotten so much longer. Beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb,\u201d she whispered and inclined her head into his hand. Slowly, her eyes focused on his, her pupils growing larger. \u201cPlease, Caleb, let me suck your dick.\u201d</p><p>Caleb was definitely light headed. Hearing her say dirty things turned him on to point of physical ache. He cleared his throat, \u201cGet in the shower, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>Her hand reached for him and boldly wrapped around his dick. Caleb hissed and pushed her toward the shower, pinning her against the warm glass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to repeat myself,\u201d Caleb said. Livvie gripped Caleb\u2019s c**k even harder and he moaned above her head, rocking his hips into her hand. This was a side of her Caleb hadn\u2019t seen, not sexually. He liked it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so hard,\u201d she groaned and writhed against him.</p><p>\u201cTake it out,\u201d Caleb urged and the longing in his voice was a shock. He ran his hands into her hair, loving the feel of her warm breath against his wrist. He looked into the liquid black pool of her eyes; she was so innocent, so striking. He licked his lips, hungrily preparing his assault upon his prey, bowing his head down toward her mouth. She pulled back, their eyes meeting in an awkward, sensuous moment. Her eyes continued to look at his as she slid down onto her knees.</p><p>Caleb let out a hushed moan as her shaky fingers curled along the inside of the waistband of his shorts. He tilted his head back wanting to relish every moment of her soft fingers on his skin. He rocked forward as his shorts slid down and finally her fingers made contact with his rigid flesh, freeing him. It seemed nothing else existed, nothing, but Livvie. She reached out carefully and wrapped her hand around his hot length. Though she squeezed him, her fingers barely touched.</p><p>Unable to resist, he rocked forward touching it to her lips, \u201cYou\u2019re such a brat. I told you to get in the show\u2013\u201d He couldn\u2019t get out the rest because Livvie\u2019s tongue swept across the tip of his cock. He watched, stunned, as Livvie pulled away and his precome left a slick trail on her bottom lip. Her kitten tongue darted out to collect it.</p><p>Livvie swallowed, \u201cYou taste good.\u201d</p><p>Caleb took in a breath that rattled in his chest. \u201cYou taste better,\u201d he said and ran his thumb across her plump, pink lip. He couldn\u2019t wait to get back in her mouth and watch those sexy f**king lips sliding up and down his cock. He groaned when she opened her mouth and sucked his thumb into her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKitten. Get in the f**king shower. Now.\u201d</p><p>Livvie gave his thumb one last loving lick, \u201cYes, Caleb.\u201d She stood slowly and opened the shower door. Steam drifted out, already dusting her body with beads of moisture.</p><p>Caleb hurried her along, eager to touch her, to be touched by her. He shut the shower door behind him and a moment later snatched her up and pinned her to the wall with his body. Warm water cascaded from the showerhead above them as he lifted her legs around his waist and held her in place while they kissed.</p><p>Livvie moaned into his mouth, her hands gripping his shoulders and pulling him even closer. Her legs squeezed him, pressing her untried pu**y against Caleb\u2019s stomach in a frantic plea for his attentions.</p> <p>Caleb\u2019s hands roamed her slick body, cupping her ass and digging his fingers into her firm and pliable flesh. Reluctant to move on, but eager to enjoy the rest of her, he slid his hand up to her left br**sts, his thumb and index finger finding her pebbled nipple and rolling it as his hips gyrated. His cock, hard and leaking, bumped against her ass and Caleb curved his body, seeking the warm cleft between her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh. God.\u201d Livvie moaned. She joined in Caleb\u2019s rhythm, loosening her arms so her ass met Caleb\u2019s slippery cock.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Caleb shouted, squeezing Livvie until she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, my ribs,\u201d she said softly and without halting her movements against him.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Caleb lessened his hold slightly. Only enough to stop hurting her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Livvie moaned and rocked against him, \u201cI thought I was going to suck your dick.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s c**k throbbed and leapt between Livvie\u2019s ass cheeks. If he waited any longer, he was going to demand to get in her ass. The thought was enough to get more sounds out of him, but damn it, he wanted a blowjob. Abruptly, he set Livvie on her feet and gave her a moment to gain her balance before he put his hand on her shoulder and urged her to her knees in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYou are. Right now,\u201d he said.</p><p>There was no discussion, no hesitation, and Caleb\u2019s chest seemed to expand with pride as Livvie licked her lips and put her mouth on him. Caleb\u2019s knees buckled slightly and he could not resist thrusting into her mouth, forcing her to regain her balance. He grunted low, as if he didn\u2019t want her to hear, thrusting as much as he could without holding her head in his hands and having his way.</p><p>Her mouth was warm and caressingly tender despite her obvious inexperience. She held him in her hands, licking the head of his c**k slowly, and then putting it in her mouth. Caleb fought every impulse to force himself deeper. He wanted her to do it on her own.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she moaned.</p> <p>Caleb echoed her sounds, loving the vibration of her mouth against his dick. He wanted more. More. More. More. Her touch and her mouth were all over the place in their intention. Pain and pleasure mingled every time she accidentally grazed him with her teeth, but then caressed the spot with her tongue.</p><p>\u201cDeeper, Livvie. Please, deeper,\u201d he found himself saying. He couldn\u2019t think straight and didn\u2019t realize what he\u2019d said.</p><p>Livvie whimpered as she endeavored to take him deeper, her mouth stretching over his shaft. Teeth scraped him, but he didn\u2019t care, he knew it would be impossible to get even half of it into her mouth.</p><p>Caleb refused to take control. He was getting off on the fact this was her fantasy and not his own. He wondered how long she\u2019d wanted to do suck him off and lamented the time wasted. Livvie went deep and Caleb felt her throat contract around the head of his c**k before she pulled away to take air into her lungs.</p><p>Caleb clenched his hands into fists at his sides, determined to let her breathe before he demanded to be let back into her warm, wet mouth. He sighed when she rested one hand against his thigh for balance and with the other, held his c**k in place as she took him back in.</p><p>She increased her pace, keeping her eyes closed and focusing on her rhythm. It was almost more than Caleb could stand. Unable to resist, he reached down for his c**k and wrapped his hand around hers, guiding it up and down with the rhythm of her mouth.</p><p>She slowed, and Caleb fought not to thrust. Harder. Faster. Deeper. Caleb held her hand firmly, moving it up and down the length of him. With his other hand he caressed her face, coaxing her mouth to continue its maddening suckling, relieved when it began anew. Caleb removed his hand, letting Livvie have her way once more. His hand was covered in Livvie\u2019s saliva, much like his cock.</p><p>Livvie mewled and moaned around his cock, sucking him deeper as her lust grew and her instincts took over. Her hand pumped him and she moved her lips with growing speed and firm pressure over the tip of his cock.</p> <p>Caleb was nearing his crisis, his body tense as a drawn bow. He breathed heavily and his hands kneaded Livvie\u2019s shoulders, encouraging her. Suddenly, he grabbed fists of her hair and pulled his c**k out of her wet mouth.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Livvie was powerless as he pushed himself almost violently back into her mouth and pumped only a few times before coming long and hard into Livvie\u2019s mouth. She moaned, but her hands pushed against his thighs.</p><p>Caleb couldn\u2019t stop himself, couldn\u2019t help the way he held her still, emptying himself. He felt her trying to swallow the salty fluid overwhelming her mouth, but there was too much. It trickled down her chin and down her neck. Caleb growled from deep in his throat and his knees gave way under him until he straddled her. He kissed her over and over, sucking on her lips and searching for her tongue. His taste in her mouth felt like a claim, a brand.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he whispered to no one at all, kissing her neck.</p><p>Livvie panted hard into Caleb\u2019s ear, gripping him close and returning his fervent kisses. She grabbed Caleb\u2019s hand and pressed his fingers to her clit, whimpering for attention.</p><p>\u201cOnly fair,\u201d Caleb whispered. He circled her clit hard and fast with his fingertips, and within seconds, he felt the hot rush of Livvie\u2019s juices rushing out of her pu**y, as she came apart in his arms for the second time.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh, oh,\u201d she moaned against his ear, \u201cI love you. Oh, god, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb was too sated to care she\u2019d said it again.</p><p>Slowly, the world began to come into focus and Caleb peeled himself away from Livvie to help her onto her shaky feet. Their eyes met briefly before Livvie turned her face toward the spray of water over head. Caleb felt a twinge of anger as he watched her rinse her mouth out, but realized it had to be done. He tried not to take it personally.</p><p>She\u2019d given him so much, opened herself so fully and exposed a part of her Caleb had never seen or touched in another human being. He felt he should offer something in return. He longed to offer something in return and unable to think of anything else, he said, \u201cI was almost beaten to death when I was a teenager.\u201d Livvie jolted to attention, her gaze fixed on Caleb. He reached for the soap and began to lather it in his hands, before he turned Livvie toward the wall and began soaping her skin.</p><p>\u201cI was younger than you. I know that much. A man named, Narweh, used a bullwhip on me. There was a lot of blood. The beating left scars, but I would have died if...if Rafiq hadn\u2019t saved my life.\u201d Caleb cleared his throat and focused on soaping.</p><p>Livvie tried to turn and face him, but Caleb wouldn\u2019t allow it. He simply moved her body in the direction he wanted and continued to wash her.</p><p>Her deadened voice broke the silence, \u201cWhy would someone do that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was....\u201d He couldn\u2019t tell her. He couldn\u2019t tell her about the person he\u2019d been, or the things he\u2019d done. She was the one person who deserved to know, but he refused to say. \u201cI was too weak to defend myself. Instead, I went back later and killed him.\u201d He chuckled, lost in thought. \u201cWith the gun you pulled on me, in fact.\u201d</p><p>Livvie was tense under his hands, her shoulders knotted. \u201cIs that...? Is that the reason you feel like you owe Rafiq? Because he saved your life?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s hands inadvertently clenched and Livvie hissed in pain. He immediately let her go and reached for more soap. \u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Livvie didn\u2019t face him. She simply stared at the wall. \u201cWhat about me, Caleb? Don\u2019t you think you owe me anything?\u201d</p><p>Caleb regretted having said anything at all. What had he been thinking to say anything so personal? And to Livvie of all people \u2013 whom he planned to subjugate for his own ends to repay a twelve year debt? It was reckless and stupid beyond anything he\u2019d done so far.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. It felt like a lie. It was a lie. He owed her plenty. He\u2019d been na\u00efve to think he\u2019d ever be free of his debt. He\u2019d always owe someone. \u201cBut if you ever want your revenge against me, you let me know.\u201d</p><p>Livvie said nothing for several minutes before she turned to look at Caleb, \u201cI don\u2019t want revenge, Caleb. I don\u2019t want to end up like you, letting some f**king vendetta run my life. I just want my freedom. I want to be free, Caleb. Not someone\u2019s whore...not even yours.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s throat felt like it was on fire as he acknowledged the sincerity in Livvie\u2019s words. This had been her game the entire time. He\u2019d known it, reminded himself repeatedly, even begrudgingly respected her attempts \u2013 but he\u2019d still fallen for it. He deserved every bit of what he was getting. He knew it and didn\u2019t care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stepped forward, prodding Kitten out of the way and rinsed his body beneath the cooling spray of the water. He could feel Kitten\u2019s stare on his body, but refused to acknowledge her. Once he was done rinsing, he opened the glass shower door, grabbed a towel and headed for the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving!\u201d Kitten cried, busting out of the shower and gripping his arm.</p><p>Caleb pushed her away somewhat forcefully and continued into the bedroom. \u201cI have a lot of things to do today. You\u2019ve taken up too much of my time lately as it is,\u201d he said coldly. For a moment he looked about the room for his pants, then realized he hadn\u2019t come in wearing any because he\u2019d come to address her late-night ranting some time after he\u2019d gone to bed. He glanced at her face and saw the hurt in her eyes, tears stood at the ready. She swallowed hard to keep them at bay as her hands covered her br**sts.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to go now, after everything? I thought...\u201d her voice trailed off, teetering somewhere between anger and hurt. Something twisted inside Caleb\u2019s stomach at the sight of her. He wanted to kiss her and tell her things that would make her stop crying; but then just the thought he\u2019d considered such a thing solidified his anger and resolve.</p> <p>\u201cYou thought what? You thought offering me a little pu**y was going to make some kind of a difference? You thought you\u2019d suck my dick and I\u2019d just give you whatever the f**k you wanted?!\u201d</p><p>His words cut her deeply, as he intended. He wanted to make sure there was absolutely no confusion. He walked toward her and tilted her chin upward and she instinctively recoiled, trying to get away from his hand. He gripped her harder, holding her in place.</p><p>\u201cI did think it was really cute when you said you loved me though.\u201d He visibly saw her shoulders slump then and her eyes closed slowly. He let her face go and without hysterics she walked toward the bed and put her head down onto her pillow and crawled into a ball.</p><p>For a few moments, he waited for her to retaliate, but she said nothing. He walked calmly toward the door, opened it, and walked through without a glance in her direction. He closed the door behind him gently, and awkwardly wondered why he suddenly felt hollow. Wrapped in nothing but a towel, he made his way toward his room.</p><p>Once inside his room, Caleb stood for a moment, staring into nothingness as water dripped off of him. Livvie had said she loved him and he\u2019d made her feel stupid. Something in his gut twisted at the thought and at the memory of her tears. He often thought she looked beautiful when she cried, because she was nervous, or afraid, or embarrassed, but these weren\u2019t the same; he\u2019d really hurt her. She\u2019d hurt, him, too. Caleb couldn\u2019t change who he was.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t thought about Rafiq in a very long time. He\u2019d been too busy playing house with Livvie. Too busy to think about the debt he owed and why he owed it. It was probably the reason Rafiq had been in his dreams as of late. It was his subconscious\u2019 way of reminding him not to lose focus. He\u2019d ignored it. He couldn\u2019t do it anymore.</p><p>The night before, he\u2019d had a dream about speaking with Rafiq about the murder of his mother and sister. Caleb had been in Rafiq\u2019s study, learning the English alphabet and the sound each letter made. He\u2019d been proud to discover he could use the sounds of the letters to make sense of words. They had begun to look less like a collection of squiggly lines and slowly, but surely, he could read some words without sounding them out.</p><p>Rafiq had been teaching him English and Spanish at the same time, because they used the same letters. It had been confusing at first, because they didn\u2019t make the same sounds, but Caleb was learning. The Arabic and Urdu were much harder to read, but easier to speak because he\u2019d grown up with them. His Russian was a mess on both counts, but Rafiq insisted he learn it.</p><p>Caleb knew he had to learn the Russian because it was Vladek\u2019s native tongue. Caleb had become hungry for information about Vladek after Narweh\u2019s death, but Rafiq often refused to give too much detail when it came to the murders of this mother and sister.</p><p>Somewhere in his mind, Caleb knew the incident was painful for Rafiq, but as Caleb didn\u2019t have a mother or any siblings he knew of, it was difficult to wrap his mind around Rafiq\u2019s emotions. With the exception of Rafiq\u2019s thirst for revenge, which Caleb understood empirically, he often wondered what Rafiq was dealing with emotionally.</p><p>Rafiq had given him a long speech about family, loyalty, duty and honor. He said he had had responsibilities to his father and to his country.</p> <p>\u201cI expect obedience, Caleb. I expect your loyalty. Anyone who betrays me will only do it once. Do you understand?\u201d Rafiq had said ominously.</p><p>\u201cYes, Rafiq, I understand,\u201d Caleb had replied.</p><p>Caleb finally returned from his far off thoughts and began to dry off and dress. It was going to be a shitty day. That much, was obvious.</p><p>A knock on the door drew his attention. He answered and Celia immediately cast her eyes downward and held a deep curtsy.</p><p>\u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 quieres?\u201d he asked more harshly than he intended.</p><p>Celia stood slowly, eyeing him with confusion, but then explained her master, Felipe, had requested an audience with him.</p><p>Caleb reluctantly agreed to come down stairs after he was fully dressed. He also reminded her to please feed Kitten. He wouldn\u2019t be returning to her room for the day and he didn\u2019t want her starved. Celia nodded, gave him what he interpreted to be a judgmental look and walked away. Caleb slammed the door behind her.</p><p>Caleb dressed quickly, but not because he was in any particular hurry. Afterward, he descended the stairs and met Celia at the bottom. He noted the stern expression and instinctively knew it had to do with the state in which he\u2019d left Kitten. However, he had better things to do than indulge the scorn of someone else\u2019s f**k toy.</p> <p>\u201cTake me to him,\u201d he said.</p><p>Celia eyed him with open disdain, but still dipped her head in acknowledgment and led the way to Felipe\u2019s library. It was the same room in which he\u2019d first encountered Rafiq, and for a moment, he had to wonder if it was truly, Felipe, who would greet him when he entered. He squared his shoulders and prepared himself mentally for any eventuality.</p><p>Celia knocked on the library door and waited for Felipe\u2019s recognition before she glared at Caleb one final time and walked away in a huff.</p><p>Fuck you, too.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Se\u00f1or Caleb. Let us have a conversation,\u201d Felipe said jovially. Whatever was up Celia\u2019s ass, Felipe didn\u2019t seem to share it. \u201cMay I offer you a scotch?\u201d Caleb entered the library and took the beverage Felipe offered.</p><p>\u201cGracias,\u201d Caleb said and took a seat in a reading chair near one of the book shelves. He refused to sit across from Felipe\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cDe nada,\u201d Felipe replied and joined Caleb by the books.</p><p>Caleb got comfortable in his seat and sipped from his scotch. It was perhaps too early to be drinking, but he reasoned it had already been a long day. He was eager to get this conversation with Felipe over with and find more interesting diversions for the day. \u201cForgive me, Felipe, but why am I here?\u201d Caleb got to the point.</p><p>Felipe smiled and sipped from his glass. \u201cI only want to talk. You and your slave have been here for quite some time and we have shared very few conversations.\u201d</p><p>Caleb sighed, but tried to keep it respectful, \u201cWhat did you want to discuss?\u201d</p><p>Felipe leaned back. \u201cSo serious, my friend. How are things progressing with the girl?\u201d Felipe asked. He was too casual for Caleb\u2019s taste.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly, fine?\u201d Felipe seemed incredulous.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s face warmed with a building anger. \u201cFelipe, I realize you\u2019re a friend of Rafiq\u2019s, but I fail to see how the girl is any of your business. As you\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve been here for a while, why the sudden interest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitten,\u201d Felipe said through an obnoxiously saccharine smile, \u201cThe girl\u2019s name is \u2018Kitten\u2019 is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Caleb said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cWell, Caleb,\u201d Felipe\u2019s expression suddenly turned sinister, \u201cKitten is your business, but Celia is mine and seeing as you\u2019ve involved yourself in my business, I don\u2019t see my questions as an intrusion in yours.\u201d</p><p>Caleb had expected this sooner. \u201cWhat do you want, Felipe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to be quite honest Caleb, you\u2019ve overstepped yourself and done my house a great dishonor. My purpose here is to let you make it right.\u201d Fire spread through Caleb\u2019s body and anger flashed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTo what dishonor, are you referring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the one,\u201d Felipe said. Malice edged his tone.</p><p>\u201cI did nothing out of the ordinary, and I had no idea you were so enamored with your property. You obviously don\u2019t feel as strongly about your horses. I believe I rode one of them once as well.\u201d Caleb was purposely smug.</p><p>Felipe\u2019s entire body tensed with rage, but he smiled nonetheless, \u201cYou should be careful, Caleb,\u201d Felipe said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m a very dangerous man in some circles and I happen to know a great many things about a great many people. Including you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch yourself,\u201d Caleb said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching, Caleb. I\u2019ve been watching you. And, Kitten,\u201d Felipe said. Suddenly, he was the smug one. \u201cI wonder what Rafiq would think if he saw what you\u2019ve been up to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about,\u201d Caleb growled.</p><p>\u201cCameras, Caleb. A man like me, in the business I\u2019m in, I can trust no one. And so, I watch. Everyone,\u201d Felipe said and smiled.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s heart hammered fiercely in his chest, but he did his best to remain calm. He thought about what had happened between him and Kitten since they had arrived. He thought of all the things he\u2019d confessed to her, believing they were alone. It was enough to have him seething with rage and thrumming with anxiety. \u201cWhat do you want, Felipe?\u201d</p><p>Felipe shook his head, \u201cI really didn\u2019t want it to go this way, Caleb. Truthfully, I wish you no ill will. I only wanted to talk. You\u2019re the one who made this nasty.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb tried his hand at feigning remorse, \u201cMy apologies. I\u2019ve had a bad morning.\u201d</p><p>Felipe smiled, \u201cYes, I know. However, I plan to keep what I know to myself. I only wish for you to grant me a favor.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s jaw hurt from how hard he was grinding his teeth, \u201cWhat favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a party tomorrow night. I would love it if you and Kitten would attend,\u201d Felipe said cordially.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? You want us to attend?\u201d Caleb didn\u2019t buy it.</p> <p>Felipe quirked an eyebrow. \u201cWell...seeing as you\u2019ve made use of my Celia, I was hoping I could borrow yours for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t mine and you know she\u2019s a virgin,\u201d Caleb said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I also know she has other talents that don\u2019t require her to be...\u201d he pretended to struggle for a word, \u201ccompromised.\u201d</p><p>Caleb wanted nothing more than to grab Felipe by the throat and choke the life out of him in a slow and satisfying fashion, but he knew it would only make matters worse. \u201cI want whatever you have and your assurances Rafiq will hear nothing on the matter.\u201d</p><p>Felipe smiled and nodded. \u201cOf course, Caleb. I know you care for the girl. Rafiq won\u2019t like it, but I understand. She\u2019s quite...intriguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Caleb ground out.</p> <p>\u201cShe loves you,\u201d Felipe said.</p><p>Caleb side swept those words. \u201cWill Rafiq be at the party? He\u2019s been difficult to get in touch with lately,\u201d he said instead.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Felipe said, \u201cthese things are always so unfortunate, when they happen.\u201d</p><p>Caleb watched the other man very carefully. \u201cWhat are you getting at, Felipe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafiq\u2019s been pulling away from you.\u201d His expression was amazed when Caleb didn\u2019t respond. \u201cAre you so involved with your plaything that you haven\u2019t you noticed?\u201d</p><p>Caleb set his drink down. He didn\u2019t believe it. The mere implication was untenable. \u201cThe auction is in a little over two weeks, he\u2019s been preoccupied. I know he\u2019ll be here any day. I\u2019m asking you if he\u2019ll be at the party tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Felipe said ominously. \u201cI believe he will. Don\u2019t you think it would be a perfect opportunity to showcase all the progress you\u2019ve made with the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Caleb whispered. His thoughts were upstairs with Kitten and his chest felt simultaneously empty and too full. Their time was coming to an end.</p> <p>No, it\u2019s already over. Let her go, Caleb.</p><p>Caleb stood and left the room. He\u2019d had enough bullshit confrontations for one day.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Two in the morning. Caleb stood outside Kitten\u2019s door absorbing the knowledge he didn\u2019t have much of a choice in what had to happen next. After his confrontation with Felipe he\u2019d spent the day going through his room. He\u2019d found several cameras and still could not be certain he\u2019d found them all. Felipe was a sick bastard, an obvious voyeur with no sense of decency or shame.</p><p>Caleb had half expected someone to try and stop him from shattering every lens he found, but no one did. In fact, everyone had stayed away from him. Caleb wasn\u2019t sure if it was a good thing. He would have loved to take his frustration out on someone.</p><p>After he was reasonably sure he\u2019d done away with the cameras, he thought long and hard about everything Felipe could potentially know. The answers were nauseating. He\u2019d found cameras in the shower, discreetly hidden in the vent. What he\u2019d assumed to be a screw holding the lights above the bathroom mirror had turned out to be a camera. Felipe had them everywhere. He\u2019d seen Caleb masturbate, f**k, and even punish himself.</p><p>Caleb decided he\u2019d kill Felipe when the time was right. For now, Felipe held strong cards and Caleb had none to play. Rafiq would be returning tomorrow night. He would want to see Kitten and make sure she was ready. He would want Caleb and Kitten to return to Pakistan with him and prepare for the auction in Karachi.</p><p>It was all coming to an end and there was nothing Caleb could do to prevent the inevitable. There was nothing he could do unless he was prepared to surrender everything he knew, perhaps even his very life. Caleb had struggled too long and fought too hard to survive. Forfeiting now was unacceptable.</p><p>Caleb opened the door slowly and entered Kitten\u2019s room. He noticed immediately she hadn\u2019t turned on her nightlight which was uncharacteristic of her and made the room unusually dark. He took a moment to adjust to the dark though he didn\u2019t really need it. He\u2019d been in her room enough times to have memorized the layout. He came close to the bed and heard Kitten breathing. For a moment he thought about leaving the room and letting her sleep in peace, but he steadied himself \u2013 it had to be now.</p><p>He opened the curtains and let the moonlight come spilling into the room and onto her sleeping form. He studied her intently and noticed her eyes were red and puffy. Her body was wrapped around one pillow and her hair lay across another, the comforter pulled up to her chin. He reached out and touched her hair. Kitten sighed fretfully and buried herself deeper in her blanket.</p><p>\u201cBe gentle,\u201d she\u2019d said, as he\u2019d looked into her eyes earlier. He lifted a corner of the comforter and encountered her naked shoulder and a little lower, her bare back and ribs.</p><p>\u201cIf only I could be,\u201d he whispered into the dark, certain she couldn\u2019t hear him. He threw back her blanket and lust tugged sharp in his belly.</p><p>Kitten woke, startled and naked, before she sat up and covered herself with a pillow. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d She rubbed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d he said with enough bravado to let her know he was in no mood for protests. She hesitated for only a moment, then cast the pillow aside and stood in front of him with a questioning expression. He looked into her eyes steadily and saw the questions disappear as she looked toward her feet.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said and walked to the door with her trailing close behind. They walked down the hallway in silence, which was both better and worse, Caleb thought. He glanced back expecting to see her eyes wandering, but she seemed more preoccupied with her own shivering.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold?\u201d he asked. He stepped down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cA little, Master,\u201d she replied smoothly. He stopped for a moment, surprised at her address, then continued walking.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be for long.\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t relish the idea of pushing Kitten away for good. It didn\u2019t give him any satisfaction to know she would soon come to hate him with such fervor as to annihilate any warm sentiments she may or may not harbor toward him. He didn\u2019t like knowing Felipe, and possibly Celia, had been watching her, watching them, since they arrived. Without exception, he loathed the thought of her being sold to Vladek Rostrovich. Regardless, he had spent the day trying to make peace with each of those things.</p><p>As he descended the stairs, he could hear Kitten\u2019s naked feet slapping against the marble behind him. He glanced back and watched her br**sts bounce as she took each step. If there was anything left to be excited about, it was the guilty pleasure of still having time to spend with Kitten. Even if, the time would be spent torturing her with pleasure or pain...or perhaps, because of it.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s tastes, while narrowing toward a specific person, had not changed. He still liked power and control. He still liked tasting Kitten\u2019s tears and forcing her to ache for pleasure she\u2019d first said she didn\u2019t want. In short, he was still the sick f**k he\u2019d always been and he was going to enjoy every minute of what he had waiting in the dungeon downstairs. He\u2019d been sure to sweep for cameras.</p><p>As he reached the bottom of the steps he turned and waited for Kitten. \u201cStop looking around and hurry up,\u201d Caleb prodded.</p><p>Kitten\u2019s gaze met his for a fleeting moment before she covered her br**sts with her hands and took the last few steps at a brisk pace. As she stood in front of Caleb, he could see how much she trembled.</p><p>Caleb turned quickly and made his way toward his destination with Kitten close on his heels. Finally, he approached the heavy wooden door that would lead them down into what had previously been a wine cellar, but was now a dungeon designed for far more interesting pursuits. He begrudgingly had to give it to Felipe \u2013 the man had an impressive imagination.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d he said to Kitten. It felt cold and clammy to the touch, but Caleb didn\u2019t mention it as he delved into the darkness below. He carefully placed each step and guided Kitten along. A few more steps and Caleb reached for the light switch. The light flickered as it came on and bathed the stairs in a soft yellow glow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kitten\u2019s trembling became intense and she gripped his hand. Though Caleb tugged gently, she wouldn\u2019t move any further down the stairs. She seemed incapable of moving, such was the nature of her apprehension. Nonetheless, there was no begging. No crying. Her fear was obvious, but her courage more so.</p><p>Without another word, Caleb turned and placed her over his shoulder. Kitten gasped, but didn\u2019t otherwise protest. She held on to him tightly as he descended the stairs backward.</p><p>\u201cThis used to be the wine cellar,\u201d he said softly against the curve of her hip. Her body shook again, but this time it had nothing to do with the cold. All around her were restraints, and pain inflicting instruments. In the center of the room stood a large leather clad table with ominous metal parts attached.</p><p>Caleb sighed headily. Though he didn\u2019t much like the reason he was doing this at this particular moment, he knew it was something he was still going to enjoy. Even now, he grew hard as she pulled her weight up and managed to wrap herself around him tightly. He was sure she hoped he wouldn\u2019t do what he was about to do. He lifted her legs and had her wrap them around his waist as he brought her down from his shoulder and into his arms. He took a moment to revel in the clean, wet smell of her hair, the feel of her warm br**sts pressed against his chest, and her pu**y hugged firmly against his belly.</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing you should know,\u201d he said softly into her hair, \u201cis obedience is expected, and will be forced if necessary.\u201d He slid one of his hands down her back and over the curve of her behind until he reached the lightly parted lips of her pu**y. She gasped and froze in his arms. \u201cAnd despite how I torment you, I always find a way to make you feel good.\u201d He rubbed her gently, coaxing her shy clit to swell beneath his fingers. \u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d She nodded, but gripped him tighter. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>Caleb sighed. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll learn to.\u201d</p><p>He walked to the table and laid her down, his body held firmly to hers as she silently refused to let go. Her eyes misted over with tears and the fear crouched within them was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Caleb said. He reached behind his neck and gently pried her arms away to hold them in his right hand close to her chest. \u201cI know you think I haven\u2019t given you a reason to trust me, but I\u2019ve never really hurt you if you think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb...please,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Caleb knew she hadn\u2019t meant to speak. He watched as she shook her head and closed her eyes. Perhaps she was waiting for his anger, Caleb knew she had a right to expect it, but he wasn\u2019t angry. He was much too excited for anger. Too surprised at how good it felt to have her call him by his name again. Even if on the heels of realization, was the reminder it couldn\u2019t last between them. Their time together was short.</p><p>\u201cPut your legs in the stirrups \u2013 and don\u2019t use my name again,\u201d Caleb said. He ignored the hurt in Kitten\u2019s eyes. He ignored the hurt in his chest.</p><p>Abruptly he stepped back, looking on authoritatively as she sat up and crossed her arms over her nakedness. She eyed the metal attachments curiously, and then placed her legs in the stirrups without flinching. A roaring silence filled the room as he watched her studying him. She sat on the edge of the table with her thighs and legs spread apart in the stirrups and her arms set stiffly behind her for support \u2013 Caleb could just imagine what she was thinking.</p><p>\u201cStill cold?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, Master,\u201d she replied coldly.</p><p>\u201cLie back,\u201d he said, just as cold. Slowly, she obeyed. He came closer and secured her thighs to the stirrups by strapping a large leather band around each one and doing the same to her calves and ankles. It would be impossible for her to move them and already Caleb could see she knew it as well. Her chest moved up and down, rapid and deep.</p> <p>Slowly, he stepped away and toward the corner where he retrieved a folding chair. Her eyes followed his every move and Caleb\u2019s heart picked up speed as his excitement and her trepidation grew. He set the chair down between her spread legs, out of her view and sat in it.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s arousal grew as Kitten\u2019s thighs trembled and she tried to close her legs in vain. Her pu**y lay open to his view, his touch, his every whim and will. He tried not to let it go to his head.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself,\u201d he gently commanded.</p><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Kitten fretted. She gave a start as Caleb ran a finger along the seam of her sex.</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d he said. He made circles around her clit. \u201cTouch yourself right here. I want to watch you come.\u201d</p><p>Kitten\u2019s hips tilted forward by the barest of degrees, the sharp pull of desire already making her ni**les hard and her pu**y wet. She hesitated, but only for a moment. Swallowing hard and biting her lip, she did as he asked and placed her right hand on her swollen sex.</p><p>\u201cDo you touch yourself, Kitten?\u201d he asked. He deliberately let the warmth of his breath caress her splayed flesh.</p><p>Kitten shivered. \u201cS-s-sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you make yourself come?\u201d Caleb carefully placed his hand on top of hers and pressed her fingers deeper into her own flesh. Kitten whimpered, flexing her hips upward toward their hands.</p><p>\u201cSometimes!\u201d she whined loudly.</p><p>Caleb smiled at her, though he knew she couldn\u2019t see it. Her eyes were fixed on the ceiling overhead. Caleb leaned forward and ran his jaw along her inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kitten\u2019s body tightened, he could feel it beneath his cheek. He heard her take a deep, trembling breath and then her hand moved under his. He kissed the inside of her knee as he sat back and adjusted the painful erection in his pants. Every moment with her seemed both painful and sweet. He watched her small, delicate fingers find the apex of her pleasure and touch it experimentally. He smiled suddenly and brought his hand to his mouth, instantly realizing her scent saturated his fingers \u2013 he had the sudden urge to lick them, but didn\u2019t. He knew it would only lead to other things.</p><p>Kitten arched her back. She rubbed at the little bud with mounting pressure and speed as her wetness made the flesh increasingly slippery between her fingers. It wasn\u2019t long before soft, but insistent moans began breaking past her lips.</p><p>Caleb could feel the beat of his heart in his c**k as it worked to push blood down to his erection. He knew he shouldn\u2019t be so aroused, not when he\u2019d already come twice, once against her pu**y, and again in her mouth. However, being reminded and watching Kitten grow wetter did little to quell his desire and more to stoke it.</p><p>Kitten rocked her hips back and forth, slowly at first and then with growing speed as her obvious desperation grew. Her fingers rubbed her little clit and it visibly became redder, more swollen, but the sounds Kitten made had gone from need to frustration.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.... I can\u2019t when you\u2019re watching me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Caleb smiled, \u201cThe second thing you should know is to take pleasure whenever you can.\u201d As he thought about what he was trying to express, his smile faded, \u201cKnow your body, Kitten. Know what turns you on. Most of the time you\u2019ll be responsible for your own pleasure. There will be times when it will seem impossible, times when it will be impossible. Either way, you\u2019ll have to be convincing. Convince me.\u201d</p><p>Kitten\u2019s fingers stopped and the only sound in the room was the sound of her pulling air into her lungs. She took her hand away from her body and tried to sit up.</p><p>Caleb stood and he met her watering eyes as she placed her hands behind her for balance. \u201cCaleb,\u201d her chin trembled, \u201cno.\u201d She seemed to be looking for more to say, more emotions to express.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t want to hear what she had to say. He couldn\u2019t bear to hear it. He stepped closer and reached behind her for her hand, only just avoiding her mouth as she turned to kiss him. He couldn\u2019t bear that either.</p><p>\u201cMaster,\u201d he said, \u201cnot Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...you said \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I said, Kitten. It was a mistake,\u201d he said. He was confusing her, and for that, he was sorry. It had been selfish of him to allow her such intimacy, when she didn\u2019t belong to him.</p><p>Kitten sobbed once, twice, but then nodded.</p><p>Caleb took her hand as he guided her back down onto the table. Before any more tears were shed or words spoken on Kitten\u2019s end, he took her wet fingers into his mouth and tasted her pu**y on them. He closed his eyes as the taste of her, both sweet and tart, burst over his tongue. He moaned low, sucking them into his mouth until he watched Kitten\u2019s eyes widen and go darker, signaling her arousal.</p><p>Slowly he pulled her fingers out of his mouth and guided them back onto Kitten\u2019s pu**y. Kitten closed her eyes for a brief second and lifted her hips to meet them. \u201cYou\u2019ve been touching your clit,\u201d he whispered, making small circles against her clit with her own fingers. \u201cDon\u2019t forget you have this delicious little hole.\u201d He guided her fingers down and pushed the tip of her slender middle finger into her pu**y.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d she exclaimed. Her back bowed and her body froze, but Caleb could tell she was only adjusting to new sensations and not coming.</p><p>\u201cIs it good, Pet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Kitten only nodded and let her body drift back down gently before her hips began rocking against her hand. Caleb slowly took his hand away and sat back down in his chair to watch. Kitten cupped her breast absently and pressed the hard pebble of her nipple between her fingers as Caleb had done to her so many times before. She whimpered, her previous trepidation fleeting in the face of her mounting pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watched Kitten\u2019s fingers, the middle one delving a little further with each hesitant thrust. Caleb felt like he could only handle so much, especially with the taste of her still so pervasive in his mouth. Once again, he placed his hand on hers. He marveled at the way her body seemed to pulsate with need. She tried to keep touching herself, but his hand prevented it. Caleb inhaled sharply, dizzy with desire. He leaned forward, slipping his tongue up through her fingers.</p><p>Kitten cried out. She writhed against his all too gentle mouth, rattling the stirrups and filling the room with her desperation. He was too gentle. He knew there was no way she could come from the soft licking. So he kept licking, sometimes pushing the tip of his tongue into her pu**y. He loved the way she whimpered, whined, and moaned.</p><p>After a while though, he knew he had to stop \u2013 or he wouldn\u2019t stop. He stood up and looked down at Kitten\u2019s quivering body. She turned her head and closed her eyes as her br**sts rose and fell with the effort of her breathing. He sighed deeply and savored the taste and smell of her. It has to be now. He pulled out the small drawer attached to the table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Kitten,\u201d he said. He took out two sets of handcuffs. She didn\u2019t open her eyes, but flinched at the sound of the cuffs. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very, very, good. I hope you\u2019ll continue to be.\u201d He cuffed her right wrist to the table comfortably and smiled when she finally opened her eyes and looked at him with those big, brown, inquiring eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not resisting,\u201d he said with a bright smile. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated when he reached for her left wrist, but then her arm relaxed and her breath quickened. Secured in her handcuffs, he reached out and traced her nipple with his index finger. His dick twitched when her sigh filled the silence. Next, he blindfolded her which added to the already intoxicating tension in her body. Caleb was surprised she hadn\u2019t said a word or resisted him in any substantial way \u2013 he couldn\u2019t decide whether or not he had wanted her to be so pliable.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked. He slowly reached for the machine that would deliver the surprise he had planned.</p><p>Kitten licked her lips, \u201cI\u2019m thinking...\u201d she undulated against her restraints, \u201chow badly I want you to finish what you started.\u201d</p><p>Caleb chuckled, \u201cTrust me. I intend to.\u201d He flipped the switch on the machine. It made an ominous humming sound, not unlike a generator.</p><p>Kitten tried to move all at once, her efforts resulting in nothing more than the clanging of handcuffs against her railing and nothing more.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to gag you too?\u201d Caleb asked. Kitten shook her head violently. \u201cOkay then, let me finish.\u201d</p><p>Kitten strained against her bonds when his fingers grabbed hold of her sensitive clit and affixed a padded clamp. She wiggled her bottom trying to shake it loose, but it wouldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to be nice and ready for this. And you are; you\u2019re so close.\u201d He sucked hard on her nipple and despite her growing fear she arched her back, trying to push more of her tit into his mouth. It was tempting, but Caleb pulled away and clamped her nipple snugly and repeated his efforts on the other breast. When he finished he stepped back and took in the graphic picture she made \u2013 blindfolded, bound, and clamped with thin cables running between her legs. \u201cI think I\u2019ll gag you anyway, I wouldn\u2019t want you waking anyone.\u201d</p><p>Kitten seemed on the verge of protest, but Caleb put a swift stop to it by placing a soft piece of cloth into her mouth and securing it behind her head. Not much of a gag really, but it would muffle any sounds coming out of her mouth and make her words incoherent.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d said Caleb in the crest of her ear. \u201cThis next lesson is probably the most important and most difficult to learn.\u201d He stroked her hair. \u201cPleasure comes to you only when your Master desires it. In the meantime, you\u2019ll hunger for it, ache with it, and suffer through it \u2013 much like you are now. I\u2019m going to bed. If you continue being a good girl, maybe I\u2019ll let you come for breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>Kitten was in the middle of a muffled tirade when a surge of pulsing electricity simultaneously zapped through her clit and ni**les. Caleb watched as her body became paralyzed with panic and intense pleasure. The current was low enough not to hurt, but strong enough to make her body contract. She strained and pressed toward the sensation. She arched her back, lost in the sensation of the clamps gently pulling on her ni**les as little tremors were sent through them. Her hips pumped gently into the air looking for release when the sensation abruptly stopped. She screamed with frustration, no way to alleviate her need \u2013 neither by finding release, or letting it ebb into nothingness.</p><p>Caleb gave her one more lingering look and then he made his way toward the stairs. He called behind him, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long night. Good luck, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>Out of the wine cellar, Caleb pressed his back against the door, and let out a sigh to fight the urge to run downstairs and bury himself inside of his beautiful, cock-starved virgin.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he said on a rush of air and headed toward his room. Tired, Caleb checked his watch. It was late, or early, depending on how you looked at it. He undressed and turned out the light. In the darkness of the room and his mind, she came to him. He held his erect c**k firmly and an image of Kitten came to him.</p><p>He imagined her downstairs; with her legs spread wide and her pu**y open and wet. His c**k throbbed hotly in his fist. He gripped it tight, squeezing out warm precome. He smeared it over the head. He fantasized.</p><p>He used his thumb to gently pry the small inner lips of her slippery little cunt and watched her moan. Then he slid his c**k up and down her slit, covering himself in her juices, preparing them both. He leaned forward and the warmth of her br**sts pressed against his naked chest.</p><p>Outside the fantasy he audibly moaned as his pace increased.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she whispered and they were suddenly in her bedroom. He reached down, pulled up her nightgown, and pushed against her with his cock. He was gentle, patiently waiting for her to relax, and her legs to drop open before he pushed again.</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, with tears in her eyes. She kissed him and tangled her fingers in his hair, urging him deeper inside of her. She kept saying she loved him. He pushed himself fully inside her.</p><p>Faster and faster he stroked himself. His balls pulling themselves closer to his body ready to release the orgasm he\u2019d been holding in for far too long.</p><p>He pumped in and out of her hot tightness, and she moaned and screamed her appreciation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she panted, \u201conly yours.\u201d</p><p>It felt wrong to fantasize about such things \u2013 but Caleb didn\u2019t care. Fantasies were all he could have and no one could take them from him. He grunted loudly as his orgasm erupted into the air, coating him in warm, sticky, se**n.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Day 10: Evening</p><p>\u201cI have to pee,\u201d I say to Reed. He makes a face, but doesn\u2019t comment. \u201cWhat? People have to pee sometimes, Reed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says drolly, \u201cI\u2019m aware. I just don\u2019t understand why you feel the need to give me the specifics. A simple, \u2018I need a break\u2019 would have sufficed.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and hop down from my bed to walk into the lavatory. Reed is a little stiff as I walk past him. He\u2019s avoiding my eyes and purposely staring out the window. He can be such a weirdo, but I can\u2019t help but wonder about him. I wonder what he\u2019s like when he isn\u2019t so wrapped up in his FBI persona.</p><p>You know what they say about the quiet ones.</p><p>I\u2019ve been talking for hours. My mouth feels bone dry. I remove the plastic wrap from one of the cups and take a drink of water from the tap. It tastes like shit, but I swallow it anyway.</p><p>Somewhere far away in my mind, I know I should feel emotionally drained, or even weepy and sad. Mostly I just feel...nothing. I\u2019m not sure why. I guess it\u2019s because I know how the story ends and with every word I utter I know I\u2019m preparing myself for the eventuality of what\u2019s to come. It\u2019s like I\u2019m telling a story that happened to someone else.</p><p>I love Caleb. I love him. I don\u2019t care anymore about the awful shit he put me through, what matters most is the fact my love for him, exists. No amount of talking or therapy will change what happened. It won\u2019t change how I feel.</p><p>He\u2019s gone, Livvie.</p><p>There it is. There\u2019s the pain. It\u2019s an ember forever burning in my heart. It\u2019s a reminder Caleb will live forever.</p><p>I\u2019ve cried so much over the last ten days. I\u2019ve been living in so much agony. I know when all is said and done, when Reed has heard everything, when he and Sloan move on \u2013 I\u2019ll be all alone with my pain and my love. But today \u2013 today I\u2019m fine. Today I\u2019m telling the story as if it happened to someone else.</p><p>I conclude my business in the bathroom, wash my hands and open the door. Sloan is standing in the room with Reed when I come out of the bathroom. The atmosphere seems thick, but with what, I\u2019m not certain. Sloan is smiling, but Reed looks like someone ate his lunch out of the community fridge.</p><p>Sloan holds up a large brown sack with grease stains on the bottom. \u201cI brought dinner,\u201d she says to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d I say, surprised by the gesture.</p><p>Sloan smiles at me, warmly. \u201cI know how you love the hospital food, but I figured you might appreciate some greasy burgers and fries instead.\u201d My stomach growls in response and Sloan lifts a smug eyebrow. \u201cAgent Reed, I know you try to stay away from the junk, so I brought you a grilled chicken salad. I hope that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I take the bag from Sloan and set it on the rolling bed tray so I can get to my damn burger. Otherwise, I might try to eat through the bag. I reach in and grab the loose fries at the bottom and shove them into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHawt! Hawt!\u201d I say, but I keep chewing the salty deliciousness in my mouth. To hell with first degree burns, the fries are amazing! I\u2019m so busy stuffing my face with loose fries it takes me a moment to realize no one else is talking. I look up and see Reed and Sloan are having some sort of awkward staring contest. I think Reed is losing. Interesting.</p> <p>Reed finally clears his throat and looks toward his briefcase. \u201cActually, I have to go. I have some emails to answer and some calls I have to make. Um, thank you, though \u2013 for the food.\u201d Reed begins gathering his things in a hurried fashion. I\u2019ve never seen him so...flustered, I guess is the word.</p><p>Curiouser and curiouser.</p><p>\u201cMatthew,\u201d Sloan begins and falters when Reed stops gathering his things just long enough to glare at her. She holds up her hands. \u201cAgent Reed, I can\u2019t think of anything so time sensitive it can\u2019t wait until after you\u2019ve had dinner.\u201d</p><p>Reed sighs deeply, but doesn\u2019t stop getting his papers together. \u201cThank you for the food, Dr. Sloan. I don\u2019t mean to be rude or sound ungrateful, but I really do have work to do. And yes, it is time sensitive. Offices in Pakistan should be opening soon and they have information I need.\u201d</p><p>Sloan falters, pursing her lips briefly. \u201cOh. I didn\u2019t realize. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>No one even notices I\u2019m here in the room and I feel like a voyeur. Fascinating! I think of Felipe and Celia\u2019s little surveillance hobby and blush. Whatever is going on between Sloan and Reed really isn\u2019t my business.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d I say loudly, letting them know they are being watched. I raise Reed\u2019s salad triumphantly, and eat the loose fries on the lid. \u201cYou can take it with you.\u201d</p><p>Sloan gives me a grateful smile, as though relieved I broke their uneasy connection. She reaches for the container and takes it from my hand. \u201cYes, please take the salad. You have to eat something.\u201d</p><p>Reed looks at the salad as if he\u2019s never eaten one before, then at Sloan and me. He is angry, and it has nothing to do with anything. He is just pissed off. He wants to be angry at Sloan, but she hasn\u2019t given him a reason, hasn\u2019t said or done anything revolting. Still, he\u2019s choosing to be angry with her. Finally, he sets his briefcase down on his chair and takes the container. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Sloan says, in that soft way Caleb would use on me when he was feeling fanciful. Sloan watches Reed\u2019s face, and then her gaze skids away when he glances at her and quickly averts his eyes.</p><p>Ooooh...she likes him. It surprises me and yet not. I tend to see Dr. Sloan and Agent Reed as robots, like they have no lives. It\u2019s interesting to see them in a new way.</p> <p>Reed\u2019s face looks a little red. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s blushing. He actually looks adorable. I don\u2019t want him to leave. I want to sit on my bed and watch the two of them squirm under my scrutiny. I mean really...it\u2019s only fair.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Reed, stay.\u201d I pat the spot at the foot of my bed, grinning. He looks at me silently. If looks could kill... \u201cYou said you\u2019d listen to the rest of my story remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t, Miss Ruiz,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be back later. In the meantime,\u201d he opens his briefcase and removes his recorder, \u201ctape it for me?\u201d</p><p>Sloan takes the recorder and nods, carefully not looking at anything. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Reed nods tightly and closes his briefcase again before practically running from the room. I really can\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve just seen.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on between you two,\u201d I ask Sloan around a mouthful of fries. She turns her head away from the door and looks at me, startled. I wiggle my eyebrows and she laughs.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Livvie. Nothing at all,\u201d she says, her voice shaky. \u201cNow stop eating my fries and give me those.\u201d She reaches into the bag and takes out a burger and a container of fries before she sits in Reed\u2019s former seat.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she says when she pops a fry into her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I mimic and do the same. When I\u2019m done swallowing, I jump straight to the good stuff. \u201cSo...did you really come to see me or Agent Reed?\u201d</p><p>Sloan smiles and shakes her head. Her mouth is full, but she tries to answer me anyway. \u201cYou, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d I tease.</p><p>Sloan shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not here to talk about Reed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean...Matthew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivvie,\u201d she says in warning.</p><p>\u201cJanice,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cCome on, Sloan. I\u2019ve been telling you both some pretty deep shit. I think I\u2019m entitled to a distraction and some gossip. Reed\u2019s hot. I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell,\u201d she insists, but she\u2019s getting pink in the face. No matter the age, what I feel is universal. You can\u2019t fight who you\u2019re attracted to. Sometimes, fate gets it right, and then makes you pay for it.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I know something\u2019s going on. Caleb used to get upset when I\u2019d use his name in front of other people, but, in private? Whole other story. I saw Reed\u2019s face when you called him Matthew. He was giving you the business.\u201d</p><p>Sloan chokes on her burger and greedily takes a sip from her drink to clear it. \u201cLivvie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine,\u201d I say and pick up my burger, so disappointed. The burger is so greasy and I can already feel the grease running through my veins. I moan as I chew. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me, as long as you bring me another one of these tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Sloan says and takes another bite.</p><p>We eat in companionable silence for several minutes. The occasional moan and gluttonous eye roll as our only means of communication.</p><p>Afterward, Sloan and I talk about how I\u2019m feeling. Fine. She asks if I might be ready to talk to my mother. No. Definitely, not.</p><p>\u201cWhat could be the harm?\u201d Sloan asks. \u201cShe misses you very much.\u201d</p><p>I look down into my lap. I\u2019m not sad. I\u2019m embarrassed to look Sloan in the eye and admit the truth. \u201cI want her to suffer.\u201d</p><p>Sloan is quiet.</p><p>\u201cThe last few months have been awful,\u201d I continue, \u201cI\u2019ve been beaten, humiliated, and forced into situations no person should ever have to suffer.\u201d I pause, brooding and getting angry at my mother. \u201cStill, I\u2019d live it all again, if I could change the past eighteen years with my mother. I spent so much time already, trying to make her love me, understand me. I spent so much time giving a f**k about what she thought. I\u2019m done, Sloan. I\u2019m done caring. It\u2019s time for me to live my own life, my own way and I don\u2019t want her to be a part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your way?\u201d Sloan asks. There is no emotional quality to her voice. If she\u2019s judging me, I can\u2019t tell. If she agrees with me, it\u2019s also a mystery.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have no idea who I\u2019m supposed to be anymore. I only know I don\u2019t want to be who someone else thinks I should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Sloan says.</p><p>Sloan and I talk for a while longer before I tell her I\u2019m tired and want to lie down. I let her hug me goodbye and perhaps...I hold on to her for just a little longer than I intended. Sloan doesn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><p>Once she\u2019s gone, I turn down the lights and get in bed with Reed\u2019s recorder. I turn it on and start talking.</p><p>Another surge of electricity pumped through me. I was starved for release. I screamed behind my gag and struggled against my tethers, but all it did was heighten my suffering. I lifted my ass, trying to find a way to move and create enough friction to send me into orgasm, but it was crushingly useless. I whimpered and let the tears flow when the pulsing stopped. The door opened and a sigh of relief swept through me. Caleb had finally come back to end my suffering. I knew he would.</p><p>He approached me slowly and I made soft, pleading sounds to beg him to make it stop. As if reading my mind, his warm hand cupped my face and I inclined toward it, pressing my wet cheek against his wrist and crying pitifully. Had I been able to see, perhaps I would\u2019ve been more embarrassed and prideful. Instead, I was simply lost in my misery and eager to be free of it.</p><p>His hand traveled down my neck and chest as another pulse hit me. I arched. I wanted to come, no \u2013 I needed to come. The table shook as I struggled. Caleb\u2019s hand caressed the soft flesh under my breast which only made it more intense. I only needed a little more, just a little more. It stopped. I cried harder.</p><p>I pleaded behind the gag, but Caleb said nothing. Instead, his hands cupped both my br**sts and then pulled the clamps off my ni**les slowly. Blood rushed to my ni**les and I screamed behind the gag. It hurt, but it also made me ache for more. He massaged my br**sts and I almost cooed as I tried to press more of myself into his hands. Abruptly, the warmth of his mouth kissed around my left breast and the soft tickle of his hair caressed my chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mouth was achingly gentle, his tongue swirled around my taut flesh, no teeth, no violent sucking, just soft licks and kisses that made me want to touch him. As he repeated the process on the other breast, yet another jolt of electricity assailed my poor clit.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d I screamed behind the gag. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>He stood back until the pulsing stopped and I feared he would leave me again. I heard him unzip his pants and I had to stop myself from nodding fervently. Yes, I want this. Please, I want this. His fingers pulled down the gag and I immediately began begging him for respite.</p> <p>\u201cMaster, please make it stop, let me come. I\u2019ll be good. I swear. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d When he said nothing, I whimpered, \u201cCaleb, please!\u201d The heat of him radiated close to my face, followed by the soft press of his c**k against my lips. I didn\u2019t hesitate; I opened my mouth and took him in.</p><p>Shocking realization hit me, this wasn\u2019t Caleb. He felt all wrong in my mouth. I tried to pull back, but the stranger held the back of my head firmly in place \u2013 and despite my instincts, I didn\u2019t actually want to bite him.</p><p>Another pulse hit and assaulted me from every conceivable angle. I moaned around the stranger while simultaneously trying to f**k the air and back away from him. I wasn\u2019t as afraid as I should be. Perhaps it was because he f**ked my mouth slowly, without violence. Yes, the stranger made it obvious he wouldn\u2019t allow me to turn away, but he was far from rough. The pulsing stopped and I let my hips drop to the table. I struggled to breathe steadily with the stranger\u2019s c**k in my mouth. In the quiet stillness, I heard his soft, guttural moans as he glided in and out of my mouth.</p><p>He withdrew without coming and I immediately felt the awkwardness and shame I should\u2019ve felt earlier settle to the forefront. I wanted to ask who the f**k he was. I wanted to scream for help, for Caleb, but I said nothing.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he said with a soft Spanish accent. My entire body blushed then. I could feel the warmth of it.</p> <p>\u201cFelipe?\u201d I asked timidly, on the verge of fresh tears.</p><p>\u201cYes, my sweet girl, but you should not speak unless you are asked,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI know your Master has tried to teach you better. Still, I can\u2019t blame him for being so lenient with you. I let Celia get away with too much,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cThough, I don\u2019t know why he allows you to use his name. It\u2019s so intimate. Are both of you intimate?\u201d I didn\u2019t reply. I was in too much shock. \u201cAnswer,\u201d he said softly. I opened my mouth then, but the only thing to come out was a long, throaty moan as the electricity once again assaulted me. He stepped away and there was a clicking sound. The pulsing stopped.</p><p>\u201cOh! God!\u201d I moaned. \u201cThank you!\u201d My heart didn\u2019t have a chance to slow down.</p><p>Felipe\u2019s fingers stroked the inner lips of my pu**y almost immediately. I tried to shift away, but all I managed was to move my hips up and down which seemed only to further his efforts. A stutter of \u201cNo\u2019s\u201d flowed out of me when I felt one of his fingers trying to worm its way inside me, but he quickly silenced me with a firm tap on the side of my face and an equally firm call for silence. It didn\u2019t hurt, but it was effective.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only looking,\u201d he said. He pushed against something painful inside of me. I started to cry and much to my relief, the finger withdrew.</p><p>I wanted Caleb. How could he leave me here like this?</p> <p>\u201cYou get really wet for a virgin,\u201d he said, and again my body flushed with heat and embarrassment. \u201cNothing wrong with that though.\u201d Was he smiling? Fear tapped across my insides. I hoped this man would leave soon and Caleb would come back to let me go. A long silence followed, punctuated by my low sobs, and occasional intake of breath as I tried to keep my crying quiet.</p><p>Finally, he spoke, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweet girl. I\u2019ll be gone soon and I won\u2019t hurt you. I was only curious. Perhaps, when your real master allows it, I can better explore my curiosity.\u201d I tried to focus on the fact he\u2019d said he wouldn\u2019t hurt me and sighed with relief, willing myself to calm and let the tears dry away.</p><p>\u201cCaleb is very...enamored of you,\u201d he said and laughed low. It seemed a private joke I was not privy to. \u201cDo you love him?\u201d he asked casually.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond. I was too tired, shocked, and scared to answer.</p><p>\u201cI could always reconnect the machine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shouted before I could stop myself.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might say that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in love before. I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Felipe guffawed, \u201cEveryone knows, my dear. You know. Do you love him or not?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say. I didn\u2019t know enough about Felipe to guess whether or not he meant me or Caleb any harm. Aside from Celia, I was never alone with anyone but Caleb.</p><p>\u201cDo you love, Celia?\u201d I asked instead.</p><p>Felipe sighed, \u201cClever, girl. Answer a question with a question and you can never say the wrong thing. Regardless, I have my answer. It\u2019s a pity he doesn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Felipe laughed loudly, \u201cOne would think! Do you know how I met Celia?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cShe is the daughter of my former rival. Many years ago, when I decided to make my name, I went up against her father and won. As a trophy...I took Celia.\u201d His voice turned soft. \u201cShe hated me for many years and I was not always so kind to her. Now...not a moment goes by I do not wish I could take back wasted time. I spoil her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy letting her clean your house and be your slave?\u201d I said, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cI see why Caleb is so drawn to you. You\u2019re the type of woman who begs to be bridled and yet refuses to yield. Such women are the nectar of life,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, Celia is quite happy. I give her everything she needs and more than she desires.\u201d</p><p>I kept my mouth shut and let Felipe have it his way.</p><p>\u201cWill you allow Caleb to sell you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cTo live as a slave or to die by one\u2019s own terms is always a choice, sweet girl,\u201d he whispered. \u201cPerhaps you should remind your current master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say, my current master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Caleb tell you? Rafiq arrives tomorrow. I suspect you\u2019ll both be leaving us very soon. It\u2019s a pity though, I begrudgingly admit I\u2019ve enjoyed having you both around. Caleb is an interesting man, a bit...drastic, but interesting nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>I felt as though someone had punched me in the stomach and knocked the air out of my lungs. Rafiq was coming for me and Caleb wasn\u2019t going to stop him. It was over. I\u2019d lost.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d I whimpered. \u201cPlease, help me.\u201d</p><p>Felipe sighed, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it isn\u2019t possible, sweet girl. Rafiq...well, let me just say, he does not take kindly to betrayal.\u201d</p><p>As I tried to process what he was telling me, I heard his steps and cringed when he set the wet gag back into place and secured it firmly. I panicked when the coldness of the cables ran up along my body. I didn\u2019t want the clamps back on my ni**les. I struggled with all my might. My torso was relatively free, so it was with some difficulty he held me down with his weight to replace the clamps.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed in frustration, but there was only his soft laughter in response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry sweet girl, but I can\u2019t have your master find you in a different position. It\u2019s rude.\u201d</p><p>I whined pitifully. I had finally come down from my heightened arousal, my clit ached, and my ni**les too \u2013 but I had been glad to feel somewhat normal again. I wasn\u2019t sure I could handle more torture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a gift before I go,\u201d said Felipe.</p><p>I shook my head passionately, but it didn\u2019t stop him from placing his hand between my legs and caressing me. My body stilled, and against my wishes, he stoked the flame of my desire, in no time making it burn hotly once more. Soon, I pressed myself toward him, looking for the release I needed so desperately. And finally, he sent me over the edge. He rubbed me harder and faster, and I screamed as my orgasm ripped me apart. I wanted more. As starved as I was, the powerful orgasm did little to ebb my passion. It was with deep dread, I realized he was replacing the clamp taken from my clit. I begged for him not to do it.</p><p>Within moments of him leaving, my torture began anew.</p><p>It was a very long time before the door opened again and this time, I wasn\u2019t going to simply be content with physical release. Unless of course, physical release included punching Caleb in the stomach and then raping him into oblivion.</p><p>I growled when I heard footsteps coming near me, secretly praying it was Caleb I was directing my wrath toward and not another uninvited visitor. One smug laugh later, I knew it was him. I couldn\u2019t help but feel a deep sense of relief.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling, Pet?\u201d I would\u2019ve liked to spew invective at him just then, but the machine went off again and it was all I could do to hold in my screaming. Over the course of the night, the charges had become less frequent. I wondered if it had been a mercy my mysterious visitor had imparted. Regardless, the pulses were powerful, and it had been going on for hours. They were both pleasurable and painful, with increasing tendencies toward the pain. When the charge finally released me I couldn\u2019t help but sob softly behind the drenched gag in my mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat bad huh?\u201d he said, but I knew his words held absolutely no sympathy for what he\u2019d done. I sucked in air deeply when he removed the clamps from my body.</p><p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d I yelled. Though the words were muffled behind the gag, I knew he could make them out. He cupped my br**sts in both hands and gently massaged me.</p><p>\u201cI hate you, Master,\u201d he said with hungry lust lacing his voice.</p><p>He tweaked my ni**les playfully. I winced and I tried to shrink away from his touch.</p> <p>\u201cSensitive?\u201d he whispered softly in my ear. When I didn\u2019t respond, he pinched them a little harder and a yelp broke past my lips. \u201cAnswer,\u201d he said coolly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d I whined. My anger with him had grown as the hours had passed. I\u2019d convinced myself when he came to get me I would really give him a piece of my mind. Of course \u2013 it\u2019s easy to be brave when the object of your fear isn\u2019t holding your sore ni**les hostage.</p><p>\u201cGood, Kitten,\u201d he said. He placed his warm palms against my stiff little peaks and pressed softly to massage them as he also kneaded my br**sts. I moaned loudly. My head rolled to the side as he touched me exactly the way I needed to be touched. I never wanted the feeling to end.</p><p>His thigh pressed against the table near the top of my head as he worked his hands lower, from my br**sts, to my ribs, to my surprisingly sore hips. He rubbed softly, and I couldn\u2019t help but moan and get lost in the surety of his hands, and in the clean, masculine smell emanating from his body, which inevitably leaned toward me. I thought about Felipe. I thought about the way he\u2019d pressed his c**k against my lips, the way I\u2019d so readily accepted him when I thought he had been Caleb.</p><p>Unwittingly, I undulated beneath Caleb\u2019s hands, my body telling him what I couldn\u2019t possibly say out loud. I needed him to make me come. He sighed audibly, and I knew he wanted me as badly as I wanted him.</p> <p>I fought off the memory of what he\u2019d told me after I\u2019d offered him not only my body, but my heart. \u201cYou thought what? You thought offering me a little pu**y was going to make some kind of a difference?\u201d I recoiled at the memory and tears stung behind my eyes. I was thankful for the blindfold. Suddenly, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted him touching me anymore, but what choice did I have? Felipe\u2019s options seemed far too extreme.</p><p>It occurred to me then, the one choice that was mine to make, was not to let him hurt me anymore, not where it mattered. My heart sank heavily in my chest for reasons I didn\u2019t want to acknowledge...I had thought my confession should make some kind of a difference.</p><p>I was lost in my self-pitying thoughts when he pulled me back into reality by running his finger along the seam of my inflamed sex. I jerked in my bonds.</p><p>\u201cSensitive here too?\u201d he said darkly, and began his practiced assault on my clit. I groaned sadly in response and nodded. \u201cAww, poor Kitten. Would you like me to let you come now?\u201d Tears leaked from my eyes and were immediately absorbed by the blindfold. I nodded. His voice had taken on a sinister edge, he was enjoying this, and I was in a strange sort of misery. He shifted his position, coming around to my right as he stroked me at an easier angle.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear you beg me,\u201d he said and pulled the gag from my mouth. I rotated my jaw, trying to get it to feel normal again and finding it difficult. \u201cBeg me,\u201d he commanded. My heart raced at his steady touch, the tingling heat of impending orgasm spread through my body. If he stopped me this time, I would die. I was sure of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m begging you,\u201d I whispered. My voice was alien to my ears as I failed to keep my emotions out of my voice.</p> <p>\u201cI did think it was really cute when you said you loved me.\u201d</p><p>The orgasm tore through me with a violence I don\u2019t think even Caleb was expecting. I screamed at the top of my lungs and my body arched as much as it could in its restraints. Every part of me tingled, and throbbed, and burned with release. My thighs quivered, and my heart beat savagely in my chest, ears, and clit.</p><p>It washed over me in waves: my old life, meeting Caleb, my botched escape, Caleb\u2019s kindness that first night he held me, his smile, his hands, his smell, his kiss, the spankings, the torture, my declaration of love, his reaction...his reaction...his cruel, f**king reaction. When the best and worst of it subsided my hips hit the table with a wet thud and I lie there crying, as any number of emotions ran wild in my body while the aftermath settled.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I was so tired. I hadn\u2019t slept all night. Caleb was quiet and I was glad for it. I had nothing to say to him. Though, I thoroughly hoped he was done torturing me for a while and would allow me to finally get some sleep \u2013 alone.</p><p>I started to drift away while he went about un-strapping my thighs and legs. It was an odd thing to feel so drowsy and satiated, while at the same time, feeling jittery and anxious over being released. His warm palms touched my ribs and my drowsiness disappeared, but my anxiety mounted.</p><p>\u201cHow are your ribs feeling?\u201d he asked, with a degree of thoughtfulness.</p><p>\u201cA little sore,\u201d I said, so softly, I almost doubted he heard.</p> <p>\u201cIs it bad?\u201d He seemed concerned.</p><p>I hated when he was like this. I would prefer him to always be a cold-blooded bastard. At least then, I could forgive him for the things he did. Instead, he showed me bursts of his humanity. It was worse - knowing he knew the difference between kindness and cruelty and chose the baser of the two. I shook my head.</p><p>He undid the cuffs on my wrists and I at once tried to sit up. Not really as a show of defiance. It just seemed like the natural thing to do. My hips were agonizingly stiff and sore. It took Caleb\u2019s awkward help to lift my legs out of the stirrups. After too many hours apart, I could hardly close them.</p><p>I sat for a moment, my legs dangling off the table and my hands over my br**sts. I hoped he wouldn\u2019t remove the blindfold and I wouldn\u2019t have to look into his eyes. He stood in front of me. Our bodies weren\u2019t touching, but I felt him everywhere. Then the warmth of his fingers smoothed against my cheek, and something in my chest began to burn. Slowly, he pulled the blindfold away and I rubbed my puffy eyes as I adjusted to the soft light.</p><p>He looked gorgeous, as usual, though his customary smile was not present, only a look of seriousness. It occurred to me I must look like garbage, with my ratted hair, and puffy face. Meanwhile, Caleb stood in front of me \u2013 sexy as hell.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look him in the face. I rarely ever could. I focused on his lightweight button-up shirt, khaki pants, and casual shoes. I focused on his large hands as they reached up and rubbed my thighs. I let out a startled gasp he didn\u2019t acknowledge.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked ominously. I nodded, looking down into my lap. He slapped my thigh loudly and I had to fight every impulse to push him away. Heat crept up into my face, but I maintained my composure.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d I said, through clenched teeth. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, no humor in his voice. \u201cYou can get down on your knees and eat my cock.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him incredulously for a moment, waiting for him to say something further \u2013 though what I expected him to say, I didn\u2019t know. Strangely, the longer I looked at him, the more I became aware I was doing so without his permission. I also felt, as I often did, he could read my mind. I took a deep breath and looked away quickly, in the hopes he had not read too much. Out of the corner of my eye I saw his hands slowly reaching for his belt. A sense of impending doom spurred me into action and I reflexively placed my right hand over his.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to whip me, are you?\u201d I didn\u2019t look up. My fingers trembled. If he wasn\u2019t already, then I probably planted the idea in his mind. Stupid, stupid, stupid.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to?\u201d he asked. I shook my head emphatically: No, I did not. \u201cThen get your hands off of me. I didn\u2019t give you permission to touch me.\u201d I retracted my hands and waited for him to speak. \u201cGood. Now get down on your knees and put your hands in your lap. You\u2019re not allowed to touch me.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard and fortified myself to do as I was told. Avoiding his gaze, I attempted to lower myself from the table onto my shaky legs. My legs gave out, but Caleb reached out to steady me. I almost grabbed hold of him to stop myself from falling, but I managed to prevent the reflex and hung in his arms like a rag doll as he lowered me onto my knees.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He stood. \u201cYou know what, Kitten?\u201d he said, \u201cI think I will whip you. Ask me what for.\u201d</p><p>My eyes were already misted over with fresh tears when I looked up at him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and shook his head, just before he grabbed the back of my head and pulled my hair hard enough to let me know I was in trouble. \u201cHow about for talking when you weren\u2019t asked to speak, touching me as if you have the right, looking at me without being told, and most importantly, for consistently addressing me improperly.\u201d He gripped my hair tight. I whined sharply behind my closed lips and my eyes reflexively shut. \u201cNow, you tell me, Kitten, do you deserve to be punished?\u201d</p><p>There could not possibly be any good answer to his question. Even silence would be thought of as another infraction. My mind raced to find a way out of the situation, but I knew the damage had been done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I cried miserably, but I opened my mouth and replied, \u201cIf it\u2019s what you want, Master, then, yes.\u201d I kept my eyes closed, mindful not to look at him unbidden, and he released my hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good answer, Kitten. Later, I\u2019ll show you exactly what I want. In the meantime, show me how much you want to make me happy.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>He made me walk \u2013 with traces of his se**n on my chin and neck, naked, sobbing, and on shaky legs, up the steps of the dungeon and out into the civilized surroundings of the mansion above. I hesitated strongly at the top of the steps when I heard the unmistakable murmur of people in conversation. Caleb pressed his hand firmly against the curve of my bottom and urged me forward, but I only leaned back and tried to step down. Propping me up with one hand, he delivered a powerful, ringing slap, across the delicate flesh of my ass and I couldn\u2019t help but cry out loudly and lurch through the door. Six sets of eyes turned toward me at once. They were a mixture of surprise and amusement.</p> <p>The strong desire to run surged through me, but Caleb held my hair cruelly in his grasp, forcing me to kneel at his feet, where I instantly grabbed hold of his pant leg and hid.</p><p>\u201cWell, this entire day just became more interesting,\u201d said an unfamiliar voice, with a southern drawl. His comment was met with resounding laughter.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d said Caleb. \u201cShe\u2019s not quite house broken yet.\u201d</p><p>I was too scared to be outraged. Above my head, sitting at a table, were a group of men and women. They didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with a man dragging in a naked, and crying woman. I couldn\u2019t imagine a more horrifying scenario.</p><p>When the laughter subsided, a familiar voice spoke. \u201cWill you both be having breakfast with us?\u201d It was Felipe \u2013 there was no mistaking the strong, assured inflection of his voice, and of course, there was the Spanish accent. My heart skipped a beat. What would happen if he told Caleb about last night? Had he told Caleb about last night? What if it was a test \u2013 and I was supposed to tell him?</p> <p>\u201cNo, not this morning \u2013 but perhaps for dinner. I need time to make her suitable.\u201d He finally let my hair loose. I made no attempt to move; cowered against his legs I felt oddly protected.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d said Felipe, \u201cCelia will help you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb made me travel the rest of the way upstairs on my hands and knees, while the others looked on and remarked on how obvious it was I was new, and how fun it would be to get a hold of my sexy ass.</p><p>Heat crawled all across my body but I kept my head down and focused only on getting as far away from this emerging situation as possible. Somewhere in the back of my mind I also worried about what was going to happen to me next. I realized my deepest hope was for Caleb to take me upstairs, bathe me, feed me, and hold me as he filled my ears with reassurances. I wanted him to remind me he would never let anyone hurt me, but as he forced me past the door to my room, my hopes seemed more and more unlikely.</p><p>A little further down, we rounded a corner and my knees were finally given respite as they met with a small, carpeted alcove. Caleb stepped in front of me and opened the large wooden door. I hesitated for only a moment, not knowing why, but then crawled across the threshold. The room was not what I expected. If ever I imagined a room for Caleb to call his own, it would have been this one. It seemed inundated with his ominous taste.</p><p>The carpet was a deep burgundy. It was so dark I almost mistook it for black. The bed sat high, covered in the blackest of spreads, turned down to reveal crimson silk sheets and pillows. The headboard was black as well, a large, tall, square thing. It gave the bed an obviously masculine tone, and attached to its center, was two thick metal loops. The door shut behind me and the room was drenched in darkness. I swallowed hard.</p> <p>A small clicking sound and the light of a bedside lamp scarcely lit the room. I dared not make a sound or movement, though the urge to turn and look at Caleb was intense. My eyes stared forward, catching sight of a leather-clad bench of sorts. There was no television, no stereo, and no phone, but there were books. I noticed them in a corner bookcase, their spines showing they\u2019d been thoroughly read and enjoyed. I suddenly ached to know their titles. I wondered what he read, what made him happy. There was also an odd piece of furniture standing in front of the stark curtains. I knew from a glance I was best left unaware of its purpose. It formed the shape of a large X and at the top of each corner rest the same metal loops as the headboard. I shuddered in spite of myself.</p><p>\u201cYou embarrassed me down there.\u201d My entire body tensed at the sound of his angry voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master,\u201d I whispered, low. I struggled desperately to stay perfectly still. I treated him as the sort of predator to only attack moving prey. I heard the distinct sound of a buckle being undone and the swish of a belt being pulled from its belt loops. I started to shake.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to learn what is expected of you, Pet.\u201d</p><p>Everything in my body screamed for me to run, but somewhere inside my head a small voice whispered there was no escape, only obedience. Only obedience will make him happy. I nodded absently.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything further. He simply pressed my forehead to the ground and laid his belt down across my backside in quick succession.</p><p>At one, I clenched my jaw and forced my hands under my knees to keep from trying to take the belt.</p><p>At two and three, I was rocking as I wailed into the carpet.</p> <p>Four, and I attempted to place my hands in the way of his belt by shielding my bu**ocks. My fingers brushed across raised welts.</p><p>Five, six, and seven, he held my hands tight against the small of my back.</p><p>Eight and nine left me screaming out loud and panting.</p><p>He stopped for a moment, long enough for me to tell him how sorry I was, that I would obey, that I would be good \u2013 I promised. A few more and he finally seemed satisfied.</p><p>He let my arms go, but I knew better than to follow my instincts to get up. I grabbed my wrists and held them at the small of my back, just as he had them. I heard his soft laugh over my sporadic whimpers and sobs, and for some reason, my body became slightly more at ease.</p><p>\u201cGood girl, Kitten,\u201d he said. I sighed deeply with relief.</p><p>He dropped to one knee at my side and pulled me back firmly by my hair. I continued crying and fighting the urge to rub my behind as the real pain of the whipping set in, scalding hot and prickly.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d I whimpered pitifully.</p><p>\u201cWill you remember it?\u201d</p><p>I managed to respond through my sobs again, \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>He stood, dragging me up by my hair with the effort. I arched my back and succumbed to my urges and rubbed my behind forcefully with the palms of my hands. I only made it worse. He grabbed hold of my wrists and pinned them to the small of my back.</p><p>\u201cStay still!\u201d he snapped. Instinctually, I pressed my forehead to the front of his shirt. I tried to straighten my legs. The feel of his firm chest pressed against my face did things to me I had come to expect. Why do you always smell so good? After a moment, the pain became secondary to thoughts of my naked body pressed against his clothes. I stood still, but I could not bring myself to pull away from him. He let my wrists go and I immediately wrapped them around his waist and pressed into him. He was hard, and soft, and strong, and he smelled like everything I wanted wrapped around me.</p><p>He tensed in my embrace and quickly placed his hands on my shoulders to urge me back. I looked up at him and saw the anger and confusion in his eyes, but I didn\u2019t care. Rafiq was coming for me. Caleb would either protect me, or he wouldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t ask him without giving Felipe away, nor could I ignore the feelings stirring inside me. Perhaps it was my exhaustion, or the long night of sexual torture he\u2019d subjected me to, or perhaps it was simply the undeniable power he had over me \u2013 but whatever it was; I desperately needed to kiss him. I rose on the balls of my feet and inclined my lips toward his, begging him with my eyes to make this easier for me. If he was shocked he didn\u2019t show it, he simply stayed immobile as I finally touched my trembling mouth to his.</p><p>His hands gripped my shoulders tighter when I traced my tongue along his bottom lip, urging him to open to my kiss. He obliged me and I almost wept at the taste of him. He finally softened and inclined his head by the slightest of degrees. I delved deeper into his mouth, shaking in my need to be touched by him.</p><p>He lifted his hand to the back of my head and kissed me with all the passion of the previous morning.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop the moan that broke past my lips. I had never felt anything like this. Never had I wanted to laugh, and weep, and f**k, and devour another human being until there was nothing left of him \u2013 until we were one person and I could feel peace. I grabbed his face in my hands and kissed him all over. My loud panting was echoed by his softer sounds. I sought his mouth over and over. I wrapped my leg around him, trying to climb onto him as he straightened his body. Abruptly, he broke the kiss and pushed me to the floor. I stared up at him, my heart laid bare at his feet. His chest rose and fell with anxious breath, but his words were steady and calm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last time you\u2019ll ever do something without being told. And it\u2019s the last time I\u2019ll ever kiss you. I hope you enjoyed it.\u201d Through a mist of my tears, I thought I saw a flicker of hurt in his eyes. I dismissed it as my broken heart trying to reclaim some of its dignity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease, Caleb!\u201d I sobbed loudly. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Take me and let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s leave!\u201d</p><p>He slapped me. Not savagely, but it stung and the heat of my shock crept across my face and down my neck. I placed my hand on my cheek. It was hot to the touch. When the initial moment of shock wore off, I thought it strange I should feel the pain of his slap in my chest, but I did, and it hurt more than I ever thought possible.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s eyes held a glimpse of shock I\u2019d never seen in his eyes before. He turned his back on me and walked through one of the doors in the room.</p><p>I heard water running.</p> <p>He walked back out, \u201cClean yourself up and wait for Celia,\u201d he spat, and walked out of the room.</p><p>I cried openly once the door shut, but I did as he asked.</p><p>An hour and a half later, I sat sobbing on the edge of the tub while Celia gently brushed my hair and tried her best to soothe me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kitten,\u201d she whispered. I sobbed harder. I nodded meekly to appease her. In all honesty my tears had little to do with her, or the fact she had painfully waxed all the hair on my body with the exception of a small \u2018strip\u2019 at the apex of my pu**y. Though, the pain would not easily be forgotten. Mostly, I cried because I could not shake Caleb from my thoughts. He didn\u2019t give a shit about me, and somehow, I had fallen in love with him. He\u2019d never kiss me again \u2013 that\u2019s what he\u2019d said \u2013 never. I\u2019d trusted him. I\u2019d done everything he\u2019d asked of me in the hopes he\u2019d spare me. His loyalty had never rested with me and I\u2019d been foolish to believe I could win him over.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but replay the moment over and over in my mind. Even knowing the pain I felt was emotional, I physically hurt all over.</p> <p>\u201cCelia?\u201d I finally managed to speak through my sobs.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, mi amor?\u201d she said.</p><p>I spoke to her in Spanish. \u201cWhy does he treat me so badly? One moment he smiles at me and the next...\u201d A hard lump formed in my throat, making it difficult to swallow, let alone speak.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, sweet girl,\u201d she said. It reminded me of Felipe, but I didn\u2019t mention it. She set the brush aside and held my head to her chest. I held on to her tightly, flooded with the need to be held. She stroked my hair with her hand and spoke, \u201cI think there are things you don\u2019t know about your master. Perhaps he seems unpredictable, but he is filled with passion for you. My master is always pleasant, even when he punishes me \u2013 yet, I know nothing of what he feels.\u201d I could make out the pain in her voice. She was in love with Felipe and believed he didn\u2019t love her back.</p><p>I thought about my interaction with him in the dungeon and I had to disagree. Felipe was head over heels for Celia. It seemed ridiculous she didn\u2019t know. However, it wasn\u2019t my place to tell her.</p><p>\u201cSo many years together,\u201d she said in a soft whisper, \u201cand he has never shown a flicker of interest one way or the other.\u201d She gave a wry smile. \u201cExcept of course when he wants to f**k me...or watch someone else f**k me.\u201d Her statement shocked me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t fret little one. I don\u2019t mind. I always enjoy it, and when he makes love to me after,\u201d she sighed, \u201che makes sure I never feel ashamed, or dirty, or any of those other things. He just makes me feel like I\u2019ve made him happy, and it makes me happy.\u201d I looked up at her and saw she had tears in her eyes. She smiled at me and quickly wiped them away with the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was cruel to you Celia...you know...that night.\u201d Her smile grew wider.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I was so reckless. I didn\u2019t know he meant so much to you. I couldn\u2019t say no to him, but I didn\u2019t have to flaunt my pleasure with such abandon.\u201d I think we both blushed. I gripped her hand and she sat next to me.</p><p>\u201cCelia, do you ever...ever think of running?\u201d She didn\u2019t pretend not to understand my meaning, though her eyes filled with a tempered panic and she instinctually looked around the room.</p><p>\u201cYou must never say such things, Kitten, not even to other girls like us. They\u2019ll turn on you for no other reason than to see you punished. But no, I could never leave Felipe. Perhaps he does not love me, but he cares for me. He gives me everything I desire without my having to ask. I love him. Before him...I don\u2019t remember what I lived for, what I liked to do, none of it matters to me now.\u201d I nodded slightly, though I didn\u2019t really understand what she meant.</p><p>The door opened. Celia and I startled guiltily. Caleb paused, his gaze penetrating my skin, even as I looked down into my lap like a scorned dog.</p><p>\u201cCelia,\u201d he said after a moment, \u201cgo downstairs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cS\u00ed, Se\u00f1or,\u201d she replied shakily and scurried from the room.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said to me.</p><p>Instinctively, I went to stand.</p><p>\u201cIn here, you are always on your knees unless told otherwise,\u201d he said.</p><p>Shaking, I went down on my knees and followed him as he walked into the bedroom. My heart pounded wildly in my chest and between my thighs, my newly bared flesh made me all too aware of my nakedness. My curiosity over what he would do next turned my stomach in knots, yet I followed him almost eagerly in the hopes he would be kinder than he had been.</p><p>He led me to a small \u2018bed\u2019, consisting of a few thick, silken, comforters set on the floor near his bed. \u201cStand near the bed. Leave your arms at your side,\u201d he ordered dispassionately.</p><p>Reluctantly, I did as I was told. On the bed in front of me lay some articles of clothing, some of them I was familiar with, others I was not. Devoid of any emotion, he lifted a pair of black translucent panties from the bed and motioned for me to step into them. I did so without comment, but when I lifted my leg to step in I lost my balance and put my hands on his shoulders to steady myself. He tensed under my hands and I withdrew them. The black stockings didn\u2019t go on any steadier, but I let my arms go out for balance.</p><p>He stood and eyed the panties and stockings as my skin warmed under his scrutiny. I dared not look directly at his face to see if he appreciated what he saw. Perhaps, not surprisingly, the panties caused a strange and overwhelming surge of desire. The newly exposed skin of my pu**y sprang to life at the feel of the smooth and silky material. Suddenly, I\u2019d never been more grateful to be a woman. Our desires could be hidden, when a man\u2019s could not. Still, it was with some difficulty I didn\u2019t press my thighs together.</p><p>I\u2019d never worn a corset before, so I was ill prepared for the snugness. Made of smooth black leather it sat below the soft weight of my br**sts and encased my entire abdomen. I let out a loud grunt when he cinched the back in one swift and devastating pull. He stilled a moment, and I regained my wits, and my oxygen.</p><p>\u201cCan you breathe?\u201d</p><p>I gave a jerky nod. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. If your ribs start to hurt, tell me immediately.\u201d</p><p>Another nod, \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>There were strange pieces of leather attached to the front of the corset. I quickly learned they were for my wrists. With my wrists securely fastened, I could not lift my arms.</p><p>\u201cThat should keep your hands where they belong,\u201d he said with a mild touch of anger. I flushed at the memory of my bold kiss and winced at the memory of what had come of it. I heard rustling behind me, but resisted the urge to look.</p><p>\u201cBend over the bed, and spread your legs,\u201d he said.</p><p>I turned and saw he held something in his hand, but I couldn\u2019t quite make it out.</p><p>\u201cDo as I said!\u201d</p><p>I struggled to obey, hoping I wouldn\u2019t feel his belt across my sensitive behind. As scared as I was, my heart twisted when I recognized his smell on the bedding. Tears stung the backs of my eyes. I almost whispered his name, but I knew only horrible things could come of it. I wished I had never told him I loved him. I wished I had handled his revelations differently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want revenge, Caleb. I don\u2019t want to end up like you, letting some f**king vendetta run my life. I just want my freedom. I want to be free, Caleb. Not someone\u2019s whore...not even yours.\u201d</p><p>My heartache turned to panic when Caleb\u2019s fingers pried my bu**ocks apart. I stilled, willing the intrusion to go away. One of his fingers pressed upon the bud of my anus, while the others kept my panties to the side. There was no stopping him.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he said. He slid an obviously lubed digit inside me slowly.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t make a sound, but inside, I screamed in shock. In...and out...in...and out, he slowly thrust. Despite the fear and apprehension inside me, the sensation brought about the now familiar pull of desire low in my belly. My panties, already wet, clung to my naked flesh, willing me to undulate against the fingers. They were so close to my clit, so close.</p><p>\u201cFeel good, Pet?\u201d he whispered huskily. I tensed and I was sure he felt it around his finger. He pushed his finger deeper inside me until my stomach pinched, and a moan escaped my lips.</p><p>He held me, suspended on his finger, wrenching both tears of humiliation and lustful moans from me. \u201cYes. Yes, Master.\u201d I sobbed.</p><p>He withdrew slowly. I eased my hips back down, and again his smell saturated my senses. I wondered for the millionth time why I wanted him so badly when he was such a calculating bastard. While I panted for breath, Caleb prepared his second assault by reinserting his finger with even more lubricant. He tried to push something inside me, something foreign. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I shouted before I could stop myself.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he said.</p><p>Shocked into instant silence, I immediately willed myself to obey. Slowly, the object went in and I found myself filled just to the point of pain and on the precipice of intense pleasure. I could feel it in my stomach, and strangely, I could also feel it pressing against the walls of my pu**y. I lie still, panting and moaning, trying to decipher what the hell just happened.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s warm body pressed against my back. His hot mouth sucked at my earlobe, and my muscles contracted strongly, surging with wetness. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare push this out, or I\u2019ll whip your ass raw.\u201d As he said the words he thrust his erection against me and shifted the plug inside me. I moaned.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d I whispered. My voice was a wanton plea for more contact. He reared back, his left hand between my shoulder blades, his hips still pressed against mine. I sighed when he tugged my panties down to expose my ass. He reached between us to trace his fingers between my cheeks. I thrust back, urging him lower to the swollen bud of my clit, begging him to finish me. It didn\u2019t take long. He rubbed my clit gently with his fingers while the palm of his hand shifted the plug inside me. I came within moments, in hard, jerking motions, involving my entire body. After, he helped me to the floor and told me to sleep.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>I opened my eyes and stared into the semi-darkness, unwilling to move in the event Caleb planned to torture me further upon my waking. My sleep had been awkward. My wrists were shackled to a tightly-laced leather corset. It was difficult to breathe or lift my arms more than a few inches in front of me. I was also made to sleep on the floor \u2013 it was padded with bedding, but not anywhere near as comfortable as a bed.</p><p>I thought about the morning. After Caleb had made his somewhat violent use of my mouth, which strangely enough had me both wanting and hating him, he denied me the measure of solace he\u2019d up until now always given me after such ordeals \u2013 affection. I had to admit, it really hurt my feelings. Despite everything he\u2019d put me through, he\u2019d never made me feel cheap. Even in the beginning, when he\u2019d been even more of a calloused bastard, he\u2019d managed to allay my fear and anxiety when he was done with me \u2013 I feared those days were gone.</p><p>Not since I told him I loved him.</p><p>Playing the day over in my mind did little to urge me into waking, but I couldn\u2019t sleep anymore. Not only had I slept most of the day, but my stomach begged for something to eat. Then, as if on cue, the door opened and Caleb strode into the room. My heart instantly sped up and skipped a beat as I took in the sight of him in a tuxedo. His thick and gorgeous blond hair, often worn in a style of organized dishevelment, was now combed away from his face. The intensity of his blue eyes at once felt like both a punch to the stomach and a soft, hungering caress.</p><p>He seemed endlessly calm as he approached me. I remembered myself and looked away. He knelt next to me. I let out a sigh I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d held when he reached out and traced my chin with his long smooth fingers. He cupped my chin and tingles spread throughout my body. I shivered in spite of myself. He turned my face toward his, and I could no longer resist looking into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well, Kitten?\u201d he asked so softly, I ached.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cGood. It\u2019s time to go downstairs and introduce you to the rest of the guests.\u201d</p><p>My stomach twisted, though at this point it had less to do with my hunger and more with my anxiety. I said nothing, and didn\u2019t resist when he helped me to my feet. As I stood only inches away from him, his smell once again surrounded me. For a moment, I couldn\u2019t help but close my eyes and imagine a situation different than this one \u2013 one where I could just be myself, and he would adore me for it. He smoothed my hair back, unraveling the snags formed in my sleep and working them through quickly and deftly.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, more to himself, than to me, \u201cthat looks a lot better.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence fell between us. I kept my eyes focused on the cleanly pressed shirt in front of me. He sighed, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice it was the kind of sigh someone let out when they were preparing themselves to do something difficult. I knew it had to do with Rafiq, somehow, but I couldn\u2019t ask him. I couldn\u2019t accept my fate just yet. I had to hope the Caleb I had grown to love was thriving inside the version of Caleb in front of me. Hope was all I had left.</p><p>With no further ado, he turned me around and swept the bulk of my hair over my left shoulder. My entire body shivered. I heard him pull something from his pocket. I tensed when I felt the smooth band of leather circle my throat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same collar you wore before. I like this one much better. It\u2019s softer, and it won\u2019t dig into you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Were my hands free I might have reached up to touch the loop attached to the front, but they weren\u2019t free \u2013 like me, they were bound by circumstance.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know,\u201d he said matter-of-factly, \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a lot of people downstairs. These people are important acquaintances of mine. I expect you to behave. Do exactly as I say, keep your eyes lowered, and it should be an enjoyable evening for the both of us. Understood?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed thickly and managed to whisper, \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a little something to ensure your obedience.\u201d As I turned, I couldn\u2019t help but meet his eyes. He pulled me close, holding me in place by way of his hand at the small of my back. His other hand cupped my breast just inside my corset. He put his mouth on my nipple and sucked.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t hold in a powerful sigh. I was wet, but his affection was to be short lived. Just as soon as his mouth released me, firm pressure took hold of my nipple. While I swooned, he repeated the perfunctory process on my other breast and then stood back to admire his work.</p><p>I looked down at my br**sts through a haze of tears to notice the delicate clamps adorning my ni**les. A thin gold chain joined them and led directly into Caleb\u2019s hand. As I took stock of my predicament I couldn\u2019t help looking up at Caleb with a pleading expression. He tugged gently, as if to say my pleading was meaningless. My body stiffened and a jolt of pain and sensation drilled down through my belly ending between my legs. The plug in my ass moved, exaggerating the sensation. In midstream, the pain changed to something pulsating, something near pleasure. Like a puppet, my body relaxed as Caleb released the tension.</p><p>\u201cAre we clear on the rules of obedience?\u201d Caleb asked, and then not waiting for my answer he continued, \u201cThis is a test of sorts, Kitten. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d He turned his back to me. \u201cFollow behind on my left, keep your eyes lowered and there should be no need to test the sensitivity of your ni**les.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d I replied, not able to keep the tremor from my voice. Tears clung to my lashes and my body quaked, but I followed Caleb as directed.</p><p>We walked the pace of a parade. A slight murmur of low voices reached the top of the stairway. Candlelight from the room below glimmered across the marble stairs, lighting our descent in living color. The warm glow eased some of my quaking, along with Caleb\u2019s care of the chain joining us together.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairway, Felipe greeted Caleb, \u201cGood to have you join us my friend. I see you have your lovely Kitten in tow. Everyone is looking forward to seeing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelipe,\u201d Caleb acknowledged. I couldn\u2019t help but notice Caleb didn\u2019t sound too pleased.</p><p>Our eyes met over Caleb\u2019s shoulder, but he did not let on about my disobedience. In fact, he winked at me. We were sharing yet another moment, unbeknownst to my master. I flushed deeply.</p><p>\u201cI thought you should know the boy is here with Mr. B tonight and will be part of the evening\u2019s entertainment,\u201d Felipe added in a whisper loud enough for me to hear. The statement had a mocking edge, as if he were poking fun at Caleb. I didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Caleb replied, simple and abrupt. Caleb lifted his head and scanned the small gathering of people. Instinctually, I scanned the room as well, and promptly received a continuous tug of shooting pain through my ni**les for the effort.</p><p>\u201cEyes down,\u201d Caleb said over his shoulder to me, his voice riddled with undisguised anger.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d I said in a jagged whisper. I wanted to scream from the pain torturing my ni**les, but the tension on the chain lessened, and my breath spun out in a heavy sigh of relief.</p><p>Caleb moved past Felipe. I followed, fearful of the damn chain he held. We stepped off the marble stairway onto carpet and crossed the room. The soft touch of the plush carpeting massaged the bottom of my stocking feet.</p><p>\u201cWell, look what the cat dragged in,\u201d came a man\u2019s Southern drawl, followed by a low whistle. \u201cShe\u2019s a beauty. I\u2019d love to test-drive her, especially if she handles anything like this one Felipe gave my wife to try.\u201d The man moved back for Caleb to look.</p><p>I dared raise my eyes only a bit, my head still bent toward the floor. From the corner of my eye I saw a boy near my age standing on his knees. He was perhaps the most beautifully handsome boy I\u2019d ever seen. Still, I could not shake the notion I knew him somehow. He raised his dark blue eyes, just enough to connect with mine. My breath caught and my eyes opened wide. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKid!\u201d I exclaimed before I could stop myself. Pain quickly overturned surprise as my ni**les burned from incessant pressure.</p><p>\u201cEyes down, Kitten,\u201d Caleb snapped.</p><p>I was slow in my obedience. I\u2019d known Kid had been captured, but I hadn\u2019t seen him since the night Caleb and I had arrived at the mansion. I wondered where he had been all this time. His hair was longer, his body leaner, and his demeanor signaled just how deeply he\u2019d been broken down. Despite everything, he looked healthy, perhaps even happy. I didn\u2019t know how to feel about seeing him. Kid reminded me too much of what had happened to me with the bikers. I tried hard to remember he had been the one to stop his friends from beating me to death.</p><p>Caleb tugged again, this time with only as much force as was necessary to demand my attention.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d I finally whispered and Caleb held me still to untie my wrists.</p><p>\u201cKeep your hands behind your back unless you need them for balance.\u201d</p><p>Forced into close proximity, I couldn\u2019t help but take in the sight of Kid dressed only in a loin cloth. His wrists were tethered and he had clamps on his ni**les. Around his neck there was a collar with a leather leash attached. His body radiated heat against my legs. I wanted to cry out from the injustice of it all. I began to pant with anxiety, maybe even panic.</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s a feisty one. I think I\u2019d like to play with her for a while,\u201d Mr. B added, and a chuckle rumbled out sounding like it came from the bottom of his belly.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be possible,\u201d Caleb said. His tone was somewhat harsh and I couldn\u2019t help but notice the way those near him stared at him. \u201cKitten is meant for other things.\u201d</p> <p>I raised my eyes slightly, looking through the fringe of my lashes as he led me toward a table dressed in white linen. Candelabras bathed a warm glow over the two couples at the table enjoying cocktails and conversation. They wore suits and gowns, aristocrats dressed up for an expensive night out.</p><p>A woman, dressed similar to me, sat on her knees near the table. Her body was poised, yet relaxed. Her eyes were cast down and her hands were folded over her thighs. Caleb stopped near her, dropping the chain into her hands. He pressed my shoulders down. I bent down to rest on my knees and the plug in my ass shifted. Sensations pulsed through my body, making me shake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back, Celia. Make sure Kitten remains here for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>I gasped, not recognizing Celia, but kept my eyes down. As soon as Caleb walked away, I raised my eyes slightly to get a better look. Celia looked exotic and beautiful. I knew, of course, she belonged to Felipe, but I had no idea she was subject to participating in anything like this. Last time, she had wielded the crop, but tonight, she was a prisoner, like me - and apparently, Kid.</p><p>Another couple, a tall woman and a short man, dressed in white, approached pulling a red corseted woman behind them. The woman wore nipple chains, red silk stockings, and a red lace thong, with a red ribbon weaved through her long dark hair. The couple settled at the table, and the woman in red sat on her knees next to the man.</p><p>The classic formalwear and respectful murmur of voices intertwined with a gentle tinkle of laughter. Theirs was a different world from the one I was used to. Men with smiling faces, women dripping with sparkling jewelry and long polished nails, tugging behind them corseted half-naked women. I noticed Kid was the only male prisoner.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone, please find a seat. We are ready to serve your first course,\u201d Felipe announced from the end of the table. Gentle music began playing in the background and more candles were lit around the room. Caleb came to get me at the same time Felipe came for Celia.</p><p>\u201cCome on Kitten, let\u2019s have some dinner. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re hungry.\u201d Caleb moved slowly so I could keep up crawling along on my knees the few feet to the table. He sat down at the table, positioning me next to him on the floor.</p><p>Servers dressed in scant uniforms, barely covering their br**sts or backsides, placed platters of appetizers down the center of the table, some refreshed water glasses, and others refilled wine glasses.</p><p>On the other side of me sat Felipe, Celia close to his side on the floor. The woman in white sat next to Caleb.</p><p>\u201cKitten, you\u2019re behaving exemplary tonight,\u201d Felipe whispered, and gently touched my shoulder. I remained in position, though his touch sent a shiver of mistrust down my arm. I turned my head slightly to see if Caleb noticed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had her moments,\u201d Caleb added as if I weren\u2019t there. His attention was drawn to the woman in white sitting next to him. From my position on the floor, I watched her polished fingers slide up the middle of his thigh and stop short of the bulge between his legs.</p><p>\u201cSo good to see you again, Caleb,\u201d her silky voice purred loud enough for me to hear.</p><p>\u201cHave we met?\u201d Caleb asked and placed his hand over hers, preventing it from going any farther up his leg.</p> <p>\u201cRegrettably, no. I was here when you and your lovely girl first arrived. I admired you and I was sure to find out who you were,\u201d she all but purred.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d said Caleb. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Miss...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ,\u201d she said, \u201cMrs. J, but don\u2019t worry, Mr. J, is well aware of my extra-curricular activities.\u201d She gave a short flirtatious laugh. Her fingers moved up to cup Caleb\u2019s bulge.</p><p>I fought the urge to swat her hand away. Mine! You f**king, bitch.</p><p>Caleb pressed her hand to him and then moved it back into her lap. \u201cThank you for the compliment, Mrs. J, but I think your attentions would be best spent on someone else.\u201d Caleb\u2019s voice carried down to me, even though it was a whisper next to Mrs. J\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not available?\u201d She sounded disappointed.</p><p>Seething with jealousy and with the memory of Caleb and Celia in my thoughts, I inclined myself toward Caleb and rubbed my head against his thigh. To my surprise, Caleb\u2019s hand landed on my head in a soft and reassuring caress, before he urged me away.</p><p>Caleb chuckled low and I watched his hand squeeze the top of Mrs. J\u2019s thigh through her satin gown. Her legs parted and she pulled his hand toward her center.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hungry. We\u2019ll make sure you get your fill.\u201d Caleb caressed her deeply with his fingers then slipped from her grasp and moved his hands above the table. He grabbed a plate of the appetizers and piled a few on her plate as well as his own. \u201cThat should get you started.\u201d His voice held a promise and I had to wonder what he planned for later.</p><p>Tears stung the backs of my eyes. Not that he noticed. My heart hammered in my chest and I swear the ringing in my ears blasted out for everyone to hear. My breath came in pants, and Felipe\u2019s hand brushed my upper arm.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Caleb reached down with a succulent shelled shrimp in his hand. \u201cOpen, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>My eyes automatically rose to his level. Before I settled an appropriate glare at him, my ni**les received a burning tug that stole my breath. My mouth dropped open, quite by accident, but Caleb used the opportune moment to plop the morsel into my mouth. Mortified, I could do nothing but chew. My stomach appreciated the attention.</p><p>All of the chained ones ate from their Master\u2019s hand. It appalled me, but I remained submissive. I promised obedience. It made Caleb happy and my survival ultimately depended on his happiness. I still hadn\u2019t seen Rafiq, but I had come to expect surprises.</p><p>When the last course was finished, Caleb pulled away from the table. \u201cYou need to relieve yourself and freshen up.\u201d</p><p>Felipe interjected, \u201cCelia can take her to the slave quarters, if it\u2019s all right with you, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her over with Celia. Then Celia can show Kitten what\u2019s expected.\u201d</p><p>Caleb helped me to my feet. The plug shifted, creating another tremble through my body. Felipe gave Celia\u2019s chain over to Caleb, and he led us away.</p><p>He handed Celia my chain at the door. The room was shiny and sterile white. A row of tubs lined the floor to the right of me, some large, some small. To the left, were private rooms. Farther down, I saw a large mosaic featuring a young Mexican girl bathing outdoors and touching her ni**les while a man watched in the distance. It provided the backdrop for the shower room, which featured a row of shower heads, drains in the floor, and a few toilet stalls.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place, Celia?\u201d I whispered. My voice held both wonderment and trepidation. Unconsciously, I reached for her hand and she held it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a room, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>She leaned in close to my ear and whispered, \u201cEverything we say is recorded. Motion sensors \u2013 microphones.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cGo on and use the ladies. I need to grab some towels.\u201d</p><p>After I relieved myself, Celia took me to a small, private and curtained room. There was a sink and a set of towels. A cabinet set next to the sink laden with toiletries.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to freshen between your legs.\u201d She slid my silk panties down, along with my silk stockings, and I let her. She\u2019d cleaned me up so many times before I held no embarrassment. \u201cOnce I\u2019ve done it for you, you\u2019ll understand what you need to do the next time you are told to freshen up.\u201d She lathered up a cloth with some special soap smelling of almonds and honey. \u201cStand on this towel and open your legs for me.\u201d I did as she asked. She was amazingly gentle, as always. I could almost understand how women swayed over to women. Celia didn\u2019t touch me inappropriately, but her demeanor was so gentle, it lulled me into relaxing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t long before we were back out to Caleb and he walked Celia over to Felipe, who then handed her off to one of the first couples I saw sitting at the dining table. Celia went without rebelling, even when both the man and the woman touched her br**sts.</p><p>Caleb tugged on my chain, creating another shot from my ni**les to my pu**y. I closed my eyes and held back a plea. \u201cLet\u2019s not keep people waiting,\u201d he said.</p><p>Caleb tied my wrists to the loops at the front of my corset. We moved close to another area in the same large room. Couches and low tables with candles and wineglasses were strategically placed in an area close to a stone fireplace wall. Flames licked the piled wood within the hearth.</p><p>We stopped beside the couple we\u2019d met earlier. Their names for the evening seemed to be Mr. and Mrs. B. A cursory glance and I realized Kid sat on his knees next to them with his head bowed and his hands behind his back. I would have felt sorry for him, but I was too concerned with my own situation.</p> <p>I wondered what Caleb had planned for the evening. So far, it had a very Eyes Wide Shut atmosphere. I wanted to be alone with him. I wanted to explain how much he truly meant to me. I wanted him to understand my feelings for him had nothing to do with manipulating him, or trying to gain my freedom.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to be Caleb\u2019s whore, that much, I wouldn\u2019t take back. I also didn\u2019t care for revenge. I wanted Caleb. I knew it was stupid. I knew he was a terrible person, who\u2019d done terrible things. I knew he didn\u2019t deserve me or my love. I didn\u2019t care. During the course of our time together, I\u2019d fallen in love with my captor. I\u2019d fallen in love with his smell and his taste; his smile, kindness, and yes, even his cruelty because I knew it was a part of him.</p><p>I wanted him to know. I wanted him to know everything and I wanted it to mean something to him. I wanted him to choose me and accept me. I wanted him to leave everything behind and love me.</p><p>\u201cKitten...\u201d his forehead pressed hard against the nape of my neck, \u201cyou ask for impossible things.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t care.</p> <p>I was lost in thought when Caleb\u2019s hand, warm and reassuring, landed on my shoulder. I looked up at him and I let my longing for him show. He smiled, but it struck me as sad. Caleb\u2019s sad smiles never boded well for me.</p><p>\u201cDown,\u201d Caleb said, gesturing toward the spot next to Kid.</p><p>I let myself sink into the command. I wanted to comply. I wanted to make Caleb happy in any way I was able, in the hopes he would never be able to let me go.</p><p>\u201cLadies and Gentlemen, dessert is about to be served,\u201d Felipe\u2019s low accented timbre silenced the small group. Chairs slid across the carpeted area near where I lay, the sound of people getting comfortable. I wondered why Caleb didn\u2019t pull me up in preparation to eat.</p><p>Abruptly, Caleb\u2019s hand was in my hair and pulled me close. He whispered in my ear, \u201cI know how difficult this is going to be for you. It\u2019s going to be difficult for me, too. That said, I expect perfection, Kitten. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>My pulse quickened, my vision blurred. \u201cCaleb....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShh, Kitten,\u201d he reprimanded, \u201cObey.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back when he let me go and our eyes met. He gave me another sad smile and then, for reasons I couldn\u2019t possibly know, Caleb pushed my face down into Kid\u2019s lap. My butt rose off the floor and Caleb pushed against the plug in my ass with his knee. Again, to my mortification, the plug shifted. Beneath Kid\u2019s loin cloth, something else stirred.</p><p>Caleb, sounding strained, added, \u201cI wondered how these two would respond to each other.\u201d He removed his knee from my derri\u00e8re, and I sprang backward, falling on my ass. My bent knees splayed open as I lie on my back unable to push myself up with my wrists tethered.</p><p>\u201cWell, by the looks of the kid\u2019s cloth there, I\u2019d say he\u2019s pretty pumped up.\u201d Mr. B laughed out loud, carrying out over the quiet murmurs of the other guests.</p><p>I closed my eyes, embarrassed, and waited for the nipple pain. Guests shuffled around us, and I squeezed my eyes tighter, afraid of where to look in this position. Suddenly, a warm, trembling hand slid up my nylon stocking just on the inside of my calf, slowly over my knee, and up the inside of my thigh. It stopped, but then hesitantly burned a path back down the inside of my leg to the arch of my foot. The hand gently massaged my foot before moving to the inside of my other leg and sliding its way toward my thigh. Fingertips, ever so lightly, brushed the small patch of silk between my legs.</p><p>The persistent hand rubbing my leg became two hands, both brushed between my legs at once. Muscled thighs pushed my legs farther apart. I could no longer fight the urge to open my eyes. I dared to peek through the fringe of my lashes and saw Kid\u2019s shoulder-length, blond hair. It was combed away from his boyish beauty. His cheeks burned with embarrassment, mirroring my own, as he positioned himself close to my center and continued rubbing my thighs.</p><p>His eyes remained closed as he assailed my body with his touch. I imagined Kid getting a tug on his ni**les as reprimand for opening his eyes. The tip of his tongue slid across his full bottom lip and for some reason, a sensation rippled along my center.</p><p>I wanted so badly to see Caleb, my eyes opened wider. A searing pressure on my ni**les told me he remained close. My eyes closed and the pressure subsided. It was proof he was watching me intently as another man touched me.</p> <p>So, this is what will make Caleb happy. My heart pinched at the betrayal. Fine, he wants to pretend there\u2019s nothing between us. I\u2019ll give him a show to remember.</p><p>Kid definitely knew what he was doing. His hands created a burning desire not just where he touched me, but throughout my whole being. In fact, it was tough to keep control. Part of me strove to hold on to my pride, or what was left of it, and another part of me wanted to let go with reckless abandon.</p><p>Kid\u2019s gentle and warm caresses stoked something deep inside me. I was breathless, tingly, and so wet between my legs the silk settled into my folds. His hands laid trails over my thighs, hips, and belly...damn corset. Suddenly, a different set of hands pulled me back and stood me upright.</p><p>There was another rumble of laughter from Mr. B. who took control of Kid. With a great deal of effort, I kept my eyes down. Caleb pressed me back into his erection. I was unable to stop a soft moan. To my shock and surprise, Caleb unbound my wrists and began unlacing my corset. My entire body tensed in a silent plea for him to stop. He pressed his lips softly to the shell of my ear, \u201cObey,\u201d he whispered with enough intensity to almost stop my heart.</p><p>I remained still as he completely unlaced my corset. My breath caught with its removal, and I heard the heavy intake of breath from the others around me through the ringing in my ears. A blindfold was slipped over my eyes. Both clamps were released from my br**sts and my ni**les burned as blood rushed into the starved areas. Caleb released me and I stood feeling alone and exposed.</p><p>Where is Caleb?</p><p>My pride dropped away and my heart filled with sadness while my head filled with embarrassment. The stillness in the room was palpable, punctuated keenly by the lone sound of my anxious breath. There was a soft rustle, then the feel of smooth fingers rolling one of my silk stockings down my thigh. I desperately fought my urge to resist.</p><p>This is what he wants. Be brave.</p><p>My sex pulsed as my left stocking was rolled down my leg. I reached my hands out to feel and gasped when they were quickly gathered up between my br**sts. My body was hoisted into the air. I kicked out with my legs, but someone grabbed them firmly. They placed me on a hard surface, which I knew instinctually to be one of the linen covered dining tables.</p><p>I panicked and at once Caleb\u2019s voice was in my ear telling me to obey. \u201cSteady, Kitten. I won\u2019t let him inside you. I won\u2019t let anyone inside you.\u201d Through my panic, I almost missed the possessive nature of his words, but the part of me that thought of him as mine wanted to recognize it as an admission. I relaxed by the barest of degrees.</p><p>My wrists were tied together and held over my head. Within moments, soft feathery touches along the top of my silk panties assailed my senses. Despite my apprehension, a shudder ran through me. Those hands, those warm, trembling, and wonderful hands, activated something. A charge ignited within me as my panties slipped down and away. My head swam in the smell of lust, the taste of it. I suddenly wanted satisfaction. I needed it.</p><p>Muscular thighs, pressed between my legs. Palms pushed against both of my inner thighs, splaying my legs wide and opening my pu**y. My hips rose off the table and a finger slid down and back up my crevice. My hips rose higher, begging. A moan and a sob fell from my lips. My hands were pushed harder into the table.</p><p>Hands cupped my bu**ocks from between my legs and lifted my hips higher, pushing the plug in my ass right against my throbbing sex muscle. Another moan left my lips. I was panting.</p><p>Without warning, a tongue, so masterful, thick, wet, and slightly rough, licked and lapped my nether lips. The mouth on my pu**y, pulled me in, sucking until another moan left me breathless. The tongue spread me apart, laying me open. A gentle nip on my clit ignited a thousand flames within my body.</p><p>Other hands massaged my br**sts, rolling my sensitive buds between fingers. Please be Caleb. Waves of fire begged to be released inside me, my body trembled with need. The concentrated sucking and licking on my swollen clit swept me over the edge. Panting turned into screams and a flood of sensation carried me away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My butt was placed back on the table and I lie there spent, tears wetting the blindfold, my legs still trembling and splayed open. The room filled with applause.</p><p>\u201cIf this enthusiasm is any indication, I see no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have a second course of dessert,\u201d Felipe said, breaking through the applause in the room.</p><p>I\u2019m dessert? Nice of Caleb to make me part of dinner. Bastard!</p><p>I struggled to raise myself, pulling my legs together and bending my knees up so my ankles hid my swollen sex. My back remained stuck to the linen cloth. My wrists stayed pinned to the table over my head.</p> <p>Caleb\u2019s voice filled my left ear, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to reciprocate, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>What the hell does he mean?</p><p>My body was pulled up to sitting. Again, the plug shifted. A spasm shot through my pu**y, making me gasp. My wrists were loosed, and my hands placed on Kid\u2019s loin cloth. The blindfold remained in place. His upper body heat reached out to me. He smelled sweet, but unnatural, as though someone had covered him in something scented. I preferred the way Caleb smelled.</p><p>I moved one hand around to feel Kid\u2019s position. His knees stuck out in front, his bu**ocks sat on his ankles. I slid my hand down his muscled arm to find his wrists had been tied behind his back. My fingers traced his chest and released the clamps from his ni**les, tossing them away. His heavy exhale moistened my face.</p><p>So, this is what I\u2019m supposed to do? Perform?!?</p> <p>I was apprehensive in the extreme. I had only done this twice before, and only with Caleb. I couldn\u2019t believe he was going to let me do this \u2013 make me do this. I could feel my lip tremble. I could feel the tears waiting in my throat, but then I thought about Caleb and his night with Celia.</p><p>I remembered my jealousy and my rage. I wanted Caleb to feel those things. I wanted him to watch me give to someone else what I felt in my heart had been reserved only for him. If he cared for me at all, I knew this was a sure way to find out. I took several deep breaths and prepared myself for what I was about to do.</p><p>\u201cI guess you do want revenge,\u201d Ruthless Me, whispered.</p><p>You bet your sweet ass, I do.</p><p>Kid\u2019s chest pounded beneath my trembling right hand. His hardness throbbed against my left palm. I slid my legs underneath me and raised my upper body to meet his. I pressed my br**sts against his chest and his breath caught. My left palm felt a shift, a thickening, his c**k barely contained. I licked his chest, his ni**les, as far up as I could reach on his neck, until he bent down to me.</p><p>Our lips touched ever so gently. The taste and smell of me lingered in his mouth as his tongue slid between my lips. I shuddered, and he pressed his chest harder into mine, our lips taking in each other.</p> <p>We were only kissing for a few seconds before my head was snapped back by my hair and Caleb\u2019s voice filled my head in a growl against my ear, \u201cNo kissing on the lips.\u201d He pinched my bu**ocks so hard I couldn\u2019t help but cry out.</p><p>I jerked into Kid and nearly tipped us both over. Kid\u2019s strength steadied me. I paused, resting against him, before I slowly resumed kissing him. I let my mouth travel along his chest, shoulders, arms, and ni**les before making my way up to his neck. I felt him bending his head down toward me and I pushed him back with both hands against his chest.</p><p>The kissing show is over, buddy!</p><p>Kid\u2019s hips rutted against mine, his loin cloth totally deformed. My arms went around his waist, my fingers followed the thong of the loin cloth, and my br**sts molded against his belly. It tied in the back, which only took seconds for me to untie. The thong immediately opened and released his penned-up cock. My hands felt its throbbing length and width. His balls rest against the pouch of the loin cloth. I carefully pulled the cloth away.</p><p>We froze. Am I really going to do this? I couldn\u2019t believe how far I\u2019d come. Over the course of a few months, I had gone from being afraid of sex, to performing a sexual act with a stranger in front of an entire room of derelicts. Kid groaned and pressed his warm c**k against my hand in a wordless plea for me to set him free from his sexual purgatory. How well I knew the feeling.</p><p>Kid sucked in his breath when I kissed the tip of his cock. He tasted different than Caleb, but it probably had more to do with the fact he had been prepared. He tasted sweet, as if someone had covered him in some sort of spicy cinnamon concoction. It wasn\u2019t unpleasant. I spread a bead of precome with my lips and tongue and he became both salty and sweet in my mouth. As I slid my tongue down the length of him, Kid\u2019s body shuddered. He let out a deep breath and moaned. His hips rocked toward my mouth.</p><p>Is this what you want, Caleb? I hope you\u2019re watching you son of a bitch. I want you breathless with want. I want you to see how I please a man. Will that make you want me?</p><p>The blindfold made it easy for me to imagine Caleb in Kid\u2019s place. I imagined hearing his ragged breath in my ears, his body trembling with desire and need for me. My body responded, my beaded ni**les yearned for attention, and my sex pulsed to the rhythm of Kid\u2019s thrusting hips.</p> <p>My lips surrounded the head of Kid\u2019s cock, and my tongue played with both the underside of its rim and the slit at the top. Kid panted heavily, his hips thrusting harder, until his c**k slid further into my mouth and my tongue touched it everywhere. His body stiffened, his breath sucked in, and so did the breath of the room. For a moment, time suspended. Then, he moaned.</p><p>I made my move. I squeezed my fingers around his c**k low, and pumped him in time with my mouth, drawing him in and out. He gasped and I heard hands kneading and rubbing his chest. He thrust into my mouth faster, my mouth sucked, my tongue stroked, my pu**y screamed for its own release. My hips gyrated against the air, until someone splayed my legs apart and slid a hand through the back of my thighs, squeezing my nether lips.</p><p>It stopped me for a nanosecond, until a couple fingers found my clit and began rubbing. My hips thrust to match Kid\u2019s. His c**k pulsed, he thrust a final time, and spilled into my mouth. I milked him dry as waves of heat spun through me. A palm pressed against my ass, shifting the plug and I screamed with my lips still around Kid\u2019s cock. The wretched fingers continued rubbing my swollen clit.</p><p>Oh god, Caleb! Yes. Please, keep going.</p><p>Wave after wave of sensation touched every part of my body, but Caleb\u2019s fingers on my clit and his palm against my ass were relentless. My body heated up again, as did Kid\u2019s. He heard me, felt my tongue, my breath, and my moans of ecstasy against his still throbbing cock. His hips thrust a little more, and I squeezed and sucked a little more, imagining Caleb in front of me, as well as behind.</p><p>Kid moved his c**k in and out of my mouth. I could barely hold it with my hands, he moved so fast and rough.</p><p>I rocked against Caleb\u2019s hand, matching Kid\u2019s rhythm. My breath came quick and hard. I was barely able to breathe, but I didn\u2019t care. My mouth was full. My ass was full. My clit was ready to explode. Caleb\u2019s fingers were skilled. They knew my pu**y. I came in a fit of tears.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>There was no applause. Just the sound of Livvie\u2019s broken sobs and Kid\u2019s muted pants.</p><p>Caleb felt...well, he didn\u2019t know how he felt. He only knew he wanted Livvie. He wanted her close and away from all the prying eyes around them. Rafiq had not arrived and Caleb was overwhelmed with anger and regret in addition to an influx of emotions he had no time to analyze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her upstairs,\u201d Caleb said, gathering Livvie\u2019s naked and quivering body into his arms. He noticed Kid\u2019s eyes, glazed with unshed tears, and harboring a more than guilty expression. If Caleb didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d say the boy was smitten in the worst way. The very idea seemed to incite his anger and yes, his jealousy. Caleb was teeming with jealousy. If he didn\u2019t get away from Kid soon, Caleb worried he\u2019d be unable to control himself.</p><p>She kissed him, he screamed in this head.</p><p>She\u2019ll kiss Vladek, too.</p><p>Caleb couldn\u2019t think about it. His thoughts were too dangerous. His emotions were too raw and logic was quickly fleeing. Devoid of reason, he could find no cause to keep him from taking Livvie upstairs and f**king her senseless. He wanted to scrub every trace of Kid from her body and clear every memory of him from Livvie\u2019s mind. Caleb wanted her to think only of him, to be, with him.</p><p>You can\u2019t do it, can you? You can\u2019t let her go. Find a way, Caleb. Find a way to make Rafiq understand.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s thoughts ran wild as he held Livvie to his chest and walked toward his room. His heart pounded a sharp tattoo he could visibly see shifting her in his arms.</p><p>Once upstairs, Caleb gently placed Livvie onto his bed. In the short time it had taken him to get to his room she had somehow managed to sob her way into a kind of sleep. Her eyes were closed. Every so often, she would take in a deep breath and her chest shuddered before she exhaled. Caleb looked down at her sleeping form and wondered what she dreamed about in her passed-out state of slumber. Her body jerked, twisting her over onto her back, her nakedness open for the taking. He wanted to take her. His erection pressed into the zipper of his pants, begging for release.</p><p>He closed his eyes in order to relax, still standing next to the bed. Her smell permeated his senses, a fragrance light, musky, and all her own. It had pulled him to her earlier tonight. Like a sea siren calling to a sailor, her need compelled him to act. Without thought, he had rolled his sleeves up and dived in with both hands to quench her thirst. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mine.</p><p>The word was a declaration. It rocked him to his very foundation. It was a truth he\u2019d kept hidden for far too long. Caleb didn\u2019t know anything about love, or loving anyone, but he knew...Livvie, was his. He owned her. He possessed her and he knew, with everything he was, he couldn\u2019t give her away.</p><p>Mine!</p><p>Mine!</p> <p>Mine!</p><p>Rafiq will understand. I\u2019ll make him understand.</p><p>Caleb was far from rational. Deep down, he knew Rafiq wouldn\u2019t understand. He would see it as the deepest betrayal. He would demand the impossible of Caleb. Rafiq would try to hurt them both. Caleb pushed those thoughts away.</p><p>Before common sense could return, Caleb gently raised Livvie\u2019s hands and untied her wrists. Livvie sighed, and Caleb lied down on top of her in time to watch her eyes flutter open. He stared into her deep, chocolate-colored eyes and saw himself reflected in their depths as she focused on him. A myriad of feelings passed through him, jealousy and possessiveness at the forefront. He needed to make her his: unequivocally and irreversibly.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s expression turned inscrutable. She lay under Caleb, her arms limp at her sides, her expressive eyes cold and distant.</p> <p>Caleb wanted nothing more than to know what she was thinking, but he was too terrified to ask. The feeling of terror was foreign and unwanted. The last time he\u2019d felt it, Livvie was in a house, bleeding, broken, and barely holding on to her life. He\u2019d been terrified then and he\u2019d barely known her. The way he felt for her now paled in comparison. He dared not ask what was in her heart. He knew he couldn\u2019t bear to hear it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand the smell of him on you,\u201d Caleb sneered.</p><p>Tears sprang to Livvie\u2019s eyes and trailed down her temples. She closed her eyes and turned her head away from Caleb.</p><p>He put his hand on her face and forced her to face him.</p><p>Don\u2019t ask.</p><p>Don\u2019t ask.</p> <p>Fuck! I\u2019m going to ask.</p><p>He needed to know. He needed to know if her love for him was real. He needed to know hope was not lost and he could still, against all odds, repair the damage he had done.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy it?\u201d he asked. He tried not to make it sound like an accusation, but he knew he fell short. Livvie raised her hands to her face, covering her eyes and mouth as she began weeping. Again, Caleb refused to let her hide. He reached for her hands and pressed them into the bed above her.</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want me to say!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth! Did you like sucking his dick? Did he eat your pu**y better than I do?\u201d Caleb\u2019s thoughts were suddenly murderous. He had meant to be kind, he had meant to be gentle, but it just wasn\u2019t his way. He no longer knew what \u2018his way\u2019 was.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Livvie screamed, \u201cYes, you son-of-a-bitch. I liked it. Isn\u2019t that why you made me do it? So you could parade me around like a trained f**king poodle?\u201d</p><p>Caleb saw red. He squeezed Livvie\u2019s wrists until she cried out in pain and he forced himself to let go. Her words hurt him.</p> <p>Mine! You\u2019re f**king mine!</p><p>Caleb pulled away from Livvie and reached for his belt. He unfastened it quickly and pulled it free in one swift jerk. Livvie gasped, scrambling backward across the bedspread. Caleb caught her ankle and dragged her back toward the edge of the bed. She folded her knees and crossed her arms over her br**sts.</p><p>The plug in Livvie\u2019s ass was clearly visible and the sight sent the strangest series of emotions through him, not the least of which was lust. He leaned forward above her and braced his arm across her legs to keep her bent. He chanced a glance up at her face and saw the terror in her eyes as she strove to remain perfectly still.</p><p>He reached down and pressed his palm against the plug. Livvie groaned and shut her eyes, but made no move to stop him. Caleb knew it was cruel to keep her in such a position, but his anger and lust kept him from gentling.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s fingers traced the rim of Livvie\u2019s hole, stretched around the plug. \u201cHow about this, Kitten? Do you like this? Should I invite everyone downstairs to watch?\u201d</p><p>Livvie closed her eyes and turned away with a whimper.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said and tugged gently on the plug until she complied. \u201cDo you want me to take this out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d she whimpered. Tears ran down her temples.</p><p>\u201cAh! It\u2019s Master, now, is it?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re so much more obedient when you\u2019ve something rammed up your ass.\u201d He tugged again.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t! I only did it because you told me to!\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cQuiet! You don\u2019t want to provoke me,\u201d he said. His body trembled with rage.</p><p>You\u2019re scaring her, you idiot. You won\u2019t get to her this way.</p><p>Caleb knew he was hearing the voice of reason in his head, but he seemed unable to help himself. His fingers traced the edges of the plug, over and over until he could feel Livvie\u2019s hips rocking on their own.</p><p>\u201cTell me you like this,\u201d he said. Lust edged his voice.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Caleb continued his gentle, but sadistic exploration. He watched as Livvie\u2019s tears wet her face, but her teeth nibbled on her lip. She felt pleasure, but she also felt shame. It was a feeling Caleb understood all too well.</p><p>Slowly, he pressed on her muscles and pulled on the plug. He wanted it out. He wanted all evidence of the past twenty-four hours stripped away from her body and from his mind.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he snapped, when he felt her tighten up. \u201cPush the plug out,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Livvie sobbed.</p><p>\u201cPush, now!\u201d he said and spanked her upturned ass. It wasn\u2019t much of a slap, but his point was made. Livvie squeezed her eyes shut and pushed at the same time Caleb slid his finger in around the plug to loosen the suction created by Livvie\u2019s ass.</p><p>Slowly, he wiggled the plug back and forth as Livvie pushed, until finally, it popped out. \u201cOh!\u201d Livvie cried out.</p><p>As Caleb dispensed with the toy, Livvie turned onto her side and wept into his bedspread. He returned shortly, at a loss for how he wanted to proceed. He needed to make her his. He pulled her up off the bed and turned her toward it. His heart ached when she didn\u2019t resist.</p><p>Easy, Caleb. Don\u2019t break her. Win her.</p><p>Caleb wrapped his arms around Livvie and pulled her close. He needed her close. She trembled in his arms, her chest heaved with sobs. Caleb buried his nose in her neck and shut his eyes tightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI know. I know you only did it because I told you to.\u201d Livvie gasped and squirmed in his arms as she tried to turn around, but Caleb held her in place. He needed to say things to her and he couldn\u2019t do it unless his eyes were closed and her body was pressed against his. That was his way.</p><p>He\u2019d confessed so many things to her in the dark. He\u2019d whispered to her as she\u2019d slept. He\u2019d held her close to him and fantasized about all the things he wanted and yet felt could never be his. He\u2019d discovered a secret place inside himself in those moments.</p><p>He was done fantasizing. He wanted his desires to become reality.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m f**ked in the head, Livvie. I know it. I know I\u2019m wrong,\u201d he whispered and held her tighter. She was frozen in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI felt like I didn\u2019t have a choice. Felipe\u2019s been watching us since we got here. He has cameras everywhere,\u201d he continued. Livvie gasped. \u201cBut I did have a choice. I could have told him to go f**k himself. I could have killed him right then and there \u2013 but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafiq will be here soon and I.... I needed a way to let you go. I needed a way to remind myself I can\u2019t keep you.\u201d Caleb could feel himself getting choked up. His skin crawled with heat and shame. He was weak to express so much, but now the floodgates had opened, he could do nothing but hold tight to Livvie as he was battered against the rocks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived a horrible life. I\u2019ve done terrible, unspeakable things. You have to know, I\u2019m not sorry. I\u2019ve never killed anyone who didn\u2019t deserve it. The scars on my back are the least of what I\u2019ve suffered. And it\u2019s only because of Rafiq I\u2019m alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Caleb,\u201d Livvie whimpered.</p><p>Caleb squeezed her again, too roughly. He loosened his hold when Livvie whined, but he couldn\u2019t let her go. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to make you understand. I don\u2019t know how to tell you how much I owe him. I owe him everything! But God, help me \u2013 I can\u2019t....\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t say it. He couldn\u2019t tell her how much she had come to mean to him. She could destroy him with her rejection. If she had feigned her feelings for him \u2013 if he\u2019d bought into her lies and her quest for freedom.... He wasn\u2019t sure what he would do. He could hurt her.</p><p>Mine!</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand to see you with that motherfucker downstairs. I wanted to beat him unconscious. Even now, I can smell him on you and it makes me sick!\u201d He growled.</p><p>Livvie cried. She struggled in Caleb\u2019s grasp until she freed her arms. She placed them over his hands and squeezed them. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cBut...you\u2019re just...you\u2019re all over the place! One minute, I think...you must feel something. You have to care! But the next.... Caleb, you\u2019re awful. You\u2019re cruel and you...you break my heart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caleb held her as she sobbed in his arms and never had he wished he could just let go, so much. He wished he were capable of letting everything come out of him. He wanted to cry. He could feel the tears in his throat. Everything hurt, his heart, his throat, even his eyes as he kept them tightly closed. His arms ached with the intensity of his hold on Livvie, but he couldn\u2019t let it out. He\u2019d trained himself for far too long and unlike the job he\u2019d done with Livvie, he\u2019d trained himself much too well.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore, Caleb. I\u2019ve tried, but I can\u2019t,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cEvery time I think you\u2019re coming around, every time I let myself hope, you crush me. You rip everything out! Sometimes I think I f**king hate you. Sometimes I know I hate you. And still! Still, Caleb \u2013 I love you. I put my faith in you. I believe you when you say it\u2019s all going to be alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d she said with a determination capable of stopping Caleb\u2019s heart. \u201cI\u2019m done, Caleb. I\u2019ll kill myself!\u201d</p><p>Mine!</p> <p>Pure rage slammed into Caleb. He turned her in his arms and pushed her onto the bed. His body came crashing down on top of her and he held her down. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare! Don\u2019t you dare say shit like that to me. That\u2019s the coward\u2019s way out and you know it,\u201d he spat.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s eyes burned with a rage to match Caleb\u2019s own. He could see it. He could feel it. \u201cYou\u2019re the coward, Caleb. I\u2019m not afraid to tell you how I feel. I\u2019m not afraid to admit, that despite everything you\u2019ve done to me, I love you.\u201d</p><p>She loves me.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how stupid I feel confessing to you?\u201d she continued, \u201cYou kidnapped me! You\u2019ve humiliated me, beat me, nearly gotten me raped, and just a moment ago you had me suck a complete stranger\u2019s dick in a room full of twisted perverts. I love you, but I\u2019m not the coward, Caleb. I deserve to live or die on my own f**king terms.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stared down into Livvie\u2019s face and the steel he saw behind her eyes shook him to his foundation for the second time. Livvie was no coward. He knew it, had even told himself he\u2019d never accuse her of such a thing again, and this had been why. Livvie would do it. She would end her own life. Caleb couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. It seemed to be all he could say, all he was capable of saying. He relaxed his hold on her and rested his head next to hers on the bed. He made himself breathe, past the pain, past the anguish lying in wait in his throat. Slowly, deeply, he breathed.</p><p>They lay in silence for several minutes. Caleb could feel Livvie\u2019s tears as they slid down her face; they wet his own. It was as close to crying as Caleb could get and for a moment he imagined they were his tears. They were his confession. They said all the things he couldn\u2019t...because he was a coward.</p><p>Slowly, Livvie stirred. Caleb wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but then he felt her arms slide around him. Caleb\u2019s stomach dipped, his heart felt squeezed. She shouldn\u2019t be holding him. He knew it was his place to comfort her since he was the one responsible for all of her suffering. Still, Caleb was selfish. He let her be the one to comfort them.</p><p>\u201cI thought about you,\u201d she said numbly, \u201cwhile he was touching me. I thought about you.\u201d Caleb pressed into her in a silent plea for her to stop talking. He didn\u2019t want to hear this, but Livvie was done listening to him, and he knew it. \u201cI wanted to make you jealous. I wanted to make you feel, even a fraction, of what I felt, the night you f**ked Celia in front of me.\u201d</p><p>Caleb winced. His heart felt even tighter. He hoped Livvie\u2019s words meant he hadn\u2019t lost her yet. Somehow he\u2019d find a way to make it right with her, and Rafiq.</p><p>\u201cI was insanely jealous,\u201d Caleb offered in supplication.</p> <p>Livvie squeezed him for a moment then loosened her hold, \u201cI know. It should make me happy, but it doesn\u2019t.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhy,\u201d Caleb asked softly into her warm, wet neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather make you happy, Caleb. I\u2019d rather see you smile. Sometimes, you smile and I...\u201d she paused, overwhelmed, \u201cI forget about everything that\u2019s wrong with you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb wasn\u2019t sure what to say, so he simply told her the truth, \u201cI\u2019d rather see you smile, too. In the beginning, when I didn\u2019t know you...you seemed so sad. I watched you cry one day and I thought, \u2018I want to taste her tears\u2019. I have a thing about them. I confess I\u2019ve made you cry just to see your tears. I\u2019ve gotten off on your suffering.\u201d He swallowed.</p><p>\u201cBut now,\u201d Caleb said, \u201cI never want to see you cry again. I wish I could go back to the day on the street, the day you thought I\u2019d saved you from the guy in the car, and just...let you believe I was your hero. You smiled at me, so sweetly. You thanked me. I wish I\u2019d just let it be.\u201d</p><p>Caleb could feel Livvie taking deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s what I should want, too,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t. I accuse you of being f**ked in the head, Caleb. The truth is... I wonder if I\u2019m not f**ked up, too. I should hate you, Caleb. Now I\u2019ve decided what my fate will be, I should want to kill you. I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t imagine never having known you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s fate,\u201d Livvie said, \u201cif you believe in that sort of thing. Maybe you were supposed to meet me that day. You asked me once if I\u2019d choose some other girl to take my place. I wanted to say yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said, no,\u201d Caleb whispered. He thought about how it might have worked out with another girl \u2013 if he\u2019d have the feelings he had for Livvie for someone else. He\u2019d been conflicted from the start. He\u2019d been ready to leave his life as Rafiq\u2019s right hand behind until Vladek had resurfaced unexpectedly. Perhaps his emotions had less to do with Livvie and more with his desire to move on from his past. Nonetheless, he doubted it. Livvie was unique to him. Irreplaceable.</p><p>\u201cI did, but I wanted to say yes, Caleb. If I had believed for a second you\u2019d let some other girl suffer in my place... I think I might have said yes,\u201d she said dully. \u201cI\u2019m f**ked in the head, too. Even before I met you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb let her words sink in for a moment. He didn\u2019t believe they were true. Livvie was far from f**ked up, especially while he was the standard. However, if Livvie chose to see some greater purpose behind their relationship and therefore not hate him, he was too weak not to let her believe it.</p><p>As the silence stretched on between them, Caleb became more aware of Livvie and her nudity. He ached to touch her, to make love to her, but there were more things he had to say first.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t erase my debt to Rafiq,\u201d he said. Livvie tensed, but Caleb hurried his words along, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I expect you to understand, but I can\u2019t just leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Caleb? What does it mean, for us?\u201d Her words were said without emotion, but Caleb knew how much she held in check.</p><p>\u201cIt means I have to make him understand. We\u2019ll have to find another way, maybe another girl...\u201d he began.</p><p>Livvie pushed at his shoulder and sat up, \u201cAre you f**king kidding me, Caleb? Another girl? How could I live with myself?!?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s anger was returning, \u201cYou just finished saying....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before!\u201d Livvie shouted, \u201cI could never put someone through this. Never! Please, Caleb, see reason. Let me get dressed and let\u2019s get the f**k out of here and never look back.\u201d She reached out with both hands and held Caleb\u2019s face in a vise-like grip. \u201cPlease, Caleb. Please.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stared into Livvie\u2019s pleading eyes and for a moment he thought he might open his mouth and say yes.</p><p>\u201cI expect obedience, Caleb. I expect your loyalty. Anyone who betrays me will only do it once. Do you understand?\u201d Rafiq had said ominously.</p><p>\u201cYes, Rafiq, I understand,\u201d Caleb had replied.</p><p>\u201cI want to, Livvie,\u201d Caleb whispered, \u201cAside from my revenge, I can honestly tell you, there is nothing I desire more than to take you away and find out what this thing between us is all about.\u201d He reached for her hands and placed them in her lap before he stroked her hair affectionately.</p><p>\u201cBut, this is who I am. I repay my debts. Nothing comes before family, loyalty, duty, and honor. Rafiq is as close to family as I can remember, and I owe him. If you\u2019re asking me to betray him...you can never accept who I am.\u201d</p><p>Livvie shut her eyes tightly, seemingly processing the pain Caleb\u2019s words had caused. He felt stupid and na\u00efve. He should have known Livvie would be incapable of understanding him or his motives. Livvie was no monster and she wouldn\u2019t become one simply because Caleb was.</p><p>\u201cWhy does this guy need to die so badly, Caleb? What did he do? What is so horrible, you\u2019d dedicate your life, and sacrifice your happiness to kill him? Help me understand, Caleb,\u201d Livvie whispered.</p><p>Caleb looked at Livvie, and had he seen any trace of condescension, he would have told her to go to hell, but the only thing expressed in Livvie\u2019s eyes was concern. He was surprised he even recognized it. Rafiq had never really been concerned for Caleb.</p><p>Rafiq had been Caleb\u2019s salvation, his tutor, mentor, and sometimes friend. He\u2019d clothed him, provided shelter, and food. He\u2019d nursed him from a traumatized whore into a dangerous man. Yet, Rafiq had always demanded his due. At the slightest hint of uncertainty on Caleb\u2019s part, Rafiq never hesitated to remind him of his place. Caleb\u2019s life had always been conditional. Rafiq\u2019s favor had always been conditional. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caleb had never questioned Rafiq\u2019s methods or his authority. It had never mattered to him that Rafiq demanded blind obedience. He had always believed he was lucky to be alive and been grateful for Rafiq. Caleb was still grateful and always would be, but until Livvie, Caleb had never known how it felt to have someone care, truly care, for him.</p><p>\u201cI think...,\u201d Caleb\u2019s heart hammered hard in his chest, \u201cI think he...sold me.\u201d His flesh felt like it was on fire, like it would burn, crackle, and molt right off his bones.</p><p>\u201cSold? As...as, in...?\u201d Livvie seemed at a loss for words.</p><p>Caleb looked her dead in the eyes and steeled himself, \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen last week, alright!\u201d He said angrily. \u201cI was young. I don\u2019t even remember how young I was. I have no memories of my life before Narweh. Sometimes, I think I remember something, but I can\u2019t be sure. Even my early years with Narweh get mixed up. I wasn\u2019t born a monster, Livvie.\u201d</p> <p>Livvie\u2019s face crumpled and she seemed to explode with tears. She wrapped her arms around Caleb\u2019s neck, squeezing him with all her strength, \u201cOh, god! Oh, Caleb. I\u2019m so sorry I called you that. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s emotions were everywhere. He didn\u2019t want her pity. He never wanted pity. Still, he seemed to need Livvie\u2019s arms. He didn\u2019t have it in him to push her away.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t alone. There were six of us,\u201d Caleb said. He held Livvie tight to his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t remember being sold. There wasn\u2019t an auction or anything. I think I came in a box. To this day, I can\u2019t stand cramped spaces \u2013 or boats \u2013 I hate boats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings...,\u201d Caleb struggled, \u201chappened to me. Narweh liked to beat me...among other things.\u201d Caleb felt Livvie\u2019s arms tighten around him.</p><p>Mine!</p> <p>\u201cI was getting too old, I think. I was tall compared to the others. I had hair on my balls and under my arms. The men who....\u201d Caleb swallowed hard, \u201cThey wanted boys, not men. I think Narweh meant to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Livvie sobbed into Caleb\u2019s neck, \u201cI can\u2019t listen anymore.\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt something slide loose inside him: shame. Pure, uncut, shame rolled through him. \u201cDon\u2019t love me now you know I used to be a whore?\u201d</p><p>He pushed Livvie away and she flopped backward onto the bed. Her red, puffy eyes fixed on Caleb with disdain. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot!\u201d she said and sat up. \u201cI can\u2019t listen anymore because I can\u2019t stand the thought of you being hurt!\u201d She crawled toward Caleb slowly, wary.</p><p>Caleb wanted to run, but he remained immobile as Livvie\u2019s words tried to settle into his mind. \u201cIt was a long time ago. I made him pay.\u201d Caleb met Livvie\u2019s eyes and saw a flicker of realization light her features.</p><p>\u201cThe bikers,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Caleb said. He cleared his throat, trying to keep calm when all he wanted was to destroy something in a fit of murderous rage.</p><p>Livvie nodded, \u201cThose men deserved to die.\u201d Caleb reared back, incredulous. Livvie continued, \u201cNarweh deserved to die, too. And I...I get why you can\u2019t let this go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Caleb\u2019s heart thudded in his ears.</p><p>Livvie smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach her eyes, \u201cYes, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...?\u201d Caleb prodded.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s mouth turned down in the corners, \u201cI can\u2019t let you replace me. I couldn\u2019t live with myself, Caleb. I couldn\u2019t live...with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not up to you!\u201d Caleb snapped.</p><p>Livvie held up her hand, her fingers curled under as she reached for Caleb. She approached him slowly, as one would a wild animal.</p> <p>Caleb had the desire to push her hand away, but the sorrow on Livvie\u2019s face gave him pause. He let her touch his face and he marveled at how much affection he could feel in her simple, yet complex touch. He closed his eyes and let himself feel loved, just for a few seconds to commit it to memory. It hurt to think it might be the first and last time anyone ever touched him in such a way.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait two years for you to come get me, Caleb. I\u2019m done being the damsel in distress. I don\u2019t need anyone to save me,\u201d she said. Her voice was calm, resolute.</p><p>\u201cLivvie...\u201d Caleb began, but she put her fingers to his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it, Caleb. I\u2019ll go to the auction and I\u2019ll be perfect. I\u2019ll make the son of a bitch want me,\u201d her breath shuddered, \u201cand when we\u2019re alone...I\u2019ll kill him for you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s eyes flew open and he shook his head, \u201cWhat the f**k are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want him dead, right?\u201d Livvie said, \u201cWhat does it matter who kills him or when? I could poison him or something.\u201d</p><p>Caleb couldn\u2019t help but smile, even as he knew he would never let her do such a thing. The fact she would even offer....</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t interested in revenge?\u201d Caleb teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in my revenge, Caleb. But for you....\u201d Livvie whispered, and her eyes said the rest.</p><p>Caleb lunged toward Livvie, toppling her backward onto the bed. When Livvie gasped in surprise, he took the opportunity to kiss her. He wished he couldn\u2019t taste Kid in her mouth, but he refused to let it stop him. He needed this. He needed Livvie and her love. His heart had never felt so flooded. He felt he could burst open with the strength and force of it, nothing but need and desire would come pouring out of him.</p><p>He put everything he felt, but couldn\u2019t put into words, into his kiss. His hands held on to Livvie, pressing her closer, deeper into his body. His inability to touch every part of her at one time seemed a great injustice.</p><p>Closer!</p><p>Mine!</p><p>He broke away from the kiss, only because he needed her permission. He was done taking anything from her she wasn\u2019t willing to give. \u201cCan I....\u201d Fuck you? Didn\u2019t seem right. Make love to you? So, f**king cheesy.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb! For f**ksake, yes!\u201d Livvie cried and pulled Caleb back down into their kiss.</p><p>Caleb chuckled softly into her mouth, but quickly regained his bearings. He wanted this to be perfect. For the both of them. Despite how his own body protested, he pulled himself up and off the bed. He held out his hand for Livvie before he spoke, \u201cI want to take a shower. I\u2019ve waited a long time for this and I just want it to be us. I only want to smell, you.\u201d</p><p>Livvie blushed, but didn\u2019t say anything. She took Caleb\u2019s hand and followed close behind him as they entered the bathroom to wash all traces of the other man away.</p><p>Beneath the flood of warm water, he kissed Livvie. Only hours before, he\u2019d told her he would never kiss her again. What an idiot he\u2019d been! Pressed against her, his bare skin against hers, he regretted every horrible thing he had done to Livvie. He decided he would do anything to make it up to her. He would beg her forgiveness. He would bare his soul. He would bleed and die if he had to, but he would never hurt Livvie again.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said between kisses.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Caleb whispered against her mouth. He knew she wanted him to say the words. He wanted to say them as well, but he didn\u2019t want to lie. Caleb was a monster. Monsters didn\u2019t love. He cared. He hungered. He lusted. He felt more than he ever dreamed possible, and yet...he couldn\u2019t be sure it was love. He wouldn\u2019t lie.</p><p>Caleb went to his knees, kissing a trail across Livvie\u2019s body as he went. He sucked water from her ni**les, drawing her taut flesh into his mouth in long, greedy pulls. He licked under her br**sts and down her ribs. He worshipped her hips and belly. Finally, he parted her legs to find the source of her womanhood.</p><p>He could smell her arousal, see the redness of her swollen clit as it peeked out from under her hood. Pushing her legs farther apart, he stared at the open petals of her inner lips. Soon, his c**k would be sliding past them and into the heat of her. She would be his \u2013 irrevocably. Caleb leaned forward and kissed her lips as he would her mouth.</p><p>She moaned and her hands moved toward Caleb\u2019s head, pushing him closer. It was exactly where Caleb wanted to be \u2013 closer. He teased her lips gently with the tip of this tongue, letting them part slowly as her arousal and his mouth made Livvie wetter. As she rocked on his face, he pushed deeper, tasting her inside.</p><p>\u201cOh, Caleb,\u201d she sighed. \u201cOh, god. You feel so good.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s hands weren\u2019t idle. They traveled up and down her legs, sometimes spreading her thighs, other times scratching up the backs of her legs, forcing her up on her toes. He let them keep traveling as he licked, sucked, and even f**ked Livvie with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna come,\u201d Livvie panted. Caleb grabbed her ass with both hands, holding her in place as he moaned into her pu**y and she came on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d she shouted and fisted his hair. She couldn\u2019t move her hips, so she pulled him close.</p><p>Once Livvie had finished shivering, she let go of Caleb\u2019s hair. It had hurt, but he was okay with pain, especially under the circumstances. He stood slowly, letting his knees work out the pain from having been on the shower floor for so long and turned off the water.</p><p>Livvie reached out and grasped his cock, startling him. He was hard and her touch made him eager. As quickly as was safely possible, he led the way out of the shower and back into the bedroom. To hell with towels. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want you,\u201d Caleb said. He slid against Livvie in a preview of what was to come.</p><p>\u201cI want you, too,\u201d Livvie said and spread her legs. She shivered, her hair and body soaking wet.</p><p>Caleb reached down to Livvie\u2019s pu**y and rubbed her with his fingers, loving the sounds she made and the way she undulated against him. Assured of her desire, Caleb slid his index finger into Livvie\u2019s tight, wet hole.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Livvie sighed. She rocked back and forth.</p> <p>Caleb\u2019s head swam with desire. She was so tight inside. Her muscles sucked on his finger, drawing it deeper inside. There was no way he\u2019d fit inside her if he didn\u2019t prepare her well enough. He dipped his head down to her nipple and trapped the little bud between his lips. When her hips rocked up, he slipped another finger inside.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d she said, followed by a moan, as Caleb laved her nipple.</p><p>Caleb waited for her to relax and for her legs to drop open again before he slowly began moving his fingers back and forth. Her muscles loosened in degrees, stretching around his fingers, lubricating them with her desire.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to hurt a little. You know that, right?\u201d Caleb said. He stared down into Livvie\u2019s chocolate-colored eyes and saw her trust. He didn\u2019t want to betray it again.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s okay,\u201d she said and pulled him down toward her mouth. The kiss she placed on Caleb\u2019s lips was sweet and full of warmth.</p> <p>Caleb felt the barricade of her virginity with his fingers. \u201cPut your hands over your head,\u201d he said. Livvie complied instantly and Caleb used his left hand to pin her wrists. He pushed deeper with his fingers, slowly turning them width-wise.</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d Livvie tried to push away from his fingers, her face a twisted mask of pain.</p><p>\u201cI know, Livvie. I know it hurts, but it\u2019ll be over soon, I promise,\u201d Caleb kissed her lips gently, not offended she wasn\u2019t kissing him back because she was too wrapped up in her pain.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Livvie,\u201d he encouraged. His thumb made circles around her clit as he continued to push against the wall of her virginity. Finally, he felt it give way. It seemed to dissolve as if it had never been.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d Livvie whimpered and rubbed her head against Caleb\u2019s outstretched arm.</p> <p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s done. I think that was the worst part,\u201d he whispered and kissed her trembling lips. He let her wrists go and he sighed when she wrapped her arms around his neck and started kissing his neck.</p><p>Caleb cautiously slid his fingers out. Livvie whined and stopped kissing him. They both looked at his fingers and noticed her light pink blood on them. Caleb couldn\u2019t hear past the sound of his heart beating in his ears.</p><p>Mine!</p><p>He spared a glance toward Livvie and saw she was embarrassed. Meeting her eyes, Caleb placed his fingers near his mouth and licked her virgin blood off of them. Livvie\u2019s face went from embarrassment to horror.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t care. \u201cThere. Now you\u2019re part of me, forever. You\u2019re mine, Livvie. I hope you understand.\u201d</p><p>Livvie swallowed audibly, her eyes flicking from Caleb\u2019s to his fingers and back. \u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she said, but then added, \u201conly yours. And you\u2019re mine, only mine.\u201d</p><p>Caleb could only smile. He couldn\u2019t have said it better himself.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p> <p>She ran her hand down his face, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Caleb reached down and grabbed his dick. If he\u2019d ever been this hard, he didn\u2019t remember it. He was glad this was Livvie\u2019s first time, because he wasn\u2019t going to last very long and perhaps it would keep her from getting too sore. He rubbed the head of his c**k through her wetness, deliberately sliding it over her clit every once in a while.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, stop it. Just do it already,\u201d she moaned. She was trying to get onto his c**k herself, but Caleb kept moving his hips back.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGreedy little pu**y, you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she moaned, \u201cAll the better to make you come.\u201d</p><p>Caleb almost lost it. He\u2019d never imagined Livvie to have such a dirty mouth. He liked it. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we?\u201d He pushed into her pu**y. He didn\u2019t thrust himself inside, but he wasn\u2019t too slow. He wanted her to get to the part where the pain was a memory and she could appreciate the pleasure he wanted to give her.</p><p>\u201cOh, god!\u201d she shouted. Her legs wrapped around him in an attempt to hold him still, but Caleb simply lifted her weight and rocked. With her arms and legs wrapped around him, she hung like a pendulum and her momentum forced Caleb deeper.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Caleb whispered in Arabic, \u201cI want to be all the way inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Livvie said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cI said your pu**y is amazing!\u201d And damn it, it was! Caleb sat back on his heels and wrapped his arms around Livvie. He pushed in the last few inches, grunting loudly when he felt Livvie\u2019s ass on his balls.</p><p>He waited. Livvie held him tightly, leaving kisses on his face, mouth, and neck. She sighed when her muscles finally relaxed and Caleb settled into her.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI love you, so f**king much.\u201d</p><p>Buried inside of Livvie, Caleb experienced nirvana. If ever there were a time to repeat Livvie\u2019s words, he knew it should be now. He couldn\u2019t. He hoped in time, he could. All he could do was caress her, kiss her, and slide in and out of her in the hopes she could feel everything he wanted to express.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Livvie was too tight, too wet, and too f**king incredible inside for Caleb to hold back. He held Livvie in his arms and rocked his hips under, sealing himself against her wet flesh and he started to f**k. Up and down he bounced Livvie on his dick. He wanted to yell out every time he went balls deep, but he settled for whispering filth to her in a language she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh. Oh, god,\u201d was all Livvie seemed capable of getting out.</p><p>Caleb felt heat at the base of his spine and he knew it would be spreading. He was going to come any second and as much as he wanted to, he knew he couldn\u2019t come inside Livvie. He laid her down on the bed, fighting her arms as she clutched at his shoulders and back.</p><p>\u201cArms over your head, right now,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb,\u201d Livvie moaned.</p><p>Livvie\u2019s enthusiastic obedience was enough to push Caleb over the edge. He sucked Livvie\u2019s nipple into his mouth and sucked hard, forcing her to cry out and he pulled his c**k out of her and came against her thigh.</p><p>Once he was done panting, Caleb held Livvie\u2019s trembling body in his arms. He\u2019d never felt happiness like he felt it then, but Livvie was crying. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Caleb whispered. He was mortified to think he\u2019d taken more pleasure than he gave.</p><p>Livvie reached up, touched his face and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said sheepishly.</p><p>Caleb wiped at her tears. \u201cThen why are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Livvie said. Her shaking hands stroked Caleb\u2019s hair away from his forehead. He closed his eyes, enjoying the proprietary way she touched him. \u201cI think I\u2019m just happy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Caleb let out a short laugh, \u201cStrange response to happiness, but okay.\u201d He leaned down and licked at one of the salty tears trailing toward Livvie\u2019s ear. He smiled when he felt her try to wriggle out from under him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She said and laughed.</p><p>\u201cI was curious,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Caleb looked down at Livvie in wonder. He had done so many terrible things to her, things he could never take back. And still, she loved him. Of all the tears he\u2019d made her shed, these were his favorite. \u201cIf happy tears taste the same as the sad ones,\u201d he said.</p><p>A rush of tears rolled down her face, but her smile widened. \u201cAnd?\u201d she croaked.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re sweeter,\u201d Caleb whispered. He kissed her lips and discovered what real sweetness was, \u201cbut it could just be your face.\u201d</p><p>Caleb knew he could never undo what he\u2019d just done and he was glad.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Once upon a time, Caleb held me captive in the dark, now he used it to seduce me. His fingertips traced patterns on my skin, while his lips found their way down my spine, leaving goose bumps in their wake. I sighed and arched beneath him, begging him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spoiled,\u201d he whispered at the base of my spine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve earned it,\u201d I sighed into the bed. One of his large hands palmed my ass cheek and I found myself lifting my hips. I never wanted to leave Caleb\u2019s bed again. I could be content to live out my life being touched, kissed, and made love to by him.</p><p>He swatted my behind playfully, \u201cCareful, Kitten, if you put your ass in my face again, you\u2019re going to learn what a pervert I really am.\u201d</p><p>I stilled for a moment, not sure I wanted to play this game, but then I felt Caleb\u2019s teeth nibbling at the curve of my bottom and thought fled. Slowly, he sucked my flesh into his mouth and bit me gently. It was the perfect blend of pleasure and pain. His tongue laved each spot before he moved on to the next. Small gasps escaped my mouth with each bite.</p><p>\u201cLike that, Pet?\u201d he whispered. He blew gently across my damp skin and I moaned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, Caleb,\u201d I sighed. He had called me by my name earlier and while it melted my heart to know Caleb saw me as a person and not a thing, I was just as happy to be his Kitten. For better or worse, Caleb had instilled his tastes in me.</p><p>I liked knowing the only thing I had to do to make Caleb happy was exactly as I was told. There was no wrong way to touch him. He took charge and knew what to do. In all the humiliations he had put me through, the one thing he had never done was make me feel bad about my body or my inexperience.</p><p>Caleb shifted, and his hands positioned me to suit him. His c**k rested against my left leg, while my right was moved up on the bed. I blushed, knowing how exposed I was from behind, but I didn\u2019t stop him from exploring. If Caleb wanted something, he was sure to get it one way or another. I chose the path of least resistance and greatest pleasure.</p><p>I gasped when his finger stroked the seam of my pu**y. I was sore inside, but his soft, skillful touches on my clit were magic. They always had been. As his finger circled my clit, my hips found their own rhythm, sometimes chasing Caleb\u2019s touch, others trying to pull away from the intensity. I didn\u2019t want the frenzy of orgasm, content to languish in the lazy pleasure Caleb cultivated so easily. Caleb resumed his love bites and I could do little more than writhe and moan.</p> <p>\u201cTell me again whom you belong to,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I moaned, loudly and unabashed. \u201cTo you, Caleb. I belong to you,\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he groaned and bit me again. I gasped, but didn\u2019t pull away from his mouth. \u201cI wish you weren\u2019t sore. I\u2019m dying to get inside you again.\u201d</p><p>My stomach flipped, and I sounded breathless when I replied, \u201cI want you, too.\u201d Instinctively, I raised my hips toward his face. Caleb\u2019s arm wrapped around my right hip, holding me in place as his tongue delved into the last place I was ever expecting.</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d I screamed and tried to get away from his mouth. I moved like a cat trying to escape water, but Caleb had me where he wanted. The feeling of his tongue sweeping across the bud of my sphincter was an alien and shocking sensation.</p> <p>\u201cStop moving,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>I opened my mouth to protest when his tongue pushed at the entrance to my hole and sound escaped me entirely. I froze out of pure instinct, letting Caleb f**k this secret part of me with his mouth. My muscles ached under the strain of staying so still. After a while though, I relaxed into Caleb\u2019s touch.</p><p>He rewarded me by loosening his hold on my hip and returning his fingers to my neglected pu**y. At the first touch of his fingers rubbing my clit, I came. It was too much to resist when Caleb\u2019s domination of me was so thorough. Just the thought of him having me pinned face down with his tongue in my ass, and his fingers stroking my clit, was enough to push me over the edge a second time. I dropped like a rag doll onto the bed.</p><p>Caleb rolled me onto my back with a sense of urgency, and scurried to the top of the bed. He lifted my head onto his knee. I opened my mouth to his c**k and swallowed everything he had deigned to give me. Caleb had taken my virginity gently, but this was the version of him I knew I could expect moving forward. I licked and sucked his glorious c**k until he told me to stop and he gathered me into his arms. It was the first night, in close to four months, I felt safe, sated, and loved. I slept like the dead.</p><p>Rafiq had been delayed by some unforeseen event and Caleb wouldn\u2019t tell me what it might be. For two days, and two nights, it had been glorious. We had two entire days of being ourselves, of being free of obligations and thoughts of revenge. Two days of making love every night in Caleb\u2019s bed.</p><p>Caleb was still a kinky bastard and I was glad to know his taste for imaginative torments had not abated. The specter of my virginity long gone, Caleb felt free to indulge. He liked to make me beg. Over his knee, with my ass in the air, he\u2019d slide his fingers into me and make me beg to come. I would have done it gladly, but the catch involved letting him spank me until I came. In the end, I could never resist and the begging became as real as my orgasms \u2013 and the sting of his palm. Afterward, he\u2019d fling me onto the bed and f**k me into another orgasm before he came. We split most of our time between the bed and the shower.</p> <p>The third morning, Celia came into the room to open the curtains, a suspicious but playful smirk alight in her features. I hadn\u2019t spoken to her since the night of Felipe\u2019s party and when I tried, both she and Caleb seemed opposed to the idea.</p><p>\u201cShe belongs to Felipe and for all we know she\u2019s here to spy on us. She isn\u2019t your friend and neither of us can afford to trust her,\u201d Caleb ranted after Celia left.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even want to talk to me. If she was a spy, wouldn\u2019t she be trying to \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 pump me for information?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so na\u00efve, Kitten. Your face alone gives away everything between us. You can\u2019t hide a thing because your emotions are written all over your face for anyone interested to read,\u201d he said angrily.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but smile, I was happy. I didn\u2019t want to have to hide it. I knew the situation remained dangerous. \u201cWhat do you expect me to do, Caleb, just ignore her? She\u2019s seen me spread-eagled!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect obedience, I expect loyalty.\u201d</p><p>Caleb was apparently less inclined to smile and I knew it had to do with Rafiq. Caleb continued to struggle with what he called a betrayal. I understood now why the situation was so difficult for him, but my need to survive, my need for both of us to escape, was far more important to me than Caleb\u2019s need to make things right between him and Rafiq.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loyal, Caleb. I can\u2019t make any promises as to the rest. You\u2019ve said it yourself, Rafiq is dangerous. He\u2019ll kill anyone standing in his way \u2013 that\u2019s us. It\u2019s us, or him, at this point, Caleb. It\u2019s you who needs to decide where your loyalties lie.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb glared at me for several seconds before his expression softened. He sighed heavily and nodded, \u201cI have to get you out of here, Kitten. I promised to keep you safe and I will, but, I\u2019ve already told you...I can\u2019t betray Rafiq any more than I already have. I have to talk to him, convince him there\u2019s another way. Then I can come for you.\u201d</p><p>I scrambled toward him and wrapped my arms around his neck, \u201cI can\u2019t leave without you, Caleb. What if you never come back? I\u2019ll be out there on my own and anything could happen. What if...what if he kills you? How will I live with myself?\u201d Tears ran down my face as I struggled to find the words to convince him to leave with me and forget about his debt to Rafiq.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m capable of taking care of myself, Kitten. No matter what, I can\u2019t leave this unfinished. If we run, he\u2019ll never stop looking for us. What then? I have no plans to live my life in hiding. I have to finish things one way or the other,\u201d Caleb said. He stroked my hair and tried to be reassuring, but his words left me cold and numb.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cFelipe is having another party tomorrow. There will be lots of people and I\u2019m hoping, plenty of distractions. You\u2019re leaving, Pet. It\u2019s the only way I can keep you safe.\u201d Caleb hugged me so tightly I didn\u2019t have breath to cry.</p><p>One more night \u2013 it was all we could have. I was determined to make the most of it. I pulled back from Caleb. I wanted to see his face. I wanted to memorize every curve, every eyelash. I looked into his Caribbean-blue eyes and the things I saw, stirred my soul, but broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cTell me you love me, Caleb,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He kissed me, refusing. \u201cI wish I could, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>I heard pounding, loud and frantic pounding. My eyes flashed open and the dark surrounding me only helped to exacerbate my panic. Caleb was already out of bed.</p><p>\u201cGet down on the ground and don\u2019t move,\u201d he said in an urgent whisper. He went to the closet and flung it open.</p><p>I reached for the bedside lamp and turned it on. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d I asked. I threw the covers back and scrambled to the ground. Caleb threw something at me and it collided with my chest. He\u2019d given me clothes.</p><p>\u201cPut those on, now!\u201d Caleb said. He was climbing into a pair of pants, buttoning them urgently. He fumbled with a box before he got it open. He removed his gun and cocked it.</p><p>Adrenaline pounded in my veins. Something bad was about to happen.</p><p>\u201cAbra la puerta!\u201d Celia shouted from the other side of the door. She was in a panic of her own and I didn\u2019t know what to make of it.</p><p>Caleb rushed toward me and slid onto the floor, I wrapped my arms around him, pulling him close. His hands dug into my wrists as he pulled me away. Something cold and hard made its way into my hand. I looked down and saw Caleb\u2019s gun.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed, stay here. I\u2019ll knock two times before I come in. If anyone else comes into this room, you f**king shoot to kill. Do you understand?\u201d he said.</p><p>My panic made me deaf and blind. I didn\u2019t understand. I had no idea what Caleb was trying to tell me. He stood and tried to walk away. I grabbed on to his leg, \u201cCaleb! Don\u2019t go, don\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what I tell you!\u201d he shouted and pulled free with so much force I was afraid my arm had come out of its socket again. Caleb was at the door before I could catch him again. He held a big knife at his side and stood to one side of the door. He unlocked it slowly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Celia burst into the room, but she didn\u2019t have a chance to say anything before Caleb grabbed her around the neck with his arm and put the knife to her throat. She struggled, but Caleb subdued her quickly and held her still.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cI came to warn you,\u201d she said, \u201cRafiq and his men are here. They\u2019re downstairs with Felipe. They want to see you.\u201d Celia\u2019s hands held tightly to Caleb\u2019s forearm around her throat. \u201cPor favor,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, let her go,\u201d I sobbed. \u201cShe came to warn us.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb squeezed Celia\u2019s throat until even her sobs couldn\u2019t escape, \u201cWe don\u2019t know, Kitten. She could be here to separate us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill her!\u201d I urged. I didn\u2019t believe Celia would sell me out, but I had no reason to believe she wouldn\u2019t. I raised the gun in my hands, \u201cLet her go, Caleb. I\u2019ll keep her here.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stared at me. His eyes weren\u2019t his own and reminded me more of an animal than a man.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caleb. Let her go,\u201d I begged.</p><p>Slowly, Caleb\u2019s arm around Celia\u2019s throat loosened and she collapsed on the floor, sobbing as she held her throat. I looked up at Caleb and saw the horror in his eyes as he looked down at Celia.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, Caleb?\u201d I said to refocus his attention. As much as I liked Celia, I liked living even more.</p><p>Caleb nodded as he fisted a handful of hair at his nape, \u201cI need to go meet them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t! What if they\u2019re just waiting to kill you?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf everything is as Celia says, then there\u2019s no reason I shouldn\u2019t go downstairs?\u201d Caleb went down on one knee and held the knife to Celia\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Celia pleaded, \u201cFelipe sent me to warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he warn me?!\u201d Caleb insisted.</p> <p>\u201cFelipe knows what\u2019s been happening between the two of you and hasn\u2019t said a word to Rafiq. He doesn\u2019t want to deal with the fallout. You\u2019ve been here for months, instead of the few days, Rafiq, originally promised. The last thing he needs is bloodshed in the house,\u201d Celia cried. She rubbed at her throat; it was red, but the damage seemed relatively benign. She could speak clearly and there weren\u2019t any bruises.</p><p>Caleb stood, \u201cYou stay here with her until I get back.\u201d</p><p>This was my worst nightmare come to life. Caleb was going to walk out the door and never come back. I just knew it. \u201cCaleb, please don\u2019t go. Let\u2019s leave. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her out if there\u2019s trouble,\u201d Celia suddenly offered. Caleb and I stared at her incredulously. \u201cThere are passages in the walls. Felipe had them built in case we needed to escape. I\u2019ll get her out, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you?\u201d Caleb asked. He seemed to be coming around toward Celia.</p><p>\u201cNot for you,\u201d she spat. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to suffer.\u201d</p><p>Caleb nodded, \u201cThank you, Celia. I\u2019m in your debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anything happens to Felipe, I\u2019ll be sure to collect,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Caleb whispered. He grabbed a shirt from the closet and put it on. \u201cThe library?\u201d he asked. Celia nodded and with that, Caleb left the room.</p><p>I wanted to scream. Caleb was gone and he\u2019d left me to fend for myself. He\u2019d panicked and perhaps threatened Celia when he didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you bang on the door?\u201d I asked Celia. She sat on the floor, rubbing her throat and wiping tears from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want them to come looking for you. Felipe barely stopped Rafiq from coming up here himself,\u201d Celia said calmly.</p><p>I felt the gun, warm from my hand, and wet with sweat. \u201cCaleb says Felipe\u2019s been watching us. He said you\u2019ve been watching us. Why would either of you help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelipe trusts no one, Kitten. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you, but Felipe means more to me than you. I love him, but he\u2019s an opportunist,\u201d she said.</p><p>My head was spinning, \u201cDid you really come to warn us, Celia? Is Caleb walking into a trap right now?\u201d I tried to sound contrite. I tried to appear like a friend, asking for another friend\u2019s advice, but truthfully, I wondered if I had it in me to shoot Celia if I had to. The answer terrified me.</p><p>\u201cI swear I came to warn you. As far as I know, Caleb is meeting his friends and nothing more. The worst thing you could do right now is panic,\u201d she said.</p><p>I saw the pleading in her eyes and my instincts told me I could trust her. I wasn\u2019t sure my instincts were worth a damn, but the alternative left me cold. Celia was right, I was panicking. If Rafiq had wanted us dead and nothing more, he could have gunned us down in our sleep.</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d I whispered and set the gun down on the bed. Celia\u2019s eyes cut to it, but she remained in place. I started to put on the clothes Caleb had left for me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Get undressed. If they come up here and find you wearing Caleb\u2019s clothes they\u2019ll know you were planning to escape,\u201d Celia said.</p><p>\u201cWhat if something happens and I need clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need them, Kitten. I promise. The danger was in Rafiq finding you both together in a compromising situation.\u201d</p><p>Again, I believed her. Perhaps, I would believe anyone who told me I had no reason to kill, and no reason to suspect the worst. Perhaps, Celia was telling the truth. I chose to believe the less horrific of the two. I quickly removed the shirt I had just put on.</p><p>Abruptly, there was a knock at the door. \u201cCelia?\u201d asked a male voice.</p><p>I reached for the gun.</p><p>Caleb struggled for calm as he approached the door to the library. Tucked into the back of his pants and sheathed was his large hunting knife. He wondered for a moment if he was doing the right thing by meeting with Rafiq. He had hoped he could convince him their plans for revenge could still prove fruitful without sacrificing Livvie. He still hoped for that particular outcome, but having Livvie in the house, was less than ideal.</p><p>Upstairs, Livvie was vulnerable. If anything were to happen to him he knew she stood little to no chance of escape. Caleb had f**ked up, plain and simple. He had let his emotions get the better of him and he\u2019d acted rashly with Celia, who perhaps would sell him and Livvie out the moment the opportunity presented itself. For all he knew, she already had.</p><p>There was only one way to find out though, and Caleb was determined to see things to their conclusion, one way or the other. He opened the door and stepped into the library. Four sets of eyes turned to greet him and they belonged to Felipe, Rafiq, Jair, and Nancy. Each of the men had a drink in hand and sat near Felipe\u2019s desk chatting about benign things. Nancy knelt at Rafiq\u2019s side, her eyes on the floor. She trembled slightly, and Caleb wondered if it was fear or cold causing it, but didn\u2019t care either way. Caleb breathed a sigh of relief, but still felt worried about the situation upstairs. He hoped Livvie could keep her head and not do anything drastic in his absence.</p><p>\u201cKhoya! Were you sleeping? You look exhausted,\u201d Rafiq said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d he said cautiously. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you so soon.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq eyed him curiously. \u201cWhy would you? I told you I wasn\u2019t sure how long it would take to resolve the situation.\u201d</p><p>Caleb often neglected to take into account Rafiq\u2019s political ties to the Pakistani government. From time to time, his job as a military officer took precedent over his more illicit activities. In those circumstances, not even Caleb knew what Rafiq was involved in and he\u2019d never really cared. If Rafiq wanted to maintain separate lives, it wasn\u2019t Caleb\u2019s place to meddle.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d contact me, is all. If I\u2019d known to expect you, I would have greeted you at the door,\u201d Caleb said without bite. Rafiq let Caleb speak candidly in private, but in public, there was a protocol to be followed. Rafiq was older and as Caleb\u2019s mentor and former guardian, in a position commanding respect. To publicly disrespect Rafiq would be folly of the worst kind.</p><p>Rafiq smiled, \u201cNo worries, Khoya. You\u2019re here now and so am I. Come,\u201d he gestured toward another chair, \u201chave a drink with us.\u201d</p><p>Caleb managed a smile, \u201cOf course, but let me go upstairs and put on some shoes first. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect and I rushed.\u201d What he really wanted to do was go upstairs and give Livvie some relief.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Celia?\u201d Felipe interjected. His tone was light and jovial, but Caleb saw the way his eyes narrowed and his mouth twisted.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs with Kitten, I didn\u2019t want to leave her alone,\u201d Caleb offered, with a warning glance of his own.</p><p>\u201cDoes she still require constant supervision?\u201d Rafiq asked disapprovingly.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I thought it best not to leave her alone, just the same,\u201d Caleb said, before Felipe could offer his own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Rafiq replied and took a sip from his drink. It looked like scotch. \u201cWell, have a seat, Caleb. Don\u2019t put on shoes on my account. We\u2019ll all be retiring soon. I\u2019m tired from so much traveling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Caleb said and took the drink Jair offered him before he sat next to him. Jair smirked, but said nothing and Caleb decided it was best not to make a scene. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, Felipe tells me the girl has been making excellent progress. He says she\u2019s even participated in one of his sordid parties,\u201d Rafiq said with a smile. \u201cHe assures me the girl\u2019s involvement did not compromise her virginity.\u201d</p><p>Caleb swallowed all the liquid in his glass and winced as the amber liquid burned down his throat, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Inside his chest, his heart took up a rapid beat.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it, Khoya,\u201d Rafiq said. \u201cJair had his doubts, but I told him you would never betray me. Not for the sake of one girl.\u201d</p><p>Caleb turned to scowl at Jair in open disgust, \u201cOf course not, Rafiq. I\u2019ll never understand why you listen to anything this pig has to say.\u201d</p> <p>Jair stood and flung his chair back, but Caleb was prepared to meet him. As Jair lunged, Caleb used his upward momentum to push the other man into the air and slam him to the ground. Caleb took advantage of Jair\u2019s stunned state and landed a satisfying punch across his face.</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d Rafiq admonished, \u201cGet off of him, now!\u201d</p><p>Caleb landed another punch and Jair lost consciousness. Caleb couldn\u2019t stand the son of a bitch and regardless of how things turned out, he wouldn\u2019t suffer Jair a moment longer. He reached back for the knife in his pants, determined to plant it in Jair\u2019s chest, but then felt two sets of hands pulling him backward.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, no!\u201d shouted Felipe, \u201cControl yourself in my home.\u201d</p><p>A flat hand collided with the side of Caleb\u2019s face and he knew instantly it had been Rafiq who slapped him. As Caleb struggled to regain his bearing, he heard a gun being cocked just before Rafiq\u2019s foot landed on his chest, winding him.</p> <p>\u201cJair does what I ask him to do. If you have a problem with it, you can take it up with me, Caleb. I won\u2019t tolerate your disrespect. Apologize to Felipe, or so help me, you will walk with a limp from this night forward,\u201d Rafiq shouted.</p><p>Behind Rafiq, Nancy was weeping. Caleb held up his hands in surrender. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I lost control.\u201d Rafiq\u2019s eyes burned with anger and Caleb knew he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to follow through on his threat.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell would possess you, Caleb?\u201d Rafiq spat, literally.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been begging me to put a knife in him since we met, Rafiq. Do you honestly expect me to let him disrespect me? In front of you? You\u2019ve never doubted me before. Never! And suddenly, his word means more to you than mine?\u201d Caleb\u2019s chest heaved beneath Rafiq\u2019s foot.</p><p>Rafiq sighed deeply and shook his head. \u201cI never said such a thing, Khoya.\u201d He removed his foot from Caleb\u2019s chest and cocked his weapon one more time to take the bullet out of the chamber. \u201cThings are....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Caleb whispered. Their revenge was close at hand and Caleb had jeopardized it. Rafiq had every right to shoot Caleb where he lay. The pain in Caleb\u2019s chest suddenly had nothing to do with being held down. He had betrayed the one person who\u2019d never judged him for the things he\u2019d done, for the sake of the one person who loved him in spite of the person he\u2019d become. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Caleb said again, knowing Rafiq couldn\u2019t yet guess how deeply his apology went.</p> <p>He realized there would be no reasoning with Rafiq, no compromise over his fate or Livvie\u2019s. There was only one option left and Caleb had always known it might come down to it all along. One of them would have to die.</p><p>\u201cCelia?\u201d the man repeated. I held the gun in my hands, but didn\u2019t know what I meant to do. I looked toward Celia.</p><p>Her eyes were wide as saucers, but she held up her hands and kept calm, \u201cIt\u2019s Felipe. Please, put the gun down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb said not to let anyone in. I think that includes Felipe,\u201d I said. I felt faint, my world blurry at the edges as I considered shooting my way out of the room.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Kitten! Don\u2019t be an idiot. Felipe will never let you out of here alive if you don\u2019t put the gun away,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cTell him to go away,\u201d I hissed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll know something\u2019s wrong. I would never tell him what to do,\u201d she said.</p><p>Loud knocking and a string of Spanish came through the door, \u201cCelia, come to the door now or I will break down the door.\u201d</p> <p>I nearly vomited in my mouth as I considered going up against Felipe. I looked to Celia and she frantically wiped tears from her eyes. \u201cGo to the door,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d Celia sobbed.</p><p>\u201cAsk him where Caleb is,\u201d I urged.</p><p>Celia nodded and slowly crawled toward the door, \u201cI\u2019m in here with Kitten,\u201d she said. Her voice seemed calm and considering her face was puffy with tears, I was impressed.</p><p>\u201cWhy is the door locked?\u201d Felipe\u2019s angry voice asked through the door.</p><p>\u201cCaleb was worried,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDownstairs with Rafiq, open the door,\u201d he said. It sounded like a command.</p><p>Celia looked toward me with a pleading expression. I weighed my options for a few seconds and decided to let Celia open the door, but there was no way I was giving up the gun. I put it on the ground next to me. \u201cOpen the door,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBe calm, Kitten,\u201d Celia said, \u201cFelipe won\u2019t hurt you unless you make him. Trust me.\u201d She waited until I nodded and then turned the lock. She opened the door slowly and Felipe, gun in hand, stepped inside to the side of the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked Celia, but kept his eyes on me. I was still on the floor, taking cover next to the bed.</p><p>\u201cTell her Caleb is alright,\u201d Celia said. She placed herself between me and Felipe.</p><p>\u201cWhy have you been crying, Celia? What happened here?\u201d Felipe asked. His tone was deadly and calm.</p><p>\u201cNothing, my love. I\u2019ve just been keeping Kitten, company. She\u2019s scared, Felipe. Tell her Caleb is alright. She\u2019s worried about him,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He and Rafiq are having a drink. He should be up here shortly. We can all wait for him,\u201d he said, but didn\u2019t lower his gun.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he come himself?\u201d I screeched.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t, not without raising suspicions. As it was, I suspected something might be happening up here. Why were you crying, Celia?\u201d Felipe asked. His tone hinted at his anger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just girl talk, Felipe. Please don\u2019t make a fuss. She was terrified you were coming to hurt her and it made me think about....\u201d Celia\u2019s voice trailed off. Slowly, she raised her hand and caressed Felipe\u2019s face, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember what it was like in the beginning?\u201d</p><p>Felipe\u2019s eyes turned sad. He lowered his gun and kissed Celia\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry she made you remember,\u201d he whispered. \u201cEspecially when I\u2019ve tried so hard to make you forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Felipe, I promise you I have,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Celia still stood between us and while I didn\u2019t necessarily trust Felipe, she had proven herself a friend by remaining between me and certain death. I remembered my conversation in the dungeon with Felipe. He had taken Celia as a trophy and by his own admission had not treated her kindly. Looking at them now, it was difficult to picture a time when Felipe was cruel to Celia. Then again, I didn\u2019t know either of them very well. Celia didn\u2019t seem to have a clue as to how much Felipe loved her. It looked fairly obvious to me.</p><p>Felipe nodded and pulled Celia into his arms. She sobbed loudly into his chest as he stroked her hair and whispered reassuring things. Seeing them made me ache for Caleb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to cause any problems.\u201d It was true. I didn\u2019t want to cause problems. The only thing I wanted was a way out for me and Caleb.</p><p>Felipe looked up at me, \u201cGo wash up, sweet girl. You\u2019re master should be coming back any minute and I suggest you\u2019re ready for him when he does. You don\u2019t have much time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?!\u201d I blurted.</p><p>Felipe gave me a wry smile, \u201cI wish there was more I could do for the two of you. I\u2019ve enjoyed watching your relationship unfold. Good luck to you, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>As I sat, stunned and with my mouth agape, Felipe led Celia out of the room and shut the door behind him. I had surrendered my hostage. I had surrendered my guide. I had surrendered to whatever fate awaited me once the door opened.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Day 10: 11pm</p><p>Matthew had had a sick feeling in his stomach for the better part of the last hour. The feeling wasn\u2019t necessarily new; it had accompanied him many times on certain cases. The world was a sick, f**ked-up place and he dealt with it more than most, but this case was shaping up to be a nightmare he\u2019d remember forever. Every agent had a case that haunted them. Olivia and her Caleb would be his.</p><p>Some interesting hits had turned up via facial recognition, nation-wide records searches and the Homeland Security database. Matthew, along with a few other agents had started putting the pieces together over the last five hours.</p><p>\u201cI think Karachi makes the most sense given the intel,\u201d Agent Williams said. She\u2019d flown in from Virginia once the sensitive nature of the case became clearer.</p><p>\u201cI agree. The boys at the FIA aren\u2019t going to like what we have to say, but it looks like Muhammad Rafiq has been making use of military resources to cover-up his human trafficking ring,\u201d Matthew said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Karachi was a coastal city, accessible by air and sea. It was an ethnically and socio-economically diverse area, capable of camouflaging rich and poor alike. According to information from SSgt Patel, who had access to the passenger manifests and air traffic control documentation, several high visibility persons of interest would be arriving in the next two days. Many were already in the city. Unfortunately, none of the names on the list were Vladek Rostrovich or Demitri Balk. Still, Matthew reasoned, he could be traveling under a different alias. One thing was certain though; Muhammad Rafiq would be in attendance.</p><p>He thought about Olivia Ruiz and everything she had been saying over the last several days. She had no idea how deep Rafiq\u2019s involvement in the slave trade ran. Based on the pile of information on Matthew\u2019s desk, he was beginning to suspect, Caleb, had no idea either. Rafiq had been in it for the money for a very long time. The evidence suggested he\u2019d been a key player since 1984.</p><p>Matthew held up a picture of Vladek Rostrovich and Muhammad Rafiq taken in Pakistan that same year. Rafiq wore his military uniform and pointed to a table full of Russian weapons, his arm slung over Vladek\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Matthew\u2019s best guess was that Muhammad Rafiq had acted as Vladek Rostrovich\u2019s arms broker during his missions in other parts of the world, most notably: Africa, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Perhaps guns had begun the connection, but it hadn\u2019t ended there.</p> <p>Another photograph from 1987 showed Rafiq and Vladek at a Pakistani military dinner. Vladek sat at the officers table with Rafiq, also in attendance was Bapoto Sekibo. He was notorious for razing entire villages, killing men, women, and children in the pursuit of natural resources and valuable territories for corporate projects coming in from other countries. Some of the corporations even had roots in the U.S. In fact, all three men had been photographed at one time or another with U.S. Senators or CEO\u2019s of major companies.</p><p>Matthew wasn\u2019t surprised sex, guns, and money were interconnected. Even Vladek\u2019s African diamond mines didn\u2019t come as a shock. No, the most shocking piece of information was an unsolved missing person\u2019s case from 1989 sitting on the pile. He couldn\u2019t resist picking it up and staring at the picture paper-clipped to the file.</p><p>\u201cPretty f**ked up, huh?\u201d Agent Williams whispered from across the desk.</p><p>The sick feeling in Matthew\u2019s stomach flared and he rubbed his stomach. As he stared at the photo, he wondered what, if anything, he should do with the information. \u201cYeah. It is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay? When\u2019s the last time you ate?\u201d Williams asked.</p> <p>\u201cHours ago, and just a salad. Been on a steady stream of coffee since then,\u201d Matthew said and offered a watery smile. It was nice working with someone, even if Agent Williams was a little too young and bright eyed for his tastes. She still got excited about the job and didn\u2019t hide it very well. Matthew didn\u2019t really get excited anymore, solving cases was an obsession, locking the bad guys up, satisfying \u2013 but he\u2019d stopped being excited a long time ago. No matter how many cases were resolved, or how many villains were brought to justice, there were always new cases and new bad guys. It was a vicious circle.</p><p>\u201cThat stuff\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Agent Williams said through a smile. \u201cI still have half a turkey sandwich in the fridge if you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not hungry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou keep staring at that picture?\u201d she hedged.</p><p>Matthew couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Olivia. She was mourning the loss of a man she didn\u2019t really know and for the first time, Matthew was beginning to understand why she fought for him so strongly. \u201cThe witness says he died helping her escape. I\u2019m wondering if it should just stay there. I mean, I wish I didn\u2019t know this. I can\u2019t imagine how the mother would feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try not to think about that stuff. Not really our priority, you know?\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bitch getting a team into Pakistan. I\u2019m trying to just focus on one thing at a time. Some kidnapped kid who turned out to be a serious prick isn\u2019t really on my radar.\u201d</p> <p>Matthew looked up at Williams, \u201cHow old are you, Williams?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, \u201cTwenty-four,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhy? Are you going to give me shit about my age?\u201d</p><p>He held up the photograph. \u201cJames Cole was a few months shy of his sixth birthday when he was taken. Just try to imagine your life the past eighteen years and how different it was compared to the hell this little boy had to live through.\u201d</p><p>Williams stared long and hard at the photograph before she turned away to mess with the files on her own side of the desk. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, Reed. I know it\u2019s sad, but there\u2019s nothing we can do for that kid. And the man he turned out to be? He\u2019s better off dead,\u201d Williams said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to defend him. Trust me; I\u2019ve spent the last week doing exactly the opposite. It\u2019s just...she has a way of making me think about things. She basically talked her way out of being sold at the auction.\u201d Matthew smiled. Olivia was certainly unlike any person he\u2019d met in his thirteen years on the job. He would never forget her, or Caleb, and the boy he\u2019d been. He would never forget this case and for whatever reason, he felt the need to take a moment and preserve the memory of it correctly.</p><p>\u201cPretty smart girl. Except for the falling in love with her captor part,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAlthough, if you\u2019re going to fall for any kidnapper, good gawd, he should be as handsome as this son of a bitch.\u201d Williams lifted Caleb\u2019s surveillance photo from a few years back and waggled her eyebrows.</p><p>Matthew laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re sick. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Williams shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t get out much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, the job, I guess. I don\u2019t really get off on dating other agents and normal guys can\u2019t deal.\u201d She shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should let his mother know we found him?\u201d Matthew asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been twenty years, Reed. She\u2019s probably thought he was dead for a long time. I don\u2019t think telling her we found her son and he just so happens to be a human trafficking son of a bitch who died in a botched escape attempt isn\u2019t exactly consoling,\u201d Williams said, wryly. She and Matthew sat in silence for a few moments, before Williams added, \u201cShe\u2019s better off believing her little boy died innocent, you know?\u201d</p><p>Williams had a point. \u201cYeah. I just wish...I wish I\u2019d been in the bureau back then, maybe I could have found him before it was too late.\u201d He thought about Olivia and her grief. It was sad, knowing she was the only one who would miss Caleb. She was the only who would mourn him.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Williams said suddenly, and startled Matthew.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not really relevant, but...\u201d She handed one of her files over to Matthew. \u201cVladek went to college in the U.S. He went to the University of Oregon,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, check the date,\u201d she added grimly.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t finish. He was there \u201880 to \u201882.\u201d Realization was slowly dawning on Matthew, and he felt bile crawling up into the back of his throat. \u201cJames Cole was born in 1983. In Oregon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia Ruiz mentioned Rafiq wanted revenge against Vladek, something to do with his mother and sister. Apparently, Vladek killed them, or so Rafiq says. I\u2019m starting to think everything out of the guy\u2019s mouth is bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to pull James\u2019 birth certificate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, do that. Did you already call the Deputy Director to let him know we think the auction is taking place at the military cantonment in Karachi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him an hour ago, figured he could get started on organizing the op. That, SSgt Patel, doesn\u2019t seem like the cooperative type. Holy f**k, Reed...do you honestly think Vladek, would sell his own f**king son?!\u201d</p><p>Matthew wanted to start punching things, \u201cNo. I think he was collateral damage.\u201d It was all starting to come together. The pieces of the puzzle were slowly forming in Matthew\u2019s mind. There were still huge pieces missing, but Matthew thought he could make out the picture just the same.</p><p>\u201cWell, we already know where the auction is. Everything else is just gravy at this point. Let me finish pulling these records and then I say we pack it in for the night. If we get the green light, we could have Rafiq in custody in the next seventy-two hours. We can get our answers straight from the source,\u201d Williams said.</p><p>Matthew could hear the anger and determination in Williams\u2019 voice. He admired her fire, but he\u2019d been around long enough to know fire could get you burned. \u201cI doubt we\u2019ll even get a crack at him, Williams. Be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? We have a mountain of f**king evidence and a witness,\u201d Williams spouted.</p><p>\u201cWhat we have, is a high ranking military official from a foreign government, accused of crimes in a completely different country. I want this guy. I want him bad, but I\u2019ve been here before, Williams. Sometimes...they get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here, Reed? Why have you been working this case so damn hard?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOlivia Ruiz was the original perpetrator. She caused an international incident when she decided to cross the US-MEXICO border waving a gun. She didn\u2019t become the victim until later. I had no idea this case was going to become the juggernaut it is. I\u2019ve worked the case, Williams. It\u2019s all any one of us can do,\u201d Reed said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well...it\u2019s not over yet, Reed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever said it was, Williams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d Williams sighed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have James Cole\u2019s, birth certificate. His father is listed as \u2018Vlad\u2019, with no known last name. There\u2019s a death certificate here too, seven years after James disappeared. That\u2019s pretty standard, I guess. Let me see what I can find on the mother, Elizabeth Cole,\u201d Williams shook her head, \u201cShe died in 1997. Coroner\u2019s report reads self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\u201d</p><p>Matthew\u2019s heart felt like it was sinking. James Cole had been kidnapped when he was five and sold into slavery. It had most likely been an act of revenge against his father, Vladek Rostrovich. He\u2019d been beaten and abused most of his life and according to Olivia Ruiz, the only person he had ever trusted, had been the one to ruin his life in the first place.</p><p>\u201cThis is depressing the hell out of me, Reed,\u201d Williams whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Matthew cleared his throat, \u201cMe too. I just thought I could give the poor woman some peace, but it looks like she found it on her own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe should get some sleep. Chances are, we\u2019re going to have a full day tomorrow. If everything goes well, you\u2019ll be on a plane to Pakistan to lead the raid. Do try, to remember the little people when you\u2019re promoted,\u201d she smiled impishly and fluttered her lashes for effect.</p><p>Matthew managed a short laugh, \u201cI\u2019ll try, Agent...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Williams.\u201d Matthew continued to go over the stack of files on his desk as Williams, got ready to leave. He knew he should be doing the same, but he couldn\u2019t let it go quite yet.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I get the feeling I\u2019m going to see you sitting there when I come back in the morning?\u201d Williams said, as she slung her laptop bag over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out of here soon. I just want to poke around a little more. I couldn\u2019t sleep right now anyway \u2013 been drinking coffee all night, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, likely story. I\u2019ll be in around seven if we\u2019re not called up sooner. I\u2019ll bring you something to eat and maybe some coffee that won\u2019t eat through your stomach,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI like the coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Williams said, as she stepped into the elevator.</p><p>Matthew stood up and grabbed the files on Williams\u2019 desk. He\u2019d done his job. The rest would fall to the bureau and the justice department. Regardless, the puzzle wasn\u2019t solved, and he couldn\u2019t stop putting it together. Olivia deserved to know the truth.</p><p>Three hours later, Matthew had a list of events and possibilities. He\u2019d learned a lot of things about the major players in the case, but had just as many new questions as he did answers:</p><p>1960 AKRAAN Arms Co.

Felipe had gone upstairs, despite Caleb\u2019s best efforts to stall him and get there first. Fifteen minutes had passed and he hadn\u2019t heard a gunshot, or any screams. Good news, but his worries were far from dispelled. He wanted his wits about him if things suddenly took a turn for the worse. In many ways, they already had.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mind felt ravaged over how to deal with Rafiq. Their relationship had always been complicated, but it remained the closest Caleb had to family or friendship. Rafiq had been Caleb\u2019s salvation and so many other things over the years...and now he contemplated killing him.</p><p>Caleb knew he couldn\u2019t run away with Livvie. Rafiq would hunt them down to the ends of the earth and while Caleb could take care of himself, it was no life for Livvie. She deserved better. He had considered separating himself from her, but he knew if Rafiq couldn\u2019t find Caleb, he would find Livvie again and use her to get to him.</p><p>Rafiq deserved his revenge. Livvie deserved to live her life. That left Caleb thinking about what he deserved: nothing. He\u2019d fought so hard to live, to survive, and he didn\u2019t relish the idea of ending it all, but he would...for Livvie, he would. He\u2019d lived a meaningless life that would culminate in him destroying every meaningful relationship he\u2019d ever had. At the very least, he thought, he could have meaning in his death.</p><p>\u201cWhat has you so troubled, Khoya?\u201d Rafiq asked in Arabic, now they were alone. He had sent Jair away once he\u2019d regained consciousness, and Felipe had used the opportunity to excuse himself from the room. Nancy remained, but she seemed unaware of her surroundings as she huddled on the floor and supported Rafiq\u2019s legs on her back.</p><p>Caleb gestured toward her with his drink, \u201cIs that really necessary?\u201d</p><p>Rafiq smiled, \u201cNo, but she\u2019s here, so why not make use of her? Answer my question, what has you so troubled?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s heartbeat accelerated and heat traveled down his spine, but he attempted nonchalance, \u201cThings are moving quickly now. I keep going over things in my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a long battle. I don\u2019t know which of us has sacrificed more to see Vladek suffer. The auction is only the first step. It will be up to you to earn his trust, but it will be worth it when everything he has belongs to us, even his very life,\u201d Rafiq said. He took another drink of scotch and Caleb noted it was his third.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Caleb replied, but his tone hinted at his unease.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been strange these last few months, Caleb. I would have thought you\u2019d be happier to have your vengeance so close at hand,\u201d Rafiq said. He sounded irritated.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just kill him, Rafiq? I would do it. Gladly and in front of everyone, I would kill him. We\u2019re wealthy men. We don\u2019t need his company, or his money,\u201d Caleb said and instantly regretted it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the money, Caleb! It never has been. I want it because it\u2019s the only thing he loves as far as I can tell. If you knew of the things he\u2019s sacrificed for his precious billions, it would be all you could do not to find him now. Tonight! He has no wife, no children. He trusts no one! And he has taken everything from me. Death is not enough. Torture is not enough. I thought you of all people would understand!\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t Caleb said something similar to Livvie? It seemed like ages ago, the night he\u2019d rescued her from the bikers and informed her of her fate. She\u2019d asked him why?</p><p>\u201cI have obligations, Kitten.\u201d He swallowed deeply. \u201cThere\u2019s a man who needs to die. I needed you...need\u2014\u201d He paused. \u201cIf I don\u2019t do this now then I\u2019ll never be free. I can\u2019t walk away until it\u2019s done. Until he pays for what he did to Rafiq\u2019s mother, to his sister, until he pays for what he did to me.\u201d Caleb stood abruptly, his chest heaving. He ran angry fingers through his hair and fisted his hands at his nape. \u201cUntil everything he loves is gone, until he \u2013 feels it. Then I can let it go. I\u2019ll have repaid my debt. Then, perhaps...maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Rafiq. I do understand. For twelve years, my life has been nothing but our quest for revenge. I\u2019m just tired, Rafiq. I\u2019m tired and I want it to be done. I want him dead and I can\u2019t wait for him to die slowly, but I\u2019m ready to move on,\u201d Caleb said. It was the truth. He was ready to move on with his life and he wanted it to be with Livvie. He wanted what could never be.</p><p>Caleb stared at Rafiq, the man wasn\u2019t well. His hair seemed grayer, his face harder, and his eyes lacked the slightest glimmer of compassion. In the entire time Caleb had known him, he had never taken a slave for his own, trained them, yes \u2013 kept them, no. The fact he\u2019d kept Nancy alive this long and broken her down so thoroughly spoke volumes about his mental state. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caleb continued, momentarily resigned to his fate, \u201cHave you no thought for me? Brother. All those years I spent as a whore? No one knows better than you, everything I suffered. Did you never think I might want to forget? All those years of being your shadow, learning how to kill, and training whores for the very men who would have used me, did you never think I might want to just walk away from it and be...I don\u2019t know! Something more!\u201d Caleb felt as though a floodgate had been opened in his soul.</p><p>\u201cI was finally going to show her she was wrong about me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are something more, Caleb. I made you something more. I made you a man. I delivered you! I made others quake in fear of you. Who were you before me? K\u00e9leb! That\u2019s who you were! A dog.\u201d Rafiq slammed his glass on the end table near his chair and kicked Nancy over for good measure. Nancy\u2019s sobs quickly filled the room, but she held her hands over her mouth to stifle them.</p><p>Pure, uncut, rage thrummed in Caleb\u2019s veins and he\u2019d never wanted to strike Rafiq so much. Only his thoughts of Livvie staid his hand. Her life was in danger and it remained Caleb\u2019s responsibility to keep her safe. \u201cI know who I am, Rafiq. I know what I am. And I know I owe it all to you. You\u2019ve spoken to me so much about loyalty, but only minutes ago you were willing to maim me to protect Jair, of all people. Where is the loyalty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told myself you couldn\u2019t help yourself. I told myself something happened to you to make you this way, to make you as f**ked up as me but you\u2019re even more f**ked up than I am. And in the strangest corners of my mind I thought...\u201d</p><p>Caleb remembered Livvie\u2019s fear, her despair. She\u2019d been brutalized by several men, beaten and bloodied. She had thought Caleb was her savior. Caleb was no one\u2019s savior. He looked at Rafiq and saw the worst parts of himself reflected in the other man.</p><p>\u201cThat you could fix me? What\u2019s more, that I could fix you? Well, sorry, Pet, I don\u2019t want to be fixed.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq leaned forward, the devil in his eyes, \u201cWe\u2019ve known one another for a long time, Caleb. You understand how important this is to me. I won\u2019t tolerate anyone interfering with our plans \u2013 not even you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ran. I went to collect my property. End of story. In two years, maybe less, I\u2019ll have what I want \u2013 revenge.\u201d</p> <p>For Rafiq and Caleb, it had always been about revenge. It had been the only thing that had ever mattered. Not friendship. Not loyalty. Not justice. It seemed so trivial now, so small when weighted against the price: Livvie. \u201cI want to kill Vladek and I want it to be the end,\u201d Caleb whispered.</p><p>Rafiq let out a derisive snort and sat back, \u201cThis is about the girl, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Fear quickened Caleb\u2019s pulse, \u201cNo! This is about us. It\u2019s about our partnership and how much it has always been weighted in your favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe proceed with the plan, Caleb,\u201d Rafiq said resolutely. \u201cYou\u2019ve overstepped your boundaries and taken advantage of the love I have for you for the last time. You\u2019re tired and not yourself, and so, I will try to forget the things you\u2019ve said tonight, but I will not tolerate your disrespect again. Consider yourself warned.\u201d</p><p>Caleb took a moment to regain his calm. He was tired and tonight could very well be the last time he and Rafiq talked as friends. Sadness crept in around the edges of his anger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rafiq. I haven\u2019t been fair. For twelve years you\u2019ve looked after me when you didn\u2019t have to and I don\u2019t want to sound ungrateful. I was an angry and willful boy and it couldn\u2019t have been easy to take me in. I would be dead if not for you...or worse. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq seemed to soften. He sat back in his chair and thoughtfully eyed Caleb. \u201cYou\u2019re forgiven, Khoya. Perhaps I wasn\u2019t always kind or considerate of you, either. You\u2019ve earned your keep and my respect.\u201d Rafiq stood and poured himself another drink and tilted it toward Caleb, \u201cDrink with me, to loyalty.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb raised his glass with some effort, \u201cTo loyalty.\u201d The liquid burned his throat and sat heavy in his stomach where it met with his shame and conspired to make him retch.</p><p>\u201cWe leave the day after tomorrow. I\u2019ve arranged for a pilot and a private plane to fly us home. It will be a longer journey, avoiding customs, but I don\u2019t trust the girl. I\u2019m not taking any chances. I\u2019ll resume her training in the morning. I want to be sure she\u2019s ready,\u201d Rafiq said. He seemed in higher spirits.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s heart sank, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it make more sense for me to maintain control of her training until we land in Pakistan? She\u2019s frightened of you and it might prompt her to behave rashly.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cYou\u2019ve coddled her enough, Khoya. It\u2019s time she understood her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about what might happen to her after we\u2019re done with her?\u201d Caleb asked while trying to remain respectful.</p><p>Rafiq smiled, \u201cAh! You do want her then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Rafiq. Not after Vladek has had his way with her. I\u2019m only curious if you have any plans for the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you, Khoya. Consider her your reward for a job well done. When it\u2019s done of course,\u201d he said with a smile.</p> <p>Caleb offered a smile of his own, though all he felt was anger and despair. Caleb stood slowly and embraced Rafiq as he said goodnight. In his heart, he knew it was also a farewell.</p><p>\u201cWill you miss me Caleb?\u201d Livvie put her arms around Caleb. He held her in place.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>On his way back to his room, he ran into Felipe in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cMy, don\u2019t you look serious tonight,\u201d Felipe\u2019s accented words brought Caleb to a halt. Felipe walked over to him and led him toward one of the temporary bars he had set up for the party the following evening. \u201cI believe you could use a drink, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Felipe walked behind the bar and poured them both a short glass of bourbon. He handed Caleb a glass, and then lifted his, saying, \u201cTo a long life filled with love.\u201d He drank, and then set his glass down on the bar when Caleb didn\u2019t reciprocate.</p><p>\u201cI realize I owe you my gratitude, but I\u2019m short on gratitude at the moment,\u201d Caleb said.</p><p>Felipe smiled, \u201cYes, that was close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you help me?\u201d Caleb asked, suspiciously.</p><p>Felipe shrugged, \u201cI\u2019m romantic. Also, I have no interest in having blood spilled in my home. Too messy.\u201d Felipe\u2019s expression turned quizzical, \u201cWhat will you do, Caleb?\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t trust Felipe. \u201cRafiq insists on taking over Kitten\u2019s training. We leave the day after tomorrow. That should make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Felipe said and poured himself another glass of bourbon. \u201cRafiq insists on a lot of things, doesn\u2019t he? He\u2019s expecting a virgin.\u201d</p><p>Caleb bristled, \u201cWhat exactly is your relationship with Rafiq?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says we\u2019re friends, but I\u2019m not sure I would put it quite that way. We\u2019re in business together. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t know, or at least asked me sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of business?\u201d Caleb asked. His curiosity was piqued.</p><p>\u201cThis and that, it doesn\u2019t really matter, Caleb. I was only surprised you never asked the question. I suspect Rafiq never cared for questions. Are you truly going to give him the girl?\u201d Felipe lifted an inquiring brow.</p><p>Caleb narrowed his eyes, \u201cI don\u2019t have much a choice, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a choice, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Felipe? You say you\u2019re in business with Rafiq, why are you so interested in me and what I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I trust you?\u201d Felipe asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trusting you, to keep quiet about everything you\u2019ve seen on your nasty little cameras. The most trustworthy relationships involve collateral.\u201d</p><p>Felipe chuckled, \u201cWell, I have enjoyed watching you. Why not take the girl and run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want Rafiq out of my business,\u201d he swallowed his bourbon, \u201cpermanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could kill you for saying that,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>\u201cYou could. Then you\u2019d never know the truth,\u201d Felipe countered. He sighed, and waited for Caleb to reply, when he didn\u2019t, Felipe said, \u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time for you to come forward to me with your past. I\u2019d hoped we could be friends.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stared across the bar at Felipe, stunned, \u201cYou know my past? Wait...no. You heard me on the camera.\u201d He glared at Felipe with murderous intent.</p><p>\u201cI know you were in Tehran. You never said that, on camera,\u201d Felipe said.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s vision was blurry and his heart was racing, \u201cRafiq could have told you. You could have overheard our conversations.\u201d</p><p>Felipe became gravely serious, \u201cCollateral, Caleb. Tell me a secret. One you\u2019ve never told anyone and could cost you your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the f**k would I, Felipe? You\u2019re not making any goddamn sense,\u201d Caleb growled. The world shifted beneath his feet, or so he thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat I could tell you would change everything you have ever believed and I need to know you can be trusted to do the right thing,\u201d Felipe said ominously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caleb didn\u2019t want to know.

His body shook and his skin burned.</p><p>\u201cA secret, Caleb,\u201d Felipe whispered and leaned forward.</p><p>There was nothing left to lose, except the girl, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Felipe shook his head, \u201cThen I can\u2019t help you. Goodnight, Caleb.\u201d He turned to walk away and Caleb grabbed his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d Felipe gripped Caleb\u2019s hand and flung it off his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI...assure me the girl will be safe,\u201d Caleb said and it felt like yet another betrayal. The implications alone were a death sentence for him and Livvie. Of course, Felipe already knew what she meant to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do for the girl, Caleb? Would you die for her? Would you kill?\u201d asked Felipe in a whisper. He looked around the room and Caleb did the same. They were alone.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s heart thundered in his chest, \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you live? Could you live knowing your entire life has been a lie?\u201d</p><p>Caleb was one second away from throttling Felipe and forcing him to talk. He still had his knife tucked into his pants and already, he was thinking of his plan of attack, \u201cTell me...now!\u201d</p><p>Felipe sighed, \u201cFollow me into the dungeon. I\u2019ll tell you everything, but you won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs and unharmed. If you care for her as much as I believe you do, I would suggest you keep your wits intact. If all goes as I hope it will, the both of you can leave this place together and never return.\u201d Felipe said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why now? All this time and you\u2019ve never dangled information in front of me,\u201d Caleb said through gritted teeth. Felipe wanted Caleb to do something. It meant he couldn\u2019t be trusted. Caleb\u2019s mind was already churning with ideas on how to get rid of him. Still, Caleb wanted to hear what Felipe had to say. Perhaps he could use it to sway Rafiq.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a business man, Caleb. One does not achieve my level of success without first being able to spot an opportunity. Twenty years ago, I saw an opportunity to stop being a lieutenant and become a general. Rafiq was useful then. Six years ago I saw an opportunity to expand my business by eliminating my competition. I own half of Mexico now and do business around the world. Rafiq has become...less useful, and as I said, he insists on a lot \u2013 too much. You provide me an opportunity, Caleb. In exchange, I can give you the truth about whom you are and where you come from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmitting you want Rafiq out of your way doesn\u2019t give me a reason to trust you,\u201d Caleb said in hushed tones. \u201cWhy would you need me to do your dirty work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppearances, Caleb; they\u2019re everything. I\u2019ve had plans to get rid of Rafiq cleanly, without inciting the loyalty of our mutual friends. However, I\u2019ve been watching you...and the girl. I know what love can do to a man and I know how desperate you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you! I\u2019m not desperate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you? I wasn\u2019t sure at first. When you allowed the girl to play at my party, I thought your loyalty to Rafiq knows no bounds. But I saw how it affected you, how jealous you became. I know you took her virginity. Did you think you found all the cameras?\u201d Felipe smiled smugly. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to come to you, Caleb. I\u2019ve put myself and Celia in a compromising situation and I don\u2019t do it lightly. I\u2019m offering you vengeance. I\u2019m offering you a chance to live out your days with Kitten. Do you want it, or not?\u201d</p><p>Caleb thought about everything Felipe said. Felipe knew everything between him and Livvie and hadn\u2019t said a word. Caleb knew nothing about Felipe\u2019s plans until now and the fact he\u2019d offered the information himself only solidified his trustworthiness. Caleb had nothing left to lose and everything to gain. \u201cLead the way,\u201d he said.</p><p>As Caleb followed Felipe down the dark wooden stairs, he contemplated pushing him. However, he\u2019d made up his mind to hear what the man had to say. He could always kill him after. Caleb reached for the light and turned it on as they descended.</p><p>He thought of the last time he had been down here. He\u2019d strapped Kitten to an exam table and watched her play with her pu**y. He smiled to himself.</p> <p>When they arrived at the bottom, Felipe pointed to a chair near the wall. \u201cI\u2019ll need you to sit there and I\u2019ll need to tie you up.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s steps faltered and he reached for his knife. He held it out in front of him, blocking the stairs, \u201cYou\u2019ve lost your f**king mind if you think I\u2019m going to let you tie me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a child! Your anger makes you stupid and I don\u2019t need you acting rashly. What I have to tell you is going to boil your blood and I can\u2019t have you loose in the house!\u201d Felipe shouted.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you have to say! Or you die now! I\u2019m tired of your games, Felipe,\u201d Caleb said.</p><p>Felipe\u2019s eyes shone with fury as he held up his hands and backed away from Caleb. Abruptly, he reached behind him and pulled out his gun. \u201cSit. Now.\u201d</p><p>Adrenaline surged through Caleb\u2019s veins, but he knew he was at a disadvantage. He\u2019d played directly into Felipe\u2019s hands. He weighed his options and was horrified to discover they were few and ended in his death. His only true concern was for Livvie.</p><p>\u201cSwear to me the girl is safe,\u201d Caleb whispered and he realized it sounded like a plea. It had been a long time since Caleb had begged for anything.</p><p>Nothing left to lose, Caleb. Fuck your pride.</p><p>\u201cI swear it,\u201d Felipe said evenly.</p><p>Caleb swallowed, \u201cYou can keep the gun on me. There\u2019s no need to tie me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome inside and sit down. I\u2019ll leave you free, but if you attempt to get by me, I will shoot you, Caleb. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Caleb said and did as Felipe asked.</p><p>\u201cDid Rafiq ever tell you how his mother and sister died?\u201d Felipe asked.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s heart felt like it might burst clear out of his chest. His mind was fixated on Livvie, on seeing her again, on getting her to safety. Felipe\u2019s questions seemed strange and Caleb suddenly wished he\u2019d never agreed to listen. \u201cVladek killed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you never wonder why?\u201d</p><p>Caleb had wondered, many times, but Rafiq had explained it all away by saying Vladek had been a criminal, simply passing through and fixated on his sister. \u201cGet to the point!\u201d</p><p>Felipe sighed heavily, \u201cVery well. Rush me if you must, but keep your mouth shut and listen. Rafiq killed them.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s face contorted in disbelief, \u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d He stood and took a step forward. He stopped when Felipe drew the hammer back on his revolver.</p><p>\u201cSit down! It\u2019s only the beginning,\u201d Felipe\u2019s accent was thicker when he was angry. Caleb sat. \u201cI met Rafiq and Vladek in the 80\u2019s. The two of them were dealing in stockpiled Russian weapons. My boss at the time was accepting shipments from them in exchange for cocaine and heroin. Over the years, all of us became...friends. Rafiq and Vladek were especially close.\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt dizzy, but he maintained his bearing.</p><p>\u201cThe stockpile eventually dwindled, but by then, Vladek had become the heir to his father\u2019s company in Russia. His father and brothers...met with an unfortunate accident. Anyway, things were good for a while, but nothing good lasts forever, as they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain!\u201d Caleb shouted, \u201cGet to the f**king point!\u201d</p><p>Felipe smiled, \u201cI\u2019m tempted to put a bullet in you, Caleb. Shut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafiq\u2019s father died, leaving him in charge of his mother and sister. Rafiq loved them very much and doted on them, especially his sister, A\u2019noud. We were all young men, then. Young men are stupid. Vladek stuck his dick where it didn\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt as though he\u2019d been hit by lightning. \u201cRafiq\u2019s sister,\u201d Caleb said. Memories were strange. No matter how much time elapsed, or how a memory could change, a person still trusted their own mind. Caleb, the boy, had trusted Rafiq implicitly. It only made sense for Caleb, the man, to trust him as well. Still, the information, while surprising, was not damning or life changing. Caleb could understand why Rafiq would be angry.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Felipe said. \u201cWhen Rafiq discovered his sister was pregnant and Vladek was the father, he strangled his sister in a murderous rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\u201d Caleb hissed. Rafiq wouldn\u2019t murder his own family, no matter how angry he might have been.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt!\u201d Felipe said. \u201cIt will all make sense to you in a few minutes. Rafiq\u2019s mother tried to protect her, and she met the same fate. Rafiq was riddled with guilt and he blamed Vladek. Rafiq was out to find him, but Vladek was gone, so he went after their business contacts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d Caleb asked. He was increasingly suspicious.</p><p>\u201cMy boss wouldn\u2019t help him, so he came to me. In exchange for what I knew, he helped me rise to power. I\u2019ve always been an opportunist, Caleb. I thought he would lie in wait for Vladek, but what he did instead was.... Well, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Caleb snorted, \u201cI still don\u2019t see what this has to do with me. Rafiq lost his temper \u2013 he wasn\u2019t himself. Vladek still deserves to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has a great deal to do with you, Caleb,\u201d Felipe said.</p><p>Caleb studied Felipe and the unease in his eyes set the hair on Caleb\u2019s body on edge. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Caleb asked, and for the first time, a tendril of pure fear raced down his spine.</p><p>\u201cVladek had been a bit of a ladies\u2019 man. Women swooned over his blond hair and blue eyes, but I remembered he once spoke longingly about an American woman he\u2019d met at college. She\u2019d left him suddenly and V had said she was the one who got away. I pointed Rafiq toward her.\u201d Felipe paused, apparently lost in thought.</p> <p>Caleb had heard enough. Felipe had said nothing to sway Caleb\u2019s loyalty and Livvie was waiting upstairs. Their time together had dwindled to a few precious hours and he was done wasting them. \u201cSo, Rafiq was a killer long before I knew him. So what?\u201d Caleb stood, \u201cKeep your secrets, Felipe. And keep mine as well, at least until tomorrow night. I promise to do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a son!\u201d Felipe spat. \u201cThe splitting image of Vladek: blond hair, blue eyes.\u201d</p><p>Caleb slowly sat back down. He swallowed bile and broke out in a cold sweat. He didn\u2019t want to hear anymore. \u201cWait. Stop.\u201d He waved his arm.</p><p>\u201cNo one knew. Not even, Vladek, I think. When Rafiq couldn\u2019t find Vladek, he went after the boy as a means to flush Vladek out.\u201d</p><p>Not f**king true. He\u2019s lying, Caleb. Kill him. He\u2019s lying!</p> <p>Felipe didn\u2019t relent, \u201cVladek went deep into hiding. He had heard about A\u2019noud and knew Rafiq was searching for him. He never came to claim his son, even after Rafiq put him to work in a brothel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Caleb said.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Felipe insisted, \u201cThe truth, Caleb. Hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense! He\u2019s the one who saved me,\u201d Caleb insisted.</p><p>\u201cAll he\u2019s done is claim Vladek\u2019s son for his own and use him to carry out his ultimate revenge,\u201d Felipe whispered.</p><p>Blond hair. Blue eyes.</p> <p>Images of Vladek flashed through Caleb\u2019s mind. He was older, and his hair had turned grey, but his eyes were blue.</p><p>He\u2019s Russian! They all have blue eyes!</p><p>Caleb had always wondered why he\u2019d been taken. Why he\u2019d been dragged so far away from home to be a whore. Why Rafiq would save him and not the others. Why?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying...\u201d Caleb couldn\u2019t get the rest out. It was too unspeakable to even consider what Felipe was saying. Caleb\u2019s chest felt tight and his stomach churned.</p><p>\u201cHe left you there, Caleb. You were his revenge. Everyone knew it. The war came and he left you there to rot. No one crossed Rafiq after that, not once they knew what he was capable of. Even criminals love their families, their children.\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt himself burst open like a dam. Every emotion, every memory involving Rafiq sifted through his mind. There was nothing Rafiq wouldn\u2019t do to have his revenge. Nothing. Caleb fell to his knees and vomited. For the first time in years, Caleb cried. He couldn\u2019t stop. He screamed and he cried. He heaved for breath.</p><p>He rescued me. He clothed me. He fed me. He calls me brother.</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d Caleb cried. He reached for his knife and lunged toward Felipe, intent on cutting out his lying tongue.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Caleb woke. His head hurt, but it was nothing compared to the pain inside his chest. He pushed himself back onto his heels and raised a hand to his head. It came away bloody. He stared at the blood on his hand. There had been so much blood on Caleb\u2019s hands over the years.</p><p>He sobbed.</p><p>\u201cHe left you there, Caleb. You were his revenge. Everyone knew it. The war came and he left you there to rot. No one crossed Rafiq after that, not once they knew what he was capable of. Even criminals love their families, their children.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to tell himself there was absolutely no truth to what Felipe had told him, but he had to admit...it was possible. Rafiq had lied to him about how he knew Vladek. With all he and Rafiq had shared, Caleb couldn\u2019t think of a reason for Rafiq to keep such a thing from him. Unless he had a very good reason.</p><p>Vladek is my father.</p><p>Caleb shook his head. He couldn\u2019t think about that.</p><p>He looked around the room and saw it was empty; Felipe was gone. Caleb had gone toward him with his knife, intent on killing him, but his anger had made him sloppy and Felipe had struck him with the gun. The fact he didn\u2019t shoot Caleb only gave him more credibility.</p><p>Caleb wished he\u2019d pulled the trigger, but he knew why Felipe had left him alive. He wanted Caleb to find Rafiq.</p><p>No! I can\u2019t.</p><p>He hunched over, the pain was too much to bear. There was no way he could possibly survive this betrayal. His entire life had been a lie. He had not been abandoned. He had not been rescued. He\u2019d been taken from a mother who loved him and had tried to protect him by running away from Vladek. He\u2019d been kidnapped by the only real father he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>Rafiq.</p><p>Rafiq had cared for him. He\u2019d taught him how to read, how to speak five languages. Rafiq had stayed up late and spoken with Caleb because he\u2019d known about the nightmares Caleb used to have when he went to bed alone. He\u2019d taught him how to defend himself. And the entire time....</p><p>He knew what he\u2019d done to me. He listened to me recount the way Narweh used to rape me. He\u2019d held me when I cried.</p><p>Caleb screamed toward the ground.</p><p>I\u2019ll kill you! I\u2019ll kill you for what you\u2019ve done.</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d he said aloud.</p><p>He must laugh at me.</p><p>An image of Rafiq and Jair popped into his mind. Their entire relationship had been suspect until that moment. If Rafiq was concerned about Caleb learning the truth, it made sense to have someone around to watch Caleb. He wondered if Jair knew the truth and bile crept into his throat.</p><p>Kill them both.</p><p>Slowly, Caleb stood from his balled position on the floor. He looked around him and picked up his knife. As he held it in his hand, he shook with rage. Things would end tonight.</p><p>He trudged up the stairs, his bare feet slapping against the wood steps. His heart felt both fast and shallow. He had hungered for vengeance for so many years, never knowing the source of all his suffering had held his hand and pointed him toward his own father.</p><p>Vladek was not without guilt. He\u2019d known what Rafiq did to him and still had not come for him. He had sacrificed his own flesh and blood for the sake of what? Money? Power? Cowardice?</p><p>Caleb had been a pawn since he was a child. Nothing he knew could be trusted, even his memories manipulated him. There was no such thing as truth. The truth relied heavily on perception and Caleb\u2019s had been f**ked with since the beginning.</p><p>The door was open at the top of the stairs. Caleb didn\u2019t hear any sounds within the house. He suspected Felipe and Celia were long gone. He wondered if they had taken Livvie.</p><p>Livvie....</p><p>Caleb shut his eyes tight and forced her from his thoughts. He couldn\u2019t think about her. If he went upstairs and found her missing, he would lose any composure he had left. If he found her waiting for him with Felipe and Celia, he risked showing a side of himself he didn\u2019t want her to see. And if he found her hurt...or worse...he would simply turn the knife on himself and Rafiq would live. It was best he didn\u2019t know. Not yet.</p><p>Felipe\u2019s home was enormous, filled with many rooms and hiding spaces. He walked slowly, testing each door as quietly as possible. As he walked, his memories wreaked havoc on his soul.</p><p>\u201cWhy me, Rafiq? I\u2019m no one. I don\u2019t even know who Vladek is,\u201d Caleb said. He sat on the floor with his legs pulled up toward his chest. It was almost time for bed, but he didn\u2019t want to go. He didn\u2019t want to risk having another nightmare.</p><p>Lately, he\u2019d been dreaming about the night he killed Narweh. Caleb had shot him and his face was half gone, but Narweh didn\u2019t die. He sat up and jumped on top of Caleb, his open face dripping a river of blood onto Caleb\u2019s.</p><p>He could never go back to sleep after that.</p><p>Rafiq sat at his desk, writing. \u201cMen like Vladek have no reason for their callousness, Caleb. They see something, or someone, they like and they take it. A\u2019noud was beautiful.\u201d Rafiq paused and smiled. \u201cShe was sweet. She used to wrap her arms around me and refuse to let go unless I spun her around. My mother used to complain she\u2019d never find a husband because she\u2019d never want to be away from me.\u201d Rafiq\u2019s gaze was distant, as though he were reliving a fond memory.</p><p>Caleb looked toward the imaginary spot containing Rafiq\u2019s memory of his sister and he wished he had one of his own.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss her?\u201d Caleb asked in a whisper.</p><p>Rafiq\u2019s expression turned grim and he returned to his papers, \u201cMuch of the time. My hope is that once Vladek is dead, I can give my sister and mother some peace.\u201d</p><p>Caleb nodded. \u201cDo you think...? Nevermind.\u201d Caleb pulled at the rug with his fingernails, at a loss for what to say.</p><p>\u201cAsk, Caleb. There is no room for secrets between you and I. We are in this together,\u201d Rafiq said. He smiled at Caleb warmly.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t keep secrets from you. I promise. You saved my life and I owe you everything. It\u2019s just...do you think...I have a family? I mean, I must have had one...before.\u201d Caleb\u2019s face felt hot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafiq sighed, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Caleb. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Caleb shrugged and picked at the carpet some more. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re the only one who came looking for me. If I have a family, they must not care very much.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq stood from his desk and got down on one knee in front of Caleb and lifted his chin. \u201cWe are orphans, Caleb. We make our own families.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s chest swelled with emotions he didn\u2019t understand. He pressed his lips together and nodded. He felt relieved when Rafiq let him go and ruffled his hair. Caleb didn\u2019t want to cry in front of Rafiq. He wanted to make him proud.</p> <p>\u201cLet us see what sweets are in the kitchen, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>Caleb smiled brightly and jumped up from the floor, trailing behind Rafiq.</p><p>His first impulse was to throw open the door and start stabbing anything within arm\u2019s reach, but he\u2019d made enough mistakes to last him a lifetime. He was determined to get it right this time.</p><p>\u201cHold the gun steady, Caleb. It\u2019s very powerful,\u201d Rafiq said. He smiled and lifted Caleb\u2019s arms parallel to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI can do it!\u201d Caleb whined. He tried to shrug Rafiq away.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to teach you, Caleb. Listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been talking forever. I just want to shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience,\u201d Rafiq said. \u201cWiden your stance and try to pace your breathing.\u201d</p><p>Caleb scowled. He was tired of talking. He pointed the gun toward the tin can in the distance and squeezed the trigger. The force of the gun bent his elbows and the gun cracked him in the forehead and threw him toward the ground.</p><p>\u201cAhhh! Damn it!\u201d Caleb rolled on the ground while holding his head. He kicked with his feet as he tried to assuage the pain. He could hear Rafiq laughing uproariously.</p><p>\u201cI told you! You silly boy!\u201d Rafiq stomped his foot as he laughed.</p> <p>Caleb shut his eyes again and tried to breathe through the pain. He would give anything to return to the moment Felipe had offered him the truth and deny he wanted to hear it.</p><p>You knew it could come to this, Caleb. Only now, you don\u2019t have to feel guilt. It\u2019s a gift.</p><p>Caleb shook his head, but gripped the knife tighter. He couldn\u2019t lie to himself. He had known it might come to this. He had hoped to sacrifice his own life, but in the back of his mind, he knew the survivor in him would fight to the bitter end. Rafiq had to die.</p><p>He took a deep, steadying breath and knocked on the door.</p><p>The beating of his heart swayed his body by the barest of degrees, building his adrenaline and his anxiety.</p><p>Caleb heard cursing, followed by rapid steps toward the door. He braced himself and a shiver ran down his spine.</p><p>The door opened and Jair stood in the doorway naked. His swarthy chest was slick with sweat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Jair sneered.</p> <p>Caleb tried to remain calm, but all he heard in his head was: Kill.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Rafiq?\u201d Caleb said urgently.</p><p>Jair registered Caleb\u2019s demeanor, his gaze focused on the blood on Caleb\u2019s forehead. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Caleb swallowed. \u201cFelipe attacked me. I have him tied up downstairs in the shower room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes everyone hate you?\u201d Jair turned into his room with a sneer in Caleb\u2019s direction.</p><p>Caleb spoke in Arabic. \u201cHe was planning to kill Rafiq. He wanted me to help him.\u201d</p><p>Jair turned his head toward Caleb as he pulled on a pair of pants and replied in the same language. \u201cWhy would he ask for your help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought he had something to offer me. Obviously, he doesn\u2019t know how deep my loyalty runs. Where is Rafiq?\u201d Caleb asked, again. He was having a difficult time restraining himself. Nancy was tied face down on the bed. He could see her shaking and had no clue how he felt about her plight.</p><p>\u201cEveryone seems to question your loyalty, Caleb. Perhaps there is something to question,\u201d Jair put his arms through a shirt.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, swine. Where is Rafiq? I won\u2019t ask again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Caleb. You and your little whore.\u201d Jair turned to retrieve his shoes and Caleb could no longer hold himself back.</p><p>As soon as Jair\u2019s back was turned, Caleb kicked the back of his knee and threw his weight onto Jair\u2019s back. He pushed his knife between Jair\u2019s ribs and into one of his lungs.</p><p>Jair bucked wildly, shock and adrenaline making him strong as an ox. Caleb wrapped his left arm around Jair\u2019s throat and held onto the knife in Jair\u2019s side as he was flung to the left and right with incredible force. Caleb didn\u2019t dare do anything but use his strength to stay on Jair. He could hear Nancy whimpering, but she had yet to scream.</p><p>Jair crawled, staggering across the room on his hands and knees while his blood soaked his shirt and Caleb\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jair gurgled. \u201cNo!\u201d His arm reached back for Caleb, trying to drag him off.</p><p>Caleb shifted the knife in Jair\u2019s side, his body sliding against Jair\u2019s sweat and blood. He shut his eyes and listened to Jair\u2019s death rattles until he fell forward onto the floor. Caleb held on for a minute...waiting. There was nothing. He loosened his arm around Jair\u2019s throat and one last whisper of breath escaped him. Jair was dead.</p><p>Caleb shifted, straddling Jair\u2019s limp body and pulled out his knife. He could hear Nancy crying into the bed and trying to quiet her panic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here for you,\u201d Caleb whispered. Nancy wept harder. Caleb lifted the knife and looked down at Jair\u2019s lifeless body. He stabbed him twice more to be sure.</p><p>Slowly, he stood and approached Nancy. She flinched, her chest rising and falling to the rhythm of her panic.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry for what I did. Please, don\u2019t hurt me. No more. Please, God, no more.\u201d She sobbed and shook her head.</p><p>Caleb sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cAre you sure you want to live?\u201d His voice was wooden and detached. He felt so many things, but they were distant. This was not bloodlust. There was no satisfaction in what he\u2019d done, or what he was about to do. \u201cYou won\u2019t forget,\u201d he continued. \u201cEvery time you close your eyes...it will be waiting there. Every time a man touches you, you\u2019ll struggle not to cry out. Are you sure that\u2019s what you want?\u201d</p><p>Nancy wouldn\u2019t stop sobbing.</p><p>\u201cI can make it fast. No pain. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she pleaded, \u201clet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Rafiq is?\u201d he asked, his tone cold and far away.</p><p>\u201cL-l-ast time, we...\u201d Nancy sobbed, but kept going, \u201cwe stayed in this guest house out by the pool. He...he didn\u2019t want anyone to hear me SCREAMING!\u201d Nancy wailed into the mattress and pulled on the restraints holding her down.</p><p>Caleb couldn\u2019t stand to listen to her misery. He felt responsible for it. He had brought her into his world. No matter what she\u2019d done, she didn\u2019t deserve the price she\u2019d paid. He leaned over her body, wincing at the way she screamed in horror. He cut her loose.</p><p>Nancy didn\u2019t move, she simply continued to scream and cry on the bed.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d he whispered. He stood and searched Jair\u2019s things and found his knife and gun. He picked them both up and walked out of the room.</p><p>It was warm outside, even in the dead of night. Caleb walked toward the guest house with a high level of trepidation, but an even greater sense of determination.</p><p>Part of him wanted to simply go inside and kill Rafiq as he slept. It would be over quickly. Caleb would never have to confront Rafiq\u2019s betrayal. He would never have to face the man he had thought of as a father, brother, and friend, and ask him what had been real between them and what had been a ploy. He would never have to see Rafiq\u2019s eyes lose the spark that meant he was alive.</p><p>Still, Caleb knew he had come too far not to learn the full truth. He needed to know for certain. He needed to hear it from Rafiq\u2019s lips and see it in his eyes. A part of Caleb ached to learn it had all been a lie from Felipe.</p><p>He was shocked to see Rafiq swimming in the pool when he approached, gun raised. His heart hammered wildly in his chest and he felt a little dizzy.</p><p>I can\u2019t.</p><p>I can.</p><p>I can.</p><p>I can.</p><p>Rafiq emerged from the water and wiped his face. It took him a moment to see Caleb standing near the edge of the water. He smiled for a fraction of a second until he registered the gun in Caleb\u2019s hand.</p><p>Rafiq glared and shook his head. \u201cI wish I could say I\u2019m surprised, Khoya.\u201d</p><p>Caleb shut his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, he returned Rafiq\u2019s anger. \u201cI am not your brother, Rafiq. I doubt you ever saw me as such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d he said. His tone was casual and unafraid.</p><p>Caleb wiped at his forehead. \u201cI had a talk with Felipe. It didn\u2019t end well.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq smiled. \u201cIs that all? I don\u2019t care if you\u2019ve killed him, Caleb. Put the gun away,\u201d he ordered. He was always giving orders. He\u2019d always believed he had the right, especially when it came to Caleb.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him. I killed Jair,\u201d Caleb said through a smile.</p><p>Anger swiftly came over Rafiq\u2019s features. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re here to kill me?! You ungrateful little whore. I should have let you die in Tehran!\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt heat race down his spine and he straightened. \u201cGet out of the water, Rafiq. Slowly, or I\u2019ll shoot you where you stand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo it! I don\u2019t fear you, Caleb.\u201d Despite his words, Rafiq stepped back toward the steps of the pool. Caleb followed him around the edge until Rafiq stood out of the water.</p><p>Without hesitation, Caleb shot Rafiq in his right knee. Rafiq yelled out into the night, his wet body thudding against the concrete.</p><p>Rafiq\u2019s hands shook as he held his knee, fragments of bone lay around him along with copious amounts of blood. \u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d he screamed.</p><p>Adrenaline coursed through Caleb\u2019s veins. \u201cHow do you know Vladek?!\u201d Caleb yelled over Rafiq\u2019s curses and wails.</p> <p>\u201cFuck you! Give me a towel before I f**king bleed to death!\u201d</p><p>Caleb reached for Rafiq\u2019s towel on one of the lounge chairs and threw it in Rafiq\u2019s direction. Rafiq shivered as he applied pressure to his destroyed knee. He was fighting shock.</p><p>Caleb felt sick to his stomach. When he was able to keep his nausea at bay and speak, his voice was broken. \u201cDid you make me a whore, Rafiq? Did you take me from my mother?\u201d It hurt to say the words. It hurt to look upon Rafiq and instantly know the answer.</p><p>It was in the way the anger disappeared on Rafiq\u2019s face. There was a glimpse of shame, but only that \u2013 a glimpse. When it passed, Rafiq was once again filled with a self-righteous rage. \u201cHow dare you! How dare you ask me such a stupid question, Caleb! After all we\u2019ve been through and all I\u2019ve done for you. This,\u201d he motioned to his bloody leg, \u201cis how you repay me? You make me sick.\u201d He spat on the ground.</p><p>Caleb broke.</p> <p>He fell to his knees on the concrete and hung his head. His sobs shook his chest and robbed him of breath. His mind raced with images of his torment. He relived the rapes and beatings. He felt the loss of his friend upon learning he\u2019d been burned alive. But the worst...were the memories of Rafiq and the life they had lived together \u2013 good and bad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late, Khoya,\u201d Rafiq said softly. His voice trembled. \u201cHelp me inside.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq\u2019s words brought the world back into focus for Caleb. He stared into his lap, saw the gun lying limply in his hand, and made a decision. He went into the guest house and found what he needed before coming back outside to Rafiq.</p><p>Rafiq wasn\u2019t doing very well. He shook badly and the color was drained from his face. \u201cWhat are you doing, Caleb?\u201d he asked. For the first time, there was fear in his eyes.</p><p>Caleb ignored the question. He stretched the length of cord he\u2019d brought out and gestured toward Rafiq\u2019s hands. \u201cGive them to me.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq shook his head. \u201cNo. You\u2019re not yourself, Caleb. Don\u2019t do this!\u201d</p> <p>Caleb held the cord taut in his hands and reached around Rafiq\u2019s head. He pulled back with both hands, dragging Rafiq into the house by his neck. A trail of blood followed them.</p><p>Rafiq didn\u2019t thrash around the way Jair had. He was too well trained as a soldier to make such a mistake. He placed his hands around the cord, taking tension off of his throat.</p><p>Once inside, Rafiq reached back for Caleb\u2019s arms, bracing the weight of his body and rolled toward Caleb. It was enough to throw Caleb off balance. Rafiq dragged himself on top of Caleb and punched him in the same spot Felipe had struck with the gun.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s head snapped back and his vision blurred. He felt Rafiq\u2019s hands wrap around his throat, his thumbs pressing along his windpipe. Caleb lifted his leg and kicked at Rafiq\u2019s injured knee. It was enough to regain the advantage. As Rafiq instinctively recoiled and went for his knee, Caleb rolled on top of him. He kept punching Rafiq in the face until he went unconscious.</p><p>When Rafiq opened his eyes, Caleb could see he was instantly afraid. Caleb had tied him down on one of the lounge chairs that had been by the pool.</p><p>Caleb felt dead inside, but his thirst for vengeance had not abated. He had waited his entire life for this moment and it could not be denied.</p><p>He sat on the ground next to Rafiq. His knife sat delicately on his knee and still gory with Jair\u2019s blood. \u201cYou\u2019re going to die tonight, brother. I want you to know that,\u201d Caleb whispered. \u201cI can kill quickly if you tell me the truth,\u201d he paused, \u201cor I can use my knife and practice all the things you\u2019ve taught me about torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb...\u201d Rafiq\u2019s voice shook.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my name, Rafiq. I don\u2019t remember my name. It was taken from me,\u201d Caleb said dully. \u201cDo you know why?\u201d Caleb looked up at Rafiq, his expression hard.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do this, Caleb,\u201d Rafiq said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Caleb replied and shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d He picked up the knife and poked at Rafiq\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cSTOP!\u201d Rafiq yelled. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>Caleb returned the knife to his knee. \u201cI never wanted to hurt you, Rafiq. Never! But you have to suffer for what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq\u2019s body shook violently. Sweat covered his body. \u201cAnd what is it you think I\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask the questions. I\u2019ll start with the most important one: Did you give me to Narweh?\u201d</p><p>Rafiq stared at him for a long time.</p><p>Caleb felt a tear race down his cheek and he wiped it away quickly with the back of his hand. He didn\u2019t know he was crying. It had been so long since he\u2019d cried and he suddenly seemed unable to stop. He cleared his throat, \u201cYour silence betrays you, Rafiq. I had hoped you would deny it. I almost killed Felipe for even suggesting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true, Caleb. Felipe is a liar,\u201d Rafiq whispered.</p><p>Caleb shut his eyes and wiped at his face again. He unexpectedly laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re late. And unconvincing. But thank you, for trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI raised you,\u201d Rafiq implored.</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Caleb nodded. \u201cI think that\u2019s what makes your betrayal so much worse. I worshipped you as a boy. You were my savior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI treated you well, Caleb. I gave you everything your heart desired.\u201d There was sincerity in Rafiq\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI always wondered why you came for me. At first, I thought you took pity because of what Narweh had done. I thought you rescued me because you were too late to save your sister. Felipe tells me you killed her...and your mother. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>Rafiq turned his face away. \u201cYou don\u2019t know about the things you\u2019re saying,\u201d he grated.</p><p>\u201cExplain it to me, then. You\u2019re about to die. Unburden your soul,\u201d Caleb said numbly.</p><p>Rafiq took a deep breath and released it slowly. \u201cAnd my wife and children? What\u2019s to become of them?\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt nothing. \u201cWill your sons come after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re too young for that, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about their age the first time I killed. Even younger when....\u201d He couldn\u2019t continue.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not like us. Swear to me you\u2019ll leave them alone and I\u2019ll tell you what you want to know.\u201d Rafiq turned his head and looked at Caleb.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI swear it.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq also nodded. Tears swam in his eyes. \u201cThank you, Caleb.\u201d Rafiq turned his gaze toward the ceiling. \u201cI know you won\u2019t believe me, but I have always regretted what happened to you. I was in pain and I.... I tried to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt a rush of hot tears, but managed to scoff. \u201cAs if anything could make up for what was done to me! You know! You know what they put me through, the pretty American boy who everyone called Dog.\u201d Caleb picked up the knife and stabbed it into Rafiq\u2019s thigh and twisted the blade.</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d Rafiq shouted. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Please! That\u2019s how I begged, too. I said it so much, Narweh used to taunt me with the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you vengeance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVengeance will never undo what was done! Your betrayal is worse than anything Narweh ever did. He never betrayed me. He raped my body, but you.... You, I loved.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq was delirious with pain and blood loss. \u201cKhoya,\u201d he croaked, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late, Rafiq. Much, much, too late.\u201d</p><p>Rafiq shook his head, \u201cVladek is a monster. He ruined my beloved A\u2019noud. He turned her against me. My father had died and my sister was carrying Vladek\u2019s bastard! I was sick with grief. We fought and my mother got in the middle. I never meant to hurt them. They were my life! Vladek took them from me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed them! You are responsible!\u201d Caleb pulled the knife from Rafiq\u2019s thigh and listened to him weep. Caleb had never seen Rafiq cry and it did things to him he did not expect. He wanted to feel nothing but hatred, but he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Caleb had done things too. He had killed and tortured. He had sold women into the very life he condemned Rafiq for thrusting him into. Caleb was no better than Rafiq. He deserved no better. Caleb had told Livvie he was sorry for what he\u2019d done. He had meant it, but his apology could no more erase his actions, than Rafiq could erase the past.</p><p>If Livvie could show forgiveness, Caleb could try.</p><p>Caleb got up on his knees and put his hands on Rafiq\u2019s face and turned his head toward him. Rafiq met his gaze and Caleb saw sorrow and perhaps, remorse. Caleb leaned down and kissed Rafiq on both cheeks before he looked at him steadily in the eyes. \u201cI forgive you,\u201d he whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafiq smiled weakly and shut his eyes.</p><p>Caleb slowly reached back for his gun and shot Rafiq in the heart.</p><p>Afterward, he washed Rafiq\u2019s body.

He wept as he wrapped the body tightly.</p><p>With great difficulty, he carried him out toward one of Felipe\u2019s gardens and buried the only family he had ever known.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Day 11: 5am</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Caleb whispers. His blond brows are creased in concern. I\u2019ve never seen him look like this. He\u2019s so happy, at ease.</p><p>I reach up and caress his beautiful face. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He swipes at my eyes, \u201cThen why are you crying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say and continue to run my hand across his face. \u201cI think I\u2019m just happy.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, \u201cStrange response to happiness, but okay.\u201d He leans down and I feel him lick one of my tears.</p><p>I squirm, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cI was curious,\u201d he whispers very seriously.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf happy tears taste the same as the sad ones,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His words make me cry even harder. I can\u2019t control them. I\u2019m just so overwhelmed with everything. \u201cAnd?\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re sweeter,\u201d he says and kisses me, \u201cbut it could just be your face.\u201d We dissolve into peals of laughter.</p><p>I hear voices.</p><p>I bolt up in bed. For a few seconds I have no idea where I am. The room is small. There are grates on the windows. The bed isn\u2019t Caleb\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t come back in three hours. I need to speak with her now,\u201d a man says. The voice is familiar, but I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m having trouble placing it.</p><p>It\u2019s Reed. Caleb\u2019s not here, remember?</p><p>I feel tears rolling down my cheeks and clogging my throat. I\u2019m awake now. I remember where I am. I\u2019m in the hospital. Caleb is gone. I\u2019m alone in the dark again.</p><p>Only a few seconds ago, I held Caleb in my arms. I touched him. I smelled him. I tasted his flesh in my mouth. And now, he was gone. I\u2019d forgotten.</p> <p>The pain of remembering knocks the wind out of me and I take a deep breath. When I exhale, the sound coming out of me is pure grief. He was just here. He was just in my arms and I lost him.</p><p>\u201cHelp me! Please!\u201d I beg. I\u2019m not sure whom I\u2019m begging. Maybe it\u2019s God. Maybe it\u2019s the devil. I just want the pain to go away.</p><p>The door to my room bursts open.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?!?\u201d Reed yells.</p><p>I don\u2019t acknowledge him. I\u2019m on my knees with my head pressed into the bed and I\u2019m sobbing. I shut my eyes tightly, willing myself to go back to sleep. I want to go back to my dream, back to Caleb. I can\u2019t f**king breathe! I can\u2019t breathe without him. I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Reed says urgently, \u201cAre you hurt? Talk to me!\u201d</p><p>Go away, go away, go away.</p><p>\u201cThis is a hospital, Agent Reed! Please, put away the gun!\u201d a woman says.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Caleb. I love you! If you care for me at all...please, don\u2019t do this! Please, don\u2019t leave me. I don\u2019t know how to live without you. Don\u2019t make me go back to trying to be someone I don\u2019t know how to be anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivvie....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>I scream in my sorrow. I can\u2019t help it. I would if I could. I know they\u2019re watching me. I can feel their hot stares against my back. They don\u2019t get it. No one does. I\u2019m all alone and it\u2019s Caleb\u2019s fault.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I beg. \u201cPlease make it stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Ruiz?\u201d Reed says cautiously, \u201cLivvie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep back, Agent Reed. She\u2019s having some sort of break right now and she could hurt you if you get too close. Wait for the orderlies,\u201d says the woman.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to hurt anyone. I\u2019ll take my chances,\u201d Reed says.</p><p>\u201cSir \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a witness in a federal investigation and I need to talk to her right the f**k now. I don\u2019t want her doped up. Get out!\u201d Reed yells and his presence is beginning to penetrate the fog of my grief.</p><p>I keep telling myself to breathe. I keep reminding myself I\u2019ve been here for days. Caleb has been gone for days. He wasn\u2019t here. I never touched him. I never held him.</p><p>\u201cLive for me, Kitten. Be all those things you\u2019d never be with me. Go to school. Meet a normal boy and fall in love. Forget me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d I yell into the void.</p><p>Breathe!</p><p>Breathe!</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>I hear the door open and shut. I wonder if I\u2019m alone, but I can\u2019t will myself to look up. A tentative hand touches my back and I sob.</p><p>\u201cLivvie?\u201d says Reed.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I sob.</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t leave you like this,\u201d he says. He sounds uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Please, go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fine. You\u2019re a wreck,\u201d he says angrily.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I whisper. Talking to Reed is pulling me further away from my dream, my grief. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m too raw and I can\u2019t face him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been movement on my case. It\u2019s all happening fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean, Reed?\u201d I say, exhausted.</p><p>He sighs heavily, as if he\u2019s struggling under a tremendous weight. It makes me curious, despite myself. \u201cI came...to hear the rest of your story.\u201d</p><p>My heart starts to race. Movement on the case, he\u2019d said. I know Reed is lying, but about what?</p><p>Caleb!</p><p>I sit up fast, dizzy for a moment and Reed steadies me. I grab his suit jacket and pull him close. I\u2019m frantic. Reed\u2019s hands grab my shoulders and he pushes me. Hard. As I\u2019m falling backward he reaches for my forearm and quickly jerks me onto the bed. I rail against him, slapping and kicking, but before I know it, he\u2019s pinned my arms to my chest and sat on my legs.</p><p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down!\u201d</p><p>I look at Reed for the first time since he\u2019s come in. He\u2019s panting hard and his dark hair is a disheveled mess that mirrors the state of his shirt and jacket.</p><p>\u201cDid you find his body?\u201d I whisper. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if he says yes.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. No!\u201d Reed says. His expression has gone from anger to pity.</p><p>The news is a relief, but I can\u2019t stop crying. Reed slowly lets me go and I roll onto my side with my back to him. Reed rubs my back, but then seems to realize what he is doing and he walks away. I hear him sit in the chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks after a few minutes.</p><p>My sobbing has died away and I answer, \u201cBad dream. Well, not really. The only bad part was waking up and realizing....\u201d I couldn\u2019t continue.</p><p>Reed is quiet for a while. I\u2019m quiet too. It\u2019s the middle of the night and his presence is a dark omen. Something has happened and as much as I want to know \u2013 I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>Finally, Reed clears his throat, \u201cIf it be thus to dream, still let me sleep,\u201d he whispers. I\u2019m not surprised he knows Shakespeare. Reed is a very smart man.</p><p>I smile in spite of the sorrow I feel, \u201cTwelfth Night, Sebastian says those words to Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I attended the eleventh grade,\u201d he says. His smile is wry.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that like a million years ago? I\u2019m surprised you remember it,\u201d I whisper. My face feels crusty with dried tears and I\u2019m sure my face is a mess, but I\u2019m finally starting to feel a little better. My thoughts and memories of the last several days are organizing themselves in my head and clarity is returning. I\u2019ve heard it said, time heals all wounds, but if a dream can pull you so deeply into your past you can\u2019t remember the present, I\u2019m not sure my wounds will ever heal. Caleb lives in my dreams.</p><p>\u201cI remember it just barely, Miss Ruiz,\u201d says Reed.</p><p>I roll onto my back and stare at the ceiling. My flickering bulb has long been replaced, but I can still hear the hum and follow along: on-off-on-off-buzz-on. \u201cWhy are you here, Reed?\u201d I whisper. I stay focused on the ceiling, focused on my breathing, and try to prepare for what I\u2019m about to hear.</p><p>\u201cI told you, to hear the rest of your story,\u201d he says rather seriously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the only reason though, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It isn\u2019t.\u201d He clears his throat again, \u201cDoes the name, James Cole, mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m confused. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt came up and I needed to know; that\u2019s all,\u201d Reed says. \u201cNever mind. I guess it\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t ask if it weren\u2019t important, Reed.\u201d He\u2019s piqued my interest and I struggle into a sitting position so I can see his face and gage him better. He looks like he hasn\u2019t slept in days.</p><p>Reed leans forward with his arms rested on his knees. \u201cI came to tell you the charges against you are being dropped.\u201d He says it in a rush, flat but full of something else. \u201cOnce you\u2019re cleared by your doctor, I\u2019ve been instructed to debrief you. Sign some paperwork and you should be able to leave today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!?!\u201d I exclaim, my mind reeling. The news is a shock to my system. I\u2019m not ready to go. I\u2019m not ready to start over. I\u2019m not ready to accept Caleb is gone and I have to face the world alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe know where the auction is being held and we know some of the persons attending,\u201d he says. \u201cI wish I could tell you more, but I\u2019ve been instructed to keep it in house. All I can say, is that it\u2019s over, Livvie. You\u2019re free. And you\u2019re safe. You get to have your life back, and so do the other victims.\u201d</p><p>My heartbeat feels erratic. I can\u2019t let Reed leave without knowing everything. I need him to understand. My information, my testimony, was my only bargaining chip. Without his need for it, I\u2019m at a loss. \u201cH-how do you know where the auction is?\u201d I ask frantically.</p><p>Reed looks at me, \u201cWhy do you say it like that?\u201d he demanded, eyes narrowing, \u201cWhat is it you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Reed. You have to tell me what you know. I\u2019ve been spilling my guts to you for over a damn week. Please don\u2019t keep me in the dark. I deserve to know!\u201d I\u2019m begging him, but I don\u2019t feel ashamed.</p> <p>\u201cThis case is more complicated than anyone could have expected, Miss Ruiz. It\u2019s out of my hands at this point. The Federal Investigation Agency in Pakistan has agreed to lead a joint task force.\u201d Reeds face becomes sour, \u201cOh, but I\u2019ve been assured my involvement will be mentioned in the report!\u201d Reed stands up and starts to pace. His anger and frustration is plain, but I don\u2019t understand where it\u2019s coming from.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean, Reed? What happens once they arrest everyone?\u201d I want to get off the bed and follow Reed as he paces the small room, but I know it will only annoy him and he might not tell me anything.</p><p>\u201cIt depends,\u201d he says through gritted teeth. He stands still for a moment, thinking something over. When he returns from his thoughts he looks at me and I see regret in his eyes. My heart almost stops.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be a trial,\u201d Reed says. He starts pacing again, a fist at the nape of his neck. \u201cI knew it could go down this way. I didn\u2019t want to believe it, but I knew. I\u2019ve been arguing with my boss for the last few hours. There\u2019s just....\u201d Reed seems at a loss. \u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of arrests, I\u2019m sure. The people meant to be auctioned will undoubtedly be given sanctuary, but...there won\u2019t be any justice. Not the kind those victims deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can that be?\u201d I sob. \u201cHow can you let that happen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRafiq is a high level military officer in the Pakistan Army, Livvie. His government isn\u2019t going to allow a scandal to get out. They\u2019ve agreed to let our government be a part of the raid in exchange for keeping their people out of it. When the dust settles, they\u2019re the ones to decide who was there and who wasn\u2019t, that\u2019s how international politics work.\u201d</p><p>I feel like someone has hit me in the chest with a battering ram. For the second time in my life, I understand Caleb\u2019s thirst for vengeance. I could kill. I\u2019ve done it before and I don\u2019t feel bad about it. Some people deserve to die.</p><p>Tears are running from my eyes without ceasing, I\u2019m soaked through with them. I\u2019m not sad, though. I\u2019m filled with rage and I have no way to let it out. There\u2019s no one to kill, nothing to hit, and nowhere to go.</p><p>\u201cReed,\u201d I sob, \u201cI have to tell you something. Please, please try to understand. I need your help.\u201d My hands are clasped together and I\u2019m holding them so tightly to my chest I can feel my thumb leaving a bruise.</p><p>Reed scrubs his hands over his face, \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me something incriminating, Miss Ruiz. There\u2019s nothing I can do right now and if I have to put you back under arrest, it\u2019s going to seriously put a shitty end to an already shitty day. All I have is my integrity. Don\u2019t make me choose between it and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Reed! I have to tell you the rest of my story,\u201d I plead. It\u2019s the most important part, the part I\u2019ve been saving until I knew I could trust Reed. I just hope I\u2019m not too late.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard all I need to know. My job was to investigate the border incident. You\u2019ve been cleared of charges. My job was to locate the auction \u2013 done. I did my job. I came here to tell you you\u2019re free to go and I was willing to listen to the rest of your story if it would give you closure, but if you\u2019re just going to incriminate yourself, I don\u2019t want to hear it. If I hear it, I\u2019ll act on it. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Reed is angry, but I don\u2019t care. Caleb is too important. He\u2019s sacrificed so much for me, even to the point of protecting me from myself. I would have followed him anywhere, done anything he asked of me, but he\u2019d cared enough not to let me. For all I knew, he would be at the auction, trying to kill Vladek and getting himself killed in the process. It was my turn to save him.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I beg, \u201cyou have to help him. If you arrest him, I know he\u2019ll live. There\u2019s no telling what will happen to him if he\u2019s in Pakistan. You said it yourself, Rafiq has a lot of power over there. Please! Please, Reed! Help him.\u201d</p><p>Reed stands deadly still, but his chest rises and falls harshly with each breath. \u201cAre you telling me Caleb is alive?\u201d Reed hisses.</p><p>My heart is racing. \u201cNo. Not yet. But if he were? Could you help him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Livvie!\u201d Reed kicks the chair, \u201cYou lied to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe! Maybe, I did,\u201d I plead. I don\u2019t know if wording things hypothetically changes anything, but I have to try. I have to know if Reed can help me. I have to know if he will. \u201cI needed time and you weren\u2019t giving me any,\u201d I sob, \u201cYou came in here, asking me all kinds of questions and calling me a f**king terrorist. What was I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to tell me the truth! That was the deal. You tell me the truth and I help you,\u201d Reed says and resumes pacing.</p> <p>\u201cI did tell you the truth! I told you everything you needed to know. I helped you find the auction, but here you are \u2013 telling me there\u2019s no justice! So who\u2019s the liar, Reed?\u201d I cry.</p><p>Reed turns and glares at me. He looks a lot of things: angry, exhausted, and sad. Finally, he looks away and collapses into the chair.</p><p>\u201cReed?\u201d I hedge closer.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do, Livvie. The team is already on its way and the FIA is calling the shots,\u201d he says.</p><p>His words play in a loop in my head until they\u2019re reduced to their true meaning: I\u2019ll never see Caleb again. I feel dead inside. Empty. Hollow. Vivisected.</p><p>\u201cThere...has to be something,\u201d I croak.</p><p>Reed shakes his head.</p><p>In my head, I can hear myself screaming. I can see myself clawing at my skin and tearing at my hair. In reality, I\u2019m motionless, no tears, no screams, no flesh being torn from my bones.</p><p>Reed is silent. He can\u2019t help me. No one can.</p><p>My thoughts turn to Caleb and the last days we spent together.</p><p>Caleb had been gone for hours. I sat on the floor, next to his gun, waiting for something to happen, anything to happen. Several times, I thought about leaving the room and searching for him, but kept talking myself out of it. Caleb had said to wait. I waited.</p><p>A feeling of dread began to settle over me when I saw light peeking in around the curtains. The sun was coming up and Caleb still hadn\u2019t returned. I wondered if Celia might come back, but I doubted it. Our bridge was well and truly burned. My only solace was in knowing she would keep Felipe from hurting me.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a hard thump on the door, then another. My heart felt like it had leapt up into my throat, but then I remembered Caleb had said he would knock twice. I reached for the gun, just in case.</p><p>I watched as the handle turned and when the door swung open I could barely process what I saw. Caleb stood in the doorway. He was covered in dirt. He was smeared with blood.</p><p>\u201cCaleb?\u201d I managed to whisper, but still couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t move from the doorway. He just stood there, his eyes fixed on some distant point. He looked like he\u2019d been crying. His blue eyes were ringed with red and swollen. He had a cut on his forehead and blood dripped onto his eye. He didn\u2019t blink.</p><p>Instantly, I was in tears. Something terrible had happened. Something awful! Slowly, I stood up. I grabbed the shirt Caleb had left and pulled it on over my head. We had to go and it was going to be up to me to get us out. I scrambled for a pair of pants and found a pair of Caleb\u2019s boxers instead.</p><p>Caleb never moved.</p><p>\u201cCaleb?\u201d I whispered and came a little closer. His mouth turned down briefly, like he\u2019d been about to cry, but then his face returned to a catatonic state. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me, Caleb. Please, say something,\u201d I sobbed.</p><p>Tears fell from his open eyes.</p><p>It was more than I could bear to see him in so much pain and not know why. I rushed forward and wrapped my arms around him. \u201cPlease, Caleb! Wake the f**k up!\u201d</p><p>His weight collapsed on top of me and we fell. As I lay flat on my back, Caleb pulled me close and released an agonized wail into my chest. The sound terrified me and I wrapped my arms around him, holding him as tight as he held me. It was all I could do. His entire body trembled and shook with the force of his gut wrenching sobs. I felt like a knife was buried in my intestines and someone kept turning the blade. The only thing I could do to keep from screaming was hold him.</p><p>My hand shook as I stroked his hair, \u201cShh, Caleb. Shh. It\u2019s okay. Whatever it is, it\u2019s okay.\u201d I sobbed when he pulled me tighter and tried to bury himself deeper into my chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hair was stiff and brittle \u2013 gritty with sand.</p><p>He\u2019s been digging. He\u2019s covered in blood.</p><p>\u201cShh, baby,\u201d I whispered and kept stroking Caleb\u2019s hair. He was barely allowing me to breathe, he gripped me so tightly. \u201cWhose blood is this?\u201d</p><p>I felt him shaking his head, fast, angry. He accidentally nudged my chin and I winced. \u201cOkay. It\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p> <p>I was at a loss for how to reach him. The man in my arms wasn\u2019t Caleb, he was a shell of a human being. Primal and stripped bare. I had my suspicions about whose blood Caleb wore, but I didn\u2019t dare say it out loud.</p><p>He killed his only friend. For me.</p><p>My chest shook with the force of the sobs I kept trapped in my chest. Caleb needed me and I couldn\u2019t help him by falling apart. \u201cWe have to go, Caleb,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for us here.\u201d</p><p>Caleb moved fast. He lifted himself off my chest and caged me in with his body. He looked predatory and I knew instinctively, not to scream. His eyes raked over me, moving quickly from my eyes, to my mouth, to my neck, all the way down to my feet. I wasn\u2019t sure he even knew who I was.</p><p>My fingers hurt after being ripped away from his hair so abruptly. There were several strands intertwined with my fingers. Without moving, I let my eyes cut to my hand. Caleb followed my eyes and when I slowly lifted my hand, he watched it intently. I put my fingers to the wound on his head, wiping away the blood. He needed stitches. Caleb closed his eyes and let me touch him.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to go. Please...let\u2019s go,\u201d I repeated. Caleb\u2019s eyes flew open and narrowed on my face. For several seconds all he did was stare.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d I said.</p><p>Caleb brought his mouth down on mine with such ferocity I almost pushed him away. The timing was terrible. Our lives were in danger. But Caleb needed me. He needed to be close and I owed it to him to give him what he needed.</p><p>I put my fear aside and opened my mouth to him, letting his tongue invade my mouth. He groaned when I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him down on top of me. I pulled at the filth covered shirt he wore and broke our kiss just long enough to pull it over his head. Sand and, I was sure, blood, fell onto my face, but I brushed in away with the back of my hand and went back to kissing Caleb.</p><p>His hands seemed to be everywhere at once, touching my hair, pulling me close, squeezing my br**sts. His knee planted itself between my knees, prying them apart. I opened my legs and let Caleb\u2019s lower belly press against me. I could feel his cock, trapped inside his jeans, against my inner thigh.</p> <p>As we pawed at one another, some of Caleb\u2019s primal behavior seeped its way into me and before I knew it, I was pushing him off of me and to the side. He grabbed hold of my shirt and made a sound I took as a warning.</p><p>\u201cYours, Caleb. I promise,\u201d I said. I grabbed the hem of my shirt and pulled it over my head, exposing my br**sts to Caleb. His mouth latched on, forcing me to cry out and hold him to my breast. I straddled his hips, grinding against him through the fabric of our clothes.</p><p>For all of Caleb\u2019s animalistic intensity, he wasn\u2019t hurting me. He might have, if I\u2019d given him a reason, but I was as open to him, as water to a pebble. When his mouth pulled away from one nipple, I fed him the other.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said and stroked his hair. He whimpered.</p><p>Caleb would never regret the sacrifices he had made for me. I would make sure of it. For the rest of my life, I would dedicate myself to giving Caleb every ounce of love I had in me to share. I was his and he was mine and it was everything.</p><p>I pushed at Caleb\u2019s shoulder, urging him back toward the floor. I followed him down, resting my weight on him. His hands found the waistband of the shorts I wore and shoved. I reached back and together, we pushed the fabric down and off my legs.</p><p>I hated the feel of Caleb\u2019s dirty jeans against my bare skin. \u201cTake these off,\u201d I said. I helped him push his pants down to his ankles. His feet were bare and caked in dirt, but I was more preoccupied with getting as close to Caleb as I possibly could.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s c**k sprang up between us like a living thing. We reached for it at the same time, his hand over mine and guided it between my legs. I was sore, but wet, and Caleb\u2019s c**k slid into me with minimal effort. Caleb gripped my hips, pulling me down as he thrust.</p> <p>\u201cOh, god,\u201d I cried out. My fingernails dug into his chest, scoring his skin, but Caleb only groaned and thrust into me again. And again. And again.</p><p>I fell forward, my hands bracing me above Caleb\u2019s head. I was adrift in a sea of pleasure and all-consuming lust. Arching my back, I teased Caleb\u2019s mouth with my nipple and he pulled it into his hungry mouth. I felt my pu**y getting tighter around his cock. I whimpered as my orgasm approached and Caleb f**ked me harder, sucked me deeper into his mouth. I didn\u2019t have the breath to make a sound. I froze on top of him, letting him keep f**king me as I came.</p><p>His mouth pulled away from my breast with a loud pop and then Caleb\u2019s sounds filled the room as his come filled my pu**y. Pulse after pulse of hot come flooded my insides and I couldn\u2019t get enough. I wanted Caleb inside me forever. I collapsed on top of him, loving the way my body rose and fell with each of his breaths.</p><p>\u201cLivvie?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I forced myself up on my elbow and stroked his face with my other hand. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. My tears made him blurry, but I could tell he was back now, from wherever he had been.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Did I hurt you?!\u201d He sounded frantic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Caleb. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m more worried about you,\u201d I said. I bent down and kissed his lips. When I pulled back, my heart ached to see him turn his face away from me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me, Livvie,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, no.\u201d I tried to make him look at me, but all at once he sat up and put my head on his shoulder where I couldn\u2019t see him. I could feel him sliding out of me, his come aiding in the effort.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t deal with it, okay? I \u2013\u201d his words sounded stuck in his throat.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered and held him in my arms for just a few more seconds.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Slowly, we reclaimed our bodies from one another. Tears stung the backs of my eyes, but I wouldn\u2019t let them free. Caleb needed me strong and I was determined to give him everything he needed.</p><p>Silently, we went about prioritizing. Caleb pulled up his pants with a grimace and started barricading the door. I made myself useful by finding a bag and tossing in anything I thought we might need: the gun, clothes, a first-aid kit I found in the bathroom. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was something.</p><p>Caleb walked into the bathroom and turned the shower on. I didn\u2019t think we had time for it, but I knew better than to ask questions. With shaking hands, he removed his pants and stepped beneath the water. Blood and dirt quickly coated everything.</p><p>I thought about stepping in, but one look at Caleb and I knew he needed time alone. The water was steaming hot, clouding the bathroom. I turned on the fan, but remained an otherwise unobtrusive presence. At one point, I heard him sob, but I remained on the floor, keeping silent vigil.</p><p>He\u2019d been in the shower less than ten minutes before he turned the temperature down and stepped out. He silently grabbed a towel and walked out into the bedroom. My shower didn\u2019t last nearly as long, but by the time I stepped into the room, Caleb was more like himself.</p><p>\u201cTime to go, Livvie,\u201d he said and gave me a smile. It was feigned, but I appreciated the effort. I tried to make my smile more convincing.</p><p>The house felt empty, eerily empty. No Felipe. No Celia. No Rafiq. Caleb offered no answers and I asked no questions.</p><p>It was hot outside, even early in the morning. I realized it had been a long time since I\u2019d walked outside, beneath a glaring sun. I was wearing clothes. I was...free. My steps faltered as the realization hit me. FREE!</p><p>\u201cThe truck isn\u2019t far, keep moving,\u201d Caleb said numbly.</p><p>I could feel myself getting choked up, excited laughter bubbled out of me, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I said with joyful tears in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask. Just come with me.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, the pain on his face palpable. This was not the time to argue with him. Whatever he was doing, it was a very big deal. It would change everything between us, but he\u2019d asked me to come with him, and when the man you love asks you to go with him \u2013 you go.</p><p>We walked for less than a mile, but I marveled at the sheer size of Felipe\u2019s estate. Whatever he was into, it was certainly profitable. Finally, we found the old truck we had arrived in. I was surprised it started right up.</p><p>Caleb hadn\u2019t said much and though he seemed in much better control of himself, I knew whatever had happened still weighed heavily on him. I reached for his hand across the seat and to my surprise, he not only held my hand, but squeezed it. As we left Felipe\u2019s house, I stared at the gravel road in the side view mirror. It was really happening. We were leaving \u2013 together. I wiped tears from my eyes for nearly twenty minutes.</p><p>We traveled for several hours before I forced Caleb to break his silence. \u201cI\u2019m hungry, Caleb.\u201d I looked at him and rubbed my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWe can get some food and water when we stop for gas. I want to keep moving for now,\u201d he said. His eyes never left the road, but his thumb moved back and forth over my hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cWill we...be driving long? You know, before we get wherever we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>Caleb squeezed my hand and closed his eyes for a second, \u201cWe\u2019ll be on the road for about sixteen hours, maybe less. We can stop for the night once we\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like his tone. It was too...sad and distant. \u201cWhere are we \u2013?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitten!\u201d he admonished. He shook his head, \u201cI mean...Livvie. Please. Stop.\u201d</p> <p>Anxiety churned in my stomach. I didn\u2019t like this at all. I squeezed his hand, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to call me Livvie if you don\u2019t want to, Caleb. To be honest, it\u2019s kinda scaring me. You\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s face seemed to crack for a second and I caught a glimpse of his sadness before he relaxed his features. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, Kitten. Everything\u2019s going to be fine, I promise. You won\u2019t ever have to be scared of me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Caleb?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt means I\u2019ll take care of you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of each other. I\u2019m stronger now, Caleb. Whatever happens...whatever happened, we can handle it together. Okay?\u201d</p> <p>He was quiet for a long time before he replied. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>We didn\u2019t make any unnecessary stops. We went to the bathroom and picked up food whenever we needed gas. Getting Caleb to talk was a bit of a chore, but he seemed very interested in my life before we met. I avoided talking about my family \u2013 my brothers and sisters, my mom. I knew I\u2019d never see any of them again and thinking about it hurt too much to talk about. I had Caleb now and he needed me.</p><p>I talked about my favorite books and movies. I mentioned my dream of writing a book I would later adapt into a screenplay and direct myself. I was going to be a triple threat. Caleb smiled and said he\u2019d love to read anything I wrote. I suddenly felt a lot more optimistic about mine and Caleb\u2019s future, but I kept seeing signs for Laredo, Texas.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in Texas?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cBesides cowboys?\u201d Caleb said. I glared at him. \u201cI have business there, Kitten. Okay?\u201d He was suddenly very serious again.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I relented.</p><p>We\u2019d been driving for close to ten hours when fatigue finally caught up with Caleb. He could barely keep his eyes open and I convinced him we needed to stop because I didn\u2019t know how to drive. Caleb laughed at me, but pulled into a motel for the night. The place wasn\u2019t much to look at, and quite honestly, the people in the parking lot were scary. This was definitely not a tourist destination.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably going to steal the truck. You know that, right?\u201d I said.</p><p>Caleb shrugged, \u201cI\u2019ll steal another one in the morning.\u201d I laughed; Caleb didn\u2019t.</p><p>I wanted to make love, but Caleb had fallen asleep while I was in the shower. I didn\u2019t have the heart to wake him. In the middle of the night, he reached for me. I barely knew what was happening before I felt his mouth on my sore pu**y. I propped myself up on my elbows and watched him lick me until I came on his tongue.</p><p>By the time he entered me, I had forgotten about how sore I was. I was too full of Caleb\u2019s c**k to care. I moaned my pleasure to the rafters, uncaring if anyone heard me. Caleb didn\u2019t seem to care either as he came inside me with a yell. There was a fleeting thought about protection, but then all I thought about was Caleb and the tiny thrusts he was making into my pu**y as he rode out the aftershocks of his pleasure.</p><p>After we managed to clean up, we slept with the windows open. I slept in his arms, safe, secure, and content beyond belief. I didn\u2019t care where we were going, as long as he was with me.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Day 1</p><p>I had just finished buttoning my shirt when it happened. There was a loud bang and something hit me in the face. I reached up to touch my cheek. My breath left me in the span of a heartbeat. Caleb was on top of me, shouting, but I couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying. I couldn\u2019t seem to hear anything.</p><p>My head hurt. I\u2019d smacked it on the ground when Caleb tackled me. Debris was flying everywhere.</p><p>\u201cLivvie!\u201d Caleb yelled and shook me. It penetrated the silence in my head.</p><p>BOOM! Another torrent of debris flew toward us. Caleb lay on top of me, shielding my face with his arms as he tucked his head near my shoulder.</p><p>Someone was f**king shooting at us. My eyes cut to the door and I could see large gaping holes where wood used to be.</p><p>We rolled behind the bed. My entire body was shaking and I had no idea what was going on. Caleb was shoving me and I cried out in pain.</p><p>\u201cGet in the tub!\u201d He shouted. He shoved me again.</p><p>I managed to get on my hands and knees. I crawled the few feet to the bathroom and scrambled into the tub. I realized Caleb wasn\u2019t with me.</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d I screamed. The bathroom door slammed shut. I was too scared to move.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to die out there, you stupid bitch! Do something!\u201d Ruthless Me, screamed.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t, f**king, move. My entire world was moving in slow motion and there was nothing I could do to speed it back up. I felt something wet on my face. My hand came away bloody when I touched it.</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d I screamed again.</p><p>A loud bang rattled the bathroom door and I threw myself back in the tub. I couldn\u2019t stop screaming or crying.</p><p>\u201cYou f**king coward, Livvie! I\u2019ll never forgive you,\u201d Ruthless said.</p><p>I slapped my hands over my ears, willing the voice to go away. I could still hear her screaming, begging me to do something. I could hear yelling just outside the door; a struggle. The door shook repeatedly as something was slammed against it.</p><p>\u201cHelp him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?!\u201d I screamed out loud.</p><p>\u201cStay down!\u201d I heard Caleb yell.</p><p>\u201cHelp him!\u201d</p><p>Hearing Caleb\u2019s voice, knowing he was fighting to stay alive only a few feet away seemed to clear some of my panic.</p><p>\u201cThe gun, Livvie. The gun. Where is it?\u201d Ruthless said.</p><p>I took several deep breaths, frantic breaths, as I tried to remember. Where was the gun? Where was the gun? In the bag!</p><p>\u201cGood, Livvie. Where\u2019s the bag?\u201d</p><p>I sobbed loudly, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>A string of loud and angry shouting came through the door. I didn\u2019t understand it, but I knew it was Arabic. They\u2019d come for us. Rafiq was here to kill us.</p><p>\u201cThe bag!\u201d Ruthless screamed.</p><p>Images. They flashed through my mind\u2019s eye in rapid succession: I brought the bag in. I set it down on the table. Caleb picked it up and took it into the bathroom. He needed a butterfly stitch for his head. It was in there when I showered.</p><p>I looked around the bathroom, but I didn\u2019t see it.</p><p>It was there when I went to bed. Caleb and I had sex and after, he wanted clean underwear. Next to the bed on Caleb\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cGet there, Livvie. Get to the gun,\u201d Ruthless said.</p><p>I shook my head back and forth as I sobbed. I didn\u2019t know what was out there. If I opened the door...</p><p>\u201cThey already know you\u2019re in here! You\u2019re going to die. Caleb is going to die. Please!\u201d</p><p>I scrambled out of the tub. The bathroom was tiny, my foot still touched the edge of the tub as I put my hand against the door. I could still hear Caleb fighting someone on the other side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming out!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Caleb yelled and there was a loud crash.</p><p>I gripped the handle of the door and pulled it open. The clothing rack was directly across from the bathroom, creating a little square alcove to the side of the bedroom. I could see Caleb on the floor, grappling with someone.</p><p>\u201cRun, Livvie!\u201d</p><p>I stood up and tried to run past them and get on the bed. A hand reached out and grabbed my ankle. I fell, face first onto the floor, but the pain didn\u2019t register. I kicked with my legs, blind to what or whom I was hitting. The hand let go.</p><p>I looked back and saw blood. Caleb\u2019s head was down. There was a loud, panicked scream and the person under Caleb pulled at his hair to wrench him backward. Caleb\u2019s mouth opened on a scream and blood came spurting out.</p><p>The screams continued, one after the other.</p><p>I froze. The screaming. I couldn\u2019t take the screaming.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s body was suddenly thrown toward the alcove. I didn\u2019t recognize our attacker. His face gushed with blood and a flap of skin hung from his cheek.</p><p>I screamed.</p><p>The man was still screaming as he threw himself on top of Caleb. He was beating his head into the floor.</p><p>I forced myself to move. I scrambled toward the bed, frantically running my hands underneath and feeling for the bag. It was there! I pulled it out and dumped it out on the floor. The gun came toppling out and I gripped it. It went off. I hit myself in the face with the back of my hand.</p><p>\u201cLivvie!\u201d Caleb yelled. The sound was a wet gurgle.</p><p>I regrouped quickly and held the gun in both hands. I pulled the hammer back and my hands trembled as I pointed it at the man on top of Caleb. \u201cGet off him! Now!\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at me, the flap of skin on his face just hanging there as blood gushed out, one heavy spurt after another. He rushed me and I squeezed the trigger. The force toppled me. My vision blurred for a couple of seconds. I scrambled backward on my hands, searching for the gun behind me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d shot him. Our attacker lay on the ground, his body twitching and shuddering. His hands clawed at his chest. There was blood everywhere.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCaleb, Livvie! Focus. Focus on Caleb. Where\u2019s Caleb?\u201d Ruthless said.</p><p>Somehow, I registered the situation. I looked toward the bathroom. Caleb wasn\u2019t moving. No. No, no, no, no, no! I saw red. Nothing but red! I found the gun and picked it back up. I crawled over and put the barrel on our attacker\u2019s chest. He tried to fight me while I pulled back the hammer, but he was weak, and my rage made me strong. I screamed as I pulled the trigger and blood sprayed my face, neck, and body. When I opened my eyes, I stared directly into his wide open chest.</p><p>\u201cCaleb!\u201d I yelled. When he didn\u2019t answer, I crawled toward him, terrified of what I might find when I reached him. He wasn\u2019t moving. He was covered in blood and he wasn\u2019t moving! I pulled his head into my lap and tapped the side of his face, \u201cCaleb? Wake up, baby. Wake up! We have to go.\u201d There was no reaction. \u201cPlease. Please, God!\u201d I put my hand on his chest. He was breathing.</p><p>I could hear shouting from outside. People running and squealing tires leaving the parking lot. Cops would be here soon. I put Caleb\u2019s head down and grabbed his shirt to sit him up. \u201cWake up! Please!\u201d I shook him. His head fell forward and he coughed blood onto my pants. \u201cOh! Oh! Thank you!\u201d I pulled him to my chest, running my hands all over him.</p><p>\u201cLivvie,\u201d he said. And then he really woke up, \u201cLivvie!\u201d He pulled back and stared at me in shock. He pushed me to one side and looked behind me, then back to my face. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he said frantically.</p> <p>I nodded, tears streaming down my face.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go,\u201d he said. \u201cNow. Get up.\u201d He pushed me up and I helped him stand. He grabbed my hand and stooped down to scoop up the gun.</p><p>I ran to the pile of things next to the bed and found the keys. I shoved everything else inside in one huge ball.</p><p>\u201cGet to the truck, Livvie,\u201d Caleb said. He seemed much too calm.</p><p>I ran across the parking lot, surprised to discover there were no people out there anymore. I managed to get the key into the lock and open the door. I scrambled inside and slammed it shut.</p><p>I heard another gunshot and ducked. Nothing happened for several seconds, but then the truck shook and I heard a loud thud. I squeezed my eyes shut. The cab door opened.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Livvie. It\u2019s me,\u201d Caleb whispered. He found the keys in my hand and pried them loose. He peeled out of the parking lot as I shivered and cried on the seat next to him. After a while, I felt his fingers in my hair, gently stroking my head.</p><p>I had killed a man. I was covered in his blood.</p><p>I had to do it. I\u2019m not sorry.</p><p>And I wasn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t sorry the son of a bitch was dead. I\u2019d known he was dead after I shot him the first time. There was no way he could have survived the wound I\u2019d given him. I had shot him the second time because...I wanted to. He had tried to kill me, but it was seeing Caleb\u2019s motionless body, that had ultimately filled me with rage. Caleb was mine. I was through letting people take things from me.</p><p>We drove for a few hours. I had no idea where we were and I didn\u2019t care. I kept my head on Caleb\u2019s lap and let him touch me. Everything in my world made sense if Caleb kept touching me.</p><p>Eventually, Caleb stopped the truck, but he asked me to stay put while he took care of the body in the bed. The final shot I had heard was Caleb shooting the guy in the face. He didn\u2019t want him identified. The guy in question had been Jair\u2019s cousin, Khalid.</p><p>I wanted to ask about Rafiq and the others, but then I remembered the way Caleb had come back to the room, shell-shocked and devoid of life. Some things were better left unsaid. Caleb and I were alive. We were together. Everything else? I didn\u2019t need to know.</p><p>Caleb got back in the truck faster than I would have expected. \u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou buried him?\u201d I asked doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cNo need. The animals can have him,\u201d he said. He reached across the seat and pulled my forehead toward his lips. \u201cI killed that man, Livvie. Do you understand?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLivvie! Listen to what I\u2019m telling you!\u201d He looked me dead in my eyes. His expression was hard and cold. \u201cI killed him.\u201d He nodded his head until I mimicked him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he whispered and kissed me. Our agreement was sealed.</p><p>I should have known what Caleb was planning. There had been plenty of signs. I should have questioned him more about what had traumatized him back at Felipe\u2019s mansion. I should have demanded to know the plan when I kept seeing signs for Texas. At the very least, I should have asked more questions about the piece of paper Caleb demanded I memorize. He said anyone with the pass codes and account information could gain access and it was important only he and I knew the information. I had felt so special. I thought he trusted me. I had felt like a spy when I burned the piece of paper and threw the ashes out the window.</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask questions. I didn\u2019t demand answers. Instead, I had been completely blindsided when Caleb stopped the truck and shattered my entire world by saying our time together had come to an end.</p><p>We were both silent for a long time. I didn\u2019t want to be the first to speak, I was afraid I couldn\u2019t. Caleb finally cleared his throat and broke the silence, \u201cThe border is just a few kilometers up the road. I can\u2019t go any closer.\u201d He gestured to the blood all over him.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I can? I killed \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill anyone!\u201d He shouted. \u201cYou were kidnapped. You\u2019ve been trying to escape and for months...I\u2019ve...I kept you prisoner. I raped you,\u201d he said.</p><p>His words were a knife in my heart and I slapped him. Hard. \u201cDon\u2019t say that! I know how we started out, Caleb. I know! But, please,\u201d I begged. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s eyes welled up with tears, but he smiled and rubbed his face, \u201cYou slapped me,\u201d he laughed. \u201cAgain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this, Caleb?\u201d I asked as calmly as I could, but already, my throat was thick with the sobs I was trying to hold inside.</p><p>He looked at me and I could see the faintest trace of something resembling the pain on my own face. \u201cBecause...it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you let me decide for myself what the right thing is? I want to stay with you.\u201d I choked out. My heart raced, and I could no longer hold back my tears. He was giving me my chance to go home, to go back to my life, to go back to everything I said I wanted \u2013 but all I could think was none of it mattered if it meant I\u2019d never see him again.</p><p>He gripped the steering wheel tightly and pressed his forehead against it, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you want, Livvie, and what you think you want, you\u2019ve been brainwashed into wanting.\u201d I immediately took a breath in order to protest; he held up his hand to stop me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time \u2013 manipulating people to get my way. That\u2019s why you think you love me! Because I\u2019ve broken you down and built you back up to believe it. It wasn\u2019t an accident! Once you leave this behind...you\u2019ll see that.\u201d</p><p>I could barely see him through the mist of tears clouding my vision. Caleb believed everything he said. I could hear it in his voice \u2013 but he was wrong. He hadn\u2019t manipulated me into loving him. He\u2019d tried to do the very opposite.</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s it? You think I\u2019m just some idiot that fell for your bullshit! Well you\u2019re wrong! I fell in love with you, Caleb. I fell in love with your sick sense of humor. I fell in love with the way you protected me. You saved my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to collect my property, Livvie,\u201d he said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Livvie anymore! I\u2019m yours! Isn\u2019t that what you said? Isn\u2019t it what you promised? What we swore!\u201d I wept.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to own you. I want you to be free and as long as you\u2019re with me...I\u2019ll always see you as my slave,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stand the sight of Caleb\u2019s head bowed in shame. He was much too proud a person. \u201cI was never your slave, Caleb. You tried, I\u2019ll give you that, but we both know you belong to me, as much as I, belong to you. If you\u2019d really been able to break me down, and build me back up, neither of us would be here. No matter how f**ked up the circumstances, I genuinely fell in love with you...and...and believe it or not...you love me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitten,\u201d he said, \u201cmonsters can\u2019t love.\u201d He swiped at his eyes, \u201cNow, get out of the truck. Walk toward the border, and don\u2019t ever look back.\u201d</p><p>Unable to control myself any longer I wrapped my arms around him as tightly as I could. \u201cI love you, Caleb. I love you! If you care for me at all...please, don\u2019t do this! Please, don\u2019t leave me. I don\u2019t know how to live without you. Don\u2019t make me go back to trying to be someone I don\u2019t know how to be anymore.\u201d</p><p>His arms gently guided me back, and when our eyes met, I finally saw the emotions he tried so hard to keep hidden, and the resolve with which he said, \u201cLive for me, Kitten. Be all those things you\u2019d never be with me. Go to school. Meet a normal boy and fall in love. Forget me. It\u2019s time for you to go, Kitten. Time for us both, to go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere will you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>My heart sank, but I knew I had lost the argument and there was no stopping this goodbye. I wanted to kiss him then, just one last kiss to remember him by, but I knew kissing him would only be torture. I wanted to remember our last kiss as being one of passion and connection, not one of sadness and regret.</p><p>I let him go and opened the door.</p> <p>\u201cTake this,\u201d he whispered and pushed the gun toward me. \u201cIt\u2019s how you escaped.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the gun for a long time. I even contemplated taking Caleb hostage with it and forcing him to drive us somewhere else. But he\u2019d hurt me.

He\u2019d made his choice and it wasn\u2019t me. I stepped out of the truck, slammed the door and started my trek toward the border.</p><p>As I walked, I could feel his eyes on me, the way I could always feel his eyes on me. Tears ran down my face unabashed, but I didn\u2019t move to wipe them away. I had earned those tears, and I would wear them as a symbol of everything I had been through. They represented all the pain I had suffered, the love I felt, and the ocean of loss sweeping through my soul. I had finally learned to obey and never looked back.</p><p>I was covered in blood and bruised when I arrived at the border. In shock over everything that had happened with Caleb, I didn\u2019t respond well to the border patrol officers screaming at me with raised weapons. I had a weapon of my own and I wasn\u2019t afraid to f**king use it. And if I died? Who the f**k cared?</p> <p>I put the gun to my head and demanded to be let through.</p><p>The f**ktards shot me.</p><p>I thought I would die, bleed out as they wrestled me to the ground and handcuffed me. I didn\u2019t know they had shot me with rubber bullets.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Day 14:</p><p>Matthew sat across from the former Miss Olivia Ruiz. She looked like hell. Her long dark hair was pulled away from her face into a severe bun. She had dark circles under her eyes and she hadn\u2019t been eating much. Her lack of food intake had kept her at the hospital an additional 72 hours, but they couldn\u2019t keep her once she had decided she wanted to leave.</p> <p>Agent Sloan was also in the room. The revelations of the case had been difficult for her to swallow as well and Matthew wished there were some way to comfort her without leading her on. She had come to his room after visiting Olivia at the hospital and learning about his and Olivia\u2019s last conversation. They spoke about the case for a while, but then she had wanted to talk about the night they\u2019d had sex and he had to let her know in no uncertain terms it had been a one night affair. She\u2019d called him a coward. He\u2019d called her worse.</p><p>\u201cIs this the last piece of paper?\u201d Sophia Cole asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cOnce you walk out of this room, you\u2019ll be Sophia Cole. In exchange for your silence on the events of the last four months, the Bureau has dropped the charges against you and given you a new identity. We will cover your accrued medical expenses and you will be provided with the airline ticket you requested. In addition, your mother will receive the sum of $200,000 to be paid over five years. You understand, should you violate the terms of your agreement with the U.S. Government, you may be treated as a terrorist under the provisions of the Patriot Act and subject to a $250,000 fine and potential imprisonment. As a suspected terrorist, you may not be granted access to a lawyer or formally charged. However, your case will be reviewed every three years to make a determination on whether or not you pose further threat. Do you understand the terms of this agreement?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sophia whispered dully.</p><p>\u201cDo you agree to the terms of this agreement?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I have much of a choice.\u201d</p><p>Matthew sighed heavily and his eyes briefly met Sloan\u2019s. She shook her head slightly, letting him know how much she hated what was happening. Matthew hated it too, but his hands were tied on the issue. \u201cThe U.S. Government has given you all the things you\u2019ve asked for, with the exception of returning into your care the S&amp;W Model 29 revolver confiscated when you were first apprehended,\u201d Matthew said.</p><p>\u201cAnd the bad guys go free. Don\u2019t forget that part, Agent Reed,\u201d Sophia said coldly.</p> <p>Matthew was just as pissed off about that, but he\u2019d done his job and he\u2019d bent as far as he could. \u201cYour assailants were never recovered at the auction in Karachi, Miss Cole.\u201d It felt wrong to call her by that name, but it was the one she had chosen and Matthew would respect it. \u201cThe U.S. Government sees no need to damage its relationship with Pakistan based on unsubstantiated allegations. However, it will be mentioned in the report that your statement led the joint task force to the auction and resulted in the freeing of over 127 human trafficking victims and the arrest of 243 potential traffickers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Reed. Are we done here? I\u2019d like to go,\u201d Sophia said. Matthew didn\u2019t take her disdain personally. He knew the real reason for her distress and it had little to do with the deal she was making \u2013 the deal she\u2019d asked for. She was still grieving over Caleb\u2019s\u2014James\u2019 death.</p><p>Matthew suspected he was still alive, but as far as he, or the Bureau, was concerned, James Cole had died in Mexico of gunshot wounds he sustained while aiding in Olivia\u2019s escape. The shooter, Khalid Baloch, was still at large. Matthew had closed James Cole\u2019s kidnapping case as well, but not before he reached out to Demitri Balk\u2019s personal assistant and was told Mr. Balk had \u2018no surviving children\u2019. Mr. Balk himself was unavailable.</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss Cole, we\u2019re done,\u201d Matthew said. He could almost feel Sophia\u2019s sorrow from across the table and it seemed to work its way into his own frame of mind. He had wanted things to end differently. Not just for Sophia, but for him as well. He\u2019d been losing his faith in the system for quite some time. He had hoped by solving this case and putting the bad men in jail, he might regain some of the fire he\u2019d once had for his job. Instead, the victory had been bitter sweet. Over a hundred women were free from sexual slavery, but only a fraction of their traffickers would see the inside of a jail cell. Most of them would simply pay fines and go free. \u2018Bitter sweet\u2019 was a lackluster description of what had happened in Pakistan.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart,\u201d Sloan said to Sophia, \u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d She stood and gathered up her papers, putting them into her briefcase.</p><p>Matthew watched Sloan intently. Her red hair was gathered in a French braid and her face was scrubbed clean of all make-up. She wore a grey suit that covered up all her sexy curves. She was somewhat of an enigma. Matthew wondered how she was able to change like night and day. As a social worker, she seemed empathetic and somewhat devoid of interesting facets in her personality, but Matthew knew, first hand, what she could be like when she took down the mantle. He almost regretted not taking her up on her offer of more sex. He\u2019d never been with a woman so attuned to his needs. Then again, she terrified him a little.</p><p>Matthew stood and offered Sophia his hand, \u201cGoodbye, Miss Cole. Please know...you can contact me if you ever need anything. You have my card and I\u2019d be offended if you didn\u2019t use it.\u201d</p><p>Sophia smiled at him, but tears shone in her eyes, \u201cThanks, Reed. I know you did your best.\u201d She shook his hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Cole,\u201d he said. It didn\u2019t feel like enough. It probably never would. Matthew turned toward Sloan and extended his hand, \u201cThank you for all your help too, Agent Sloan.\u201d</p><p>Sloan raised an auburn brow, but took Matthew\u2019s hand and shook it, \u201cNo problem, Agent Reed. Let me know if you need any help with the final report. I\u2019m leaving for Virginia tomorrow night, but until then...my phone\u2019s on.\u201d She smiled and Matthew felt his face heat up.</p><p>\u201cI should have everything, but thank you,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cYou two should just f**k and get it over with,\u201d Sophia said without humor.</p><p>\u201cLivvie! I mean.... Let\u2019s go,\u201d Sloan said.</p><p>Matthew didn\u2019t have a chance to respond before the two women left the room. He smiled to himself and shook his head. He was definitely going to miss Livvie and her crass sense of humor. He hoped she would seek the help she needed and make a full recovery one day. It would be a shame for such a beautiful, intelligent, and brave person to lose faith in the future.</p><p>Matthew picked up his recorder and turned it off. It was an archaic contraption and completely unnecessary considering everything in this room was recorded by the surveillance cameras, but he liked to maintain his own evidence. Things had a way of getting lost. He put it in his briefcase along with his files and headed out the door.</p><p>As he walked toward the elevator, he glimpsed \u2018Sophia\u2019 exchanging a tearful embrace with her mother. Matthew didn\u2019t exactly like the woman after all he\u2019d learned about her, but he was happy she was finally getting the opportunity to see her daughter and perhaps apologize for everything she\u2019d put her through. As part of the agreement, Sophia\u2019s family would be relocated and her mother would be offered her choice of training and employment. It was more than she deserved in Matthew\u2019s estimation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Matthew would be heading back to an empty apartment in South Carolina until he was assigned to a new case. He hoped it would differ greatly from this one and he was fairly sure it would. In the meantime, he\u2019d decided he wouldn\u2019t give up on getting in touch with Demitri Balk. The guy was dirty and despite all evidence to the contrary, he wasn\u2019t untouchable. Perhaps, in time, he would also lead him to Muhammad Rafiq and the rest of his cohorts.</p><p>James Cole deserved justice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want revenge, Caleb. I don\u2019t want to end up like you, letting some f**king vendetta run my life. I just want my freedom.\u201d \u2013 Livvie</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p> <p>Day 287: Kaiserslautern, Germany</p><p>He\u2019d learned the hard way that there was no future when all he could see was revenge. The only thing revenge had ever given him was a brief moment of satisfaction, followed by an empty abyss. He was through with revenge. He wanted to feel full instead of empty, loved, instead of feared.</p><p>Love, Caleb reminded himself. Love was the purpose of all this. He\u2019d been dreaming of this moment for nearly a year, but now that his moment had arrived, he hesitated. Was it the right thing to do? Should he take his own advice: leave and never look back? He wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>As a slave trainer, he had trained at least a score of girls. Some had been willing, offering themselves as pleasure slaves to escape destitution, sacrificing freedom for security. Others had come to him as the coerced daughters of impoverished farmers looking to off load their burden in exchange for a dowry. Some had been the fourth or fifth wives of sheikhs and bankers sent by their husbands to learn to satisfy their distinct appetites. He had trained so many, he had forgotten their names.</p><p>He knew them all by heart now. Ojal Nath had ended up in Turkey; her master had died and passed her off to his son. Caleb had paid a king\u2019s ransom to set her free. She was safe at home with her family now, and she had enough money to support herself and her young daughter.</p> <p>He\u2019d been too late to save Pia Kumar, she had been dead for nearly five years. She had been beaten to death by her master\u2019s new wife. Caleb had made sure to bury the both of them together. Alive.</p><p>Isa Nasser, Naba Mazin, and Jamila Awad, had refused their freedom. They had come to him willing from the first and they lived happily with their respective masters/husbands. They\u2019d been more terrified of Caleb than of remaining in their servitude. He\u2019d wished them well and vowed to keep an eye on them.</p><p>His years spent with Rafiq had built him a reputation and Caleb took full advantage of the fear he\u2019d cultivated as Rafiq\u2019s \u2018loyal disciple\u2019. A lot of blood had been spilled in the last ten months, some of it even belonged to Caleb, but it didn\u2019t buy redemption. Caleb knew he could never be redeemed and he\u2019d made his peace with it. He couldn\u2019t right the wrongs, but he could offer a better future to those he\u2019d wronged for the sake of his own selfishness.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t about revenge. Caleb had had enough revenge to last him several lifetimes. The things he\u2019d done to Rafiq and Jair in Mexico hadn\u2019t given him solace. They\u2019d given him nightmares. For Caleb, it had become about love. He loved Livvie. Through her, he\u2019d learned what love could make a person do and it drove him forward. She had given him a gift and while he didn\u2019t deserve it, he tried to make sure it had not been wasted.</p><p>His work was far from over and he remained dedicated to his task, but the road was long and Caleb was only human. There was a hole in his heart and each day it grew, threatening to pull him into a pit of despair.</p><p>Caleb, from his vantage point diagonally across the street, glanced at the girl he\u2019d been observing for the last thirty minutes. Her hair was pulled away from her face, a heavy frown played across her mouth as she stared intently at the laptop sitting on the table in front of her. She fidgeted sometimes, alluding to a sense of restlessness she was unable to hide. He wondered why she seemed so anxious. As he eyed her beautiful face, he felt himself bursting with hope and burning with shame.</p> <p>After Mexico, Caleb had traveled farther and farther south, until he could book passage to Switzerland. He liked Z\u00fcrich, he liked its diversity and wealth, and he knew no one would notice him there. He\u2019d been putting his investments into commodities and he had enough money now to live as he pleased and travel the world to free the women he had wronged. Still, it wasn\u2019t in his nature to pursue being miserable, and so, he\u2019d looked for Livvie.</p><p>At first, there had been plenty of information. He\u2019d simply had to get on his computer and sift through the dozens of news stories from the weeks following her rescue. Things had not been easy for Livvie once she\u2019d crossed the border. She had been the target of a controversy-starved media. They followed her every move, and her reluctance to speak with the press only made her a more attractive target.</p><p>Her beautiful face had lit up his computer screen, but all he had learned was that she refused to speak to anyone. She had looked sad, and his heart had ached because he\u2019d known it was his fault. Then, after a few weeks of coverage, Livvie had seemingly disappeared.</p><p>Caleb had called the bank in Mexico and was informed the account he had set up was closed several months back. The person who\u2019d closed the account had left no messages with the bank.</p><p>His next plan of attack had been to find Livvie through her family. Caleb knew the FBI would be keeping a close eye on Livvie and had decided to hire a private investigator online. Livvie\u2019s family was gone and the private investigator he\u2019d hired couldn\u2019t provide him with any answers. Instead, the investigator had asked to meet in person, and Caleb had severed all communication.</p><p>He\u2019d almost given up hope of finding her until he remembered she\u2019d had a friend named Nicole. Caleb didn\u2019t know the girl\u2019s last name and he\u2019d had to go about finding her himself. She was attending university in California. He\u2019d followed her for weeks, but saw no signs of Livvie.</p><p>His break didn\u2019t come until Nicole left her laptop unattended while she went off to play a game of Ultimate Frisbee with her friends. Caleb had simply walked past the table filled with belongings and snatched it up, along with other things of value he could grab in a few seconds. He wanted it to look like a general robbery.</p><p>Livvie had not been easy to find and at first he had been glad. However, as the months had passed, he\u2019d become obsessed with knowing how she was. Nicole\u2019s laptop stood the best chance of letting him know how Livvie had fared. He\u2019d told himself he only wanted to make sure she was safe and happy, but in the back of his mind, he\u2019d known the real reason he wanted to find her again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m yours! Isn\u2019t that what you said? Isn\u2019t it what you promised? What we swore!\u201d she\u2019d cried.</p><p>Back at his hotel, he\u2019d opened the laptop with shaking fingers and a racing heart. At first, he\u2019d thought it was yet another dead end, but then he realized Nicole had been trying to make contact with someone named Sophia, for quite some time. He followed the trail, opening each message Nicole had sent until at last, he arrived at an email from Sophia.</p><p>To: Nicole &lt;<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>&gt;</p><p>From: Sophia &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>...&gt;</p><p>Subject: Re: Where the hell are you?</p><p>December 23, 2009</p><p>Hey girl, long time, no hear \u2013 I know. I\u2019m sorry. Even as I write this, I know you have every right to hit the delete button, but I hope you\u2019ll at least hear me out. It\u2019s almost Christmas, and I\u2019m lonely. I miss you. I miss my family (never thought I\u2019d say that).</p><p>I\u2019ve been wandering around Europe, seeing all the things most people won\u2019t get to see in their entire lives. The truth? It\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. The French are truly ass**les. I wouldn\u2019t suggest coming unless you speak fluent French, because they\u2019re pretty crappy to tourists. For the city of love, it\u2019s pretty damn lonely. I had to take the stairs up the Eiffel Tower and when I finally reached the top I realized I had no one to share the moment with me. I mean, it was crowded and people were pushing, but the view was truly gorgeous, but alone, it\u2019s just another tall building. Someone stole my wallet and I didn\u2019t notice until I tried to get something from the gift shop.</p><p>England is super expensive. Did you know it\u2019s like two dollars to every pound?!? I didn\u2019t stay there long. The money I have is great, but it won\u2019t last forever if I don\u2019t take care of how I spend it. The one great thing about England is the people are much nicer, but the men remind me a little too much of you know who. The accent makes me want to cry.</p><p>I miss him, Nick. I know it\u2019s stupid, but I do. I think it\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone after I left the hospital. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d understand. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you \u2013 I do. It\u2019s just that I love him and everyone else hates him and I can\u2019t deal with it.</p><p>Someday, I\u2019ll be ready. Someday, I\u2019ll stop loving him and seeing him everywhere I go. I\u2019ll stop hearing his voice in my head and dreaming of his kisses every night. Someday, I\u2019ll be able to see things the way I should and I\u2019ll hate him for everything he put me through \u2013 but not today. Not tomorrow.</p><p>You\u2019re angry with me and believe me, I get it. I would be pissed if you decided to fall off the edge of the earth and not reply to my messages, but I needed time. I still need time. If you\u2019re not there for me when I\u2019m through this, I\u2019ll understand. Just know, I love you and I never wanted things to be this way between us. If I don\u2019t hear from you, have a Merry Christmas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hugs,</p><p>Sophia</p><p>Caleb searched the rest of the messages, but didn\u2019t find any dated after Livvie\u2019s email. Apparently, Nicole had moved on, and Livvie had let her. Perhaps, Caleb thought, he should do the same with Livvie, but his heart had been claimed. He needed to know if she still loved him, or if he\u2019d been right and everything she had felt for him had been based on her need to survive.</p><p>He\u2019d agonized over whether or not he should seek her out. He knew her answer could destroy him, but he needed to know. He needed to know if she suffered without him, as much as he suffered without her. If she loved him, he wanted to spend the rest of his life trying to be worthy of her. If she didn\u2019t, he could at least take solace in knowing he\u2019d made the right decision in setting her free.</p> <p>Caleb looked at the girl sitting outside the caf\u00e9. Did he even know her anymore? Could she sense her life as she knew it hanging precariously in the balance? Could she feel his eyes on her? Did she have a sixth sense for monsters? The thought made him sad.</p><p>He\u2019d been here before. He\u2019d done this, before. He shouldn\u2019t be watching her. He shouldn\u2019t be contemplating thrusting himself back into her life. He still had work to do, women to free from the slavery he had subjected them to live through.</p><p>He looked at the girl one last time.</p><p>I love you, Livvie.</p><p>He put the key in the ignition and drove away.</p> <p>Day 392: Madrid, Spain</p><p>It\u2019s just a feeling, but I\u2019ve been having it for a while. Someone\u2019s been watching me. I\u2019ve been in touch with Reed and he\u2019s dutifully put out some feelers to find out if I might be in danger. He\u2019s supposed to meet me in a few days, under the guise of following a counterfeiting case. In the meantime, he wants me to behave normally. He doesn\u2019t want whoever\u2019s following me to know I\u2019m on to them.</p><p>Reed says he\u2019s heard reports of someone targeting Rafiq\u2019s known associates. Rafiq has been missing for over a year and his government is none too happy about it. They think the FBI has something to do with his disappearance. Of course, they can\u2019t prove it. Reed doesn\u2019t seem too bent out of shape about it though. The culprit is apparently some sort of vigilante. He\u2019s freed eighteen women from sexual slavery.</p><p>When I first heard the news, I immediately thought it might be Caleb and my heart felt like someone had squeezed it in their fist. Reed didn\u2019t say it, but I thought he might suspect it was Caleb, too. It was in the way he asked me if I had any idea who might be responsible, or if anyone had been in touch with me.</p><p>\u201cJames Cole is dead,\u201d I had whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Reed replied, \u201cI hope he has enough sense to stay that way.\u201d</p> <p>I want to agree with Reed, but in my heart, I know what I really want. I want it to be Caleb. I want to know he\u2019s alive. I want to know he\u2019s out there trying to correct some of his mistakes. More than anything, I want to see Caleb again.</p><p>I\u2019d contemplated killing myself early on, but then I\u2019d hear Caleb\u2019s voice in my ear, telling me to survive, that it was the coward\u2019s way out. So, I\u2019d taken the money Caleb had left for me and decided to see the parts of the world I\u2019d heard so much about and thought I\u2019d never lay eyes on.</p><p>The last year has been a whirlwind. I\u2019ve lost so much and only now have I started to get some of it back. To date, I\u2019ve seen four of the seven wonders, and I have plans to see the pyramids before the year is out. I have a job, working as a waitress at an Applebee\u2019s of all places. Who comes to Barcelona to eat at an Applebee\u2019s? I don\u2019t care though, it\u2019s work and it pays for my classes at European University Barcelona, where I\u2019m studying creative writing.</p><p>I don\u2019t like to rely on Caleb\u2019s money, so I have a financial advisor who invests it for me and looks after my affairs. Each month, I receive a generous stipend to supplement my income from working as a waitress.</p><p>Things were really hard at first, but it continues to get easier if I take my life and break it up into small increments. I wake up, take a shower, brush my teeth, get dressed, and go to work. I meet people and I\u2019ve even managed to make some friends. I met Claudia and Rubio in line for a screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Claudia had been dressed as Colombia, and her boyfriend as Riff Raff. I didn\u2019t dress up.</p><p>They\u2019re great friends. They don\u2019t ask me questions about my past and I don\u2019t offer any information. Mostly, we like to hang out after work and drink pitchers of sangria outside El Gallo Negro. They serve the best chicken/seafood paella I\u2019ve found anywhere. After we get good and sauced, we usually go see the latest movie or go back to my place and play Rock Band on my PlayStation.</p><p>My friends may not ask about my past, but they\u2019re always interested in my present and future. They often try to set me up with their other friends, but I firmly resist. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t want a boyfriend, I do, but I\u2019m not ready.</p><p>Caleb still fills my dreams and stars in each and every one of my fantasies. I still have the picture Reed gave me, and so, I can still imagine his face with perfect clarity as I touch myself. Sometimes soft and slow, reaching for climax like one stretches after a good nap. Sometimes, I like it fast and rough. I pinch my ni**les hard and rub my clit while I push my fingers deep inside my pu**y and play Caleb\u2019s words in my head.</p> <p>\u201cIs that good, Pet?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes, Caleb,\u201d I answer.</p><p>I never mention Caleb to Claudia or Rubio. My memories and fantasies are my own business, but I think Claudia can tell whenever I miss Caleb. She smiles and reaches for my hand. She reminds me I don\u2019t have to be lonely.</p><p>I\u2019ve been thinking about Caleb more frequently in recent months. Ever since I thought I felt his eyes on me one day outside of a caf\u00e9 in Germany. I\u2019d been sitting outside, typing on my laptop. Then again, I\u2019d been writing about him.</p><p>I\u2019ve been writing our story for over a year, every detail I can remember. I know I\u2019m not supposed to talk about what happened with the public, but it\u2019s occurred to me how many people want to hear my story. Why shouldn\u2019t I be able to tell it? I\u2019m not a complete idiot. I\u2019ve changed all the names and locations. I\u2019ve decided to market the book as fiction. And of course, I have a pseudonym. The important thing for me is people read it and perhaps understand why I\u2019m still in love with the man who kept me prisoner.</p><p>I know all about James Cole. Reed can be a dick, but his heart is usually in the right place. He told me as much as he could. I\u2019ve deduced the rest. At first, I felt gutted by everything I had learned. I had called Caleb a monster, but he\u2019d only been doing the things he\u2019d been taught to do.</p><p>I often think about the day he\u2019d walked into the room, covered in dirt, smeared with blood, and devastated by whatever he\u2019d done to get that way. There wasn\u2019t a doubt in my mind he\u2019d killed Rafiq. I just wish he\u2019d known his tears had been wasted. I wonder if the reason Caleb pushed me away was because he felt guilty over what he\u2019d done to Rafiq to save me. Perhaps, if he\u2019d known what a true monster Rafiq was, he\u2019d have taken me with him instead of throwing me out of his life. Then again, maybe not.</p><p>\u201cYou have that \u2018lost in space\u2019 look again,\u201d Claudia says as she takes the seat opposite me at our table. \u201cOne day you\u2019re going to have to tell me what that\u2019s about. I know it has to be a boy.\u201d She moves her eyebrows up and down.</p><p>I smile at her, \u201cYou\u2019re late. Where\u2019s Rubio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ran into his friend, Sebastian. I think they\u2019ll be here in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaudia,\u201d I groan, \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you? I\u2019m not interested in a hook up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not! I swear, it was a total accident. We were on our way here and they ran into each other.\u201d She quickly pours herself a glass of sangria and starts sipping. She\u2019s a terrible liar. \u201cBesides, he\u2019s gorgeous. He\u2019s a student at EUB and he wants to be an artist. He\u2019s good too, Rubi and I saw some of his paintings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I say and start gathering my things. I am definitely not in the mood to deal with another \u2018accidental\u2019 blind date.</p><p>Claudia rolls her eyes and tugs me back down into my seat. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude, Sophia. Rubi wouldn\u2019t set you up with a troll. Come on, stay for one pitcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it is a set up then!\u201d I scowl at Claudia and she doesn\u2019t even blush.</p><p>\u201cYes, okay, you got us. We\u2019re terrible friends for wanting to see you happy.\u201d She tosses her hands in air sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI am happy, Claudia. I\u2019d be a lot happier if you guys would stop setting me up.\u201d I cross my arms over my chest, but I know I can\u2019t stay angry.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Sophia,\u201d interrupts the waiter. His name is Marco and he knows our little group pretty well. He\u2019s asked me out a couple of times, but I always say no.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Polo?\u201d I say with a smile. He hates his nickname.</p><p>\u201cVery funny. Somebody asked me to give you this,\u201d he says and hands me a piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, a secret admirer!\u201d Claudia says. Both Marco and I blush, but only Marco has the luxury of walking away from an awkward situation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a jerk, you know that?\u201d I say to Claudia, but she just smiles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I open the note and I only have to read the first sentence to know whom it\u2019s from.</p><p>I can\u2019t imagine what you must think of me...</p><p>I stand up so quickly, I knock over the pitcher of sangria and it shatters on the floor. My heart is beating in a frantic, but familiar rhythm. Claudia is up on her feet, trying to get me to acknowledge her, but I\u2019m too busy scanning the crowd for him. He\u2019s here somewhere. He\u2019s here! I don\u2019t see him and I want to scream. I can\u2019t lose him again. I can\u2019t! Already, there are tears in my eyes. I look down at the note:</p><p>And I don\u2019t expect you\u2019ve forgiven me. Still, selfishly, I have to ask you, are you glad I made you get out of the car? Was I right? Was everything you felt for me on account of my manipulation? If so, please know I am deeply sorry. That I will NEVER bother you again \u2013 I swear you\u2019ll never have cause to fear me. But if I was wrong, if you still care for me \u2013 meet me? Paseo de Colon, San Sebastia tower, eight o\u2019 clock tonight.</p> <p>C</p><p>\u201cI have to go, Claudia,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWait! What happened? Talk to me, Sophia,\u201d Claudia shouts after me.</p><p>I\u2019m already half way down the block. As I run, I look around me. Is he watching me? Is it really him? Should I call Reed? It could be a trap, but I don\u2019t think so. Only Caleb would know about our last conversation. It\u2019s him. I know it in my f**king bones.</p><p>I\u2019m in tears by the time I reach my apartment. I look at the clock. It\u2019s only four o\u2019clock. I have four whole hours to wait. I\u2019ve waited an entire f**king year, but these last four hours are going to be torture.</p> <p>Epilogue</p><p>James swallowed thickly as the stared at the words on the screen.</p><p>As I walked, I could feel his eyes on me, the way I could always feel his eyes on me. Tears ran down my face unabashed, but I didn\u2019t move to wipe them away. I had earned those tears, and I would wear them as a symbol of everything I had been through. They represented all the pain I had suffered, the love I felt, and the ocean of loss sweeping through my soul. I had finally learned to obey and never looked back.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
