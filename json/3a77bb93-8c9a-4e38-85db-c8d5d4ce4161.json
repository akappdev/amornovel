Every year during the holidays I pull it out of the attic and take a look at it and it still looks great, and every year I try to get up the nerve to take a slice and try it.</p> <p>\u2014Dean Fearing,</p><p>chef of The Mansion on Turtle Creek</p><p>This job was going to kill her yet.</p><p>Emma Collins stared at the daredevil pilot who was urging her toward his plane. She\u2019d come to Thun Field to drum up advertising dollars for her employer, The Puyallup Examiner, and wasn\u2019t interested in taking a spin around southeast Puget Sound.</p><p>\u201cThank you, but no,\u201d she insisted for the third time. Oliver Hamilton seemed to have a hearing problem. However, Emma was doing her best to maintain a professional facade, despite her pounding heart. No way would she go for a ride with Flyboy.</p> <p>The truth was, Emma was terrified of flying. Okay, she white-knuckled it in a Boeing 747, but nothing on God\u2019s green earth would get her inside a small plane with this man\u2014and his dog. Oliver Hamilton had a devil-may-care glint in his dark blue eyes and wore a distressed brown leather jacket that resembled something a World War Two bomber pilot might wear. All he needed was the white scarf. She suspected that if he ever got her in the air, he\u2019d start making loops and circles with the express purpose of frightening her to death. He looked just the type.</p><p>Placing the advertising-rate sheet on his desk, she turned resolutely away from the window and the sight of Hamilton\u2019s little bitty plane\u2014a Cessna Caravan 675, he\u2019d called it. \u201cAs I was explaining earlier, The Examiner has a circulation of over forty-five thousand. As you\u2019ll see\u2014\u201d she gestured at the sheet \u201c\u2014we have special introductory rates in December. We serve four communities and, dollar for advertising dollar, you can\u2019t do better than what we\u2019re offering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I understand all that,\u201d Oliver Hamilton said, stepping around his desk. \u201cNow, what I can offer you is the experience of a lifetime....\u201d</p><p>Instinctively Emma backed away. She had an aversion to attractive men whose promises slid so easily off their tongues. Her father had been one of them. He\u2019d flitted in and out of her life during her childhood and teen years. Every so often, he\u2019d arrived bearing gifts and making promises, none of which he\u2019d kept. Still, her mother had loved Bret Collins until the end. Pamela had died after a brief illness when Emma was a sophomore at the University of Oregon. To his credit, her father had paid her college expenses, but Emma refused to have anything to do with him. She was on her own in the world and determined to make a success of her career as a journalist. When she\u2019d hired on at The Examiner earlier that year, she hadn\u2019t objected to starting at the bottom. She\u2019d expected that. What she hadn\u2019t expected was spending half her time trying to sell advertising.</p><p>The Examiner was a family-owned business, one of a vanishing breed. The newspaper had been in the Berwald family for three generations. Walt Berwald II had held on through the corporate buyouts and survived the competition from the big-city newspapers coming out of Tacoma and Seattle. It hadn\u2019t been easy. Now his thirty-year-old son had taken over after his father\u2019s recent heart attack. Walt the third, the new editor-in-chief, was doing everything he could to keep the newspaper financially solvent, which Emma knew was a challenge.</p><p>\u201cHey, Oscar,\u201d Oliver said, bending to pet his dog. \u201cI think the lady\u2019s afraid of flying.\u201d</p> <p>Emma bristled, irritated that he\u2019d pegged her so quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her and continued to pet the dog. She couldn\u2019t readily identify his breed, possibly some kind of terrier. The dog was mostly white with one large black spot surrounding his left eye. Right out of that 1930s show Spanky and Our Gang. Wasn\u2019t that the name? She shook off her momentary distraction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to sell you advertising in The Examiner,\u201d she explained again. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll reconsider.\u201d</p><p>Oliver straightened, crossing his arms, and leaned against his desk. \u201cAs I said, I\u2019m just getting my business started. At this point I don\u2019t have a lot of discretionary funds for advertising. So for now I\u2019ll stick with the word-of-mouth method. That seems to be working.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be working that well, since he appeared to have a lot of time on his hands. \u201cExactly what is it you do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI give flying lessons and I\u2019ve recently begun an air-freight business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOscar and I haven\u2019t crashed even once.\u201d</p> <p>He was obviously making fun of her, and she didn\u2019t appreciate it. Nor did she take his alleged safety record as an incentive to leap into the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cBut then,\u201d he added, \u201cthere\u2019s always a first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what I was going to say,\u201d Emma muttered. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave the information with you,\u201d she said more pleasantly. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll think about our proposal when it\u2019s financially feasible.\u201d</p><p>Retrieving her briefcase and purse, she headed toward the door\u2014which Oliver suddenly blocked with his arm. His smile was as lazy as it was sexy. Hmm, funny how often lazy and sexy went together. Considering all that boyish charm, plenty of other women had probably melted at his feet. She wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She met his gaze without flinching.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t take you up for a spin?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, positively sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to fear except fear itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have other calls to make.\u201d</p><p>He moved aside. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame. You\u2019re kinda cute in an uptight sort of way.\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist, she rolled her eyes.</p><p>Oliver chuckled and walked her out to her car, his dog trotting behind him. Normally Emma would\u2019ve taken time to pet the terrier, but Oliver Hamilton would inevitably read that as a sign she was interested in him. She was fond of animals, especially dogs, and hoped to get one herself. Unfortunately, her apartment complex didn\u2019t allow pets; not only that, the landlord was a real piece of work. As soon as she had the chance, Emma planned to find somewhere else to live.</p><p>Using her remote, she unlocked her car door, which Oliver promptly opened for her. She smiled her thanks, eager to leave, and climbed into the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cSo I can\u2019t change your mind?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. The one thing a ladies\u2019 man could never resist, Emma had learned from her father, was a woman who said no. Somehow, she\u2019d have to get Oliver to accept her at her word.</p><p>She reached for the door and closed it. Hard.</p><p>Oliver stepped back.</p><p>After she\u2019d started the ignition and pulled away, he smiled at her\u2014a mysterious smile\u2014as if he knew something she didn\u2019t.</p><p>As far as Emma was concerned, she\u2019d made a lucky escape.</p><p>Her irritation had just begun to fade when she returned to the office and walked down to her cubicle in the basement, shared with half a dozen other staff. The area was affectionately\u2014and sometimes not so affectionately\u2014termed The Dungeon. Phoebe Wilkinson, who sat opposite her, glanced up when Emma tossed her purse onto her desk.</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d Phoebe asked, rolling her chair across the narrow aisle. She was one of the other reporters, a few years older than Emma. She was short where Emma was tall, with dark hair worn in a pixie cut while Emma\u2019s was long and blond. Most of the time, anyway. Occasionally Emma was a redhead or a brunette.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe my afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sell any ads?\u201d Phoebe asked. It\u2019d been her turn the day before and she\u2019d come back with three brand-new accounts.</p><p>Emma nodded. She\u2019d managed to get the local pizza parlor to place an ad in the Wednesday edition with a dollar-off coupon for any large pizza. That way, the restaurant could figure out how well the advertising had worked. Emma just hoped everyone in town would go racing into the parlor with that coupon. Badda Bing, Badda Boom Pizza had been her only sale.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Phoebe said with real enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYes, at least our payroll checks won\u2019t bounce.\u201d She couldn\u2019t restrain her sarcasm.</p><p>Phoebe frowned, shaking her head. \u201cWalt would never let that happen.\u201d</p><p>Her friend and co-worker had a crush on the owner. Phoebe was the strongest personality she knew, yet when it came to Walt, she seemed downright timid\u2014far from her usual assertive self.</p><p>Emma sighed. Her own feelings about men had grown cynical. Her father was mostly responsible for that. Her one serious college romance hadn\u2019t helped, either; it ended when her mother became ill. Emma hadn\u2019t been around to help Neal with his assignments, so he\u2019d dropped her for another journalism student. Pulling out her chair, Emma sat down. She hadn\u2019t worked so hard to get her college degree for this. Her feet hurt, she had a run in her panty hose and no one was going to give her a Pulitzer prize when she spent half her time pounding the pavement and the other half writing obituaries.</p><p>Yes, obituaries. Walt\u2019s big coup had been getting a contract to write obituaries for the large Tacoma newspaper, and that had been her job and Phoebe\u2019s for the past eight months. Emma had gotten quite good at summarizing someone else\u2019s life\u2014but that hardly made a smudge on the page of her own.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t obtained a journalism degree in order to persuade the local department store to place mattress sale ads in the Sunday paper, either. She was a reporter! A darn good one...if only someone would give her a chance to prove herself. Emma longed to write a piece worthy of her education and her skills, and frankly, preparing obituaries wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this much longer,\u201d she confessed sadly. \u201cEither Walt lets me write a real story or...\u201d She didn\u2019t know what.</p><p>Phoebe gasped. \u201cYou aren\u2019t thinking of quitting, are you?\u201d</p><p>Emma looked at her friend. She\u2019d been hired the same week as Phoebe. The difference was, Phoebe seemed content to do whatever was asked of her. She loved writing obituaries and set the perfect tone with each one. Not Emma. She hated it, struggling with them all. The result was always adequate or better because Emma took pride in her work, but it just wasn\u2019t what she wanted to be doing. She had ambition and dreamed that one day she\u2019d write feature articles. Eventually, she hoped to have her own column.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to quit. I\u2019ve been waiting six months for Walt to offer me something more than funeral home notices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep on it,\u201d Phoebe advised. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a rough day. Everything will seem better in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she murmured. An ultimatum shouldn\u2019t be made on the spur of the moment. Besides, it wasn\u2019t the obituaries or even drumming up advertising dollars that depressed her the most.</p><p>It was Christmas.</p><p>Everywhere she went, there was holiday cheer. But not everyone in the world loved Christmas. She, for example, didn\u2019t enjoy it at all. Christmas was for families and she didn\u2019t have one. Yes, her father was alive, but that was of little comfort. Since her mother\u2019s death, he always invited Emma to his house in California and she always took a certain grim satisfaction in refusing him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Almost everyone she knew had family and shared the holidays with them. Emma was alone. But she\u2019d rather be by herself than spend it with her father and his new wife. Last year she\u2019d ignored the season entirely. On Christmas Day she\u2019d gone to a movie and had buttered popcorn for dinner and that had suited her perfectly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to quit just before Christmas,\u201d Phoebe told her.</p><p>Emma sighed again. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t.\u201d But she said it mostly to avoid upsetting Phoebe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually going to confront Walt?\u201d Phoebe peered at Emma across The Dungeon aisle the next morning.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Emma murmured. She\u2019d decided that after almost a year, she wasn\u2019t any closer to writing feature articles than the day she was hired. It was time to face reality. She\u2019d reached her limit; she was finished with working in the bowels of the drafty building, tired of spending half her week traipsing around Bonny Lake, Sumner and Puyallup searching for advertising dollars.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to say to him?\u201d Phoebe\u2019s brown eyes regarded her carefully.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what she could say that she hadn\u2019t already said a hundred times. If Walt refused to listen, she would simply hand in her notice. She wouldn\u2019t leave until after Christmas; that was for strictly financial reasons. Where she\u2019d apply next, however, was the question.</p><p>\u201cWalt won\u2019t want to lose you,\u201d Phoebe said confidently.</p><p>\u201cYou mean when he isn\u2019t yelling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has a lot on his mind.\u201d</p><p>Emma narrowed her eyes. Phoebe\u2019s infatuation with Walt blinded her to the truth.</p><p>It was now or never. Emma stood, squaring her shoulders. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to talk to Walt.\u201d She motioned at the stairwell. \u201cDo I have the look?\u201d The one that said she was serious.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d Phoebe was nothing if not encouraging.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be stuck writing all the obituaries,\u201d Emma cautioned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d her friend said.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, here goes.\u201d</p><p>Emma marched up the stairs and toward the back of the first floor, where Walt\u2019s luxurious office was situated. Well, perhaps it wasn\u2019t as luxurious as all that, except when compared to the dank basement where Emma and Phoebe were relegated.</p><p>Walt glanced up, frowning, as she planted herself in the threshold to his office.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d she asked politely.</p><p>His frown slowly transformed itself into a smile, and for the first time Emma noticed her employer had company. She opened her mouth to apologize, but Walt didn\u2019t let her finish.</p><p>\u201cI was just going to ask you to step into my office.\u201d He waved her inside. \u201cI believe you\u2019ve met Oliver Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>It was all she could do not to ask why he was here. \u201cHello again,\u201d Emma managed to say as her stomach lurched. She should\u2019ve known; Oliver wasn\u2019t a man who took no for an answer.</p><p>He stood when Emma came into the office and extended his hand. \u201cGood to see you again, too.\u201d</p> <p>Emma reluctantly exchanged handshakes, not fooled by his friendly demeanor, and avoided eye contact. A weary sensation came over her. The man was up to no good. At this point she didn\u2019t know what he wanted, but she had a feeling she was about to find out\u2014a sinking feeling, which was one of those clich\u00e9s she\u2019d learned to excise in journalism school.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Walt instructed when she remained frozen to the spot.</p><p>She did, perching on the chair parallel to Oliver\u2019s.</p><p>Walt leaned back in his seat and studied her. Despite the free and easy style typical of the office, Emma chose to dress as a professional, since that was the way she wanted to be perceived. Her hair was secured at the base of her neck with a gold clip. The impression she hoped to create was that of a working reporter with an edge. Today\u2019s outfit was a classy black pinstripe suit with a straight skirt and formfitting jacket.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been saying for some time that you\u2019d be interested in writing something other than obituaries,\u201d Walt began.</p><p>\u201cYes, I feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say you want to write what you refer to as a \u2018real story.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded. She glanced out of the corner of her eye at Oliver. \u201cHowever, if the story\u2019s about planes and such, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d Her employer didn\u2019t allow her to finish.</p><p>Emma relaxed. Not completely but enough so she could breathe normally.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about fruitcake.\u201d</p><p>Emma was dying to write a human interest story and after months of pleading, Walt was finally giving her an assignment. He wanted her to write about fruitcake. Surely there was some mistake.</p><p>\u201cFruitcake?\u201d she repeated just to be sure she\u2019d heard him correctly. Emma didn\u2019t even like fruitcake; in fact, she hated the stuff. She firmly believed that there were two kinds of people in the world\u2014those who liked fruitcake and those who didn\u2019t.</p><p>She\u2019d once heard an anecdote about a fruitcake that was passed around a family for years. It was hard as a brick and the fruitcake shuffle finally ended when someone used it as an anchor for a fishing boat.</p><p>\u201cGood Homemaking magazine ran a national fruitcake contest last month,\u201d he went on to explain. \u201cAmazingly, three of the twelve finalists are from the state of Washington.\u201d</p><p>He paused\u2014waiting for her to show awe or appreciation, she supposed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a statistic, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Oliver inserted.</p><p>Still leery, Emma slowly nodded once more.</p><p>Walt smiled as if he\u2019d gotten the response he wanted. \u201cI\u2019d like you to interview the three finalists and write an article about each of them.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so maybe these articles weren\u2019t going to put her in the running for a major writing award, but this was the chance she\u2019d been hoping for. There had to be more to these three women than their interest in fruitcake. She\u2019d write about their lives, about who they were. She had her first big break and she was grabbing hold of it with both hands.</p><p>The professional in her took over. \u201cWhen would you like me to start?\u201d she asked, trying not to sound too eager.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you want,\u201d Walt told her, grinning. Judging by the gleam in his eyes, he knew he had her. \u201cThe magazine\u2019s going to announce the winner on their Web site in three weeks, and then do a feature on her in their next issue. It could be one of our ladies. Flatter them,\u201d Walt advised, \u201cand get permission to print their recipes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Emma said, although she had the feeling this might be no small task. A niggling doubt took root and she shot a look at the pilot. \u201cI assume all three finalists live in the Puget Sound area?\u201d Oliver was in the newspaper office for a reason; she could only pray it had nothing to do with fruitcake.</p><p>Walt shrugged. \u201cUnfortunately, only one lives in the area.\u201d He picked up a piece of paper. \u201cPeggy Lucas is from Friday Harbor in the San Juan Islands,\u201d he said, reading the name at the top of the list.</p><p>A ferry ride away, Emma thought. Not a problem. It would mean a whole day, but she\u2019d always enjoyed being on the water. And a ferry trip was definitely less dangerous than a plane ride.</p><p>\u201cEarleen Williams lives in Yakima,\u201d Walt continued. \u201cAnd Sophie McKay is from Colville. That\u2019s why I brought in Mr. Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>Emma peered over her shoulder at the flyboy with his faded leather jacket.</p><p>He winked at her, and she remembered his smile yesterday at the small airport. That I-know-something-you-don\u2019t smile. Now she understood.</p><p>A panicky feeling attacked her stomach. \u201cI can drive to Yakima. Colville, too...\u201d Emma choked out. She wasn\u2019t sure where Colville was. Someplace near Spokane, part of the Inland Empire, she guessed. She wanted to make it clear that she had no objection to traveling by car. It would be a piece of cake. Fruitcake.</p><p>\u201cA woman alone on the road in the middle of winter is asking for trouble,\u201d Oliver said solemnly, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, do you?\u201d While the question was directed at Walt, he looked at Emma. His cocky grin was almost more than she could bear. He knew. He\u2019d known from the moment she\u2019d refused to fly with him, and now he was purposely placing her in an impossible position.</p><p>Emma glared at him. Hamilton made it sound as if she were risking certain death by driving across the state. Okay, so she\u2019d need to travel over Snoqualmie Pass, which could be tricky in winter. The pass was sometimes closed because of avalanche danger. And snow posed a minor problem. She\u2019d have to put chains on her tires. Well, she\u2019d face that if the need arose. In all likelihood it wouldn\u2019t. The interstate was kept as hazard-free as possible; the roads were salted and plowed at frequent intervals.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to see you in that kind of situation,\u201d Walt agreed with Oliver. \u201cIn addition to the risk of traveling alone, there\u2019s the added expense of putting you up in hotel rooms for a couple of nights, plus meals and mileage. This works out better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat works out?\u201d Emma turned from one man to the other. It was as if she\u2019d missed part of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re giving advertising space to Hamilton Air Service and in return, he\u2019ll fly you out to interview these three women.\u201d</p><p>For one crazy moment Emma couldn\u2019t talk at all. \u201cYou...want me to fly in that...little plane...with him?\u201d she finally stammered. The last two words were more breath than sound. If she started to think about being stuck in a small plane, she might hyperventilate right then and there.</p><p>Walt nodded. He seemed to think it was a perfectly reasonable idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a flight scheduled for Yakima first thing tomorrow morning,\u201d Oliver told her matter-of-factly. \u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem, will it?\u201d His smile seemed to taunt her.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been saying you wanted to write something other than obituaries, haven\u2019t you?\u201d This was from Walt.</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d she said, her throat tightening and nearly choking off the words. \u201cNo problem whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Oliver stood. \u201cBe down at the airstrip tomorrow morning at seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d Her legs had apparently turned to pudding, but she managed to stand, too. Smiling shakily, she left the office. As she headed down to her desk, Emma looked over her shoulder to see Walt and Oliver shaking hands.</p><p>Phoebe was waiting for her in The Dungeon. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked eagerly.</p><p>Emma ignored the question and walked directly over to her chair, where she collapsed. Life had taken on a sense of unreality. She felt as if she were watching a silent movie flicker across a screen, the actors\u2019 movements jerky and abrupt.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me?\u201d Phoebe stared at Emma and gasped. \u201cYou quit, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Emma shook her head. \u201cI got an assignment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Phoebe hesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...think so. Only...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly it looks like you\u2019re going to be writing the obituaries on your own for a while.\u201d</p> <p>Phoebe gave her a puzzled smile. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I already told you I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but I have a feeling that the next one you write just might be mine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The first thing Emma did when she got home from the newspaper office that evening was check her medicine cabinet. Her relief knew no bounds when she found six tablets rattling around in the dark-brown prescription bottle. A few months earlier, she\u2019d twisted her knee playing volleyball. Phoebe had conned her into joining a league, but that was another story entirely. The attending physician in the urgent-care facility had given her a powerful muscle relaxant. Her knee had continued to hurt, as Emma vividly recalled, but thirty minutes after she\u2019d swallowed the capsule, she couldn\u2019t have cared less. All was right with the world\u2014for a couple of hours, anyway.</p><p>Knowing how potent those pills were, she\u2019d hoarded them for a situation such as the one she now faced with Oliver Hamilton. For the sake of her career she\u2019d accompany him in his scary little plane, but it went without saying that Emma would need help of the medicinal variety. If she was going to be flying with Oliver Hamilton she had to have something to numb her overwhelming fear at the prospect of getting into that plane. She clutched the bottle and took a deep breath. For the sake of her craft and her career, she\u2019d do it.</p> <p>Emma simply couldn\u2019t survive the trip without those pills. One tablet to get her to Yakima and another to get her home. That left four, exactly the number she needed for the two additional trips.</p><p>Thankfully, Phoebe had agreed to drive her to the airport and then pick her up at the end of the day. Emma was grateful\u2014more than grateful. Once she\u2019d taken the muscle relaxant, she\u2019d be in no condition to drive.</p><p>At six-thirty the next morning, Phoebe pulled up in front of the apartment complex. Carrying her traveling coffee mug, along with her leather briefcase, Emma hurried out her door to meet her friend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you look nice,\u201d her landlord said, startling her. She was sure that was a smirk on his face.</p><p>Under normal circumstances Emma would\u2019ve taken offense, but in her present state of mind all she could do was smile wanly.</p><p>Mr. Scott leaned against his door, this morning\u2019s Examiner in his hand. He was middle-aged with a beer belly and a slovenly manner, and frankly, Emma was surprised to find him awake this early in the day. After moving into the apartment, she\u2019d stayed clear of her landlord, who seemed to be...well, the word sleazy came to mind. He didn\u2019t like animals, especially cats and dogs, and in her opinion that said a lot about his personality, all of it negative.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Scott,\u201d Emma greeted him, making a determined effort not to slur her words. The pill had already started to take effect and, despite the presence of the loathsome Bud Scott, the world had never seemed a brighter or more pleasant place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit nippy this morning, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Emma nodded, although if it was chilly she hadn\u2019t noticed. In her current haze nothing seemed hot or cold. From experience she knew that in three or four hours the pill would have lost most of its effect and she\u2019d be clear-headed enough for what she hoped would be an intelligent interview.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know anyone who needs an apartment,\u201d Bud Scott muttered. He narrowed his gaze as if he suspected she wasn\u2019t sober\u2014which was a bit much considering she rarely saw him without a can of Milwaukee\u2019s finest.</p><p>\u201cI thought every unit in the complex was rented,\u201d Emma said.</p><p>\u201cThe lady in 12B had a cat.\u201d He scowled as he spoke.</p><p>He\u2019d underlined the No Pets clause a number of times when Emma signed her rental agreement. Any infraction, he\u2019d informed her, would result in a one-week notice of eviction.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Murphy?\u201d Emma cried when she realized who lived in 12B, two doors down from her. The sweet older lady was a recent widow and missed her husband dreadfully. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have made an exception?\u201d she asked. \u201cMrs. Murphy is so lonely and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo exceptions,\u201d Mr. Scott growled. He shoved open his door and disappeared inside, grumbling under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d Phoebe asked when Emma got into the car.</p><p>\u201cHe is truly a lower life-form,\u201d she declared righteously. \u201cDoesn\u2019t possess an ounce of compassion.\u201d She stumbled a bit on the last word.</p><p>Phoebe gave her an odd look. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Emma smothered a yawn and then giggled.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Phoebe asked, eyeing her suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cRemember the pain pills I got last August?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones that made you so...weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t weird. I was happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you took one this morning!\u201d</p><p>In response Emma giggled again. \u201cJust one. I need it for the plane ride. Can\u2019t leave home without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma, you\u2019re supposed to be doing an interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...The pill will wear off by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine. Really, I am.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe didn\u2019t look as if she believed her. When she stopped at a traffic signal, she cast Emma another worried glance. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re doing the right thing?\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded. All at once she felt incredibly tired. Closing her eyes, she leaned her head against the passenger window. In her dreamlike state, she viewed a long line of circus animals parading down to Bud Scott\u2019s office and protesting on behalf of Mrs. Murphy. The vision of elephants carrying placards and lions ready to rip out his throat faded and Emma worked hard to focus her thoughts on the upcoming interview. Fruitcake. Good grief, she hated fruitcake. She wanted nothing to do with it.</p><p>Yesterday, once she\u2019d received her assignment, Emma had phoned Earleen Williams, the Yakima finalist, who was a retired bartender. Earleen had seemed flustered but pleased at the attention. Emma had made an appointment to talk with her late this morning. She\u2019d spent much of the night reviewing her questions when she should\u2019ve been sleeping. No wonder she was exhausted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at the airport,\u201d Phoebe announced.</p><p>Emma stirred. It required tremendous effort to lift her head from the passenger window. Stretching her arms, she yawned loudly. The temptation to sleep was almost irresistible, especially when she realized that all too soon she\u2019d be suspended thousands of feet above the ground.</p><p>\u201cFlying isn\u2019t so bad, you know,\u201d Phoebe said in a blatant effort to encourage her.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever flown in a small plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t want to hear it. See you back here tonight,\u201d Emma murmured, hoping to boost her own confidence. People went up in small planes every day. It couldn\u2019t be as terrifying as she believed. But this wasn\u2019t necessarily a rational fear\u2014or not completely, anyway. It didn\u2019t matter, though; fear was still fear, whatever its cause. She reminded herself that in a few days she\u2019d be able to laugh about this. Besides, writers across the centuries had made sacrifices for their art, and being bounced around in a tin can with wings would be hers. By the end of this fruitcake series, she might even have conquered her terror. Even if she hadn\u2019t, she\u2019d never let Hamilton know.</p><p>Oliver and his dog were walking around the outside of the aircraft, inspecting it, when she approached, briefcase in hand.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked, barely looking in her direction.</p><p>\u201cAh...don\u2019t you want to wait until the sun is up?\u201d she asked. She hoped to delay this as long as possible. The pill needed to be at the height of its effectiveness before she\u2019d find the courage to actually climb inside the aircraft.</p><p>\u201cLight, dark, it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d He walked toward the wing and tested the flap by manually moving it up and down.</p><p>\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a problem with the flaps, has there?\u201d she asked, following close behind him. Too bad he was so attractive, Emma mused. In another time and place...She halted her thoughts immediately. This man was dangerous and in more ways than the obvious. First, he was intent on putting her at mortal risk, and second...Well, she couldn\u2019t think of a second reason, but the first one was enough.</p><p>No, wait\u2014now she remembered. Since he was a good-looking, bad-boy type, she probably wasn\u2019t the only woman attracted to him. Tall, dark, handsome and reckless, to boot. Men like Oliver Hamilton drew women in droves and always had. He was far too reminiscent of her father, and she wasn\u2019t interested. Emma preferred quiet, serious men over the flamboyant ones who thought nothing of attempting ridiculous, hazardous stunts like flying small rattletrap planes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about the flaps?\u201d he asked, and seemed to find humor in her question.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t they been working properly?\u201d While Emma actually had no idea what function the flaps played in keeping an airplane aloft, she was sure it must be significant.</p><p>Something in her voice\u2014perhaps a slight drawl she could hear herself\u2014must have betrayed her because Oliver turned and gave her his full attention. Frowning, he asked, \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis early in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she returned with an edge of defiance. \u201cI don\u2019t drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver?\u201d His eyebrows rose as if he doubted her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI do on occasion, but I don\u2019t make a habit of it.\u201d</p><p>His dog sneezed, spraying her pant leg. This was her best pair of wool pants and she wasn\u2019t keen on showing up for the interview with one leg peppered with dubious-looking stains. Oscar sneezed again and again in quick succession, but at least she had the wherewithal to leap back. \u201cYuck!\u201d she muttered. \u201cOh, yuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to be wearing perfume, would you?\u201d Oliver demanded in a voice that suggested she was attempting to carry an illegal weapon on board.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I am. Most women do.\u201d</p><p>He grumbled some remark she didn\u2019t hear, then added, \u201cOscar\u2019s allergic to perfume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve told me that before now,\u201d she said, wiping her pant leg a second time. Thank goodness she\u2019d brought gloves. And thank goodness they were washable.</p><p>He raised his shoulder in a nonchalant fashion. \u201cProbably should have. It slipped my mind.\u201d He continued his outside inspection of the plane. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said, testing the flap on the opposite wing, \u201cI need to know how much you weigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d There were certain things a man didn\u2019t ask a woman and this was one of them.</p><p>\u201cYour weight,\u201d he said matter-of-factly.</p><p>Despite her drug-induced state of relaxation, Emma stiffened. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cListen, Emma, it\u2019s important. I\u2019m loaded to the gills with furnace parts. I have to know how much you weigh in order to calculate the amount of fuel we\u2019re going to need.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cYou expect me just to blurt it out?\u201d A woman didn\u2019t tell a man anything that personal, especially a man she barely knew and had no intention of knowing further.</p><p>\u201cIf I miscalculate, we\u2019ll crash and burn,\u201d Oliver said, apparently assuming this would persuade her to confess.</p><p>She glared at him in an effort to come up with a compromise. With her mind this fuzzy, it was difficult. \u201cI\u2019ll write it down.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Emma set her briefcase on the floor inside the plane and extracted a pencil and small pad. The only time she weighed herself was when she suspected her weight had fallen. She certainly wasn\u2019t overweight, but a desk job had done little to help her maintain the figure she\u2019d been proud of back in college. A few pounds had crept on over the last five years. She penciled in her most recent known weight, according to a doctor\u2019s visit last year, and then quickly erased it. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, she subtracted ten pounds. At one point in the not-so-distant past, she\u2019d weighed exactly that and she would again, once she got started with an exercise program.</p><p>Tearing the sheet from the pad, she folded it in fourths and then eighths until it was about the size of her thumbnail.</p><p>Oliver was waiting for her when she\u2019d finished. He held out his hand.</p><p>Emma was about to give him the folded-up paper, but paused. \u201cSwear to me you\u2019ll never divulge this number.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned, increasing his cuteness a hundredfold. \u201cThis is a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she countered, \u201cI\u2019m totally serious.\u201d</p><p>He grunted yet another comment she didn\u2019t understand and grabbed what now resembled a paper pellet. \u201cI can see this is going to be a hell of a flight.\u201d</p><p>Oliver stepped away, and Emma didn\u2019t see where he went, but he came back a few moments later. He casually told her it was time to board. She stood outside the aircraft as long as she dared, summoning her courage. Maybe she should\u2019ve swallowed two tablets for this first flight.</p><p>Oscar was already aboard, curled up in his dog bed behind the passenger seat. He cocked his head as if to say he couldn\u2019t understand what she was waiting for.</p><p>\u201cYou got lead in your butt or what?\u201d Oliver said from behind her.</p> <p>With no excuse to delay the inevitable, she hoisted herself into the plane and then, doubling over, worked her way forward into the cramped passenger seat. Her knees shook and her hands trembled as she reached for the safety belt and snapped it in place, pulling at the strap until it was so tight she could scarcely breathe.</p><p>Oscar poked his head between Oliver\u2019s seat and Emma\u2019s, and she was left with the distinct impression that she\u2019d taken the dog\u2019s place. Great, just great. She\u2019d arrive for her first interview with her backside covered in dog hair.</p><p>Oliver handed her an extra set of earphones and pantomimed that she should put them on. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She forced herself to nod.</p><p>He spoke to someone over the radio in a language she didn\u2019t understand, one that consisted solely of letters and numbers. A couple of minutes later, he taxied to the end of the runway. And stopped there.</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t know what that was about but regardless of the reason, she was grateful for a moment\u2019s reprieve. Her head pounded and her heart felt like it was going to explode inside her chest.</p><p>Oliver revved the engine, which fired to life with an ear-splitting noise. The plane bucked as if straining against invisible ropes.</p><p>Despite her relaxation pill, Emma gasped and grabbed hold of the bar across the top of the passenger door. She clutched it so hard she was convinced her fingerprints would be embedded in the steel.</p> <p>Without showing a bit of concern for her well-being, Oliver released the brake and the plane leaped forward, roaring down the runway. Emma slammed her eyes shut, preferring not to look. She held her breath, awaiting the sensation of the wheels lifting off the tarmac.</p><p>For the longest time nothing happened. She opened her eyes just enough to peek and realized they were almost at the end of the runway. Despite the speed of the aircraft they remained on the ground. In a few seconds of sheer terror, Emma realized why.</p><p>She\u2019d lied about her weight.</p><p>Hamilton had miscalculated the weight on board. In her vanity, she\u2019d shaved ten pounds\u2014well, maybe fifteen\u2014off the truth. Because of that, she was about to kill them both.</p><p>Unable to restrain herself, Emma dragged in a deep breath and screamed out in panic, \u201cI lied! I lied!\u201d</p><p>No sooner had the words left her mouth than the plane sailed effortlessly into the sky.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Fruitcakes are like in-laws. They show up at the holidays. You have no idea who sent them, how old they are, or how long they\u2019ll be hanging around your kitchen.</p><p>\u2014Josh Sens, freelance writer in Oakland,</p><p>California, and food critic for San Francisco magazine</p><p>The fear dissipated after takeoff. Emma kept her eyes focused directly in front of her, gazing out at the cloud-streaked sky. For the first while her heart seemed intent on beating its way out of her body, but after a few minutes the tension began to leave.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the loud roar of the single engine lulled her into a sense of peace. No doubt that was due to the pill, which was exactly the reason she\u2019d taken it. When she did find the courage to turn her head and look out the side window, she found herself staring Mt. Rainier in the face. She was so close that it was possible to see a crevasse, a giant crack in a glacier. Had there been hikers, she would\u2019ve been able to wave.</p><p>Gasping, she shut her eyes and silently repeated the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Talk about spiritual renewal! All that was necessary to get her nearer to God was a short flight with Oliver Hamilton.</p><p>Forty minutes later as they approached the Yakima airport, Oliver made a wide sweeping turn with a gradual drop in altitude. Emma felt the plane descend and nearly swallowed her tongue as she reached for the bar above the side window again, holding on for dear life.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Oliver asked when he noticed how she clung to the bar with both hands.</p><p>How kind of him to inquire now. These were the first words he\u2019d spoken to her during the entire flight. He\u2019d glanced at her a number of times, as if to check up on her, and whenever he did, he started to laugh. She failed to understand what was so funny.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said with as much dignity as she could. A little the worse for wear, but okay, she mentally assured herself. Her head was beginning to clear.</p><p>She felt every air pocket and bump as the plane drew closer to the long runway. When the wheels bounced against the tarmac, Emma was ready for the solid thump of the tires hitting concrete, but the landing was surprisingly smooth. She slowly released a sigh of pent-up tension; she\u2019d lied about her weight and lived to tell the tale. Now all she had to do was make it through this interview and find something noteworthy about Earleen Williams and her fruitcake recipe.</p><p>Oliver taxied the plane off the runway. He cut the engine and as the blades slowed, he unbuckled his seat belt and picked up his clipboard.</p><p>Emma was just starting to breathe normally again when Oscar sneezed.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to leave the perfume behind for the next flight,\u201d Oliver said matter-of-factly.</p><p>Emma wiped her cheek although most of the spray had been directed elsewhere. She resisted the urge to tell Oliver he could leave his dog behind, too. At this point, she didn\u2019t want to risk offending the pilot\u2014or his dog. And, she supposed, it wasn\u2019t really Oscar\u2019s fault....</p><p>Crawling behind her, Oliver opened the door and climbed onto the airfield. Emma followed, bent double as she made her way out of the aircraft, feeling a sense of great relief. He offered her his hand as she hopped down. She was hit by a blast of cold air, which she ignored. Staring down at the ground, she was tempted to fall on all fours and kiss the tarmac.</p><p>A white van bearing the name of a local furnace company pulled up to the plane. Oliver spoke briefly with the driver, then walked over to where Emma stood.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think the interview will take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Emma didn\u2019t know what to tell him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>He stared out toward the Cascade Mountains, only partially visible in the distance. \u201cWe\u2019ve got bad weather rolling in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad weather? How bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d How could he say such a thing and then expect her not to worry? She was already half-panicked about the return flight and he\u2019d just added to her fears.</p><p>\u201cDo what you have to do and then get back here. I want to take off as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She glanced around and felt a sense of dread.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t have any way of getting to Earleen\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Hamilton said, walking to the other side of the plane.</p><p>Emma assumed he was going to ask the guy in the van to give her a ride, but that turned out not to be the case. He climbed back inside the Cessna and returned a moment later with a large leather satchel.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA foldable bike.\u201d</p><p>Emma watched as he unzipped the bag and produced the smallest bicycle she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cYou don\u2019t honestly expect me to ride this...thing, do you?\u201d The wheels were no more than twelve inches around. She\u2019d look utterly ridiculous. Nervous as she was about this first interview, she hoped to make up in professionalism what she lacked in experience.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll phone for a taxi.\u201d It went without saying that the newspaper wouldn\u2019t reimburse her, but she absolutely refused to arrive pedaling a bicycle Oliver Hamilton must have purchased from a Barnum and Bailey rummage sale.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Oliver barked, clearly upset. He walked over to the van this time and spoke to the driver. The two had a short conversation before Oliver glanced over his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s the address you have to get to?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Fumbling to find the slip of paper inside her briefcase, Emma read off the street name.</p><p>\u201cShe can tag along with me,\u201d the driver said.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Oliver flashed the other man an easy smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much,\u201d Emma murmured, grateful to have saved the taxi fare. She hurried around to the passenger side and opened the door. One look inside, and Emma nearly changed her mind. The van, which must\u2019ve been at least ten years old, had obviously never been cleaned. The passenger seat was badly stained and littered with leftover fast-food containers, plus half-eaten burgers and rock-hard French fries. A clipboard was attached by a magnet to the dashboard and several papers had fallen to the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou getting in or not?\u201d the driver asked.</p><p>\u201cIn.\u201d Emma made her decision quickly and hopped inside the van. She could just imagine what Walt would say if she announced that she\u2019d missed the interview because she refused to get inside a messy vehicle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Earleen Williams lived on a street called Garden Park in a brick duplex. The van dropped Emma off and drove away before she had time to thank the driver. He was apparently glad to be rid of her and she was equally thankful to have survived the ride. She\u2019d worry later about getting back to the airfield.</p><p>Straightening her shoulders, Emma did a quick mental survey of her questions. She\u2019d reviewed her class notes about interviews and remembered that the most important thing to do was engage Earleen in conversation and establish a rapport. It would be detrimental to the interview if Emma gave even the slightest appearance of nervousness.</p><p>Emma so much wanted this to go well. She didn\u2019t have a slant for the story yet and wouldn\u2019t until she\u2019d met Earleen. If she tried to think about what she could possibly write on the subject of fruitcake, it would only traumatize her.</p><p>Knowing Oliver was probably pacing the pilots\u2019 lounge, Emma walked onto the porch and pressed the doorbell. She stepped back and waited.</p> <p>\u201cOh, hi.\u201d The petite brunette who answered the door couldn\u2019t have been more than five feet tall, if that, and seemed to be around sixty. It was difficult to tell. One thing Emma did conclude\u2014Earleen wasn\u2019t at all what she\u2019d expected. She wore a turquoise blazer and black pleated pants with a large gold belt and rings on every finger. Big rings.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Earleen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She unlatched the screen door and held it open for Emma. \u201cYou must be that Seattle reporter who phoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma Collins,\u201d she said and held out her hand. \u201cActually, I\u2019m from Puyallup, which is outside Seattle.\u201d There was a difference of at least a quarter-million readers between the Seattle Times and The Examiner\u2014maybe more. The Seattle Times hadn\u2019t sent her a circulation report lately.</p><p>\u201cCome on inside. I\u2019ve got coffee brewing,\u201d Earleen said, smiling self-consciously. \u201cThis is the first time anyone\u2019s ever wanted to interview me.\u201d</p> <p>They had a lot in common, because this was Emma\u2019s first interview, too, although she wasn\u2019t about to mention that.</p><p>Earleen looked past her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring a photographer with you?\u201d</p><p>Actually she had. Emma would be performing both roles. \u201cIf it\u2019s all right, I\u2019ll take your picture later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, that\u2019s fine.\u201d Earleen touched the side of her head with her palm as if to be sure every hair was neatly in place, which it was. She smelled wonderful, too. Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Beautiful, if Emma guessed correctly. Just as well Oscar wasn\u2019t around or he\u2019d be sneezing on her pant leg.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d talk in the kitchen, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Earleen said as she led the way. \u201cMost folks like my kitchen best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWherever you\u2019re most comfortable,\u201d Emma murmured, following the older woman. She gazed around as she walked through the house and noticed a small collection of owl figurines lined up on the fireplace mantel, among the boughs of greenery. The Christmas tree in the corner was enormous, and it had an owl\u2014yes, an owl\u2014on top.</p> <p>The kitchen was bright and roomy. There was a square table next to a window that overlooked the backyard, where a circular clothesline sat off to one side and a toolshed on the other. A six-foot redwood fence separated her yard from the neighbors\u2019.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Earleen said and motioned to the table and chairs. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone for me, thanks.\u201d After the pill she\u2019d taken earlier, Emma didn\u2019t think she should add caffeine, afraid of the effect on her stomach\u2014and her brain. She took out her reporter\u2019s pad and flipped it open. \u201cWhen did you first hear the news that your recipe had been chosen as a national finalist?\u201d</p><p>Earleen poured herself a mug of coffee and carried it to the table, then pulled out a chair and sat across from Emma. \u201cThree weeks ago. The notification came by mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny reason you weren\u2019t surprised?\u201d</p><p>Earleen blushed. \u201cI know I make a good fruitcake. I\u2019ve been baking them for a lot of years now.\u201d</p> <p>Emma could see this wasn\u2019t going to be as easy as she\u2019d hoped. Earleen wasn\u2019t much of a talker.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a secret ingredient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. I have two.\u201d</p><p>Emma made a notation just so Earleen would recognize that she was paying attention. \u201cWould you be willing to divulge them to our readers?\u201d</p><p>Earleen rested her elbows on the table and held the mug with both hands. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you, but maybe it\u2019d be better if I showed you.\u201d</p><p>Emma frowned slightly when the other woman rose from the table. She dragged out a step stool, placed it in front of the refrigerator and climbed the two steps. Then she stretched until she could reach the cupboard above the fridge and opened it. Standing on the tips of her toes, Earleen brought down a bottle of rum and a bottle of brandy.</p><p>\u201cYour secret is...alcohol?\u201d</p><p>Earleen climbed off the step stool and nodded. \u201cOne of my secrets. I didn\u2019t work all those years at The Drunken Owl for nothing. I serve a mighty fine mincemeat pie, too. That recipe came from my mother, God rest her soul. Mom always started with fresh suet. She got it from Kloster\u2019s Butcher Shop. When I was in high school, I had the biggest crush on Tim Kloster. My friends used to say I had Kloster-phobia.\u201d She giggled nervously.</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to point out that \u201cphobia\u201d was technically the wrong term. She hesitated, unsure how this interview had gotten away from her so quickly. \u201cAbout the fruitcake...Did that recipe come from your mother, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. Mom was raised during the Great Depression, and her recipe didn\u2019t call for much more than the basics. Over the years I started adding to it, and being from Yakima, I naturally included apples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApples,\u201d Emma repeated and jotted that down.</p><p>\u201cActually, I cook them until it\u2019s more like applesauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Having lived in Washington for only the last eight months, Emma wasn\u2019t all that familiar with the state. She knew more about the western half because she lived in that area. Most of the eastern side remained a complete mystery.</p><p>Come to think of it, as Oliver landed she\u2019d noticed that there seemed to be orchards near the airport. Distracted as she\u2019d been, it was nothing short of astounding that she\u2019d remembered.</p><p>\u201cYakima is known for apples, right?\u201d she ventured.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. More than half of all the apples grown in the United States come from orchards in Yakima and Wenatchee.\u201d</p><p>Emma made a note. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most popular variety is the Red Delicious. Personally, I prefer Golden Delicious. They\u2019re the kind I use in my fruitcake.\u201d</p><p>Emma held her breath. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll agree to share the recipe with The Examiner\u2019s readers.\u201d</p><p>Earleen beamed proudly. \u201cIt would be my honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the liquor and the apples are your two secret ingredients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Earleen said in a solemn voice. \u201cBut far more important is using only the freshest of ingredients. It took me several tries to figure that out.\u201d</p><p>Emma was tempted to remind her that one of the main ingredients in fruitcake was dried fruit. There wasn\u2019t anything fresh about that. But again she managed to keep her mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been baking fruitcakes?\u201d Emma asked next.</p><p>\u201cQuite a few years. I started in\u2014way back now. You see, I was going through a rough patch at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Emma hated to pry, but she was a reporter and she had a feeling she\u2019d hit upon the key element of her article.</p><p>\u201cLarry and I had just split, and I have to tell you I took it hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Larry is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>Emma couldn\u2019t help observing that Earleen seemed more of a conversationalist when she stood on the other side of the kitchen counter. The closer she got to the table, the briefer her answers were. Emma speculated that was because of Earleen\u2019s many years behind a bar. She\u2019d always heard that bartenders spent a lot of time listening and advising\u2014like paid friends. Or psychiatrists.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I ever tried Mom\u2019s fruitcake recipe was after Larry moved out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Have you ever been married?\u201d Earleen asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d The sorry state of her love life was not a subject Emma wanted to discuss.</p><p>\u201cLarry and I were high-school sweethearts. He went to fight in Vietnam and when he got back, we had a big wedding. It was the type of wedding girls dream about. Wait here a minute,\u201d she said and bustled out of the kitchen.</p><p>In a couple of minutes, she returned with her wedding photograph. A radiantly happy bride smiled into the camera, her white dress fashioned in layers of taffeta and lace. The young soldier at her side was more difficult to read.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, Larry had a weakness for other women,\u201d Earleen said sadly.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Larry? Since 1984.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been married more than once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll my husbands were versions of Larry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t learn from my mistakes.\u201d Earleen turned away. Then, obviously changing the subject, she said, \u201cI imagine you\u2019ll want to sample my fruitcake.\u201d She slid open the bread box and took out an aluminum-foil-wrapped loaf. \u201cHave you noticed that people either love fruitcake or hate it?\u201d she said companionably. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any middle ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat...seems to be true,\u201d Emma agreed.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I started baking after Larry left,\u201d she said, busily peeling away the cheesecloth from the loaf-size fruitcake. \u201cI\u2019d never suffered that kind of pain before. I figured if you\u2019ve ever been divorced you\u2019d know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Emma was confused. \u201cI don\u2019t exactly think of fruitcake as comfort food.\u201d</p><p>Earleen shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t eat it. I baked it. Loaf after loaf for weeks on end. I was determined to bake the perfect fruitcake and I didn\u2019t care how long it took. I must\u2019ve changed that recipe a hundred times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy fruitcake?\u201d</p><p>She paused as if she\u2019d never put it into words. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I guess I was looking for the happiness I always felt as a kid at Christmastime.\u201d</p><p>There it was again, Emma mused. Christmas. It did people in emotionally, and she wasn\u2019t going to allow that to happen, not to her. She found it easy enough to ignore Christmas; other people should give it a try. She might even see if Walt would let her write an article about her feelings. Emma believed she wasn\u2019t alone in disliking all the hype that surrounded Christmas.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was with Larry and my two other husbands, I felt there must be something lacking in me,\u201d Earleen continued. \u201cNow I don\u2019t think so anymore. Time will do that, you know?\u201d She glanced at Emma. \u201cAs young as you are, you probably don\u2019t have that much perspective.\u201d Earleen paused and drew in a deep breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma stopped taking notes. She suspected this was it; she was about to get to the real core of the interview.</p><p>\u201cBy the time Larry and I split up, both my parents were gone, so I was pretty much on my own. I realize now that I was searching for a way to deal with the pain, although God knows the marriage was dead. That\u2019s where the fruitcake came in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe comfort factor,\u201d Emma said with a nod. \u201cHow long were you and Larry together?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSixteen years. It\u2019s a shame, you know. We never had kids and it was real lonely after he left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Secretly Emma hoped he was miserable. In some ways Earleen reminded Emma of her mother.</p><p>The woman sighed. \u201cLarry married the floozy he\u2019d taken up with, and the two of them got drunk every night. It only took him a few years to drink himself to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sad,\u201d Emma said, and she meant it.</p><p>Earleen shrugged. \u201cI was single for nearly ten years. I thought I\u2019d learned my lesson about marrying the wrong man, but obviously I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other two husbands?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMorrie courted me for a long time before I agreed to marry him. He didn\u2019t have a roving eye so much as he did a weakness for the bottle.\u201d She paused. \u201cOf course, Larry had both. The thing is, and you remember this, young lady, you don\u2019t meet the cream of the eligible-bachelor crop working in a tavern.\u201d</p><p>Emma scribbled that down so Earleen would think she\u2019d given due consideration to her words.</p><p>\u201cMorrie died of cancer a couple of years after we were married.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI never should\u2019ve married Paul after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with Paul?\u201d</p><p>A dreamy expression came over her. \u201cPaul looked so much like Larry they could\u2019ve been brothers. Unfortunately, looks weren\u2019t the only trait they shared. We were married only a year when he suffered a massive stroke. He had a girlfriend on the side but he really loved my fruitcake. I think if Larry had lived, he would have, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have anyone to share your good news with?\u201d Emma asked. \u201cAbout being a finalist?\u201d</p> <p>Earleen shrugged again. \u201cNot really, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it matters,\u201d Emma insisted. \u201cYour recipe was one of only twelve chosen from across the entire United States. You should be kicking up your heels and celebrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will with friends, I suppose.\u201d Earleen opened her cutlery drawer for a knife and sliced through the loaf. \u201cIt\u2019s time I started baking again,\u201d she said. \u201cThis close to Christmas, I\u2019ll bake my mincemeat pies. People are already asking about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you bake your fruitcakes?\u201d</p><p>Earleen sipped her coffee, her fingers sparkling in the light. All ten of them. \u201cI usually bake up a batch every October and let it set a good two months before I serve it. The longer I give the alcohol to work, the better. Then, before Easter, I bake another version that\u2019s similar but without the dried fruit.\u201d Earleen moved the slice onto a plate and brought it over for Emma to taste.</p><p>Although she wasn\u2019t a fan of fruitcake, Emma decided it would be impolite to refuse. Earleen watched and waited.</p><p>Emma used her fork to break off a small piece and saw that it was chock-full of the dried fruit to which she objected most. She glanced up at the older woman with a quick smile. Then she carefully put the fruitcake in her mouth\u2014and was shocked by how good it tasted. The cake was flavorful, moist and pungent with the scent of liquor. The blend of fruit, nuts, applesauce and alcohol was divine. There was no other word to describe Earleen\u2019s fruitcake.</p><p>\u201cYou like it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d Emma assured her, trying not to sound shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s excellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Larry would\u2019ve thought so, too,\u201d Earleen said wistfully. \u201cEven if he\u2019s the reason I started baking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still love him, don\u2019t you?\u201d It seemed so obvious to Emma. Although she\u2019d married twice more, Earleen Williams\u2019s heart belonged to a man who hadn\u2019t valued her. Her mother had been the same; Pamela Collins had loved her ex-husband to her dying day. Emma\u2019s father had never appreciated what a wonderful woman she was. For that sin alone, Emma wanted nothing more to do with him. He\u2019d been a token husband the same way he\u2019d been a token father.</p><p>When she spoke, Earleen\u2019s voice was resigned. \u201cI\u2019ve been over Larry for a long time,\u201d she explained. \u201cMuch as I loved him, all I can say is that it\u2019s a good thing he left when he did. Larry was trouble. More trouble than I knew what to do with.\u201d</p><p>More trouble than Earleen deserved, Emma reflected.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I can tell you?\u201d Earleen asked. She seemed eager to finish the interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to talk so much about my past. I never could figure out men\u2014but I know a whole lot about fruitcake.\u201d</p><p>Emma scanned her notes. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got everything I need for now.\u201d</p><p>After snapping a picture of Earleen and collecting the recipe, she asked, \u201cCan I call you later if I have any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Since I retired from The Drunken Owl, I\u2019m here most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I used your phone book?\u201d Emma stood and gathered up her things. \u201cI want to call a taxi to take me back to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that.\u201d Earleen shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you. It\u2019s not far and I have errands I need to run, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Emma smiled her gratitude. She already knew that Walt wasn\u2019t going to reimburse her for any taxi fare, and it was too close to the end of the month for unnecessary spending on her part.</p><p>Earleen backed her twenty-year-old Subaru out of the garage and Emma got inside. The contrast between the interior of Earleen\u2019s vehicle and the furnace company van was noteworthy in itself.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Earleen dropped Emma at the airport and after a few words of farewell, drove off.</p><p>As soon as Emma climbed out of the Subaru, Oliver came from the building next to the hangar, with Oscar trotting behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded absently, wondering how to structure her article on Earleen. Start with her childhood or her wedding or\u2014</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d he asked, interrupting her thoughts.</p><p>She stared at him, eyes narrowed. \u201cIn case you didn\u2019t know it, men can be real scum.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, Oliver grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have even more reason to think so when you hear what I\u2019ve got to say.\u201d</p><p>This didn\u2019t sound promising. \u201cYou\u2019d better tell me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Oliver buried his hands in his pockets. \u201cBlame me if you want, but it won\u2019t make any difference. We\u2019re grounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrounded?\u201d She blinked. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re grounded,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBecause of the weather. We\u2019re stuck in Yakima.\u201d</p><p>Earleen\u2019s Masterpiece Fruitcake</p><p>2 cups sugar</p><p>1 cup butter</p><p>2 1\u20442 cups applesauce</p><p>2 eggs, beaten</p><p>2 cups raisins</p><p>2 cups walnuts, chopped</p><p>4 cups flour</p><p>1 tsp. salt</p><p>1 tbsp. soda</p><p>1 tsp. baking powder</p><p>1 tsp. cloves</p><p>1 tsp. nutmeg</p><p>2 tsp. cinnamon</p><p>2 pounds candied dried fruit mix</p><p>1 1\u20442 cups chopped dates</p><p>Cream sugar and butter. Add beaten eggs and applesauce. Mix flour, salt, spices, soda and baking powder, then gradually add to other ingredients. Mix well. Blend in candied fruit, dates, raisins and nuts. Mixture will be stiff. Bake in 325-degree oven in two loaf pans for one hour.</p><p>Cool and remove fruitcake from pans. Cut a piece of cheesecloth to fit and soak in 1\u20442 cup rum or brandy. Pour any remaining alcohol over the fruitcake. Wrap fruitcake in cheesecloth and then cellophane, followed by aluminum foil. Store in refrigerator for up to three months.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad joke\u2014isn\u2019t it?\u201d Emma cried. \u201cOh, please tell me it\u2019s a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>From his darkening scowl, Emma could see he wasn\u2019t pleased about this turn of events, either. He\u2019d obviously enjoyed giving her the bad news but he wasn\u2019t grinning anymore. A delay probably affected his bottom line. Oscar sat down next to Oliver and stared up at him confidently. She\u2019d heard somewhere that a man was always a hero to his dog; that was certainly the case with poor deluded Oscar.</p><p>\u201cI mentioned the weather earlier, remember?\u201d Hamilton said.</p><p>Emma had forgotten that. Her afternoon muscle relaxant was ready to be swallowed, and she was glad she hadn\u2019t taken it yet. \u201cWhat are we supposed to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait it out. We could find ways to entertain ourselves.\u201d</p><p>This was exactly the kind of comment she expected from Flyboy. And was that a wink? \u201cIn your dreams,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any other brilliant suggestions?\u201d</p><p>Emma wished she did.</p><p>\u201cWe might be able to get out late this afternoon, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it.\u201d He raised his eyes to study the heavily clouded sky. \u201cThere\u2019s a snowstorm in the mountains and it\u2019s heading in our direction. The clouds don\u2019t concern me as much as the problem with icing.\u201d</p><p>Emma wasn\u2019t sure what that meant; she had her own problems. \u201cI\u2019ve got an article to write,\u201d she murmured, biting her lower lip. Walt had wanted the first piece written as quickly as possible. Earleen Williams had been a great interview, but Emma still hadn\u2019t decided exactly what slant she should take. She needed time to study her notes and think over their conversation.</p><p>Oliver nodded glumly. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m not thrilled about sitting around here all day, twiddling my thumbs.\u201d</p><p>Emma realized he could\u2019ve left after making his delivery if he hadn\u2019t been waiting for her. She felt bad about that. She\u2019d been less than gracious. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His voice was suspicious.</p><p>\u201cI was being friendly.\u201d She glanced across the street at a caf\u00e9. Several letters in the neon sign had burned out. It\u2019d once read MINNIE\u2019S PLACE but now said MI...CE. This wasn\u2019t exactly an enticement, but Emma\u2019s stomach was growling. It was past noon and all she\u2019d had to eat was a small slice of liquor-drenched\u2014and quite delicious\u2014fruitcake.</p><p>\u201cAre you offering to buy me lunch?\u201d</p><p>Emma mentally calculated how much cash she had with her. \u201cAll right, as long as you don\u2019t order anything over five dollars.\u201d</p><p>Oliver grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day I\u2019ll tell our children you asked me out first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more remark like that, and you can buy your own lunch.\u201d</p><p>Oliver chuckled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to be funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re half in love with me already.\u201d</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t dignify that with a reply. They started walking toward the caf\u00e9; Oscar trotted obediently beside them and seemed to know to wait by the restaurant door. Oliver patted his head and assured the terrier he\u2019d get any leftovers.</p><p>Emma resisted reminding Oliver that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to feed people food to a dog, but she doubted he\u2019d listen. If she had a dog, she\u2019d feed him only the highest-quality, veterinarian-approved dog food.</p><p>Once inside the caf\u00e9, they slid into a red vinyl booth, facing each other. Emma reached for the menu, which was tucked behind the napkin dispenser, and quickly decided on the ham-and-cheese omelet. Oliver ordered the club sandwich.</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you been flying?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Once again, he sounded suspicious. For heaven\u2019s sake, did the man have some big secret?</p><p>Emma sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It seemed like a good conversation starter, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in being interviewed,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cBesides, I have a couple of questions for you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the waitress who poured her coffee, then relaxed in the padded vinyl seat. \u201cWait a minute. You can ask me questions but I\u2019m not allowed to know anything about you? Is that fair?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFair doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m your ride home\u2014or I will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think I owe you for that? Oh, never mind,\u201d she said, suddenly tiring of the argument. \u201cAsk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with The Examiner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout eight months\u2014long enough to know I\u2019m tired of writing obituaries.\u201d</p><p>Oliver frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing Walt lets you write?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the most part. A month ago he let me cover the school board meeting.\u201d Emma had written what she thought was a masterful commentary on the events. Walt hadn\u2019t agreed, to put it mildly, and had rejected her article in scathing terms. He said she was trying too hard. People were looking for a clear, concise summary, not a chapter from War and Peace. \u201cWhat I want is a real story,\u201d she told Oliver in a fervent tone, \u201csomething I can really get my teeth into.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike fruitcake?\u201d Oliver said, teasing her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Once again, he was obviously trying to restrain a smile. \u201cWhat are you going to write about Earleen Williams?\u201d</p><p>Emma was mulling that over. \u201cI don\u2019t know for sure. She\u2019s a complex woman. She\u2019s had a number of difficult relationships with men, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t date much, do you?\u201d he broke in.</p><p>Emma stared at him. \u201cWho says?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhoebe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Phoebe?\u201d Either her friend had been holding out on her, or Oliver was lying. If Phoebe knew him, Emma was positive she would\u2019ve said so earlier.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of conversations about you,\u201d Oliver admitted, nimbly twirling the fork between his fingers.</p><p>Emma found the action highly irritating. Stretching across the table, she grabbed his wrist. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned; he seemed to do a lot of that around her. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep your hands off me, can you?\u201d</p><p>She toyed briefly with the idea of getting up and walking out. She would have, too, but their food hadn\u2019t been delivered yet. Her stomach won out over her pride.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know Phoebe and when did you talk to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met through...a friend of mine. Phoebe\u2019s a few years younger than me, but I\u2019ve seen her around town. No big deal.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI stopped in at the office after your visit to the airfield and asked about you. Casually, you know. Phoebe sang like a canary.\u201d</p><p>Emma refused to believe it. Phoebe had never mentioned this supposed conversation.</p><p>\u201cShe said the two of you were hired at the same time and that you kept pretty much to yourself. So what gives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s jaw sagged open. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of nerve!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are scum, remember?\u201d His eyes twinkled. \u201cSo tell me, what\u2019s happening in the men department?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m a serious writer\u2014well, maybe not yet, but I intend to become one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a \u2018serious\u2019 writer means you don\u2019t have time for relationships?\u201d</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t care for the direction this conversation was taking. \u201cAt present, no\u2014not that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always so nosy, or is this expressly for my benefit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d He picked up his fork and studied the tines with every appearance of interest.</p><p>To Emma\u2019s relief, their plates arrived just then. The waitress set the bill facedown in the middle of the table.</p><p>Emma spread the paper napkin across her lap, looked over her meal and lifted her fork. By the time she\u2019d taken two bites, Oliver had wolfed down half his sandwich. She glared at him disapprovingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, apparently perplexed.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, knowing it would do no good to explain.</p><p>He munched on a French fry, then glanced across the table at her. \u201cIf I asked you out on a date, would you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said without hesitation. She didn\u2019t mean to be rude but she could read him like a book. He was her father all over again. Besides, she wasn\u2019t much good at relationships.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Oliver pressed.</p><p>Emma groaned. \u201cListen, I\u2019m sure a lot of women would consider you charming\u2014\u201d she almost choked on the word \u201c\u2014and you\u2019re not unattractive...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you think I\u2019m cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she inserted quickly. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what I meant at all.\u201d The last thing she wanted was for Oliver to assume she was attracted to him. \u201cI like that you\u2019re kind to animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me.\u201d</p><p>Emma set her fork down, astonished at his audacity. \u201cI most certainly do not!\u201d</p><p>He cracked an even bigger smile. \u201cKeep telling yourself that, but I know otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is exactly what bothers me,\u201d she said, sighing heavily. \u201cYour arrogance is unbelievable. You assume that because you\u2019re reasonably good-looking, any woman would be grateful for the opportunity to date you. The fact is, it\u2019s simply not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dying to find out everything you can about me.\u201d</p><p>This time Emma laughed outright. She couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cYou\u2019re the one asking all the questions\u2014and making a lot of assumptions. I was making conversation. It seemed the polite thing to do, since we might end up spending the next few hours together.\u201d</p><p>Some women might find his smile sexy. Not Emma, of course, but others. She forced herself to look away, in case he misread her interest.</p><p>\u201cAll right then. What do you want to know about me?\u201d he asked, leaning forward.</p><p>Emma considered his question. Anything she asked him, Oliver was bound to interpret in such a way that it would seem she was falling head over heels in love with him. Really, his attitude bordered on the comical.</p><p>\u201cHow soon before we can fly out of here?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that until I get an updated weather report. Anything else you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Plenty, but she planned on asking Phoebe first. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>She sliced into her omelet and saw that he\u2019d already finished his sandwich. Only a handful of French fries remained.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to eat your toast?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head and slid the plate across the table.</p><p>Oliver took it, slipped out of the booth and headed outside to where Oscar waited. As soon as he left the caf\u00e9, Emma plucked her cell phone from her bag and pushed the button that speed-dialed the newspaper office. A moment later, she connected with Phoebe.</p><p>\u201cThis is Phoebe,\u201d her friend answered in her usual cheerful fashion.</p><p>\u201cWhen did Oliver Hamilton ask you about me?\u201d Emma demanded.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly who this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it the muscle relaxant has worn off?\u201d</p><p>So it was true. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Phoebe murmured, \u201cit was a short conversation. Two minutes, if that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew he was coming in to talk to Walt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Phoebe admitted. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll tell you. I was afraid that if I mentioned I\u2019d talked to Oliver, you\u2019d have all these questions about how I knew and I didn\u2019t want to get into that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Emma asked. It could only be one thing\u2014Phoebe was seeing Walt. Why she wanted to keep that a secret, Emma wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>When Phoebe answered, it was in a whisper. \u201cWalt and I are dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Even though she\u2019d already guessed, Emma was shocked. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d As soon as she asked the question, she knew. \u201cWalt doesn\u2019t want anyone at the office to find out.\u201d It explained a lot.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s good policy. I hated not telling anyone, especially you, but I...couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months.\u201d</p><p>Emma was stunned into silence. She couldn\u2019t believe that her best friend had managed to keep this from her for three months. Obviously, Phoebe wasn\u2019t as timid around Walt as she\u2019d seemed.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let him know that you know,\u201d Phoebe said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Emma blew out her breath. \u201cBut when I get back, I want you to tell me everything, understand?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe laughed softly. \u201cI\u2019ll make a full confession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, what do you know about Oliver Hamilton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that...he likes you. He specifically asked for an opportunity so the two of you could fly together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>Oliver had done that because he knew she was frightened to death to get into his little plane. The man was a sadist, and between them, her employer and her best friend had willingly handed her over.</p><p>\u201cHe told Walt you\u2019d done a wonderful job of selling him on advertising and he wanted to give the newspaper his business because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Walt that if I didn\u2019t get an assignment soon, I\u2019d quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let my best friend quit,\u201d Phoebe said\u2014although Emma noted that she hadn\u2019t really answered the question. \u201cNot if I could prevent it. Then Oliver showed up and, well, it was meant to be.\u201d</p><p>The truth was out. She\u2019d gotten this assignment thanks to her friend. Walt hadn\u2019t thought she was ready; he was just trying to keep Phoebe happy.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t like Oliver,\u201d Phoebe said.</p><p>Emma pinched her lips tightly together. \u201cOliver Hamilton is accustomed to women swooning over him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not like that,\u201d Phoebe protested.</p><p>Emma knew otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not upset with me, are you?\u201d</p><p>Emma considered the question. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf our situations were reversed, you\u2019d have done the same thing for me,\u201d Phoebe said. \u201cNow tell me what\u2019s going on in Yakima.\u201d</p><p>Emma looked out the window and noticed that Oliver had walked across the street, presumably to get an updated weather report. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019re stuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether?\u201d Phoebe asked with an inappropriate amount of amusement.</p><p>It figured she\u2019d see this unfortunate situation in a humorous light. \u201cFor now, and trust me, I\u2019m not happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be. Oliver and Walt get along really well. He\u2019s a cool guy.\u201d</p> <p>The problem was he knew it. Emma didn\u2019t bother to comment. She chatted with Phoebe a few minutes longer before ending the phone call.</p><p>The waitress refreshed Emma\u2019s coffee and took the money she\u2019d left on the table. While she waited for her change, she read over her notes from the interview with Earleen Williams. But it wasn\u2019t the older woman who dominated her thoughts, it was her own mother.</p><p>Pamela Collins had wanted the very best for her, Emma knew. What she could never understand was why her mother had stayed in the marriage as long as she had. From as early as Emma could remember, she\u2019d known her father was having affairs, betraying his wife and family. To this day, her father didn\u2019t get it. Her mother had been so forgiving; Emma wasn\u2019t. And she was too smart to be taken in by a man who had all her father\u2019s worst traits\u2014and all his appeal.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine what her mother would think of Oliver. No, she could imagine exactly. Her mother would think he was wonderful and treat him like a king, the same way she\u2019d done with Emma\u2019s father whenever he\u2019d seen fit to bless them with his presence.</p><p>The caf\u00e9 door opened and Oliver returned, his leather jacket splotched with damp. He walked across the room, sliding into the booth. He handed her a sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe weather report. You aren\u2019t going to like it.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s heart sank. \u201cHow long are we trapped here?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated as if weighing how much of the truth he should tell her. \u201cOvernight.\u201d</p><p>The word echoed in her brain. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you looked outside lately?\u201d</p><p>Emma hadn\u2019t. She stared out the window now. Thick flakes of snow drifted down; already the sidewalks were covered and the sky had grown darker. No wonder his coat was wet. She closed her eyes. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Oliver shrugged. \u201cIt happens, especially this time of year. I don\u2019t like it any better than you do, but I try to make the best of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re planning, but I\u2019ve already got a line on a poker game. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d care to join us?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The snow fell fast and furious as the afternoon wore on. Although Emma strongly suspected Walt wouldn\u2019t be willing to reimburse her, she broke down and rented a motel room near the airfield, using her credit card since she was almost out of cash. Her knight in tarnished armor had disappeared inside one of the hangars with three other pilots for a poker game, and she hadn\u2019t seen him since.</p><p>The motel room was about what you\u2019d expect for $39.95. The mattress and pillows were thin and no matter what she did, Emma couldn\u2019t get comfortable on the bed until she marched down to the office for extra pillows, which she propped up to support her back while she used her laptop on the bed. Her fingers flew across the keys.</p><p>Lessons from Fruitcake: Earleen Williams</p><p>by Emma Collins</p><p>For The Examiner</p><p>Earleen Williams of Yakima bakes masterful fruitcakes but she\u2019s the true masterpiece.</p><p>It\u2019s no surprise to anyone who has tasted one of her fruitcakes that Earleen and her recipe have achieved national acclaim. With a shy smile, she\u2019ll laughingly say that her secret ingredient is stored in her liquor cabinet. But there\u2019s more to it than that.</p><p>Now Earleen\u2019s recipe has been chosen as one of the twelve nationwide finalists in Good Homemaking\u2019s fruitcake contest. The winner will be announced December 20th on the magazine\u2019s Web site. The January issue will feature a profile of the winner. That winner might be Earleen Williams.</p><p>Earleen admits her life hasn\u2019t been easy, not that she\u2019s complaining. She was married to her first husband, Larry, for sixteen years, but as she says, he was more trouble than she could handle. They parted, and in her pain and loss she returned to the days of her childhood and the happiness she\u2019d known, surrounded by family and love.</p><p>Earleen\u2019s parents had little money for frivolous things, but there was an abundance of love in the home. And somehow, through good times and bad, there was always fruitcake at Christmas. It was this spirit of love, laughter and joy that Earleen sought to recapture in making her own fruitcake. Adding local apples, cooked down into a sauce, and using only ingredients of the highest quality, she began with her mother\u2019s recipe and expanded on it. When asked, Earleen was happy to share her secrets\u2014liquor and apples. In the years since her divorce, her fruitcake has become a holiday staple for family and friends.</p><p>The former bartender continued baking through two subsequent marriages. Discussing her three husbands, Earleen commented that none of them appreciated her. Each pursued other women\u2014or sought escape in a bottle. Over time, Earleen says, she gained perspective on her life and learned to recognize that her husbands\u2019 infidelity wasn\u2019t due to any lack in her.</p><p>Earleen Williams creates a moist, succulent fruitcake\u2014a baking masterpiece. But she, too, is a masterpiece, just the way she is.</p><p>This was a draft, but Emma felt it was a good start. The more she read over her notes, the more she realized that the interview hadn\u2019t been about fruitcake as much as about Earleen. Briefly she wondered if all the interviews would be the same. Lessons about life, wrapped up in a fruitcake recipe. She hoped so.</p><p>By now it was past four o\u2019clock; dusk had begun to fall in earnest. The room had grown chilly and Emma was ready to stop work for a while. The heater below the window belched and coughed before it sent out a blast of hot air. When she turned on the television, all she got was a blank screen and some strange noise. Bored and restless, she threw on her coat and wandered out to the office to complain.</p><p>The middle-aged woman at the desk looked up when she appeared. \u201cThe television doesn\u2019t seem to be working,\u201d Emma told her in a friendly tone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been having problems with the cable,\u201d the clerk said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really like to watch the news.\u201d Listening to the weather report was vital at this point. She wanted out of Yakima, and the sooner the better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send Juan over to see what he can do,\u201d the clerk promised. \u201cHe\u2019s our handyman. He knows what he\u2019s doing, but his English isn\u2019t very good. I\u2019ll do my best to explain it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019d appreciate that,\u201d Emma told her.</p><p>Since Oliver didn\u2019t know where she was, Emma decided she\u2019d better inform him. If there was a break in the storm, he wouldn\u2019t appreciate having to search for her.</p><p>Unsure where to find Oliver, she stepped out of the motel office and turned toward the hangar where she\u2019d last seen him. Pulling her wool coat more tightly around her, she trudged across the snowy street. Fortunately, Oscar trotted over to her, happily wagging his stub of a tail.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Oliver?\u201d she asked the terrier, then followed the dog as he led her to a hangar not far from Oliver\u2019s Cessna.</p><p>When she walked inside, shaking the snow from her coat, Emma found Oliver sitting at a table with his poker-playing friends. Two were dressed in beige overalls, and Emma assumed they must be mechanics. Oliver sat across from a third man who wore a leather jacket similar to his. Probably another pilot.</p><p>Oliver pulled his gaze away from his cards, glanced up and frowned, almost as though he couldn\u2019t remember who she was.</p><p>\u201cI wondered where you\u2019d wandered off,\u201d he mumbled, returning his attention to his hand.</p><p>\u201cI got a motel room.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of the room, his three friends stared at her. From her, they turned as one to Oliver. All speaking at the same time, the men made suggestive comments.</p><p>\u201cWay to go, Oliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAtta boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOo-la-la.\u201d</p><p>To her dismay, Oliver played along, grinning from ear to ear as if it was understood they\u2019d be making wild, passionate love as soon as he\u2019d finished his poker game.</p><p>Emma wasn\u2019t letting him get away with that. If he wasn\u2019t going to explain, then she had no qualms about doing so. \u201cThe motel room isn\u2019t for him,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing between Oliver and me.\u201d</p><p>One of the mechanics laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what all the girls say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d Oliver set his cards down on the table and stood, his movements casual.</p><p>\u201cTake your time, ol\u2019 buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurry on our account.\u201d</p><p>Emma glared at the men as Oliver took her by the elbow and steered her out of the hangar. She peered over her shoulder on her way out the door, strongly tempted to put them all in their place. That would be a waste of time, she realized. Besides, any argument was only going to encourage them.</p><p>\u201cYou got a motel room?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she muttered irritably. Then, repenting her sharp tone\u2014at least a little\u2014she added in a more conciliatory voice, \u201cYou said it would be morning before we\u2019d get out of here.\u201d She hadn\u2019t wanted to spend money on the motel, but there was only so long she could sit in Minnie\u2019s Place, otherwise known as MICE.</p><p>\u201cThat was probably a good idea.\u201d Oliver looked both ways before jogging across the street, Oscar at his heels.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see the weather report. Unfortunately, the television in my room seems to be on the fritz. The manager sent a repairman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind getting a current weather update, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only reason I came to find you was so you\u2019d know where I was.\u201d She wanted to make it clear that she hadn\u2019t gone searching for him because she wanted his company. She was being considerate, nothing more.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see about getting a room for the night myself.\u201d</p><p>While Oliver filled out the paperwork, Emma went back to her room. She opened the door to find Juan, the repairman, sitting on the end of her bed, gazing intently at the television.</p><p>Emma took one look at the images flashing across the screen and gasped. He was watching the pornography channel. Obviously, a lack of familiarity with English was no impediment to following this kind of movie\u2014not that there was much dialogue to worry about.</p><p>He grinned at her as if he\u2019d managed some spectacular feat. \u201cI fix,\u201d he said, beaming. He flipped off the television and handed her the remote on his way out. Emma stared at him openmouthed as he disappeared into the snowstorm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma didn\u2019t know how long she stood in the doorway, still holding the remote, but it must have been more than a minute.</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d Oliver asked as he strolled toward her.</p><p>\u201cThe repairman was in my room watching porn.\u201d She was shocked by the other man\u2019s audacity.</p><p>Oliver followed her into the room. \u201cLet me see the remote,\u201d he said, and took it from her. He pushed the power button; instantly the television returned to the scene she\u2019d witnessed when she walked into the room.</p> <p>\u201cChange the channel,\u201d she insisted, whirling around so she wouldn\u2019t have to look at the entwined figures. This was so embarrassing. All she could hear were moans and groans.</p><p>Oliver made several attempts but the pornography channel was the only one that seemed to be working. Every other channel remained a snowy blur.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Oliver said after a moment. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked to watch the news, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d she concurred.</p><p>\u201cJuan thought you wanted to watch the nudes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d Half-laughing, Emma felt the heat radiate from her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m two doors down if you need anything.\u201d He tossed the remote onto the rumpled bed, where she\u2019d been working earlier.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Emma rushed to assure him. But when she closed the door she remembered that she still couldn\u2019t watch television.</p><p>Sighing, she sat cross-legged on the bed. Might as well work, she decided. Emma reached for a pad of paper and a pen, one of a dozen she kept in a special compartment in her briefcase.</p> <p>She wrote down the date, then chewed on the end of her pen while she mentally reviewed the conversation with Earleen. She needed an introduction to her first article.</p><p>Life is a journey, she began, and as with any journey, a traveler will come upon unexpected twists and turns. Sometimes a person will follow the same path for so long that change seems imperceptible. Conversely, another will travel the shortest of distances and discover a completely new landscape. In a single lifetime, it is possible to live both experiences, as Earleen Williams discovered.</p><p>When Emma finally glanced up, she was surprised to see that it was pitch-black outside, the darkness punctuated by the lights in the motel parking lot. There was a knock on her door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think?\u201d Oliver called from the other side.</p><p>Emma opened the door.</p><p>\u201cMy television works if you want to trade rooms.\u201d</p><p>The idea was tempting.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to my poker game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Emma said gratefully. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Oscar stay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d They exchanged room keys and he turned away. Then, as if he\u2019d just thought of something, he turned back.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Emma asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. Without another word he kissed her.</p><p>At first Emma felt too stunned to react, but once she\u2019d collected her wits, she was furious. He was trying to shock her, and she refused to give him a reaction. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Oliver stopped, shrugged, smiled. \u201cCan\u2019t say. All of a sudden, I had this urge to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time curb it.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged again. \u201cDon\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>Just the way the edges of his mouth turned up annoyed her. \u201cCome on, admit it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou liked it.\u201d</p><p>Emma examined her feelings. If he wanted honesty, then she\u2019d give it to him. \u201cAs kisses go, I guess I\u2019d call it fair.\u201d</p><p>His grin slowly faded. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Before she could take a single step back, he pulled her into his arms again and brought his mouth to hers.</p><p>Ample opportunity came and went for Emma to object. Her mind shouted at her to put an end to it right that minute but...she simply couldn\u2019t.</p><p>His mouth moved over hers with practiced ease. Emma parted her lips and moaned involuntarily. On second thought, maybe it was Oliver who moaned.</p><p>They were still fully caught up in the kiss when Emma heard someone clear his throat. Even then, she didn\u2019t make an effort to break away.</p><p>\u201cOliver,\u201d a man\u2019s voice said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Oliver. We playin\u2019 cards or not?\u201d</p><p>Oliver lifted his mouth from hers and slowly opened his eyes, as if she were the one providing the answers.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s playing cards,\u201d Emma answered for him. She barely recognized her own voice. It didn\u2019t matter. Oliver got the message.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cEmma! Open up.\u201d The words were accompanied by a loud knock on the motel room door.</p><p>The harsh sound of Oliver\u2019s voice woke her abruptly, and she bolted upright. Taking a moment to orient herself she realized Oliver had awakened her in the middle of a dream about him. She blamed Oscar for this. The terrier slept at the foot of her bed, a constant reminder of his master. Her face instantly went red as she tossed aside her covers and hurried to the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she demanded without unlatching the chain. She\u2019d slept in her shirt and her legs were bare.</p><p>\u201cThe weather\u2019s clear. We\u2019re leaving in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes? I don\u2019t know if I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry up. I\u2019ll be waiting at the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll be as fast as I can.\u201d Already she was fumbling about, looking for what she needed.</p><p>As soon as she heard him leave, she tore around the room, dressing as quickly as she could. Twenty-five minutes later she was strapped in the plane\u2019s passenger seat with headphones on. They sat at the end of the runway, awaiting clearance. Oscar was asleep in his dog bed in the cargo hold, oblivious to the tension up front.</p><p>Oliver ignored her and spoke to the tower, again rattling off a list of letters and numbers.</p><p>That was when it hit her. In her rush Emma had forgotten to take her pill. The muscle relaxant was wrapped in a small plastic bag at the bottom of her purse.</p><p>Her first instinct was to interrupt Oliver and insist he taxi the plane back to the hangar. She needed to swallow the pill and then wait thirty to sixty minutes for it to take effect. One glance at the intense expression on his face and she could see that wasn\u2019t the best plan. Just then, he pulled back on the throttle and the plane roared down the runway, gaining speed. Leaning against the seat, she closed her eyes and gritted her teeth. A few minutes later, the wheels left the runway and they were airborne. Okay, she\u2019d survived.</p><p>Emma held her breath. Keeping her eyes closed, she tried to think happy thoughts. Unfortunately, her mind had other interests, drifting back to the scene in the doorway last night. In an effort to dispel the memory of their kiss, she opened her eyes. That, she immediately decided, wasn\u2019t a good idea. All she could see in the darkness was a blur of lights far below. Far, far below. Dwelling on exactly how far was not conducive to her peace of mind.</p><p>About twenty minutes into the flight, the Cessna hit an air pocket and bounced. She gasped and bit down on her lip. She\u2019d grabbed a cup of coffee in the motel office; it was boiling hot, but after adding cold water, she\u2019d managed to drink it. Now, with the slight turbulence, her stomach revolted. Feeling light-headed, she closed her eyes once more and pressed her cheek against the passenger window. It felt nice and cool against her skin.</p><p>As if he sensed her discomfort, Oliver glanced in her direction and asked how she was doing.</p><p>\u201cI...is there any way it would be possible to land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLand?\u201d he repeated into his mouthpiece. \u201cWe can\u2019t land here.\u201d</p><p>Emma refused to look at him. \u201cI think I might be sick.\u201d</p><p>Oliver chuckled. \u201cQuit telling yourself that. You\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit telling me how I feel. I\u2019ve got nausea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake deep breaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d He made it sound as though she had a choice in the matter.</p><p>Oliver took one hand off the controls and stretched his arm behind her seat. He appeared to be searching for something. Sure enough, a couple of seconds later, he triumphantly gave her a plastic bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA container for you to puke in,\u201d he said without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>Emma supposed she should be grateful, but she wasn\u2019t. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d she muttered sarcastically.</p><p>His scowl told her he didn\u2019t appreciate her sarcasm.</p><p>Her stomach settled down a few minutes later, and she slowly exhaled. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI thought you would be.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged no further conversation for the rest of the flight home.</p><p>Once they\u2019d landed, Emma was out of the aircraft in record time, eager to be on her way. Unfortunately, her car was parked back at her apartment. Oliver offered to drop her off, and she accepted, but he certainly wasn\u2019t in any hurry. She chafed with impatience as he tended lovingly to his plane, exchanged protracted greetings with various other men, then retrieved his truck. Finally they arrived at her apartment. As she politely thanked him for the ride, Oscar took her place in the passenger seat\u2014well, his place, she assumed.</p><p>Emma watched them drive away, more determined than ever not to get inside a plane with him again. Somehow, she\u2019d persuade Walt to listen to reason. With her mind made up, she headed into her apartment. After showering, washing her hair and changing clothes, Emma drove to the office.</p><p>It seemed that every eye in the newsroom was on her when she walked through the door. Judging by the looks cast in her direction, she could easily have been the page one story.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Phoebe asked the minute Emma entered The Dungeon. She hadn\u2019t even sat down at her desk before Phoebe rolled her chair across the aisle. \u201cI think it\u2019s wildly romantic that you and Oliver Hamilton were stranded together like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d Emma refused to elaborate. Bad enough that he\u2019d kissed her without permission. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have a toothbrush with me. It wasn\u2019t an experience I care to repeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were with Oliver.\u201d</p><p>Emma sent her friend a glower that said she wasn\u2019t impressed with the pilot.</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, Oliver\u2019s pretty hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to a man than his looks.\u201d Her father was an attractive man, too, but his character wasn\u2019t any deeper than the average mud puddle. Emma suspected Oliver was like that. His glibness infuriated her. He took delight in making her uncomfortable, which she considered a juvenile trait\u2014and one that seemed particularly typical of men.</p><p>Phoebe wouldn\u2019t be thwarted. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he kissed you.\u201d</p><p>Emma ignored the comment. She set her briefcase on her desk and removed her laptop. As soon as she could, she\u2019d review what she\u2019d written and go over her interview notes one final time.</p><p>Phoebe grinned knowingly. \u201cHe did, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Her friend wasn\u2019t going to stop tormenting her. Emma sighed. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but yes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d Phoebe\u2019s eyes flashed with victory, as if she were personally responsible for that kiss. \u201cAnd?\u201d She waited for Emma to elaborate.</p><p>\u201cAnd nothing,\u201d Emma returned. \u201cIt was okay as kisses go, but I didn\u2019t feel the earth move or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d This seemed shocking to Phoebe. \u201cBut everyone says\u2014\u201d</p><p>Emma had no interest in hearing the details of Flyboy\u2019s amorous exploits, even if it was only by repute.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is,\u201d she broke in, \u201cthat ninety percent of the time we were stranded, Oliver was busy playing poker with his cronies.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe\u2019s expression suggested that she was terribly disappointed in both of them. The only way to end this inquisition, Emma decided, was to ask a few questions of her own. \u201cWhile I have your attention, I want you to tell me what\u2019s going on between you and Walt,\u201d she said. \u201cYou promised.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe glanced over her shoulder and lowered her voice. \u201cI\u2019ve probably said more than I should have already.\u201d She rolled her chair back across the aisle.</p><p>Emma followed her, and leaned against the cubicle wall with her arms folded. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether I should thank you or yell at you for getting me this assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d Phoebe insisted righteously. \u201cI just felt Walt should know that if he didn\u2019t do something quick, he was going to lose you, so I...I told him what you said about quitting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s practically blackmail!\u201d Emma said in a horrified voice. \u201cWhat if he\u2019d fired me because you told him I threatened to quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. I wouldn\u2019t have let it happen,\u201d Phoebe said calmly. \u201cBut you deserve a shot at something other than obituaries. I knew Walt couldn\u2019t afford to let you go\u2014and he knows it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, at least you used your power for good,\u201d Emma murmured. She was thankful that Phoebe had spoken to Walt on her behalf; still, she\u2019d rather stand on her own merit. \u201cOliver said that when he asked about me, you sang like a canary. And that\u2019s a quote.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe laughed out loud. \u201cYeah, right, and if you believe that, then you don\u2019t know me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he was exaggerating.\u201d Just then the phone on her desk rang. Reaching across the aisle, Emma picked up the receiver. It was Walt, wanting to see her. Now.</p><p>Phoebe\u2019s eyes widened in speculation when Emma hung up the phone.</p> <p>\u201cWish me luck,\u201d she mouthed to her friend. Grabbing a pad and pen, she walked up the stairs. When she got to his office, her boss was on the phone, but he motioned her inside. He grinned in her direction, which boded well. She had no idea who he was talking to or about what\u2014although the word \u201cno\u201d featured prominently\u2014but after another moment he ended the conversation.</p><p>Emma sat in the chair on the other side of his desk.</p><p>\u201cSo. You\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but resisted mentioning the motel bill.</p><p>\u201cI understand you and Oliver Hamilton had a bit of an adventure.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help wondering how much Walt knew about what had happened in Yakima. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d She mulled over how to tell him she refused to fly with Oliver again.</p><p>\u201cThe interview with Earleen Williams went well?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cEarleen was wonderful. She was flattered by the attention and excited about the article. Her recipe\u2019s terrific\u2014I had a taste and, believe it or not, I loved it. By the way, she\u2019s already signed the legal documentation so we can print her recipe in The Examiner.\u201d If nothing else, Walt should be pleased by that.</p> <p>He inclined his head slightly in apparent approval. \u201cI\u2019d like the article about Earleen on my desk this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cThis afternoon? As in today?\u201d</p><p>Walt raised his eyebrows as if she\u2019d contravened some kind of reporters\u2019 code by daring to ask such a question.</p><p>Swallowing hard, she offered him an apologetic smile. \u201cIt\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His eyebrows started to return to their usual position. \u201cAnd be ready to leave for Colville first thing tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>So soon? She wanted to tell him she needed time to regroup after the flight from Yakima. Yes, it had gone fairly well. Other than the fact that she\u2019d nearly vomited. The best part was that she\u2019d survived without drugs. Her employer simply had no idea what she\u2019d gone through just to get to the other town and home again in one piece. Then there was the problem of no transportation when they\u2019d landed in Yakima. Not only had she risked her life for this interview, but she\u2019d encountered germs besides.</p><p>Now all she had to do was find a way to tell Walt that she preferred to drive to her next interview. \u201cIf you have a moment, I\u2019d like to talk to you about Sophie McKay.\u201d</p><p>Walt gave her a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cAs you know, I ended up spending the night in Yakima. In a motel room. A cheap one.\u201d</p><p>He sat back in his chair. \u201cHamilton said that was unavoidable.\u201d</p><p>So Walt had already spoken to Oliver. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee it won\u2019t happen again\u2014being delayed due to weather, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He pinched his lips together. \u201cTrue. Not to worry, the newspaper will reimburse you for the room.\u201d</p><p>Emma couldn\u2019t prevent a look of surprise at his easy capitulation on the matter of her expenses. Still, that wasn\u2019t her main concern at the moment.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, but I was thinking, you know, that it\u2019d probably be better if I drove to Colville this time, rather than fly. I realize it\u2019s a full day\u2019s drive, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Walt raised his hand and stopped her. \u201cOut of the question. I already have an agreement with Hamilton. He\u2019s got a run into Spokane tomorrow morning. He\u2019ll drop you off at Colville, fly into Spokane and then come back for you later in the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s heart shot to her throat. \u201cYou actually want me to do this again...tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Walt nodded. \u201cMeet Oliver at the airfield same time as before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She stood, but her feet felt weighted down. In less than twenty-four hours, she was going back up into the wide blue yonder with Oliver Hamilton.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day,\u201d Walt said, turning to his computer and dismissing her. \u201cRemember, I want that first article before you leave this afternoon. We\u2019re already in the second week of December, and there\u2019s a time factor here.\u201d He gestured at some limp Christmas garland draped on his window.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be on your desk,\u201d she promised, relieved that she had the rough draft on her laptop computer.</p><p>More by instinct than knowledge, she stumbled back down to her cubicle in The Dungeon, preoccupied by the fact that she\u2019d be flying again so soon. She\u2019d learned that\u2014especially with the help of drugs\u2014she could handle being in a small plane. She didn\u2019t like it, never would, but in all honesty, the flight hadn\u2019t been as bad as she\u2019d feared.</p><p>Examining her reluctance to repeat the experience, she was forced to admit something she\u2019d rather ignore. More than the flying itself, it was Oliver Hamilton she wanted to avoid.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>A fruitcake is to a chef what love is to a gigolo\u2014an item we both desperately try to avoid.</p><p>\u2014Michael Psilakis, executive chef and owner of Onera, New York City</p><p>Oliver wasn\u2019t in the best of moods. He\u2019d made a recent and rather disturbing discovery: Emma Collins wasn\u2019t good for his ego. Until he met her, he\u2019d been doing just fine when it came to attracting the opposite sex. Better than fine.</p><p>His late-afternoon conversation with Walt had further eroded his ego. Apparently, upon their return from Yakima, Emma had attempted to get out of flying with him a second time. Fortunately, Walt had said no; a deal was a deal and Oliver didn\u2019t plan to let her kill his chances of advertising his air-freight business in the local paper.</p><p>Okay, he\u2019d admit it\u2019d been a mistake to kiss her, a mistake he didn\u2019t intend to repeat. If this was how Emma felt, then he could ignore her, too.</p><p>A glance at his watch told him she had five minutes to show up. If she wasn\u2019t at the airport by seven, he was leaving without her. He would\u2019ve kept his end of the bargain, and she\u2019d just have to explain to her boss that she\u2019d been late. He\u2019d only signed this new contract a few weeks ago, flying Alaska salmon packed in dry ice to restaurants in Spokane and Portland. It was a regular job and he couldn\u2019t afford to mess up the opportunity.</p><p>Just as he was about to board the plane, Emma hurried onto the tarmac, clutching her briefcase and a large takeout coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly am not.\u201d Then, perhaps to reassure herself, she stopped and checked her watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got five minutes to spare,\u201d she announced with more than an edge of righteousness. \u201cAt least by my watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not by mine.\u201d</p><p>This time she wasn\u2019t having trouble remaining upright because\u2014or so he assumed\u2014of some stupid pill.</p><p>Regardless, he was going to stick to his policy of ignoring her; he\u2019d simply fly his plane.</p><p>He felt her scrutiny. \u201cSomeone got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning,\u201d she said in a singsong voice.</p><p>He pretended not to hear. Oscar was already in the plane, ready and waiting to take off. The terrier poked his head out the passenger door as if to ask what was taking so long.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Emma said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we start over, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes and climbed into the plane with absolutely no complaints. He didn\u2019t know what had happened to get her to relax. She\u2019d probably switched drugs and had swallowed some heavy-duty, industrial-strength mood enhancer. Nothing else could explain this cheerful state of mind.</p><p>Suddenly he wondered if she\u2019d been drinking, although she\u2019d denied it yesterday. He studied her and sniffed on the off-chance he could smell alcohol.</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? What\u2019s wrong with you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he muttered, returning to the task at hand. He walked beneath the wing, stepping in front of the engine to examine the blades.</p><p>Emma\u2019s headphones were in place, with the small microphone positioned by her mouth, before he\u2019d finished his preflight check.</p><p>His faithful\u2014or should that be faithless?\u2014companion had obviously accepted her, barely raising his head when Oliver climbed into the plane. Oscar had settled onto his dog bed in the cargo hold.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wear perfume this time, did you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, because I didn\u2019t want to get sneezed on again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good for you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re in such a bad mood, but I wish you\u2019d snap out of it.\u201d</p><p>As if to apologize for Oliver, his terrier stood up and poked his head between the two seats. When Emma bent toward him, he licked her ear. Smiling, she stroked his face. Traitor that he was, Oscar seemed to relish her attention. Not until the engine started did the dog go back to his bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFinish your coffee,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving in a couple of minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not coffee. It\u2019s latte. Eggnog-flavored.\u201d She had to argue about everything. But she obediently drained the large cup.</p><p>Oliver taxied to the end of the runway and waited for approval to take off. It wasn\u2019t long in coming. He was in the air before he realized that Emma\u2019s eyes were squeezed shut. Like yesterday, she held on to the bar above the door with what could only be described as a death grip. But at least she wasn\u2019t confessing at the top of her lungs that she\u2019d lied about her weight. The memory produced a grin and for a moment he forgot that he was annoyed with her.</p><p>They hardly spoke the entire flight. Every now and then he felt her glance in his direction, as if to gauge his mood. An hour outside of Colville, he saw that she was squirming in her seat.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Emma shifted from one side to the other. \u201cIf you must know, I have to use the, uh, facilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve gone before we left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she said, not bothering to hide her indignation.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a toilet on the plane.\u201d</p> <p>She turned and scowled at him. \u201cI noticed. Do you have any other suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do what I do,\u201d he told her. Reaching behind him, he grabbed a wide-mouth red plastic container.</p><p>She looked at it as if he\u2019d just handed her a dead rat. \u201cYou aren\u2019t serious, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you had to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t honestly expect me to...go,\u201d she said, apparently not finding a more suitable verb, \u201cin that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI use it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s different for a man. There\u2019s a bit more effort involved for a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a little less than an hour from Colville.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her legs. \u201cI guess I can wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>By the time he approached the Colville runway, Oliver\u2019s sympathies were with Emma. She was clearly uncomfortable, if the number of times she\u2019d crossed and uncrossed her legs was any indication. He didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her there wasn\u2019t a terminal in Colville. The runway was next to a cow pasture, and while there was an office, that didn\u2019t necessarily mean anyone would be there to let her in. It\u2019d been a while since his last visit and he didn\u2019t recall if there was a restroom of any kind in the hangar. For her sake, he hoped there was.</p><p>Emma bit her lower lip when the wheels touched down. Oliver taxied and parked the plane and leaped out. Just as he\u2019d suspected, no one emerged from the office.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a toilet in there,\u201d he said, helping her down. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s open....\u201d</p><p>She had a desperate look.</p> <p>Emma hurried toward the office, but no one answered her frantic knock. When she glanced over her shoulder, he shrugged, pointing at the hangar.</p><p>With that, she bolted for the large metal shed. She must have found what she needed because she didn\u2019t immediately reappear. While he waited, Oliver got on his cell and phoned the Spokane restaurant with his ETA. Someone would meet him at the airfield to pick up the salmon delivery.</p><p>When she returned from the hangar she was frowning. \u201cThe conditions in there were deplorable. Downright primitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, holding up both hands in a gesture of surrender. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me who gulped down that eggnog latte.\u201d</p><p>She threw him an irate look. \u201cThe least you could\u2019ve done was warn me how long the flight was going to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a reporter. You could\u2019ve done the research.\u201d He was about to say something else when he saw the small black dog.</p><p>Emma had noticed the mutt, too, a curly-haired mixed breed, probably part poodle. From the matted hair and the lost expression in her brown eyes, Oliver could tell the dog was a stray.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d Emma asked, gently petting her. The dog stared longingly up at her and started to shake. \u201cShe\u2019s cold,\u201d Emma said.</p><p>Oliver felt bad, but there was little he could do. As it was, Oscar had seen her, jumped down, barking loudly, and then promptly did what dogs always do when they meet another of their kind. He sniffed her butt.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea this town was so small,\u201d Emma commented. She looked over the cow pasture and wrapped her coat more securely around her. \u201cDo you have anything to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but the dog is. I don\u2019t usually carry food with me.\u201d She checked the inside of her purse; the best she had to offer was a half-used package of antacid mints. Unfortunately, Oliver wasn\u2019t much help, either.</p><p>A lone car drove past the road next to the airfield. \u201cDo you have my cell phone number?\u201d he asked, following the vehicle with his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou gave it to me in Yakima.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He remembered that now. \u201cCall me when you\u2019re finished, all right?\u201d As soon as she was picked up, he\u2019d fly into Spokane.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you be back?\u201d she asked.</p><p>So she was going to miss him, he thought, warmed by the question. She wouldn\u2019t admit it, of course, but she was attracted to him. He decided it was better not to react.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you have a ride,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>\u201cSophie McKay said she\u2019d come and get me.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out her cell and punched in a number from her little daybook. After a short conversation, she nodded in his direction, letting him know her ride was on the way.</p><p>Oliver hesitated. He didn\u2019t feel entirely comfortable about leaving her here alone, in what was virtually a deserted field.</p><p>\u201cYou can go,\u201d she said, her shoulders hunched against the wind. \u201cMs. McKay will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will the interview be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I imagine an hour, two at the most.\u201d</p><p>Oliver estimated that he wouldn\u2019t be away more than a couple of hours himself, but it wasn\u2019t a problem if Emma required more time. The Indian casino was a few miles down the road, and if she was occupied, the gaming tables offered him ample entertainment. Emma might not want to ride his folding bicycle, but he didn\u2019t mind using it. He welcomed the excuse to try his hand at blackjack. The slot machines were pretty much a bust, but he did fairly well with a deck of cards.</p><p>\u201cTake all the time you need.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and frankly he wished she hadn\u2019t. When she acted this pleasant, it was hard to remember what a pain she really was.</p><p>Emma wrapped the plaid wool scarf around her face to ward off the chill wind, then buried her hands in her pockets. At the moment, she looked about as pitiful as the stray dog huddled next to her feet.</p><p>\u201cJust call my cell and I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she assured him, her words muffled. \u201cYou\u2019d better go or you\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated a moment longer, then returned to the plane and opened the cargo hatch. To his surprise, Emma followed him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset because you found out I didn\u2019t want to fly with you again,\u201d she said. Her hands remained in her pockets.</p><p>He shrugged as if it didn\u2019t matter either way.</p><p>\u201cIf not that, then is it because...\u201d She stopped, her expression mildly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to know.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him hard. \u201cIs it because I...I didn\u2019t react the way you wanted when you kissed me?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to answer that and climbed aboard the plane.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see any fireworks when we kissed. Did you?\u201d she asked, sticking her head in the cargo hold.</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cThen it isn\u2019t any big deal, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Without meaning to be rude, Oliver paused. \u201cI guess. Why do you care?\u201d</p><p>His question appeared to catch her off guard. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I do. If we\u2019re going to be spending time together for the next week or so, then I think it\u2019s preferable to get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>She glanced nervously away. \u201cMy mother told me that when a man uses that line, I should start to worry.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You\u2019re perfectly safe with me.\u201d</p><p>As if in disagreement, the little black dog at her feet snarled up at him.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Fruitcake is one of those foods that evoke lots of different feelings in people. For me it marks the holiday season that is accompanied by traditions and family. Sharing foods that you eat during certain times of the year is something that I look forward to. A warmed thin slice of fruitcake with freshly made ice cream is the way to go.</p><p>\u2014Craig Strong, chef de cuisine, The Dining Room,</p><p>The Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena, California</p><p>Sophie McKay arrived at the airfield five minutes after Oliver left. Although Emma would never admit it, she found his reluctance to leave her somewhat comforting. She just might have to change her opinion of Oliver Hamilton.</p><p>Emma spent those five minutes alone paying attention to the small stray, whom she called Boots because she had two white paws and otherwise black fur. The poor thing shivered in the cold.</p><p>When a compact car turned off the road and onto the airfield, Emma straightened. The vehicle came to a stop not far from her, and the driver rolled down her window.</p><p>She was an elegant eighty or so, with thick white hair, fashionably styled. Her face glowed with pleasure. \u201cAre you the reporter from The Examiner?\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded. \u201cAnd you must be Sophie McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. You seem half-frozen. Come on, I\u2019ll drive you to my house. It\u2019s warm and cozy, and I\u2019ll put on a pot of tea.\u201d</p><p>Emma looked down at the little dog. Crouching, she petted Boots.</p><p>\u201cI see you have a friend,\u201d Sophie commented.</p><p>\u201cDoes she have an owner?\u201d Emma asked hopefully, but considering the dog\u2019s appearance, she agreed with Oliver that Boots was most likely a stray.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of. The poor dog\u2019s been hanging around the area for a while. I put food out for her a few times, and I know other people have, too, but she\u2019s skittish. I think someone must\u2019ve mistreated her because she doesn\u2019t let anyone get too close. Except for you, apparently.\u201d</p><p>Boots had taken to Emma right away, and she hated to leave the dog behind. \u201cWould you mind if I brought her with me?\u201d What she\u2019d do with Boots after that was a quandary, but Emma didn\u2019t feel she could just walk away.</p><p>\u201cThat might be a problem because of my cats.\u201d</p><p>Emma gazed down at the dog, unsure what to do.</p><p>\u201cCould you find somewhere warm for her to stay until later?\u201d Sophie suggested. \u201cMaybe in the hangar? I\u2019ll give you some food to bring back for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Emma hadn\u2019t thought of that. Boots followed her inside while Sophie dug up an old blanket from the trunk of her car. Emma folded it and placed it on the bathroom floor. Boots didn\u2019t object when Emma shut her inside the small room. At least the dog was out of the cold and out of danger. Squatting down, Emma stroked her thin sides and spoke in low, soothing tones, assuring her she\u2019d be back soon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few minutes later, she left the hangar and walked over to Sophie\u2019s Taurus. A welcome blast of hot air warmed her the instant she slid into the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you,\u201d Sophie said as she slipped the stick shift into reverse and revved the engine. \u201cYou coming for this interview has really stirred up interest in town. We don\u2019t get much notice this side of the mountains. Of course, there\u2019s not much that\u2019s newsworthy coming out of Colville, so the western half of the state doesn\u2019t pay us much mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fruitcake recipe is a finalist in a national contest,\u201d Emma reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed readily enough, \u201cthat was exciting news around here. It made the front page of our weekly paper. Still, none of us figured anyone in the Seattle area would care about my recipe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you think yours was chosen?\u201d Emma asked. She might as well get started with the interview now. She opened her purse and brought out her notebook and one of her pens.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy. It\u2019s different. How many recipes have you heard of for chocolate fruitcake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I created it for my husband years ago and he loved it. Christmas just isn\u2019t Christmas without it anymore. I\u2019ve been baking my chocolate fruitcake every year for longer than I can remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine your husband appreciates that.\u201d</p> <p>Sophie took her eyes off the road for an instant. \u201cHarry\u2019s been gone twenty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Emma murmured awkwardly. \u201cUm, when exactly did you create this fruitcake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all began shortly after Harry and I were married. Within a year he was off to fight in World War Two,\u201d Sophie told her. \u201cI mailed the chocolate fruitcake to him and he got a real kick out of that because, you see, we\u2019d had our first real fight over fruitcake. I\u2019ll explain all that once we get back to the house. He wrote to let me know how much he enjoyed it, and I\u2019ve been baking it every year since. I still have all his letters. Now that he\u2019s gone, I read them every once in a while for the memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never remarried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I never did. I found the love of my life. There wasn\u2019t another man like Harry and I knew it.\u201d Sophie shook her head as she drove down Main Street and the large clock that stood in the center of town. From there, she turned up a steep hill and past the city park.</p><p>Although Harry McKay was very different from her own father, Sophie\u2019s devotion reminded her of her mother\u2019s. Pamela had been like that, loving one man her entire life, despite his weaknesses and flaws. Bret Collins wasn\u2019t worthy of such adoration, such heartfelt affection. And Emma wasn\u2019t willing to be the daughter he seemed to want now that he was aging.</p> <p>\u201cDid you have any children?\u201d she asked, unwilling to waste another moment thinking about her father.</p><p>\u201cTwo sons. Both live in other parts of the country. Harry was very proud of his sons. I am, too. They\u2019re good boys\u2014handsome like Harry and smart like me.\u201d She laughed a little as she pulled into a long driveway that led to an older home with a large front porch. Sophie parked in the back and turned off the engine.</p><p>\u201cThe boys want to buy me a new car this Christmas,\u201d she said with a thoughtful look. \u201cLonnie wants to get me one of those old-style cars you see around. I forget what they\u2019re called\u2014Cruisers, I think. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t come with a stick shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like automatics?\u201d Emma asked.</p><p>\u201cNever learned how to drive them and at my age, I\u2019m comfortable with what I know.\u201d</p><p>That made sense to Emma.</p><p>Sophie ushered her onto the back porch. She stepped around pie tins filled with cat food, both kibble and canned.</p><p>\u201cSorry for the mess and the smell,\u201d Sophie apologized. \u201cI feed the strays. Some of them have bad teeth, hence the soft food. God only knows how many cats I\u2019ve got living under this old porch. I do what I can for them\u2014take the sick ones to the vet and give them a bit of attention.\u201d She paused and smiled. \u201cIt makes me feel good, even when they don\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d</p> <p>Emma looked out over the large well-maintained lawn and flower beds. \u201cYour yard is lovely.\u201d</p><p>A fir wreath with pinecones and red bows hung in the kitchen window. \u201cYou should see my irises in the spring. I have them planted everywhere and the yard is full of color. Flowers, cats and chocolate fruitcakes are my passion. Harry and the boys, too, of course, but my husband is gone and my boys are living their own lives now. They don\u2019t need me the way they once did.\u201d She unlocked the back door and brought Emma into the oversize family kitchen. Three cats meowed as they entered. \u201cThese are Huey, Duey and Louey. They\u2019re the house cats. They\u2019re spoiled, ill-mannered and don\u2019t take kindly to strangers or dogs, so you\u2019ll have to forgive them.\u201d</p><p>Emma petted one, who instantly scooted into another room.</p><p>\u201cThis is the problem with living alone,\u201d Sophie said as she filled the kettle and placed it on the stove. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and the cats and we have certain ways of doing things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable.\u201d</p><p>Sophie walked into the dining room and returned with a large teapot. \u201cI reserve this one for special company,\u201d she said as she measured out tea leaves. Motioning toward the table, she added, \u201cMake yourself comfortable. Just pull out the chair if there\u2019s a cat in it and he\u2019ll move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Sure enough, a large tabby was nestled on the seat cushion. As soon as Emma drew out the chair, the cat stretched and yawned and grudgingly vacated the seat.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me brush away the cat hairs.\u201d Sophie brought over a whisk broom and swept off the cushion.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Emma sat down at the table, which was cluttered with magazines, newspapers, mail and sales flyers.</p><p>Sophie glanced at the wall-mounted clock. \u201cDo you mind if I turn on the radio for a few minutes? It\u2019s bingo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...sure.\u201d Bingo over the radio? Emma had never heard of such a thing.</p><p>The radio was on the table, too, next to an aged photograph of a young man in uniform. Harry, Emma guessed. His widow was right; he\u2019d been a handsome man. Other pictures caught her attention\u2014framed photographs of two families. Emma assumed they were Sophie\u2019s two sons and their wives and kids.</p><p>Her hostess turned on the radio, sat down and lined up her bingo cards in neat rows. Her timing was perfect. She reached for a round blotter pen and waited for the numbers to be called. Her eyes darted back and forth over the cards after each number was announced. Radio bingo was followed by the farm report, which Sophie immediately switched off.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that, but I\u2019m on a winning streak. I\u2019ve won two weeks in a row,\u201d she told her proudly as the kettle on the stove started to whistle. \u201cMy friends say I\u2019m lucky, and it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of radio bingo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d Sophie shook her head as if this was a real shame. \u201cThe local merchants sponsor it. When you bingo, you call it in to the station and then take your card to the participating merchant for your prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you win?\u201d Emma asked, curious now.</p><p>\u201cFive dollars off my next haircut at Venus de Milo Beauty Salon, and the week before, it was buy one, get one free at the A &amp; W Drive-In. If you were going to be in town longer and it wasn\u2019t so cold, I\u2019d take you down for one of their root beer floats.\u201d</p><p>Emma smiled appreciatively as Sophie poured the tea and brought out a dark wrapped loaf from the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might want to try my chocolate fruitcake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised\u2014pleasantly so,\u201d Sophie told her. Within minutes, she brought two cups of tea and a plate of the most unusual-looking fruitcake Emma had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cTaste it,\u201d the woman urged.</p><p>Emma helped herself to a slice, unsure what to expect. The flavors came alive in her mouth and she widened her eyes. Sophie hadn\u2019t exaggerated. This was incredibly good. \u201cIs that pineapple I taste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, and coconut, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is wonderful.\u201d Emma took another bite and licked her fingers when she\u2019d finished. For the second time, her preconceptions and prejudices about something\u2014fruitcake\u2014had been tested.</p><p>\u201cI use lots of nuts. Harry was wild about pecans. My own favorite is walnuts. Do you realize how good nuts are for you?\u201d she asked conversationally. \u201cJust think about it. Inside each nut is the potential for an entire tree. They\u2019re packed full of nutrition. A lot of people are concerned about the fat content, but nuts have good fat, not bad fat.\u201d</p><p>Emma smiled. Being with Sophie was such a delight that she was having a hard time remembering to take notes. \u201cHow did you come up with the recipe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the most interesting part,\u201d she said, joining her at the table once more. \u201cThe first year Harry and I were married, I wanted to make fruitcake at Christmas. My mother always had, and I wanted to be a good wife and homemaker, just like her. Harry told me he hated fruitcake and furthermore he didn\u2019t want me wasting money on ingredients for a cake he wouldn\u2019t even eat. This was toward the end of the Depression, when money was still scarce. I told him he was being selfish and mean, and I burst into tears.\u201d She paused and sipped her tea.</p><p>\u201cYou see, to me, Christmas was fruitcake. It felt as if Harry had asked me to give up my favorite holiday. That was our first big fight. Telling me I couldn\u2019t bake that fruitcake was like telling me we couldn\u2019t afford Christmas.\u201d</p><p>As far as this Christmas thing went, Emma\u2019s sympathies were with Harry.</p><p>\u201cThe next morning,\u201d Sophie continued, \u201cHarry said if it meant that much to me, I should go ahead and do whatever I wanted. So I baked fruitcake, but I used the ingredients I knew Harry liked best. When I told him what I\u2019d done, he put his arms around me and said it wasn\u2019t any wonder he loved me as much as he did. Harry had a real sweet tooth, especially for good chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used the ingredients he liked?\u201d Emma thought that was a clever compromise.</p><p>\u201cI admit chocolate fruitcake isn\u2019t run-of-the-mill fruitcake, but that\u2019s what got me into the finals, don\u2019t you think? I can only imagine how many recipes they received. Mine was different, and I have my Harry to thank for that.\u201d</p><p>Emma made another note on her tablet. Sophie was about to say something else when someone knocked on the back door.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be Barbara, my sister-in-law. I told her she could stop by and meet you. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Barbara came into the kitchen, wearing a heavy winter coat and a long hand-knit scarf with matching gloves. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, beaming Emma a warm smile. She removed her gloves, tucked them in her pockets, then extended her right hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you. We\u2019re all so proud of Sophie, and it\u2019s nice that the Seattle newspaper\u2019s doing this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that The Examiner was a regional paper with a limited circulation. Of course, Puyallup was considerably bigger than Colville with its population of less than seven thousand, and compared to Colville\u2019s weekly, The Examiner was practically the New York Times.</p><p>\u201cHow was your flight?\u201d Barbara shooed a cat out of a chair and joined them.</p><p>\u201cUneventful\u2014just the way I like them.\u201d The discomfort of a full bladder was not a topic she wished to pursue.</p><p>Barbara wasn\u2019t the only visitor Sophie had. By the end of the interview, Emma had been introduced to Dixie, Sophie\u2019s next-door neighbor; Florence, her best friend; and Cathy, who cleaned her house once a week. They all gathered around the table with tea and chocolate fruitcake and told story after story. Their laughter echoed through the house. It was a party unlike any Emma had ever gone to; none of these women were close to her age but she felt like one of them.</p> <p>By the time Sophie dropped her off at the airfield, it was almost two in the afternoon. The Cessna was parked at the end of the strip near the hangar, and Emma assumed Oliver was inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait just to be sure,\u201d Sophie insisted.</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t want to hold up the other woman, but reluctantly agreed. She hurried over to the plane, seeking Oliver, disappointed not to find him immediately. She felt excited\u2014no, elated\u2014after the interview and wanted to talk about the experience. Share some of the wisdom she\u2019d gained from Sophie and her friends.</p><p>In discussing the interview with Oliver, she might get a slant for her story. She had a thousand ideas and impressions chasing around in her head and needed to sort through them. It was important to her that she do Sophie and her friends justice.</p><p>\u201cOliver!\u201d she called out. He might have curled up inside the hangar for a nap. \u201cOscar?\u201d</p> <p>No response.</p><p>Emma let Boots out of the restroom and bent down to feed her the can of cat food Sophie had given her. The dog would be too hungry to be finicky, Emma guessed, and she was right. Boots gobbled up the small can\u2019s contents and looked for more.</p><p>Emma found her cell phone and walked outside to make sure she\u2019d get a good connection. She waved at Sophie, then punched in the number for his cell. The phone rang three times before Oliver responded.</p><p>\u201cHamilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finished?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she repeated. She couldn\u2019t place the background noise, which sounded like some sort of circus.</p><p>\u201cThe casino. It\u2019s a couple of miles out of town.\u201d</p><p>After the poker experience, she should\u2019ve known he\u2019d be gambling. \u201cWill you be much longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in, I\u2019m in,\u201d he shouted, obviously not to her. \u201cListen, I\u2019m in the middle of a game and I can\u2019t quit. Find a way out here, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to come to the casino?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe the nerve of this man.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer and the line was disconnected. She called again, but this time there was no answer, even after a dozen rings. Like it or not\u2014and she didn\u2019t\u2014Emma was going to the casino.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>On the short drive to the casino, Emma brooded about the unreliability of Oliver Hamilton. She hoped Sophie didn\u2019t notice how upset she was with her so-called pilot. In case he\u2019d forgotten, she needed to get back to the newspaper office sometime before the end of the Christmas season.</p> <p>\u201cColville\u2019s a pleasant little town,\u201d Sophie was telling her. \u201cI wish you had more time to look around. There\u2019s a lumber mill on the other side of town, which helps keep the local economy afloat.\u201d</p><p>Emma smiled politely, finding it difficult to concentrate. Boots was curled up next to her feet and had gone to sleep. She still didn\u2019t know what she was going to do with the stray. Maybe she could persuade Phoebe to take her until Emma moved into a new apartment that allowed pets.</p><p>When Sophie pulled up in front of the casino, Emma had to look twice. The place resembled nothing so much as an overgrown tavern. Other than a sign on the roadway, there wasn\u2019t a single indication that this was a casino. Emma had expected flashing neon lights, a fancy restaurant offering steak and lobster dinners at cut-rate prices, uniformed valets. Instead, Sophie parked on a gravel lot.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d Emma told the other woman as she climbed out of the vehicle. Boots hopped out with her as Emma reached for her purse and briefcase.</p><p>\u201cIt was lovely to meet you,\u201d Sophie said, leaning across the front seat. \u201cI hope you win today. I\u2019ll be out here on Sunday after church\u2014for bingo. I won eight hundred dollars a year ago.\u201d She grinned. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m just plain lucky.\u201d</p><p>The door to the casino opened and out sauntered the largest lumberjack Emma had ever seen. Not that she\u2019d seen many lumberjacks. This man had to be close to seven feet tall and wore a red plaid shirt, dirt-smudged jeans with suspenders and a red wool cap. She glanced around, just to make sure Babe, the blue ox, wasn\u2019t following behind.</p><p>He took one look at Emma and pointed a beefy finger in her direction. \u201cYou. Be my woman.\u201d</p><p>Emma gasped.</p><p>Shaking her head, Sophie got out of the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cGrizzly, you leave this young lady alone.\u201d</p><p>Grizzly looked crestfallen and rubbed the side of his face. \u201cI shaved before I came into town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt takes more than a shave to attract a woman. Now apologize.\u201d</p><p>Grizzly shuffled from one foot to the other. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean no offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d After a final wave for Sophie, Emma grabbed Boots and tucked the dog under her arm as she scurried into the casino. When she found Oliver, she intended to let him know exactly what she thought.</p><p>Oscar was patiently waiting for Oliver just inside the door. As soon as he saw Emma and Boots, he barked twice. This appeared to be the cue Oliver was waiting for, because he turned abruptly and faced the door.</p><p>He was at a table near the entrance playing some card game. Blackjack? It was hard to tell in the smoky haze. The entire place was shrouded in cigarette smoke, and she gave an involuntary cough. Oscar sneezed, but she managed to jump back in time.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be long,\u201d Oliver called out. \u201cMake yourself comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here?\u201d The smoke was likely to kill her first.</p><p>With a disgusted grimace, he left the table and walked toward her. \u201cI\u2019ll be ten minutes or so.\u201d</p><p>At her horrified expression, he looked over his shoulder at the blackjack table. \u201cYou want something to eat?\u201d he asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to go home. How are we supposed to get back to the airfield? And why did you make me come out here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>He gazed at her a moment, pure innocence in his eyes. \u201cWhy, Ms. Collins, I thought you\u2019d enjoy being introduced to another fascinating aspect of Washington state culture. Maybe you could write a travel piece. And like I said, you can get a meal here. Or try one of the slot machines. Don\u2019t worry about getting back, either. A friend of a friend said he\u2019d give us a ride to the airfield. You\u2019ll like Grizzly. And don\u2019t be put off by his name. He\u2019s as gentle as a lamb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrizzly?\u201d That completely distracted her from the sarcastic remark she\u2019d been about to make.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t judge a man by his name. He\u2019s a sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig guy in a red plaid shirt?\u201d</p><p>Oliver nodded. \u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just asked me to be his woman,\u201d she said from between clenched teeth.</p><p>Oliver blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s eyes opened wide. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t come into town often. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>If that was supposed to reassure her, it didn\u2019t. From the sound of it, the big guy hardly ever saw a woman. And since she was going to be stuck in some vehicle with him, he might well think he\u2019d hit the jackpot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a lucky streak.\u201d For the first time Oliver seemed to notice that Boots was with her. \u201cWhat do you intend to do with the dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I haven\u2019t figured that out yet.\u201d</p><p>Someone impatiently shouted Oliver\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cBe right with you,\u201d he yelled over his shoulder. \u201cCan\u2019t you entertain yourself for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>He spoke as if she were ten years old.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be concerned about me,\u201d she said. Next time she was going to insist on driving, and she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.</p><p>\u201cHamilton, you in or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn,\u201d he shouted back.</p><p>Emma watched him sprint over to the table. This was great; it was either breathe in smoke or risk facing Paul Bunyan in the parking lot. Emma decided her chances were better in the casino. But she didn\u2019t like it there. Boots didn\u2019t, either. The dog trembled in her arms, alarmed by all the lights and noise. Oscar, however, despite an occasional sneeze, relaxed in his corner by the door. He appeared to be an old hand at this, which no doubt he was.</p><p>After a few minutes, Emma couldn\u2019t tolerate the smoke anymore. She needed fresh air. She stepped outside and wasn\u2019t completely pleased when Oliver\u2019s terrier followed her into the pale wintry sunlight. She didn\u2019t like the way Oscar was eyeing Boots. Her hold on Boots tightened. No way was she letting Oscar have his way with this sweet dog.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking what I think you\u2019re thinking,\u201d she told the other dog, \u201cforget it. Boots is off-limits. Understand?\u201d Once she got home, there\u2019d be a veterinary appointment for Boots\u2014checkup, shots and spaying. She planned to be a responsible pet-owner, and that included thwarting Oscar\u2019s evil-minded intentions.</p><p>It was cold outside, and her fashionable leather boots weren\u2019t enough to keep her feet warm. Her toes lost feeling; reluctantly she retreated inside once again, determined to drag Oliver away from the gaming table if necessary.</p><p>Fortunately, he was finished with his game. Counting his money as he walked toward her, he looked up as if nothing were amiss and smiled. \u201cI won three hundred dollars.\u201d</p><p>She ignored that. \u201cCan we leave for the airfield now?\u201d she asked, keeping her voice as level and even as she could manage.</p><p>\u201cSure thing. And considering your worries about Grizzly, I got us another ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any objection to riding in the back of a pickup, do you? It\u2019s only a couple of miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha.\u201d She wasn\u2019t amused.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Emma, loosen up. Where\u2019s your Christmas spirit?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. The less said regarding her feelings about Christmas, the better. Instead she asked, \u201cThree of us are supposed to cram into a truck cab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I do. I\u2019ll find my own way back to the airfield.\u201d Oliver was really starting to get on her nerves. \u201cWhy did you have me come out here, anyway?\u201d she demanded. \u201cSeriously. Don\u2019t give me any nonsense about culture or travel, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed. \u201cI was on a winning streak. I didn\u2019t know how long it was going to last. But sending for you was the stupidest thing I could\u2019ve done. The minute you showed up, I started losing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blaming me?\u201d Emma had to get away from this Neanderthal. \u201cGo ahead without me,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ll phone for a taxi.\u201d</p><p>Oliver nearly doubled over as he burst into laughter. \u201cLa-di-da. Her highness requires a private conveyance. Do you actually believe a town the size of Colville has a taxi service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Emma had assumed there was one.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m the forgiving sort. I\u2019ll still let you ride with me and if you\u2019re real nice I won\u2019t make you sit in the back of the truck.\u201d</p><p>By this time Emma was so angry with Oliver, she wanted to smack him upside the head. \u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d His smile faded. \u201cFAA regulations don\u2019t permit it. I worked too hard for this license to mess it up over a beer.\u201d</p><p>She had half a mind to lean over and smell his breath. She didn\u2019t, for fear he\u2019d try to kiss her again. And yet...the thought was strangely appealing.</p><p>She and Oliver clambered into a rickety old truck driven by a bearded taciturn man named Michael Michaels\u2014known as Mike-Mike. He had remarkably little to say, which was fine with Emma. Preferable to Grizzly\u2019s idea of conversation, anyway.</p> <p>On the ride back to Colville Emma reminded herself that she wasn\u2019t attracted to Oliver Hamilton. Still, if he wanted to kiss her\u2014not now, of course, but later\u2014she was afraid she might let him. Perhaps she was experiencing altitude sickness. There was definitely something in the air, but it wasn\u2019t Christmas and it sure wasn\u2019t love.</p><p>Emma sat between the two men with Boots, plus her purse and briefcase, on her lap and Oscar down by Oliver\u2019s feet. When they arrived at the field, Emma climbed out of the truck once Oliver had leaped to the ground. She thanked Mike-Mike politely for the ride.</p><p>Oliver handed his new friend a few dollars. With the two dogs trotting behind them, Emma and Oliver headed toward the Cessna.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the interview go?\u201d Oliver asked as they approached the plane.</p><p>The tension left her shoulders. \u201cI think Sophie is one of the most interesting women I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Oliver walked around the Cessna, giving it the usual inspection.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s loved one man her entire life.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, although she doubted he was listening.</p><p>\u201cHarry died twenty years ago, and she\u2019s loved him and only him all these years. I find that so romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomantic,\u201d he repeated absently.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Oliver glanced back at her. \u201cI heard you. So what\u2019s the big deal? Men and women stay in love all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t,\u201d Emma said. \u201cDo you know what the divorce rate is in this country? One out of every two marriages fails. That\u2019s a fifty-percent failure rate. Men and women don\u2019t stay in love, and do you know why?\u201d</p><p>He yawned.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s because there aren\u2019t any genuinely romantic men left in this world. Where\u2019s Cary Grant when we need him? What about Humphrey Bogart? Rock Hudson? No, wait. Not him. Although he was very romantic in all those Doris Day movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonald Duck. Daisy thought he was pretty romantic.\u201d</p><p>This time she couldn\u2019t resist and slapped his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s all one big joke to you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Without giving him a chance to respond, she said, \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are romantic men in this world, Emma. Lots of them, and they don\u2019t look anything like a bunch of old movie stars, either. Real romance isn\u2019t about candlelit dinners or diamonds or champagne. As for couples staying in love, my parents have been married for thirty-six years.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Oliver Hamilton was the expert. \u201cYou know all about this subject, do you?\u201d She let him hear the sarcasm in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d probably consider my brother a romantic. At least he tried to be. Unfortunately, the whole thing backfired on him.\u201d</p><p>Emma knew he wanted her to ask what happened and she refused to. She needn\u2019t have worried because Oliver was intent on telling her, whether she wanted to be told or not.</p><p>\u201cJack took his girlfriend to a fancy restaurant in order to propose. He wanted to do it up big, you know. So he had the chef bake the engagement ring into a piece of chocolate cake.\u201d He was smiling as he described the details of his brother\u2019s attempt at romance. \u201cThe problem is that when Ginny ate the cake, she swallowed the diamond ring.\u201d He slapped his knee now, overcome by mirth.</p><p>\u201cOh, let\u2019s just get in the plane.\u201d</p><p>But Oliver seemed determined to finish his story. \u201cI told him he was lucky Ginny didn\u2019t choke to death on that diamond. They\u2019ve been married for six years now and have two little rug rats, both as cute as can be.\u201d</p><p>Emma was about to comment when a white van drove into the airfield. Boots started barking frantically. Emma bent over and picked up the dog in order to calm her. She\u2019d welcome the opportunity to clean her up. Maybe she could sneak her into the apartment and do that later today.</p><p>The van pulled up next to the plane. Emma read the lettering on the side of the vehicle and groaned. Animal Control.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the dogcatcher,\u201d Oliver said out of the side of his mouth, in case she wasn\u2019t smart enough to read it for herself.</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfternoon, folks,\u201d the tall thin man said as he climbed down from the van.</p><p>Boots growled and Oscar joined him in perfect harmony.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Officer Wilson,\u201d Emma said formally, reading the nametag on his jacket.</p><p>\u201cDo you know that dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...we only just met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you ask,\u201d Oliver said, distracting Officer Wilson. \u201cOscar\u2019s license is paid in full. He\u2019s not a local but he\u2019s legal.\u201d He grinned, apparently at his own cleverness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more concerned with the stray your lady friend\u2019s holding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI named her Boots.\u201d</p><p>The dogcatcher nodded in a friendly fashion; he seemed to approve of her choice of names. \u201cDo you plan to adopt Boots officially?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Emma didn\u2019t know how to respond. She needed time to work something out. If Mr. Scott discovered she had a dog, he\u2019d evict her from the apartment so fast her head would spin. She\u2019d probably end up living at the office.</p><p>\u201cIt seems she\u2019s taken a liking to you.\u201d His expression grew somber. \u201cYou know, for some reason she\u2019s been hanging around the airfield lately. That\u2019s dangerous, for her and for the pilots.\u201d</p><p>Boots growled again and squirmed as if begging for the opportunity to nip at the dogcatcher\u2019s heels.</p><p>\u201cThis dog doesn\u2019t have an owner,\u201d Officer Wilson informed her, \u201cand we\u2019ve had complaints. That\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>Emma gathered Boots closer to her side.</p><p>\u201cIf I take her to Animal Control, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll be euthanized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Emma\u2019s protest was immediate. She looked to Oliver for help, although she didn\u2019t know what he could do.</p><p>\u201cEmma wants to adopt Boots,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious those two have bonded. What are the fees?\u201d Oliver pulled a wad of cash from his pocket.</p><p>Officer Wilson frowned. \u201cAdoption isn\u2019t my department. But...\u201d He gave Emma an assessing glance. \u201cI\u2019ll turn the other way if you want to take her with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Oliver said, steering Emma toward the plane.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll take her,\u201d Emma cried. She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of Boots going to the shelter. She didn\u2019t know how long the poor thing had fended for herself, but that was about to end. Somehow or other, she\u2019d figure out a way to keep the dog hidden until she found an apartment that accepted pets.</p><p>The dogcatcher pulled two dog biscuits from his pocket and offered one to Oscar and the second to Boots. \u201cNo hard feelings, girl, I was only doing my job.\u201d He gently petted the small dog\u2019s head. \u201cGlad it worked out for you.\u201d</p><p>As if accepting Officer Wilson\u2019s apology, Boots licked the man\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see to buying Boots a license when you get home?\u201d he reminded them.</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Oliver promised.</p><p>Mr. Wilson seemed pleased and drove off with a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d and a jolly wave.</p><p>Sophie McKay\u2019s Chocolate Fruitcake</p><p>Make 3-4 weeks in advance.

They hadn\u2019t talked much during the flight, which was unexpectedly turbulent. Emma had white-knuckled it, choosing to close her eyes and pray. She hadn\u2019t prayed this much since grade school.</p><p>As soon as they taxied to the end of the runway, Oliver parked the plane. Emma climbed out and reached for Boots, who came willingly into her arms. The poor dog trembled, and Emma realized it hadn\u2019t been an easy flight for her, either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d Oliver said after Emma had collected her things.</p><p>Her legs felt shaky and her stomach queasy, so she merely nodded, eager to get home. It was too late to return to the office; besides, she had more pressing concerns that had nothing to do with her job. Somehow, she had to find a way to smuggle Boots into her apartment. Even more of a challenge would be keeping the dog hidden until she located someplace else to live. Maybe Phoebe could help. Money was tight already, this close to payday, and she needed to make a veterinary appointment, plus obtain a license for Boots and buy a collar and leash. Groceries weren\u2019t necessary, Emma decided; besides, she needed to lose a few pounds. Somehow she\u2019d make it to the end of the month, despite the unexpected drain on her cash reserves. There were real advantages to avoiding Christmas, and this proved it.</p><p>On the drive back to her apartment, Emma explained the tricky situation to Boots. She took her eyes from the road for just a second to smile at the little black dog. Boots gazed at her adoringly, but it would be ridiculous to assume the dog understood her dilemma and would voluntarily remain out of sight. And what about walks? She\u2019d have to sneak Boots in and out for her walks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fortunately, when she arrived Mr. Scott was nowhere to be seen. Clutching Boots with one arm, Emma wrapped her coat around the dog. Anyone who noticed her bulging side would guess she was making a poor attempt at hiding something. That being the case, she could only hope no one suspected it was a dog.</p><p>Her mind was whirring from her afternoon with Sophie McKay and the woman\u2019s community of family and friends. Sophie\u2019s chocolate fruitcake recipe was unusual, and it didn\u2019t surprise Emma that it was a finalist. As soon as possible, she wanted to sit down with her laptop and begin drafting the article. First, however, she had to give Boots a bath.</p><p>The moment Emma entered her small one-bedroom apartment, she closed the drapes. She didn\u2019t want Mr. Scott walking past and peering through her window. Her neighbors on both sides had decorated Christmas trees on display in theirs. Not Emma.</p><p>After checking the refrigerator and discovering an open box of baking soda, two small containers of yogurt and a shriveled-up orange, she realized she\u2019d need to go out later for dog food.</p> <p>Because she was hungry, she ate the yogurt as she ran warm water into her bathtub. Boots sauntered from room to room, sniffing and exploring her new home. The dog didn\u2019t object when Emma placed her in the water and gave her a bath. Using her own shampoo, she worked up a good lather, then rinsed Boots off and repeated the process, finishing with a cream rinse that left the black fur glossy and soft. The muck on Boots\u2019s coat had deposited a dirty residue on the bottom of the tub. The dog had been completely filthy. She licked Emma\u2019s hand as if to thank her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a darling.\u201d Emma laughed as she dried Boots off with a thick towel, and then cleaned the tub.</p><p>The doorbell chimed and Emma froze. She\u2019d barely been home an hour. It didn\u2019t seem possible that someone had already gone to Bud Scott and reported that she was in violation of the No Pets clause.</p><p>Perhaps it was Phoebe, who sometimes stopped by in the evening. Cautious, she locked Boots in the bathroom and checked her peephole.</p><p>\u201cOliver?\u201d she said aloud, surprised to see him. She unlatched the lock and opened the door.</p> <p>He stood on the other side of the threshold with a pizza box in one hand, a bag of dog food in the other.</p><p>\u201cYou said there weren\u2019t any romantic heroes left in this world,\u201d he said, balancing the pizza box on the tips of his fingers. \u201cI\u2019m here to prove you wrong.\u201d</p><p>Impressed by his thoughtfulness, Emma stared at him, hardly knowing what to think.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d Oliver asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes...sorry.\u201d It didn\u2019t even occur to her to refuse him. She stepped aside and as he passed, the scent of warm pizza made her stomach growl. The yogurt hadn\u2019t taken her far.</p><p>With flair, Oliver set the pizza down on the kitchen table. \u201cDeluxe, with extra cheese,\u201d he announced. \u201cPlus two cans of Coke.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Oscar?\u201d Emma asked as she took a couple of plates from the cupboard.</p><p>\u201cIn the truck. Where\u2019s Boots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bathroom. I\u2019ll let her out in a minute,\u201d she said, thinking it was probably for the best that Oscar had stayed in Oliver\u2019s truck. No need to raise Mr. Scott\u2019s suspicions by letting another dog inside her apartment.</p><p>\u201cBoots has a thing for him, you know.\u201d Oliver pulled out a chair, sat down and served her a slice of pizza.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d She would\u2019ve argued further but she was too hungry for a full-blown argument. \u201cYou\u2019re making that up.\u201d</p><p>Oliver\u2019s mouth twisted into a lazy smile and he wiped his fingers on a paper towel.</p><p>Boots scratched at the bathroom door. When Emma opened it for her, she hurried into the kitchen. Sitting on her haunches, she stared longingly at the steaming pizza. \u201cLook what Oliver brought us,\u201d Emma told her dog. She got a cereal bowl from the cupboard and filled it with dog food. Setting it on the floor, she watched as Boots gobbled up the entire amount and then begged for more.</p><p>She was about to refill the dish when Oliver stopped her. \u201cDon\u2019t overfeed her,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially now. She\u2019s been semistarved for some time. You don\u2019t want her getting sick.\u201d</p> <p>Emma nodded, rinsed out the bowl and ran clean water into it.</p><p>While she did that, Oliver glanced around the apartment. \u201cDo you have something against Christmas?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She didn\u2019t feel like launching into a long explanation.</p><p>\u201cThe least you could do is put up a sprig of mistletoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d He gestured around him. \u201cYou have a deficit of Christmas cheer. When are you planning to put up your tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Leave it to Oliver to press the issue. \u201cI don\u2019t really like Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to have a Christmas tree,\u201d he said. When she shook her head, he murmured, \u201cCome on. Why don\u2019t you enjoy Christmas, Ms. Scrooge?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him, struggling to maintain her composure. \u201cNot everyone lives and breathes Christmas, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people do. Take my mom. She\u2019s really big on Christmas, with family dinners and parties\u2014the whole nine yards. I thought all women were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He was really irritating her now. \u201cBut you, of course, know women so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt was just a question.\u201d</p><p>Emma realized she was overreacting. Oliver had been very kind to her this evening and didn\u2019t deserve to be snapped at. \u201cMy mother was a big fan of Christmas,\u201d she said quietly, paying a lot of attention to her pizza slice. \u201cShe used to bake cookies and decorate the house and make a big fuss over the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you spend the day with her,\u201d Oliver said, smoothly accepting her explanation. \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><p>Emma turned away. A part of her wanted to let him assume that was true. But she couldn\u2019t, although she wasn\u2019t sure why. \u201cMy mother died several years ago.\u201d</p><p>Her announcement was followed by an awkward silence. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Emma raised one shoulder in a half shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo people really get over losing their mothers?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She looked at Oliver then. Really looked at him. A small shiver of awareness went through her. It occurred to Emma that he was working hard to prove he could be a romantic hero, her romantic hero. Emma wasn\u2019t sure she was ready for anything like that, with anyone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded after a lengthy pause.</p><p>Emma blinked, embarrassed that she\u2019d been staring at him. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were thinking about something and I want to know what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet it was me.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou want me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Oliver smiled. \u201cA little pizza, a bag of dog food, and you\u2019re ready to fall at my feet. Who would\u2019ve thought it\u2019d be this easy.\u201d He\u2019d abandoned all seriousness and seemed absolutely delighted with himself. Grinning widely, he took a giant bite of pizza.</p><p>Emma could see it was going to be impossible to have a real conversation with this man.</p><p>\u201cCome on, admit it,\u201d he urged.</p><p>She pretended to be absorbed in her dinner. \u201cThe dog food was a nice touch,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cActually, it was Oscar who thought of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou carry on conversations with your dog?\u201d She didn\u2019t mention the little heart-to-heart she\u2019d had with Boots on the drive home.</p><p>\u201cAll the time.\u201d Oliver motioned toward the apartment door. \u201cNow that Boots has eaten, would it be okay if I brought Oscar inside? He hates being left in the truck for very long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mind the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he knows Boots is here.\u201d</p><p>Emma thought about warning Oliver not to let anyone see his dog, and decided against it. \u201cBoots would enjoy the company.\u201d If they were caught, it would be easy enough to explain that the terrier was only visiting. Surely Mr. Scott couldn\u2019t object to that.</p><p>Oliver stood and headed for the door and then, as if he\u2019d forgotten something, he turned back.</p><p>Emma glanced up, wondering what he was doing, when he leaned over and kissed her. This wasn\u2019t any peck on the cheek, either. His mouth was warm, insistent, and Emma felt overwhelmed by sensation. By excitement. His hands found their way into her hair and she instinctively opened to him. Thankfully, she was sitting, otherwise she feared her knees would have given out. Oliver was gentle, coaxing, as the tip of his tongue outlined the shape of her lips. When he pulled away, he reached for the back of the chair as if he, too, needed something to ground him.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he whispered, not sounding anything like his normal self.</p><p>Wanting to make light of it, Emma tossed her head. \u201cIt was all right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Oliver grinned, and she could see he wasn\u2019t fooled. \u201cYou could really damage a man\u2019s ego.\u201d</p><p>But not his, she suspected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He started for the door again.</p><p>Emma remained where she was in order to gather her scattered wits. This man\u2019s kisses were a lot more potent than she\u2019d been willing to acknowledge. Earlier, the first time he\u2019d kissed her, she\u2019d deluded herself into thinking it\u2019d been rather pleasant but nothing earth-shattering. Wrong. This time, she\u2019d experienced a response of seismic proportions.</p><p>Oliver was back and let himself in the apartment door. Oscar barreled inside and the instant Boots saw the other dog, she barked joyfully. Oh, dear, was it possible Oliver was right about that, too? But Oscar played it cool, his head at a cocky tilt. It was true, Emma thought, unable to hold back a smile. After a while, dogs and their masters began to look alike.</p><p>Emma bent down and stroked Oscar, then poured him a bowl of dog food, too.</p><p>\u201cWas that a dog I saw just now?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of Bud Scott\u2019s brusque voice, Emma nearly fainted. He\u2019d opened her\u2014regrettably unlocked\u2014door and was peering into the apartment.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Oliver answered gruffly. He\u2019d clearly taken exception to Mr. Scott\u2019s offensive tone.</p><p>Emma hurried to stand next to Oliver, hoping to block the landlord\u2019s view of the two dogs. \u201cOscar belongs to my friend,\u201d she explained, trying to sound innocent and accommodating.</p><p>Mr. Scott\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI thought I saw two dogs in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Oliver confirmed.</p><p>Emma elbowed him hard in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d Oliver glared at her and rubbed his side.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only Oscar,\u201d she said sweetly. Unfortunately, Boots chose that moment to bark excitedly. Oscar joined in, and Emma sagged against the doorjamb.</p><p>\u201cYou know this is a pet-free zone.\u201d Bud Scott scowled.</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a no-tolerance policy in regard to pets, especially cats and dogs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFriendly place you chose to live,\u201d Oliver muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t helping,\u201d she said furiously. It would\u2019ve been a whole lot better if he\u2019d just gone home, taking his leftover pizza with him.</p><p>He made a resigned gesture and stepped back.</p><p>Emma folded her hands. \u201cPlease, Mr. Scott,\u201d she implored. \u201cI...only got Boots this afternoon. She was a stray\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou brought a stray into this complex?\u201d He looked at her as if she were insane. \u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019ve exposed your neighbors to?\u201d He retreated a step as if he feared an infestation of some kind at any moment.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne week,\u201d Mr. Scott intoned. \u201cOne week and you\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne week,\u201d she echoed, aghast.</p><p>\u201cI want you and that...that mutt out of here one week from today.\u201d</p> <p>Both dogs growled when she closed the door.</p><p>\u201cNow what am I going to do?\u201d she asked Oliver. Money was already tight, and she couldn\u2019t possibly come up with first and last month\u2019s rent in that short a time.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>I\u2019ve had the honor to cook for seven presidents of the United States here at the Waldorf-Astoria. Unless President Bush asks me to make it, fruitcake isn\u2019t on the menu.</p><p>\u2014John Doherty, executive chef,</p><p>The Waldorf-Astoria</p> <p>\u201cI have to move,\u201d Emma moaned to Phoebe when she arrived at The Dungeon the next morning.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Good friend that she was, Phoebe immediately rolled her chair across the aisle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d Emma didn\u2019t want to explain just now; it would take half the morning and she had an article to write. What bothered her most wasn\u2019t the problem of having to be out of her apartment in seven days. That was bad enough, but it wasn\u2019t what had kept her up half the night. Instead, all she could think about was Oliver\u2019s kiss. By morning, with her eyes burning from lack of sleep, she hoped she\u2019d never see him again. It wasn\u2019t true, though, Emma admitted reluctantly. She very much wanted to be with him, and that frightened her. Maybe she wasn\u2019t so different from her mother, after all.</p><p>\u201cI have news,\u201d Phoebe whispered.</p><p>Emma glanced up expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWalt and I are having some...serious conversations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d The look in Phoebe\u2019s eyes was rapturous, suggesting that the couple was on the brink of announcing their engagement.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately Walt\u2019s having a problem telling anyone at the office that we\u2019re seeing each other.\u201d</p> <p>Even Emma hadn\u2019t known until just recently. She was astonished that they\u2019d managed to keep their romance such a well-guarded secret.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to wait awhile,\u201d Phoebe said. She lowered her voice again as someone came down the stairs and passed their cubicles. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but Walt seems to think we should wait until after the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you agreed?\u201d Emma asked. Like Phoebe, she didn\u2019t understand Walt\u2019s hesitation. She doubted anyone at the office would object to his relationship with Phoebe. There might be a few raised eyebrows, but so what?</p><p>\u201cI think Walt\u2019s concerned about setting a good example. You know\u2014doing things the way his father would. I mentioned that, but he denies it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess this means I won\u2019t be able to move in with you if I don\u2019t have a new apartment by next week?\u201d Emma muttered. \u201cIt would only be for a few days\u2014until I can find a place.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe frowned. \u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, I only have a one-bedroom apartment and my sofa\u2019s pretty ratty. What\u2019s going on, anyway? I was so absorbed in my own news that I\u2019d completely ignored yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a dog now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dog?\u201d Phoebe\u2019s eyes rounded with surprise.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat no doubt involves Oliver Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d Emma sighed. \u201cAlthough I\u2019d like to blame Oliver, the dog sort of chose me. Now I have to move because the landlord is dead set against animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re desperate?\u201d</p><p>Emma sighed again; she still had six days. \u201cClose, but not panicking yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t have a dog, either,\u201d Phoebe said. \u201cI\u2019ll check and see if a visiting dog is allowed, okay?\u201d</p><p>Emma was grateful; this was a lot to ask, but she might not have any other choice. She wouldn\u2019t need to move in until next week\u2014if at all. She\u2019d certainly do her best to find something else before that.</p><p>\u201cHow did the interview go? The one in Colville?\u201d Phoebe asked.</p><p>\u201cReally well.\u201d Emma glanced longingly toward her blank computer screen. \u201cI have all my notes, but do me a favor, would you? Don\u2019t let Walt know I\u2019m here just yet. He\u2019s going to want this article and I haven\u2019t even started writing it. I intended to, but then...Well, it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOliver Hamilton is somehow involved, right?\u201d This was becoming a refrain.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he always involved?\u201d Emma said, reaching in her briefcase for her notes on Sophie McKay.</p><p>As she\u2019d told Phoebe, she wanted to blame Oliver for her current troubles, but that would be decidedly unfair. In bringing Boots home with her, Emma had taken a calculated risk. Now she had to write this article and quickly, because she needed to spend her lunch hour making phone calls. At least she had access to the very latest rental listings, she told herself. If only she could find a decent place that allowed pets and required a minimum cash outlay...</p><p>Without wasting another moment, she began drafting her article.</p><p>Lessons from Fruitcake: Sophie McKay</p><p>Sophie McKay, the second of the Washington State finalists in the Good Homemaking fruitcake contest, resides in Colville, the seat of Stevens County in the northeast part of our diverse state.</p><p>Sophie believes her entry, Chocolate Fruitcake, caught the judges\u2019 interest because it was different. She first created this fruitcake with its unusual mixture of ingredients during the Depression. Her husband, Harry, claimed to hate fruitcake, but it was an important aspect of Christmas for Sophie. Her compromise was to use his favorite foods and flavors\u2014including chocolate.</p><p>Although Harry\u2019s been dead for twenty years, Sophie continues to bake the fruitcake in his honor. And while the ingredients are indeed unusual, what makes Sophie\u2019s fruitcake special are the memories she bakes into each one.</p><p>In life, as in fruitcake, this mother of two adult sons reminds us all to use the ingredients we love. For her that includes cultivating a beautiful garden, rereading her beloved husband\u2019s wartime letters, feeding and caring for any cat that comes her way. And, of course, enjoying her family and friends.</p><p>Sophie says we shouldn\u2019t skimp on the \u201cingredients\u201d that matter to us, at Christmas or any other time. Like her, we should surround ourselves with family members and friends and share stories and laughter with them. We should cherish our memories and treat all creatures with kindness. We\u2014</p><p>Hearing someone approach, Emma looked up to discover Oliver Hamilton leaning against the partition in the narrow aisle that separated her cubicle from Phoebe\u2019s. At first, she was too shocked to respond.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she managed, before her throat went completely dry.</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve had a chance to check out new apartments yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014no, not yet.\u201d As it was, Emma had barely made it to work on time. After she\u2019d dropped Boots off at a veterinarian Oliver had recommended, she\u2019d been hard pressed to get to the office by nine.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Oliver wore a cocky grin. \u201cI have good news. There\u2019s a vacant apartment on Cherry Street. The tenant got married and he\u2019s already moved out. It\u2019ll be available right away.\u201d</p><p>This was a lovely area of Puyallup and within walking distance of the office. The cherry trees that lined the boulevard gave the street its name; they bloomed each spring in a profusion of pink blossoms. Apartments there were coveted and hard to come by. \u201cCherry Street?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf you want, I can pick you up at lunchtime and you can take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Not only were those apartments at a premium, but more than likely they\u2019d be way out of her price range.</p><p>\u201cSame as you\u2019re paying now,\u201d Oliver said, seeming pleased with himself.</p><p>This sounded too good to be true, and things that sounded too good to be true generally were. But just maybe...\u201cWhat about the first and last month\u2019s rent?\u201d</p><p>Oliver shrugged as if this were a minor consideration. \u201cA friend of mine owns the complex, and he said if your credit rating\u2019s okay, he\u2019d be willing to waive that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d This came from Phoebe.</p><p>\u201cBoots won\u2019t be a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. But Jason will want a $150 deposit in case of damage.\u201d</p><p>Only a hundred and fifty dollars\u2014this was unbelievable. She\u2019d expected it to be much more than that. She\u2019d heard of apartments that asked for five-hundred-dollar deposits when the tenant owned a pet. Emma wondered for a moment whether Oliver had gotten his facts straight. No, wait. There had to be something he wasn\u2019t telling her. \u201cNo strings attached?\u201d she asked with a skeptical look.</p><p>Oliver raised both hands. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>Emma felt as if she\u2019d won the lottery. \u201cHow come?\u201d She didn\u2019t want to examine this gift too closely, but she was still terrified there might be a catch.</p><p>Oliver ignored her question.</p><p>\u201cOliver?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right. Jason owes me a favor. I flew him and his wife to San Francisco\u2014and I promised I\u2019d do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put a hold on it for you, but Jason said he can\u2019t keep the apartment off the market any longer than one o\u2019clock this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d Emma didn\u2019t want to risk losing this opportunity. She smiled at Oliver.</p><p>\u201cSight unseen?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d better go see the place,\u201d Phoebe cautioned. \u201cIn fact, you should go now.\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded; her friend was right. Still, she hesitated. Walt would be looking for that article and all she had was an unfinished rough draft. She was going to need several hours to work on it and to shape it into the piece she wanted it to be.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take thirty, forty minutes, tops,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cWe can run over, do a quick tour and you can make up your mind then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cover for you,\u201d Phoebe promised.</p><p>\u201cBut Walt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If Walt asks where you are, I\u2019ll explain the situation to him. He\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t he be upset if he finds me skipping out in the middle of the morning?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe\u2019s eyes brightened and she shook her head. \u201cLet me take care of that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, I will.\u201d Emma reached for her coat and purse. Although she\u2019d never admit it\u2014at least not to Oliver\u2014she was delighted to see him again. She wasn\u2019t quite sure why he was being so helpful, but then she remembered his comments about ordinary men and real romance as opposed to romantic gestures. A real hero brought you and your dog a meal; he didn\u2019t worry about providing the perfect setting. He made you laugh instead of presenting you with poetic words. He found you an apartment when you needed one....</p><p>When they approached his truck, he opened the passenger door for her. Oscar barked a welcome and seemed to be looking for Boots.</p><p>Emma raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re really taking this romantic-hero stuff to heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cIf a pizza and a bag of dog food results in a kiss, I can only dream about what finding you an apartment will do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d It figured\u2014he wanted something. What all men wanted, apparently. And after she\u2019d had all these lovely thoughts about him, too.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWant to go flying with me later?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting to be a pro at this. There was hardly a peep out of you the entire flight home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was busy praying.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver shook his head. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ll have a good time.\u201d</p><p>Oliver Hamilton was not getting her back in the air, especially for the so-called fun of it. To her, flying simply wasn\u2019t entertainment. \u201cNo. N-O,\u201d she said, spelling it out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pity.\u201d</p><p>Not to her. It was life preservation.</p><p>The apartment, a ground-level corner unit, was small but well-designed. The single-story complex was fairly new but beautifully maintained, and each unit had its own front door. The surrounding doors were all decorated with wreaths and pine swags and lights. Inside, Emma was thrilled to see brand-new appliances, including a dishwasher. Sliding glass doors off the kitchen led to a fenced area in the back that would be perfect for Boots. There was even space for a container garden, which pleased Emma. Her mother had always had a garden. Emma had hated weeding and watering it as a girl. She\u2019d never believed she\u2019d miss it, but she did.</p><p>Oscar walked around, cocking his head as if confused. He looked up at Oliver, who ignored his canine friend.</p> <p>\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d Oliver asked, leaning against the kitchen counter in a nonchalant pose.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>He grinned knowingly. \u201cI thought you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Thank you, Oliver, thank you so much.\u201d Impulsively she kissed his cheek.</p><p>Not one to let an opportunity slip away, Oliver grabbed her around the waist and brought her into his arms. \u201cYou can thank me properly, you know.\u201d</p><p>She was tempted to do just that when there was a sudden knock at the open door and Oliver\u2019s friend Jason let himself in. Emma had met Jason when Oliver took her to the owner\u2019s unit to collect the key.</p><p>\u201cHave you made a decision?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Embarrassed, Emma quickly disentangled herself from Oliver\u2019s embrace. \u201cI\u2019ll take it. Just show me where to sign.\u201d</p> <p>Jason had the paperwork with him, and after reading the lease agreement, she quickly signed her name at the bottom and wrote him a check.</p><p>Jason handed her the keys, assured her she could move in anytime, and left.</p><p>\u201cYou are my hero,\u201d Emma said once the other man had gone.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Oliver murmured in modest tones.</p><p>She was half-tempted to kiss him again, but changed her mind. \u201cI suppose I should get back to the office,\u201d Emma said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I need to stop at my place first.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quibble, since he\u2019d driven her here and, more, had arranged for her new home.</p><p>He walked out, turned right and went down two doors.</p><p>Emma followed. She didn\u2019t understand, until he inserted the key into the lock, that this was his place\u2014two doors down from hers.</p><p>\u201cYou live here?\u201d she asked. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, opening the front door. It had the biggest Christmas wreath of all, and the front window sparkled with tiny white lights.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t occur to you to maybe mention this before now?\u201d She\u2019d asked him earlier if there were any strings attached and he\u2019d promised her there weren\u2019t. She should\u2019ve known.</p><p>Her tone must have conveyed the fact that she wasn\u2019t happy with this unexpected turn of events. She remained standing in the doorway, resisting the impulse to look inside, although she did catch sight of a gaily decorated Christmas tree.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t you want me for a neighbor?\u201d</p><p>She found it hard enough to keep him out of her thoughts as it was. Living two doors down from him would make it impossible. \u201cAs a matter of fact, no. Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t enter my mind. You should be grateful I found you an apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I wouldn\u2019t have needed if you hadn\u2019t opened your big mouth,\u201d she said, even though that was only partially true.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s my fault?\u201d he cried out at the unfairness of her accusation.</p><p>\u201cYes, yours.\u201d</p><p>Oliver glared at her. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms and glared right back at him.</p><p>Jason stepped up to his vehicle on the other side of the street and raised his hand. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Oliver muttered back. \u201cAnd goodwill to all mankind.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Late that afternoon, Oliver joined Walt Berwald at the tavern down the street from the newspaper office. Walt sat at the bar with his shoulders hunched forward, looking as if he\u2019d just received some piece of devastating news. His demeanor was at odds with the cheerful rendition of \u201cDeck the Halls\u201d playing on the tavern\u2019s crackling sound system.</p><p>Oliver shared Walt\u2019s sentiment. He had no idea what he\u2019d done that was so terrible. There was no mistaking Emma\u2019s irritation with him, although he\u2019d expected her to be overjoyed that he\u2019d found her an apartment. Oh, no, that would\u2019ve been far too rational. He should\u2019ve remembered that there was nothing rational about most women. His mother and one of his three sisters were the exception that proved the rule.</p><p>What really got to him was that he hadn\u2019t purposely hidden the fact that he lived in the same complex. It just hadn\u2019t seemed important, and he didn\u2019t understand why it mattered. The ride back to the newspaper office had been silent and uncomfortable. Emma hadn\u2019t been able to get out of the truck fast enough.</p><p>Walt slid his gaze to Oliver when he claimed the stool next to him, nodding morosely. The bartender looked over and Oliver motioned toward the beer in Walt\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take one of those. And get another for my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Walt said.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Neither spoke again until the beers arrived.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you so down in the dumps?\u201d Walt asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. What about you?\u201d</p><p>Walt shrugged. \u201cSame.\u201d</p><p>Women were beyond Oliver\u2019s comprehension. He had sisters and knew from experience that Emma was probably talking to Phoebe right now, describing every aspect of his many faults. Things had begun to look promising, too. He\u2019d been attracted to Emma from the start and he\u2019d been certain she felt the same way. After this morning, he was no longer sure.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going with that reporter of mine?\u201d Walt asked, reaching for his cold beer.</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d Oliver didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cEmma\u2019s got real potential as a journalist, you know.\u201d</p><p>Oliver believed that, even if he hadn\u2019t read anything she\u2019d written. This was her big shot and despite their differences, he wished her well. \u201cShe\u2019s got a few hang-ups.\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to say that aloud and was surprised to hear his own voice.</p><p>\u201cAll women do,\u201d Walt said, as if he were an authority on the subject.</p><p>\u201cYou know this from your vast research, do you?\u201d</p><p>Walt laughed and shook his head. \u201cHey, when it comes to women and relationships, I\u2019m a disaster waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>Oliver gave him a second look. Walt had always seemed secure and confident. He knew his stuff, as befitted a man who was the third generation of his family in the newspaper business. Now, however, Walt seemed to feel downright miserable.</p><p>Oliver did, too. And it was all because of Emma. It was times like these when he felt like sitting in the dark, listening to Harry Connick Jr., bourbon in hand. Either that, or go and visit his mother. Knowing her, she\u2019d pry out of him what was wrong, give him some common-sense advice and then feed him a huge dinner, as if her cabbage rolls would solve all his problems.</p><p>Oliver loved her and her stuffed cabbage, but even his mother wouldn\u2019t be able to help him understand Emma Collins.</p><p>After a second beer, Oliver slid off the stool and placed a twenty-dollar bill on the bar. \u201cSee you around,\u201d he mumbled at Walt.</p><p>Neither one of them had been very talkative.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Walt responded in the same weary tone. \u201cThanks for the beer. I\u2019ll buy next time.\u201d</p><p>Oliver nodded, and got up to head back to his truck, where Oscar was waiting impatiently inside the cab.</p><p>\u201cYou got plans for the evening?\u201d Walt asked unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d It was either his mother\u2019s cabbage rolls or listening to Harry. \u201cWhat have you got in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a friend indeed,\u201d Emma said as she came out of the bedroom dragging a cardboard box filled with books. She and Phoebe had left work early, once Emma had finished the article, skipping lunch to do it. They\u2019d collected boxes on the way to Emma\u2019s place and spent the past two hours packing. Fortunately, Boots was still at the vet\u2019s and therefore not underfoot.</p><p>Phoebe didn\u2019t seem to be listening. \u201cYou\u2019d help me move, too, if our circumstances were reversed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d Emma asked. Phoebe hadn\u2019t been her usual self since she\u2019d returned from lunch.</p><p>Sighing, her friend straightened. \u201cI met Walt for lunch. We left separately and went five miles out of our way in order not to be seen. It\u2019s ridiculous! I love Walt, but I told him I was through sneaking around.\u201d</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d Phoebe sounded firm about her decision. \u201cIf he wants to wait until after Christmas, then fine, we\u2019ll wait. But I won\u2019t see Walt again until he\u2019s willing to be open and honest about our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Emma admired her friend\u2019s courage and conviction. \u201cWhat did Walt say?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m overreacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve been feeling dreadful all afternoon, and when I left, I didn\u2019t let him know I was going to help you move. Instead, I let him assume\u2014\u201d a slow smile formed \u201c\u2014that I had...other plans.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOther plans?

You\u2019d do the same for me,\u201d Phoebe said again. \u201cWhen\u2019s the next fruitcake interview?\u201d she asked, although Emma wasn\u2019t sure why she\u2019d changed the subject.</p> <p>\u201cNext week\u2014Tuesday, I think.\u201d</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t welcome the reminder that Oliver was scheduled to fly her into Friday Harbor. She didn\u2019t want to think about him\u2014or the fact that she\u2019d soon be in the air again.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to take these over to the new place?\u201d Emma asked in an effort to derail her thoughts. She was eager to show off her apartment. An apartment she wouldn\u2019t have if it wasn\u2019t for Oliver, her conscience pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Phoebe said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d But her enthusiasm seemed forced.</p><p>Emma hesitated. \u201cDo you want to talk some more?\u201d This disagreement with Walt had really depressed her friend.</p> <p>\u201cNot especially,\u201d Phoebe murmured, revealing a little more life. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d she said again.</p><p>It was nearly seven and completely dark out. The first thing Emma noticed when she pulled up in front of the complex on Cherry Street was that Oliver\u2019s apartment lights were off; only his Christmas lights flashed a festive message. He was probably out on some hot date, she thought glumly. Despite her best efforts, her spirits sank. It shouldn\u2019t matter where he was or with whom\u2014and yet, it did.</p><p>She stood by her car, fumbling for the door key, as Phoebe\u2019s SUV drove up behind her. Carrying a couple of plants she\u2019d transported on the front seat, she joined Emma. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Em?\u201d</p><p>Emma looked at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cYou just growled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did? I was thinking what a bother moving is,\u201d she said, inventing an explanation that was also the truth.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll work as long as you want tonight.\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded her thanks. She wanted out of the old place as quickly as possible. Because she didn\u2019t own much, it hadn\u2019t taken long to pack. Books, bedding and towels, clothes, kitchen stuff. Her TV and CD player. Odds and ends. Only a few pieces of furniture remained.</p><p>They made two trips, with both her car and Phoebe\u2019s loaded, rooftop and all. Back at the old apartment, they surveyed the things that still had to be moved.</p><p>\u201cWe should take the bed over tonight,\u201d Phoebe suggested, hands on her hips as she stood in the almost-empty bedroom. \u201cThat way you\u2019ll be able to sleep at the new place.\u201d</p><p>The idea appealed to Emma. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re up to this?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe nodded.</p><p>Oliver\u2019s lights were on when they arrived with the bed and nightstand. So he was home. Not that she cared.</p><p>The mattress was the most difficult to handle. With Phoebe on one end and Emma on the other, they wrestled it out of the SUV.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starved,\u201d Emma said as she paused to take a breath. She hadn\u2019t eaten lunch; her only sustenance had come from a vending-machine pack of peanuts. \u201cWhen we finish, I\u2019m treating you to dinner. What time is it, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe didn\u2019t answer. When Emma looked around the protruding mattress, she saw why.</p><p>Oliver\u2019s apartment door was open, and Walt Berwald and Oliver stood just outside the doorway, watching them struggle.</p><p>Phoebe dropped her end of the mattress. \u201cWalt,\u201d she said in a choked voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, could you use some help?\u201d Oliver asked coolly as he stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cPhoebe?\u201d Walt sounded nervous.</p><p>Even in the dark, Emma swore her friend\u2019s cheeks blossomed brighter than the cherry trees across the street ever would. She looked directly at Walt and then\u2014reluctantly\u2014at Oliver. She realized she owed him an apology. Her ungracious and ungrateful behavior toward him had worried her all day, and she needed to make it right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that,\u201d he said, hurrying toward her end of the mattress.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, and moved aside so he could grab the mattress. \u201cFor everything.\u201d</p><p>Oliver nearly stumbled. He dropped his corner of the mattress. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, ah, was attempting to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt good to hear that. Would you mind saying it again?\u201d</p><p>Emma considered refusing, since he just wanted to rub it in. Oh, well, she supposed he deserved to hear her apology twice. Not that she intended to use the word sorry even once. She cleared her throat. \u201cI wanted to thank you for all your help,\u201d she said more loudly.</p><p>He seemed gratified. Nodding his head, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He lifted his end of the mattress again and grappled with it for a moment until he noticed that Walt hadn\u2019t taken hold of the other side. He propped the mattress against the back of the vehicle.</p><p>Emma saw that Walt and Phoebe were staring at each other. He\u2019d come to stand beside her, ignoring the mattress, Emma, everything.</p><p>\u201cWhen you said you had \u2018other plans,\u2019 you let me think they were with someone else,\u201d Walt murmured, frowning.</p><p>\u201cIt was what you deserved to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with those two?\u201d Oliver whispered, moving closer to Emma.</p><p>\u201cThey had a disagreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re seeing each other?\u201d This seemed news to him. \u201cThey\u2019re a couple?\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded, watching her friend and their boss.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking, Walt.\u201d Phoebe held her ground. She crossed her arms.</p><p>Walt exhaled and looked at Oliver. \u201cDid I just hear you ask if Phoebe and I are a couple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your business, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Walt countered, \u201cI want you to know. I love Phoebe and she loves me.\u201d He turned to face her. \u201cThere, does that satisfy you?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>With that, Walt opened his arms and Phoebe walked into his embrace. A second later, they had their arms around each other and were locked in a passionate kiss.</p><p>\u201cHey, about this mattress?\u201d Oliver whispered to Emma.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she whispered back. This was a scene normally reserved for the movies; all it lacked was a soundtrack. Emma didn\u2019t think she\u2019d seen anything more romantic in her life. \u201cIsn\u2019t this just so...so perfect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Oliver demanded, leaning against the mattress.</p><p>She scowled up at him, then understood that he really didn\u2019t get it.</p><p>\u201cHey, anyone interested in Chinese?\u201d Oliver asked.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Fruitcake\u2014love it or hate it\u2014is about the ritual of a family recipe. The longer the ritual is repeated, the more it becomes part of what is \u201cdone\u201d at the holidays. With that in mind, there are only two fruitcakes that matter to me, and I eat them over the Christmas holidays every year. One is the recipe of my Grandma Prendergast, which my dad now makes at Christmas. It never turns out exactly the same as Grandma\u2019s did, but it tastes good because it reminds me of her at the best time of year\u2014when I\u2019m with family. I eat it spread with butter, just the way Grandma served it. The other belongs to my mother-in-law, who labors over her version for weeks on end. In addition to the obvious fact that everyone should eat what their mother-in-law serves, hers are actually moist.</p><p>\u2014Kevin Prendergast, executive chef,</p><p>New York Marriott Marquis</p><p>Bright and early the next Tuesday morning, Oliver pounded on Emma\u2019s apartment door. When she didn\u2019t immediately answer, he peered inside her front window. He saw her run into the living room and stare back. Smiling, he raised a small white bag and a large cup of coffee.</p><p>If she needed any inducement to unlock her door, that was it. She was dying for a latte.</p><p>\u201cYou sweetheart,\u201d she said, letting him into her apartment. Boots was at her feet, the ready protector. She\u2019d been pronounced healthy and was scheduled to be spayed right after Christmas.</p><p>Oliver smiled and handed her the take-out latte. \u201cI have another surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of a Christmas surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Emma didn\u2019t trust that gleam in his eyes, and adding Christmas wasn\u2019t a bonus. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got us a float plane for the trip to Friday Harbor.\u201d He smiled again, as if this was something that should excite her.</p><p>\u201cA float plane,\u201d she repeated slowly. It\u2019d been difficult enough to deal with an aircraft that landed on the ground. \u201cAs in a plane that lands on water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d He positively glowed with the news. \u201cYou\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>The one small sip of latte she\u2019d taken curdled in her stomach. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do. We\u2019re flying out of Lake Union. A friend of mine is letting me use his plane and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She felt the sudden urge to sit down, but didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNow, listen,\u201d Oliver said, steering her into the kitchen and placing the white sack on the counter. It contained a large cranberry muffin, but Emma couldn\u2019t eat, nauseated as she was by the thought of flying\u2014and worse, landing\u2014in a float plane. \u201cEverything\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said soothingly. \u201cJust one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should wear sensible shoes because those docks can get slippery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, there\u2019s a chance I could fall in the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not likely, but it\u2019s been known to happen, so be extra-cautious when you\u2019re climbing into the plane, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He marched out of the kitchen, and Emma followed. Boots hung behind, gazing eagerly at the white sack.</p><p>\u201cYou can bring Boots,\u201d Oliver said before she could even ask.</p><p>Emma threw on her coat, scooped up Boots and grabbed her briefcase for this last interview, which would be in the San Juan Islands. Emma had spoken to Peggy Lucas by phone, and she sounded like a woman in her thirties, much younger than the other finalists. Emma was looking forward to chatting with her about her No-Bake Fruitcake recipe.</p><p>Oliver opened the truck door for her and Boots, and Emma thanked him politely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all part of being a romantic hero,\u201d he reminded her with what she thought was a smirk.</p><p>Both dogs were in the truck, and the cab was crowded. \u201cIf I slip off the dock, I\u2019m going to blame you,\u201d she said as she fastened the seat belt around her and Boots. Before they left, Emma had changed her shoes twice. In the end, she\u2019d decided on tennis shoes with rubber soles, although they didn\u2019t do much for her dark-gray pantsuit.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you blame me?\u201d Oliver asked as they merged into the traffic on Interstate 5.</p><p>She tapped her finger against her temple. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who put the idea in my head.\u201d He\u2019d added a brand-new element to her fears, as if she needed more to worry about. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can swim, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Actually, Emma was a capable swimmer. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s only fair to let you know that if you go in the water you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cMy hero.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy hero, nothing. The water this time of year is damn cold.\u201d</p><p>Emma performed some contortions to look at the soles of her shoes once more, checking the treads.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d His eyes sparkled with delight; Oliver Hamilton was enjoying himself far too much.</p><p>Lake Union was situated between Puget Sound and Lake Washington, with canals that connected both. One of Emma\u2019s favorite movies was Sleepless in Seattle, and she remembered that the houseboat the Tom Hanks character and his son had lived in was situated on Lake Union. She knew these houseboats were very expensive, and as Oliver drove closer, Emma saw a number of them in the distance. Cheerful, flashing Christmas lights strung around the decks were reflected on the still surface of the lake. One houseboat had Santa poised on the roof with a sleigh and eight reindeer. Everyone who lived on the lake was apparently serious about observing the holiday spirit. Just like all her new neighbors....</p><p>As they continued on the road around the lake, the float planes came into view, and Emma immediately tensed. From her long-ago yoga classes, she knew the best cure for that was to draw in deep, even breaths. In to the count of eight, out to the\u2014</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d Oliver asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m practicing my breathing exercises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was for when you\u2019re in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spent time in labor rooms, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but my sister has, and she told me all about that breathing thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to remain calm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDriving frightens you, too?\u201d</p><p>Emma looked out the window. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Once they arrived at the dock where the float planes were tied up, it was immediately apparent that Oliver was well-known and well-liked. He introduced her to his friends and then led her out to the dock. Emma tested her footing with each step.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to fall from the middle of the dock,\u201d Oliver said scathingly. Boots and Oscar ran circles around them both, barking and playing.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be too careful.\u201d</p><p>He said something under his breath that she couldn\u2019t understand, but considering the irritation lining his mouth and eyes, that was probably for the best. Taking slow, careful steps, it took her five minutes to get to the end of the dock. Oliver got there maybe three minutes earlier, and he didn\u2019t conceal his impatience for one second of that time.</p><p>Stepping onto the pontoon, he opened the door to the cockpit. Then he lifted Oscar and placed the terrier in the back. Next he swooped Boots into his arms and set her inside, as well. Emma stood there frozen, afraid to inch forward.</p><p>\u201cWill you put my briefcase and purse in, too?\u201d she asked, pushing them toward Oliver.</p> <p>Oliver did as she requested and then extended his arm, urging her forward. \u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked. He was balancing one foot on the dock and the other on the pontoon.</p><p>She nodded anxiously. Her heart was beating so fast she could hear the echo in her ears. Putting all her faith in Oliver, she stretched her arm toward his and stepped off the deck. She made the transition from dock to plane easily and was astonished that she\u2019d allowed his warnings to fill her with dread.</p><p>\u201cI did it!\u201d she said, feeling triumphant.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d Oliver smiled. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Emma crawled into the passenger seat, pulled the seat belt toward her and locked it into place. Both Oscar and Boots were in the back, next to her purse and briefcase.</p><p>A boat went past and the wake rocked the plane. Standing on the dock, Oliver untied the craft and pushed off. Not a second later, Emma heard a tremendous splash. She didn\u2019t immediately understand what had happened. Then it hit her.</p><p>Oliver had slipped and fallen into the lake.</p><p>Caught in the boat\u2019s wake, the plane drifted toward the middle of Lake Union.</p><p>Scrambling out of her seat belt, Emma was on her knees in the pilot\u2019s seat. \u201cOliver! Oliver! What should I do?\u201d</p><p>In response, he started swimming out after her. She covered her mouth. With part of her she wanted to laugh, and with the other she was holding back tears.</p><p>Oliver reached the plane a moment later. He levered himself up onto the pontoon and glared at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say a word,\u201d he managed from between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cBut Oliver...\u201d</p><p>He stood on the pontoon, water streaming off him, and grabbed the plane\u2019s wheel, steering the aircraft back toward the dock. A couple of pilots were waiting for him. Oliver tossed them the rope and they efficiently tied down the plane. One handed him a towel as he climbed onto the dock. There was a lot of good-natured teasing, but she noticed that Oliver didn\u2019t have a whole lot to say.</p><p>\u201cIt happens to all of us at one time or another,\u201d his friend consoled him.</p><p>Oliver threw the towel over his shoulders, shivering visibly.</p><p>His lips were blue.</p><p>Emma felt terrible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an extra set of clothes,\u201d she heard one of the other pilots tell him as they led him away.</p><p>She stayed where she was, unwilling to risk climbing onto the dock again. Twenty minutes passed before Oliver reappeared. His mood didn\u2019t seem to have improved.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a damn fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Oliver, you were wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Her comment didn\u2019t amuse him. \u201cSo you enjoyed that spectacle, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, not really, but you swam after me. That was the most romantic thing you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was?\u201d He sounded a bit puzzled.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou truly are my hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that,\u201d he said confidently.</p><p>\u201cOh, for goodness\u2019 sake.\u201d</p><p>They taxied farther onto Lake Union with only a minimum of fuss and took off.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Emma enjoyed the flight. She wasn\u2019t nearly as afraid as she\u2019d been in the Cessna Caravan. Thinking about it, she realized it was because of the pontoons\u2014if the plane went down, they\u2019d float. That might be false security, of course; if they did crash on the water the plane would probably disintegrate on impact, but she didn\u2019t let that destroy her illusions of safety.</p><p>While flying, Oliver acted as a tour guide, showing her various points of interest. The San Juan Islands, she learned, were a cluster of 743 rocky islands of different sizes, situated in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound. Only about sixty of the islands were populated, according to Oliver, who seemed to know the area quite well.</p><p>The largest of the islands, San Juan Island, was home to the bustling town of Friday Harbor. Emma remembered reading about the annual jazz festival in late summer. The island was also a popular site for whale watching. Emma hoped to join one of the expeditions next summer, since she\u2019d never seen a whale in the wild. She didn\u2019t think she could count visiting Sea World.</p><p>\u201cI have a confession,\u201d Oliver said, frowning. \u201cI\u2019m not as much of a hero as you seem to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. You swam out and saved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to disillusion you, Emma, but I wasn\u2019t swimming after you. I was going for the plane. Do you know how much one of these is worth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, if I\u2019d been in a canoe you would\u2019ve let me drift off into the sunset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, \u201cbe honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve taken a hot shower and changed clothes and then gone looking for you in a speedboat.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so maybe he was right. He wasn\u2019t as much of a hero as she\u2019d assumed.</p><p>He sneezed violently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re catching a cold. You should take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>He dismissed her concern. \u201cI\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need hot soup and extra vitamin C and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He placed his hand on her arm. \u201cAnd a whole lot of lovin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Boy, had she asked for that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said with a smirk. \u201cGo do your interview. I\u2019ll be waiting here when you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>Emma had been looking forward to this interview ever since she\u2019d spoken to Peggy on Monday afternoon. Her sudden reluctance to leave Oliver was hard to explain.</p><p>He climbed out, tied up the float plane and then helped her out. Clasping his hand, Emma leaped from the plane onto the dock, which rocked gently when she landed.</p><p>Oliver retrieved her purse and briefcase and handed them to her.</p><p>One of Peggy\u2019s neighbors was waiting to drive her to the Lucas home.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be gone long,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cThe dogs and I will be fine. Now go.\u201d For the first time since he\u2019d crashed into the water, Oliver grinned.</p><p>Emma couldn\u2019t stop herself. Still holding tightly to her purse and briefcase, she kissed Oliver. He slid his arms around her and kissed her back. Soon they were so involved in each other, it was a wonder they both didn\u2019t slip off the dock.</p><p>That was when Emma knew she\u2019d fallen in love with Oliver Hamilton.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Those who don\u2019t like fruitcake have never had a white fruitcake.</p><p>\u2014Nathalie Dupree,</p><p>cookbook author and television personality</p><p>Peggy Lucas\u2019s matter-of-fact humor had Emma laughing even before she was in the front door of the fifties-style tract home in Friday Harbor. The neighbor, Sally, had dropped her off with a cheerful goodbye, after telling her repeatedly how proud everyone was of Peggy, how delicious her fruitcake was, how they were all convinced she\u2019d win.</p><p>Peggy and her husband, Larry, had four small children. Children\u2019s toys littered the lawn surrounding a bigger-than-life blow-up snowman that was anchored to the ground.</p><p>The oldest child, Rosalie, was in first grade and the second daughter, Abby, was a year younger. Two little boys, Trevor and Dylan, rushed onto the small front porch to greet her, hiding behind their mother\u2019s legs. Emma guessed the boys\u2019 ages to be around four and two. The two younger ones seemed to be best buddies, although they were constantly bickering.</p><p>\u201cPlease excuse the mess,\u201d Peggy said as she ushered Emma into the living room. A small Christmas tree stood in the corner, decorated with what appeared to be hand-crafted ornaments. It reminded Emma of the tree in the \u201cPeanuts\u201d cartoons, the Charlie Brown tree\u2014a little skimpy and with a definite homemade quality. The children had made a chain of colored paper loops and strung popcorn and cranberries. A small array of badly wrapped gifts circled the base.</p><p>Peggy hurriedly removed clean laundry from the recliner and motioned for Emma to take what was clearly the best seat in the house.</p><p>Emma appeared to be the main attraction. All four children gathered around their mother and stared at the stranger in their living room. Rosalie was still dressed in her pajamas.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s home from school today because of a cold,\u201d Peggy explained. \u201cAbby, too. This is cold and flu season. It\u2019s the last week of classes, and I hate to have them miss out, but I can\u2019t expose the entire class to their germs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma nodded, sympathizing with the young mother.</p><p>\u201cGo and play,\u201d Peggy instructed the kids, but they refused to budge. Emma wondered if they feared that the minute they left the room, she\u2019d abscond with the Christmas presents.</p><p>Peggy sat down on the ottoman with her children gathered around her like a small herd of lambs.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your fruitcake recipe,\u201d Emma said when she\u2019d retrieved pen and pad from her briefcase.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to tell. I concocted it myself a little while ago, using several fruitcake recipes I found in one of my mother\u2019s old cookbooks. I also found a newspaper clipping that dated back to the 1960s, which must\u2019ve been mailed to my mom by my grandmother. Everyone in the family loves fruitcake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you grew up with fruitcake?\u201d</p><p>Peggy smiled. \u201cMom bakes it every Christmas. It\u2019s a family tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you do, too?\u201d</p><p>Peggy smiled again. \u201cWith some significant differences. My recipe isn\u2019t a typical one, although I use all the same ingredients most everyone uses in fruitcake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like Mama\u2019s fruitcake,\u201d Rosalie whispered, her face averted so she wouldn\u2019t have to look at Emma.</p><p>\u201cIs it good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal good,\u201d Abby added without a hint of shyness. \u201cIt\u2019s the best, and my mama\u2019s going to win. That\u2019s what our daddy says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you submit the recipe to Good Homemaking magazine?\u201d This wasn\u2019t a question she\u2019d asked the other Washington State finalists, but Emma found she was curious about Peggy\u2019s reasons. Both Earleen Williams and Sophie McKay had perfected their recipes through the years. That didn\u2019t seem to be the case with Peggy.</p><p>The young mother blushed. \u201cMy husband encouraged me to enter, so I did. No one was more surprised than me when I found out I was a finalist.\u201d She lifted Dylan onto her lap and the little boy leaned his head against her shoulder and promptly placed his thumb in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cExactly how long have you been using this recipe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Peggy repeated, and the question seemed to fluster her. Her hand went to her hair, as if she was afraid it needed attention. \u201cActually, the first one I baked was last December\u2014a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. It must be good.\u201d If this relatively untried recipe was a finalist, it had to be impressive.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to taste a slice?\u201d Peggy asked. Setting Dylan aside despite his mumbled protests, she stood.</p><p>Emma imagined this young mother wasn\u2019t accustomed to sitting down for any length of time. A buzzer went off in the distance, signaling that the dryer had finished its cycle.</p><p>\u201cRosalie, take the sheets out of the dryer, would you?\u201d</p><p>The oldest girl left the room, and the three remaining children all stared at Emma, the youngest with his thumb still firmly planted in his mouth.</p><p>Rosalie returned a minute later, her arms wrapped around a huge load of fresh laundry. \u201cWhere should I put them? The reporter lady is sitting in the chair.\u201d Apparently the recliner was the spot for sorting clean laundry.</p><p>\u201cI can move,\u201d Emma volunteered, although she didn\u2019t know where. The one other piece of furniture was a sofa, and that appeared to be functioning as a sickbed for the two girls.</p> <p>\u201cGo and put them on my bed,\u201d Peggy shouted from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d Abby cried in sudden alarm. \u201cDylan has to go potty.\u201d</p><p>Emma hadn\u2019t noticed but, sure enough, the youngest boy was holding himself and crossing and uncrossing his legs.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s his blankie?\u201d Peggy asked calmly, coming in from the kitchen.</p><p>Peggy and the three children sprang into action, launching what was obviously a familiar and well-rehearsed routine. The two girls hurried out of the room and Trevor scrambled under the coffee table, crawling on all fours. Emma stood, fearing she was in the way.</p><p>Peggy grabbed Dylan and, holding the two-year-old at arm\u2019s length, carried him from the room. She disappeared into the hallway.</p><p>Never having witnessed anything like this, Emma followed and watched with interest as Peggy got her youngest son on the kiddie toilet. Dylan madly waved his arms, resembling a young bird about to take flight. Rosalie leaped into the room with a tattered yellow blanket.</p><p>\u201cThe duck?\u201d Peggy asked. \u201cHas anyone found the duck?\u201d</p><p>Trevor was the hero of the hour. He slid into the tiny bathroom on his stocking feet, then thrust the plush duck at his brother.</p><p>As soon as Dylan had both his yellow blanket and his duck, he let out a tremendous sigh. His shoulders relaxed and a slow smile came over his face. Apparently he could now relax enough to concentrate on the job.</p><p>\u201cGood boy,\u201d Peggy cheered and started to clap.</p><p>So did Dylan\u2019s three siblings, and because it seemed the thing to do, Emma joined in.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to get sidetracked from the interview, but she couldn\u2019t help being curious about the minor production she\u2019d just witnessed.</p><p>\u201cDylan\u2019s afraid of the potty chair,\u201d Abby explained after Emma asked. \u201cThe only way he can go is if he has his security blanket and his favorite duck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has more than one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got three\u2014white and orange and yellow, but he only wants the yellow one.\u201d Again it was Abby who explained. \u201cIt has to be that one.\u201d</p><p>Dylan smiled and his thumb came out of his mouth when he\u2019d finished his task. Peggy pulled up his pants and led the youngster to the sink. Dylan pushed the step stool over, then by himself turned on the water and washed his hands. When he\u2019d finished, he looked to his mother and siblings for another round of applause.</p><p>\u201cSorry for the interruption,\u201d Peggy said, lifting the little boy into her arms. The six of them returned to the living room, a ragtag parade.</p><p>\u201cLet me get you that fruitcake,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cI left it in the kitchen.\u201d Still holding Dylan, she retreated to the kitchen and came back with a small plate.</p><p>To Emma\u2019s surprise the fruitcake was a light brown. The candied fruits liberally spread throughout the slice made her think of a stained glass window. \u201cIt\u2019s different, all right,\u201d she told Peggy. \u201cVery pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe recipe is no-bake.\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded. \u201cI know, but what exactly does that mean? The ingredients aren\u2019t raw, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Peggy said with a laugh. \u201cI use graham cracker crumbs. Not surprisingly, graham crackers are a staple around here. That\u2019s the base that holds everything together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She took a small bite. This cake really was unusual, filled with nuts and the brilliantly colored candied fruit and something else\u2014something she couldn\u2019t quite identify. Could it be marshmallows? Peggy had kindly agreed to share the recipe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the first person who\u2019s come up with this no-bake concept. It\u2019s surprising how well it works.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s second bite confirmed her initial opinion. The flavors melded together in a delectable sweet taste. Sweet but not too sweet, Emma decided. At the start of this assignment, she hadn\u2019t liked fruitcake, and now she was a connoisseur. Every recipe she\u2019d sampled was unique, although each was based on traditional ingredients. If the three finalists\u2019 recipes from Washington State were this innovative, she could only speculate what the other nine recipes must be like.</p><p>\u201cWith my family, a cake doesn\u2019t last more than a day or two,\u201d Peggy said, describing what had inspired the revised recipe. \u201cMy children don\u2019t understand the concept of leaving a cake for several weeks in order to refine the flavors. They want to eat it now. The traditional fruitcake my mother makes is excellent. Every year she starts baking right after Thanksgiving. She\u2019ll bathe the cake in rum for weeks and then on Christmas Eve we have this ceremony and Dad slices it for the first time. In theory that\u2019s great, but it doesn\u2019t work around here.\u201d She grinned. \u201cAnd the quantity of booze isn\u2019t appropriate for kids, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor ate Mom\u2019s cake,\u201d Abby said, pointing to her little brother. \u201cLast year. At Grandma\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid, too. And then he fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Peggy raised her hand and the squabbling ceased. \u201cThat convinced me to try something different. So I came up with this idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t always make it the same, either,\u201d Rosalie said proudly. \u201cSometimes Mom adds different stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe put caramels in one time,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>Rosalie made a face. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it again, although I like the version with melted marshmallows.\u201d</p><p>That sounded interesting, too. \u201cWill you tell me about yourself?\u201d Emma asked, turning to Peggy.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Peggy said, sounding surprised. \u201cThere\u2019s not much to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou married young.\u201d That much was obvious.</p><p>Peggy nodded. \u201cI met Larry shortly after I graduated from high school. I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do with my life and was working at a Starbucks and taking a few college classes. Larry was working for a plumber and had just become certified by the Department of Labor and Industries. He\u2019s almost five years older than me, and we both wanted children. We\u2019d been dating for a while and decided to marry.\u201d She smiled and looked slightly embarrassed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start out wanting four children, but now that we\u2019ve got them...\u201d Peggy wrapped her arms around her brood. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do with the prize money if you win?\u201d Emma asked. This was a new question.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cWe\u2019d use it as a down payment on a small farm. Larry has always been an animal person and we were hoping to buy an alpaca or two. Eventually I\u2019d like to weave my own yarn. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always dreamed of doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you do win,\u201d Emma said, and meant it. She wished that for all three of the Washington State finalists.</p><p>\u201cWould you like another piece?\u201d Peggy asked.</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d Trevor volunteered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost lunchtime,\u201d his mother told him.</p><p>The little boy\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cI can have fruitcake for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it now,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>That comment could serve as part of the opening paragraph. Emma stayed long enough to have a cup of tea and another slice of fruitcake with Peggy Lucas. While Peggy worked in the kitchen, preparing peanutbutter-and-jelly sandwiches for her children and heating up soup, Emma sat at the kitchen table and they talked. Eventually the children lost interest in her and wandered back to their bedroom to play. All four, Emma noted, slept in the same room. It made for tight quarters but no one seemed to mind.</p><p>By the time Sally, Peggy\u2019s neighbor, returned her to the waterfront, ideas for the article were tumbling over each other in Emma\u2019s mind.</p><p>Oliver stood on the dock next to the plane, waiting. Whatever business had brought him to Friday Harbor seemed to have been completed. Oscar and Boots wandered up and down the pier, sniffing around curiously, but as soon as they saw Emma, both dogs leaped up repeatedly and barked for joy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Oliver asked, walking toward her in his borrowed leather jacket. It was a little too small and his wrists stuck out, looking oddly vulnerable.</p><p>Her heart jumped when she saw him, leaping about in a way that reminded her of the dogs\u2019 exuberant display.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said and then amended, \u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked the fruitcake?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLoved it.\u201d She opened her purse and brought out a small slice wrapped in plastic. \u201cPeggy insisted I bring this for you.\u201d</p><p>A cocky grin slid effortlessly into place. \u201cSo you mentioned me?\u201d</p><p>Emma had, in an offhand manner, during their conversation in the kitchen. Something in her tone must have indicated that Oliver was more to her than a means of transportation, because Peggy picked up on it right away. Despite Emma\u2019s protests that it wasn\u2019t necessary, Peggy had given her a slice of fruitcake for Oliver, too.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t immediately respond, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll bet you told her you\u2019re crazy about me.\u201d</p><p>Emma had no intention of pandering to his ego. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything of the kind,\u201d she told him briskly. \u201cAre you ready to leave?\u201d</p> <p>Oliver laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re that eager to fly again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I just want to get it over with.\u201d That was true enough. More importantly, she wanted to sit at her computer and organize her thoughts while they were fresh in her mind.</p><p>\u201cOne of these days you\u2019ll admit you can\u2019t live without me.\u201d He stepped onto the pontoon and opened the plane\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cI just might,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Her words appeared to shock him because Oliver nearly slipped. He grabbed hold of the door; otherwise he would\u2019ve fallen into the icy water a second time.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d he demanded gruffly.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she said, highly amused. \u201cIt was a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>As a matter of fact, Emma thought so, too. Even if there was more truth in that remark than she wanted him to know.</p><p>Peggy Lucas\u2019s No-Bake Fruitcake with Marshmallows</p><p>1 cup raisins (dark or golden)</p><p>2 cups dates</p><p>2 cups mixed candied fruit</p><p>4 cups chopped nuts ( you can reduce this to 3 cups if desired)</p> <p>3\u20444 cup evaporated milk</p><p>2 cups marshmallows</p><p>2 cups very finely crushed graham crackers</p><p>Mix raisins, dates, candied fruit and chopped nuts in a large bowl. In a saucepan (or in a bowl in the microwave) bring evaporated milk to a boil, add marshmallows and stir until thoroughly combined and marshmallows are melted. Grind the graham crackers in the food processor (one package at a time) until they are very finely ground (like flour). You can also use packaged graham cracker crumbs. Stir the graham crackers into the fruit-and-nut mixture. Add the marshmallow mixture. With wet hands, mix all ingredients. Rinse hands, wet them again and press the mixture into a 9 inch x 5 inch loaf pan lined with wax paper. Press it down well and refrigerate for 2 days until set.</p><p>Note: If you use 1\u20442 cup candied fruit, 1\u20442 cup flaked coconut and 1 cup candied pineapple instead of 2 cups candied fruit, the cake has a tropical taste. If mixture seems too dry, add a little orange juice or strawberry jam. Don\u2019t worry if it seems too wet, because as it sets the graham cracker crumbs will absorb the liquid.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The first time I had fruitcake was as an adult at a coffee shop in Paris. The amount of sherry is simply overwhelming and the cake is too heavy and sweet for my taste. And with so many fruits, there is no specific taste. For my family, the apple-cranberry tart is our traditional holiday cake.</p><p>\u2014Jasmine Bojic, executive pastry chef,</p><p>Tavern on the Green, New York City</p><p>Emma sat at her computer, which she\u2019d set up on the kitchen table, trying to work on her article. When Oliver had finally landed at Lake Union again and they\u2019d started back to Puyallup, it was rush hour. The Seattle traffic inched along Interstate 5; what normally would have been an easy half-hour drive took almost ninety minutes. Emma\u2019s nerves were frayed and she didn\u2019t even attempt to go to the office.</p><p>Oliver had dropped her and Boots off at the apartment. \u201cWould you like to come in and have a hot drink?\u201d she\u2019d asked. It was the first time she\u2019d made such an offer and she\u2019d expected him to accept her invitation instantly.</p><p>Oliver hesitated. \u201cSome other time.\u201d</p><p>His rejection took her by surprise. Not knowing how to respond, she mumbled her thanks for the ride and climbed out of the truck, retrieving Boots and her briefcase. She stood on the sidewalk and watched him drive away. He obviously wasn\u2019t going home.</p><p>Oliver was out of sight within seconds. Emma had wanted to demand that he tell her where he was going, but she couldn\u2019t. It was none of her business. Besides, she reminded herself, she had a dozen things to do, all of which were more important than frittering away time with an unresponsive and ungrateful man. \u201cI have an article to write,\u201d she mumbled to no one in particular.</p><p>But even now, an hour after he\u2019d left, Emma\u2019s mind continually wandered back to Oliver. Boots seemed unsettled, too. Her dog ran back and forth from the kitchen to the front window, hopping onto the chair and peering out at the street. Boots obviously missed her two companions.</p><p>Emma shared the feeling. She didn\u2019t want to care about Oliver, but she did. This was too similar to the way her mother had behaved toward her husband, which Emma had hated. Bret had acted as if Pamela should be grateful for whatever crumbs of his life he offered them.</p><p>Emma forced herself to think about the interview with Peggy Lucas. She\u2019d enjoyed meeting Peggy and her children, and...</p><p>Oliver was up to something. Emma knew it\u2014there, she\u2019d done it again. No matter how hard she tried, her mind was filled with thoughts of Oliver.</p><p>She got up and walked over to the window, petting Boots, who\u2019d jumped into the chair to stand guard. This late in the afternoon, there was little activity outside. The streetlights had come on, casting a warm glow that illuminated the Christmas bells that hung from each lamp post.</p><p>Emma drew her sweater more tightly around her. She refused to think about Oliver anymore. No\u2014not for another second. She sat down at the kitchen table again with a cup of tea and read over the opening paragraph she\u2019d drafted. With her interview notes propped next to the monitor, she resumed writing.</p><p>Lessons From Fruitcake: Peggy Lucas</p><p>Peggy Lucas is the third Washington State resident to place in Good Homemaking magazine\u2019s national fruitcake contest. Her motto\u2014inspired by her children\u2014is EAT IT NOW. The young wife and mother, who lives in Friday Harbor, married her plumber husband as a teenager, and they have four children ranging in age from two to six.</p><p>It was for her children that Peggy created the recipe for this no-bake Christmas fruitcake. Like all kids, her children lacked the patience to wait months for a traditional fruitcake. As four-year-old Trevor said, \u201cI want it now.\u201d</p><p>His three siblings agreed with him, and Peggy devised this unusual recipe, which can be made overnight and eaten immediately.</p><p>As with the two previous finalists, there are lessons to be learned from Peggy\u2019s fruitcake. Earleen Williams was determined to bake the perfect fruitcake, a masterpiece, and while it took her many years and three marriages, she discovered that she was the masterpiece.</p><p>Sophie McKay bakes her fruitcake using unexpected ingredients, including maraschino cherries and semisweet chocolate chips, because those were the ingredients her late husband enjoyed. She blends pineapple and coconut with chocolate liqueur, and her recipe is a compromise between the traditional way of doing something and individual preferences. Her lesson: Use the ingredients you like. Do what you love.</p><p>Last, there is Peggy Lucas with her four young children, eager to partake of anything Christmas. She couldn\u2019t bear to make them wait even a day for their special cake. Her fruitcake is meant to be enjoyed right away. According to Peggy, life\u2019s like that. Enjoy it now.</p><p>Three finalists, three valuable lessons that\u2014</p><p>Emma sighed and saved her draft, then shut down her computer. She couldn\u2019t concentrate on fruitcake anymore, or metaphors for life. Her mind wasn\u2019t on Peggy but on Oliver.</p><p>In order to distract herself from memories of the man, she phoned Phoebe.</p><p>\u201cHello, Emma,\u201d Phoebe said, picking up after five rings, just before the answering machine came on.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long to get to the phone?\u201d Emma wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>Emma could almost hear her friend blush and suddenly understood. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone, are you?\u201d</p><p>Again the hesitation. \u201cNot at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it, by chance, anyone I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d</p><p>Her friend\u2019s face would be beet-red by now. \u201cIs it...drumroll, please...Walt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more,\u201d Emma murmured. \u201cCall me when you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d Emma replaced the telephone receiver, more depressed than before. Everyone she met was in love. Okay, maybe not everyone; it just felt that way. Ever since the night Phoebe had helped Emma move, she and Walt were practically never apart. They hadn\u2019t made a big announcement, but everyone at the office knew. Emma didn\u2019t understand why Walt had been so concerned. Their romance had barely been a blip on the office gossip monitor. They seemed to suit each other; Phoebe\u2019s sense of adventure balanced Walt\u2019s caution. Their relationship struck her as natural and healthy, now that it was out in the open.</p><p>Emma gave another deep sigh. What did she know about healthy relationships, anyway? With her parents as an example, she was destined to mess up. Falling for Oliver Hamilton was a prime example of that.</p><p>Emma covered her face with her hands, hating this sense of despair.</p><p>The doorbell chimed and her heart kicked into overdrive. It had to be Oliver! She hoped it was him. No, she didn\u2019t. Yes, she did.</p><p>If ever Emma understood her mother\u2019s feelings about her father, it was now. She wanted to slam the door in Oliver\u2019s face and yet, at the same time, she wanted to hug and kiss him.</p><p>The doorbell chimed again.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked, stalling for time.</p><p>\u201cLook through your peephole.\u201d</p><p>It was Oliver\u2019s voice. \u201cUh, is there something you want?\u201d she asked. Should she let him in or not?</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t check the peephole, did you?\u201d</p><p>She did, then gasped at what she saw. Oliver stood there with the largest, most beautiful Christmas tree she\u2019d ever seen. It was the kind of tree the White House put up every year. Or Rockefeller Center. Definitely not as big, but about as perfect as a tree could get.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to let me in?\u201d</p><p>She unlatched the lock and swung open the door.</p><p>Boots and Oscar raced toward each other as if it\u2019d been years since their last meeting. Emma had wondered if they\u2019d ever get beyond the stage of sniffing each other\u2019s butts. Although she supposed that was like saying \u201cHello\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s new?\u201d in the dog world.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Oliver said proudly, clutching the tree by its trunk. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma stared. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.\u201d She tried to figure out where he planned to put it. In his dining room, perhaps? She recalled catching a glimpse of one in his living room last week, glittering with decorations.</p><p>He smiled as he thrust the tree at her. \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>She backed away a step. \u201cMerry Christmas to you, too.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to one side. \u201cWhere do you want it?\u201d</p> <p>Emma leaned closer in order to hear him better. \u201cWant it? This tree is for me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes. Isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d</p><p>Emma took another step backward.</p><p>He blinked, as if he\u2019d been expecting her to throw her arms around him in gratitude. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I like it. That\u2019s the most beautiful Christmas tree I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Emma froze. He\u2019d been serious about giving her the tree. Her\u2014a woman who didn\u2019t have a stand or ornaments or anything else one needed for a Christmas tree.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of...big, don\u2019t you think?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI might need to take a bit more off the bottom, but no, it\u2019s not too big. I thought you could do with a bit of Christmas cheer, and I decided to make a contribution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll thank me later.\u201d</p> <p>Emma wasn\u2019t sure about that. Not sure at all.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything so big in my life,\u201d Emma complained to Phoebe. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even ask me if I wanted a Christmas tree.\u201d Thanks to her unenthusiastic response, Oliver hadn\u2019t spoken to her in two days. Now Emma was miserable and needed to talk with her friend.</p><p>Phoebe frowned. \u201cBut don\u2019t you think bringing you a Christmas tree was very romantic of Oliver?\u201d</p><p>Emma stopped her pacing, deep in The Dungeon, as she considered this. \u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d That hadn\u2019t even occurred to her. She pressed her hand to her forehead, then flopped down in her chair. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d She should\u2019ve realized earlier what had prompted him to buy her a tree. \u201cOliver thought he was being romantic.\u201d They\u2019d had this ongoing conversation about romantic heroes and she\u2019d failed to recognize what he was doing. The tree was his way of being romantic according to his theory of \u201cshow, not tell\u201d romance. Action rather than words.</p><p>\u201cYes! Oliver was being romantic,\u201d Phoebe insisted. \u201cYou\u2019ve really fallen for him, haven\u2019t you?\u201d She smiled\u2014a smile that could only be described as smug.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s arrogant and dogmatic, opinionated and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Phoebe\u2019s smile grew even wider. \u201cI thought so.\u201d She returned to work as if there was nothing left to argue about.</p> <p>Emma felt she couldn\u2019t leave her friend with that impression. Phoebe might say something to Walt, and Oliver and Walt were pals. She wasn\u2019t ready to acknowledge her feelings for Oliver, wasn\u2019t even sure those feelings would last long enough to be worth acknowledging.</p><p>\u201cI think Oliver\u2019s a good pilot,\u201d she said, carefully weighing her words. \u201cWe\u2019ve each made an effort to make the best of an uncomfortable situation.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe ignored her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right....\u201d Emma admitted reluctantly, walking over to her friend\u2019s desk. She folded her arms and spoke casually. \u201cThere was a slight attraction in the beginning. We even joked about it.\u201d Well...Oliver had joked.</p><p>Phoebe turned and looked up at Emma. \u201cDid he or did he not kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe...ah, okay, yes, there were a couple of times when I...that happened. So technically, yes, he did kiss me.\u201d This was all she was willing to say on the subject.</p><p>\u201cSo there was more than the one time?\u201d Phoebe probed.</p><p>\u201cThere might have been.\u201d Emma wanted her friend to stop studying her with that appraising light in her eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said Oliver\u2019s your romantic hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I said it looked like Oliver was just proving a point.\u201d She wished he wouldn\u2019t try so hard, but she didn\u2019t know how to make him stop. The entire conversation about romantic heroes had come about by chance. But now he seemed to be going out of his way to prove that he was every bit as romantic as Humphrey Bogart or Cary Grant.</p><p>Emma sat at her desk, hardly able to concentrate. She\u2019d be leaving the office in a few minutes to drum up advertisements for the newspaper. During the fruitcake interviews, Walt had excused her from that responsibility. Apparently his arrangement with Oliver had sparked an idea, and Walt was now willing to trade newspaper space for goods and services. Rumor had it that the Subway Express down the street would be catering the company Christmas lunch. Talk around the water cooler was that Walt had worked out some sort of deal with the owner\u2014three weekly ads in exchange for thirty turkey sandwiches, pickles and coleslaw on the side. Thankfully, he hadn\u2019t been negotiating with the Mexican restaurant/sushi bar. Cross-cultural restaurants weren\u2019t so rare in small towns, but this was a combination Emma found a little bizarre.</p><p>\u201cHow are things going with you and Walt?\u201d Emma asked, deciding it was her turn to ask personal questions.</p><p>Phoebe glowed. \u201cFabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to have Christmas dinner with his family.\u201d</p><p>This was big, and Emma released a low whistle.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having two dinners that day,\u201d Phoebe went on to explain. \u201cFirst with my mom and dad, and then later with his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you like turkey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Phoebe assured her. \u201cBut my mom\u2019s serving prime rib and I don\u2019t know about his mother. What are you doing for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>Christmas fell on a Sunday this year, and Emma wouldn\u2019t be doing anything special. She\u2019d probably do what she had the year before\u2014attend a movie and have buttered popcorn for dinner. It would be a day like any other.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plans.\u201d She hated to lie, so she remained vague. If she mentioned going to a movie, Phoebe would feel sorry for her and then find a way to include her. Emma didn\u2019t want to intrude on Phoebe and her family, or on Walt and his.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of plans?\u201d Phoebe pressed.</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t want to be rude or arouse her suspicions, so she played it coy. \u201cPrivate plans,\u201d she said, dropping her voice until it was almost a purr.</p><p>This was a mistake because Phoebe\u2019s curiosity was certainly piqued now. \u201cThey involve Oliver, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could.\u201d Emma reached for her coat and purse, anxious to leave.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me later?\u201d</p><p>Emma sighed deeply. \u201cYes, but only if you torture it out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be arranged,\u201d a gruff male voice said from behind her.</p><p>Both Phoebe and Emma gasped as Walt stepped between their desks. \u201cI should come downstairs more often to see how the two of you spend your time.\u201d He frowned at Emma and handed her a sheet of paper printed with a list of businesses. The highlighted ones were the companies he wanted her to approach. Oh joy, The Taco Stand and California Rock &amp; Roll were on the list, the combination ethnic restaurant so recently in her thoughts.</p><p>Emma stared at the paper and squelched a groan. She did not consider ad sales her forte.</p><p>Half an hour later, Emma was sitting with Mr. Garcia of The Taco Stand and his wife, Suki, who operated the other half of the restaurant. There weren\u2019t any lunch customers yet, and they\u2019d chosen a booth on the Mexican side of the building with its strings of red chili pepper lights proclaiming Christmas cheer. Emma carefully reviewed the newspaper\u2019s advertising rates. Suki, whose English was poor, looked to her Hispanic husband to explain what Emma had suggested. Emma glanced from one to the other and realized they had a language all their own.</p><p>\u201cIs it for newspaper?\u201d Suki wanted to know for the third time.</p><p>Emma smiled and nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. She found herself speaking slowly and deliberately. \u201cAdvertise your good food to all the people in Puyallup so they will come in and place many orders.\u201d After five minutes of talking to the young Asian woman, Emma sounded as if she were the one struggling with English. It embarrassed her; she didn\u2019t want to offend the gentle young woman, but in her effort to make herself understood, she was overemphasizing each word.</p><p>Carlos, Suki\u2019s husband, nodded. \u201cVery good for business.\u201d</p><p>Suki brightened. \u201cWe talk,\u201d she said and smiled softly at her husband.</p><p>A bell tinkled in the Japanese half of the restaurant, separated by a doorway. \u201cSuki, where are you?\u201d</p><p>Emma would recognize that voice anywhere.</p><p>Suki\u2019s eyes widened with pleasure. \u201cMr. Oliver,\u201d she said and immediately scooted out of the booth.</p><p>Carlos laughed. \u201cShe has a big crush on the pilot. It\u2019s a good thing she met me first.\u201d</p><p>Emma didn\u2019t doubt Oliver\u2019s appeal to the opposite sex for a moment. He had that effect on women; she knew from her own experience.</p><p>\u201cLeave the information with me,\u201d Carlos said. \u201cI\u2019ll call Mr. Walt later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think you\u2019ll buy an ad?\u201d Emma asked hopefully.</p><p>Carlos hemmed and hawed. \u201cMaybe. I\u2019ll talk it over with Suki.\u201d</p><p>It happened like this every time. She nearly had a commitment, and then the business owner would back off. She had no idea what she needed to do in order to get businesses to advertise in their local paper. Some of the businesspeople she talked to practically gave her the impression that they were afraid of attracting more customers. She didn\u2019t know how else to explain it. Fortunately, she\u2019d had one success\u2014Badda Bing, Badda Boom Pizza. They\u2019d seen an increase in pizza sales and had happily signed a new contract.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t resist. After thanking Carlos, Emma walked over to the other half of the restaurant. Sure enough, Oliver sat on a stool with his back to her, while Suki worked behind the counter, assembling his order.</p><p>\u201cI would never have taken you for someone who enjoys sushi,\u201d she said, and slid onto the stool beside him.</p><p>Oliver didn\u2019t look surprised to see her. \u201cReally? I love it. My guess is you\u2019ve never tried it.\u201d</p><p>He was beginning to know her. Then again, he seemed to have that ability from the moment they met. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia rolls for the lady,\u201d Oliver told Suki.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not hungry,\u201d she said, which wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>Oliver didn\u2019t allow her to protest. \u201cAt least give it a try.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been saying the same thing all afternoon. The least she could do was follow her own advice. \u201cAll right, I will.\u201d</p><p>Oliver gave her a warm smile, and she couldn\u2019t help basking in his approval. \u201cSee?\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like fruitcake but you were willing to try it. And look how well that worked out.\u201d Emma could have stared into this man\u2019s eyes forever; instead, she quickly glanced away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wondered where the name California Rock and Roll came from,\u201d she said casually. \u201cNow I know.\u201d</p><p>Suki placed both orders on the counter and Emma examined hers. On a rectangular plate, Suki had arranged four California rolls. They seemed to be rolled logs of rice around a thin sheet of processed seaweed, with strips of avocado and various vegetables tucked in the center. On the same plate were two small bowls. One held soy sauce and the other was filled with a thin guacamole. Apparently Carlos and Suki had found a way to cross their foods culturally. Emma was intrigued. While Oliver reached for his chopsticks, she spread a liberal portion of the guacamole across the top of one California roll.</p><p>Oliver watched her with raised eyebrows.</p><p>Emma was about to take her first bite when he stopped her.</p> <p>\u201cYou might want to scrape off some of the wasabi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasabi.\u201d</p><p>She must have looked confused, because he dipped the end of his chopstick in her guacamole and offered her a taste. The minute her lips touched it, her mouth was on fire. She grabbed her cup of tea and swallowed the entire contents. Waving her hand in front of her mouth, all she could do was feel grateful for Oliver\u2019s intervention.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness,\u201d she gasped.</p> <p>\u201cYou thought that was guacamole?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThank you. Oh, thank you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes crinkled with a smile as he returned to his sushi.</p><p>Once Emma had tasted her first real bite, sans wasabi, she was surprised by how delicious the California roll was. \u201cHey, this is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you.\u201d</p><p>She merely smiled.</p> <p>They sat in companionable silence, and Emma had to admit she was thrilled to see him. She wanted to explain why she\u2019d reacted the way she had to his gift of a Christmas tree, but was afraid any attempt would destroy this fragile peace.</p><p>\u201cYou came here for an early lunch?\u201d Oliver asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was on another of my advertising treks for Walt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>She hated to admit how unsuccessful she was at this selling business. It was so much harder than she would\u2019ve expected. Oliver listened and nodded. Then he told her, \u201cYou\u2019re doing it all wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, I\u2019m doing it wrong?\u201d He wasn\u2019t the one hoofing it from business to business, putting on a smile and talking his heart out, only to be shown the door.</p><p>\u201cEmma, listen to me. You\u2019re an attractive, charming young woman and it should be difficult for people to tell you no.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed, although she took note of the \u201cattractive\u201d and \u201ccharming.\u201d \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been a problem today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten nothing but no?\u201d He seemed astonished by that.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t proud of it, but that was exactly what had happened. If she didn\u2019t get a flat rejection, it was \u201cwe\u2019ll think it over\u201d or \u201clater, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, you must be doing it wrong.\u201d</p><p>That annoyed her. \u201cYou turned me down,\u201d she reminded him, allowing her temper to flare just a bit.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly did not. I couldn\u2019t afford you, but I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the advertising you wanted, not me,\u201d she told him, stiffening at the implication.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I got you in my plane, didn\u2019t I? And I got advertising in the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll concede the point.\u201d She reached for the teapot and refilled her cup. \u201cIf you think it\u2019s so easy, you try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll bet I can prove to you that people can be talked into anything. What do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Another man had entered the restaurant and sat at a table by the window. Emma pointed at him. \u201cAsk that man to pay for your meal and watch how fast he tells you no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re on.\u201d Oliver slid off the stool and walked toward the gentleman dining alone. He looked like a midlevel bank employee. Possibly a loan officer, judging by the fact that he was smartly but conservatively dressed.</p><p>Oliver didn\u2019t hesitate. He strolled over to the other man and when he spoke, he made sure it was just loud enough for Emma to overhear the conversation.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said in a friendly way.</p><p>The other man glanced up from his menu. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just ordered lunch for my girlfriend and me, and I\u2019ve discovered I left my wallet at home. Would you mind paying for our meal? I\u2019ll repay you, of course.\u201d</p><p>The other man didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. \u201cHow much is it?\u201d</p><p>Emma was shocked he hadn\u2019t immediately laughed in Oliver\u2019s face and told him to get lost.</p><p>In a display of false humility, Oliver shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t got the bill yet, but I\u2019d guess around ten dollars.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI just assumed I had my wallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think of that before you ordered?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>Oliver gave him a look that said he was absolutely right. \u201cI know I should\u2019ve but...I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem like a decent sort,\u201d the other man said slowly.</p><p>Emma couldn\u2019t stand it. She climbed off the stool and hurried to Oliver\u2019s side. \u201cYou can tell him no,\u201d she said eagerly. She\u2019d hate it if Oliver won this bet so easily. Besides, they hadn\u2019t decided what the winner would get.</p><p>\u201cNow, Emma.\u201d Oliver frowned at her. \u201cThis is man to man. Don\u2019t you worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Emma wasn\u2019t going to let him win this bet without a struggle. \u201cMy friend is being irresponsible. It certainly isn\u2019t up to you to pay for his mistake. All you have to do is say no.\u201d</p><p>The gentleman nodded. \u201cTrue, but it is the holiday season, and ten dollars won\u2019t break me.\u201d</p><p>Oliver grinned triumphantly. He stretched out his hand to the other man. \u201cThank you very much. I\u2019m Oliver Hamilton, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGary Sullivan. Nice to meet you.\u201d Gary stood and reached for his wallet.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Oliver said, refusing the money. \u201cI was just proving a point to my girlfriend. This is Emma Collins, of The Puyallup Examiner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not his girlfriend.\u201d Emma felt it was important to clarify that. \u201cWe\u2019re friends....\u201d She let the rest fade, embarrassed to have said anything.</p><p>Gary looked confused.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve just said no,\u201d Emma repeated, unable to understand why it had been so easy for Oliver and so difficult for her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind. Like I said, this is Christmas, I could afford it and your boyfriend\u2014Oliver\u2014is very persuasive. The idea of paying for your meal actually made me feel good. Christmas spirit and all.\u201d</p><p>Emma gave up then and walked back to the counter.</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d Oliver said as he returned to his stool. \u201cPeople want to help and it\u2019s the same in sales. If you just remember that, and remember to show them what they\u2019ll get out of it, then you\u2019ll have a better chance of selling advertising for Walt.\u201d</p><p>She sighed loudly. \u201cOkay, you win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou win,\u201d she said a little louder this time, although she nearly choked on the words.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll be by for dinner around seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Didn\u2019t I mention my prize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me dinner.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI hope it\u2019s all right if Oscar comes, too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>As children growing up in Ireland, we would watch our grandmother make fruitcake and she would always let us lick the bowl afterward. I liked fruitcake simply because of the association with Christmas and spending time in the kitchen with my grandmother. However, it always seemed that the cake lasted until the next century and there was always the possibility of broken bones if the cake accidentally fell on you!</p><p>\u2014Frank McMahon, executive chef at Hank\u2019s Seafood in Charleston, South Carolina</p><p>Oliver was pleased with himself. His spur-of-the-moment experiment couldn\u2019t have gone any better. Later, as they left the restaurant, Emma seemed to think she\u2019d been tricked. She claimed Oliver must have known Gary beforehand. He didn\u2019t, and she\u2019d eventually believed him.</p><p>He hoped his little lesson in sales would help\u2014and not just with her ad quota. The fact was, you had to persuade people that they were going to get something out of the deal. It was more of an emotional thing than it was a practical or financial one. Look at Gary for instance\u2014he felt good about helping someone out. Oliver wanted to convince Emma that there\u2019d be an emotional payoff for her, too, if she bought his sales pitch. Only what he was selling was himself.</p><p>She\u2019d described them as friends, but he was interested in more than friendship, and if his intuition was right, so was Emma. The problem, and he considered it a minor one, was that she hadn\u2019t acknowledged it yet.</p><p>After his lunch, Oliver returned to the airfield, did some paperwork and then drove home. Emma had called to say dinner would be ready around seven-thirty and he took that to mean she had some grocery shopping to do before he came by. He was thinking a big, juicy T-bone steak would suit him just fine.</p><p>On his way home, Oliver bought a bottle of his favorite merlot. Humming a Christmas carol, he hopped back inside his pickup. Oscar, waiting for him in the passenger seat, yawned ostentatiously.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s it going with you and Boots?\u201d Oliver asked his terrier. \u201cYou looking forward to having dinner with her?\u201d</p><p>Oscar cocked his head to one side.</p><p>His cell rang and when he checked caller ID, he saw that it was his mother. He picked up on the third ring, and they discussed Christmas Day and the dinner she had planned. \u201cHey, Mom,\u201d he said, glancing in his sideview mirror before he changed lanes. \u201cWould it be all right if I brought a guest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. A...friend of mine.\u201d The word friend made him feel self-conscious. He hoped that by Christmas Day their relationship would have progressed to something a little more exciting.</p><p>His mother knew him far too well. \u201cI\u2019m assuming this guest you want to include is female?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she someone special?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment. \u201cYes,\u201d he finally admitted. \u201cYeah, she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma Collins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma Collins?\u201d his mother repeated. \u201cThat sounds familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason it should,\u201d Oliver said, changing lanes a second time. \u201cShe works for The Examiner. I met her earlier in the month when she came down to the airfield to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe works for the newspaper?\u201d his mother said excitedly, cutting him off. \u201cShe\u2019s that reporter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat reporter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl who wrote those articles about fruitcake,\u201d she told him, her tone suggesting he must be a simpleton.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but I didn\u2019t know they\u2019d been published.\u201d He\u2019d been too busy to read the paper this last week and when he did, he rarely looked past the front page and the sports section. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe interviewed the three Washington State fruitcake recipe finalists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Oliver realized he probably sounded smug. \u201cI was the one who flew her in for the interviews.

Those articles were so good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSave them for me, would you?\u201d He\u2019d look through the papers in his recycling bin, but just in case...</p><p>\u201cI already used one of the recipes and I\u2019m going to serve it on Christmas Day.\u201d</p><p>Oliver liked fruitcake, and there always seemed to be plenty of it around his parents\u2019 house. \u201cSo I can bring Emma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare show up without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he arrived home, Oliver collected a week\u2019s worth of papers and sat down with them, searching until he located the first article\u2014about the Yakima interview. He studied a picture of Earleen Williams displaying her fruitcake. Emma wasn\u2019t a bad photographer. He recalled that first flight and how nervous she\u2019d been. Then he remembered her problem with the television in the motel room and her effort to hear the news that turned out to be nudes. At that he laughed outright.</p><p>His mother was right; the article was insightful and well-written. Within a few paragraphs, Oliver felt he knew Earleen. He\u2019d certainly met women like her who didn\u2019t recognize their own worth or, as in Earleen\u2019s case, recognized it later in life. Emma had characterized her with real sensitivity. Logically but subtly, she led the reader to her own conclusion\u2014that this was a generous woman who\u2019d spent her life loving men who didn\u2019t deserve her devotion.</p><p>He found the article about Sophie McKay next. Sophie was a woman who enjoyed life. Neither she nor her fruitcake recipe was in any way typical. She took the ingredients she liked best and combined them into a truly unique recipe, just as she\u2019d done with her life. Both she and her beloved husband, Harry, had been willing to compromise on the fruitcake issue and, no doubt, on the more important conflicts within their marriage. After his death, she\u2019d mourned him and continued to love him but also continued to live. Sophie McKay, like her fruitcake, was one of a kind.</p> <p>As Oliver rummaged through discarded papers for the third and final article, he understood what had intrigued his mother and her friends about Emma. She was special, and her understanding of these women\u2019s lives was compassionate as well as incisive.</p><p>When he found the third article, he smiled at the picture of Peggy Lucas surrounded by her children. He almost wished Emma had been in the photograph. The theme for that article was eat it now and the No-Bake Fruitcake recipe followed. With Peggy, too, Emma had found just the right tone.</p><p>In all three articles, she\u2019d managed to write about fruitcake\u2014on the surface a rather limited subject\u2014in ways that gave it a larger meaning. Fruitcake as a symbol for life. Hmm...</p><p>Emma might not be much good at garnering advertising dollars for Walt, but she shouldn\u2019t worry. What she lacked in sales ability she more than compensated for with her writing talent.</p><p>Oliver saw that it was almost seven. Rubbing his hand down his cheek, he decided to shave. He was in a good mood and knew he should credit Emma with that. She\u2019d impressed him with her work and she made him laugh. There was a lot to be said for a woman who possessed a sense of humor. After throwing on his leather jacket, which had survived its icy bath in Puget Sound, he reached for the wine bottle, called Oscar and together, man and dog headed out the door.</p><p>Striking what he hoped was a sexy Cary Grant pose, Oliver rang the doorbell. He leaned his shoulder against the doorjamb and crossed his ankles, bottle tucked under one arm. It didn\u2019t take Emma long to answer. Unlatching the lock, she opened the door and immediately made a fuss over Oscar. She hardly seemed to notice Oliver was even there. Apparently she was immune to his many charms\u2014or wanted him to think she was. Definitely hard on the ego.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all the greeting I get?\u201d he chided.</p><p>She wore a towel apron over jeans and looked lovely. He couldn\u2019t resist. Slipping his hand behind her neck, Oliver bent forward and kissed her. She tasted wonderful\u2014a little spicy, a little sweet.</p><p>She blinked several times when he released her. \u201cHi,\u201d she said in a husky voice, sounding flustered. When they\u2019d first met, he\u2019d enjoyed teasing her about how much she wanted him. Actually, the reverse was true. He wanted her. In an effort to derail the direction of his thoughts, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t get back to the stove in a hurry, it\u2019ll be takeout.\u201d She dashed across the room and returned to her kitchen.</p><p>Oliver bent down and petted Boots. The two dogs resumed their ritual sniffing.</p><p>\u201cEver heard of puttanesca?\u201d Emma asked, emptying a large can of crushed tomatoes into a pan.</p><p>\u201cPutin what?\u201d Oliver asked as he set the wine bottle down on the crowded countertop. \u201cIs it some Russian dish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuttanesca,\u201d Emma repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s an Italian pasta sauce. My mother used to make it. I have to warn you it\u2019s kind of spicy.\u201d</p><p>The scents in the kitchen were delectable. He smelled garlic and tomatoes and something else he couldn\u2019t identify. He saw an empty anchovy can and wondered if that was it. Oliver enjoyed the little fish on his pizza. So far, that was the only time he\u2019d ever eaten anchovies.</p><p>Emma stirred the simmering sauce, her back to him. \u201cMom told me that women of the night would put a pan of this sauce in the window in order to entice men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to entice me, Emma Collins?\u201d Oliver asked softly.</p><p>As if she realized what she\u2019d said, Emma whirled around, her eyes wide. \u201cNo...you misunderstood. This has nothing to do with you and me.\u201d</p><p>It was probably wrong of him to find amusement in her obvious discomfort, but he grinned and said, \u201cPity.\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze. \u201cCould I?\u201d she asked, her voice hesitant. \u201cEntice you, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged carelessly. \u201cYou could always give it a try.\u201d He grinned again. \u201cIn fact, why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled in response and the tip of her tongue moistened her lower lip before she turned back to the pasta sauce.</p><p>Oliver was convinced she had no idea what an effective job she was doing of enticing him right then and there. He fought the impulse to kiss her again. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like me to do?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou can roll the lemon.\u201d</p><p>Oliver was sure he\u2019d misheard. \u201cYou want me to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoll the lemon between your hands,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019d normally roll it against the countertop, but as you can see, I don\u2019t have much space here.\u201d</p><p>He pressed the lemon between his hands, then crushed it with all his might. \u201cThis is for the pasta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cThe salad. I\u2019m squeezing fresh lemon juice over the greens and then tossing them with a little extra-virgin olive oil.\u201d</p><p>Extra-virgin, was it? Oliver didn\u2019t even want to know what that meant. Then again, maybe he did.</p><p>\u201cThe bread\u2019s warming in the oven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The table was already set, and when he\u2019d finished pulverizing the lemon, he opened the wine. After giving it a couple of minutes to breathe\u2014he\u2019d read about that once in an airline magazine\u2014he poured them each a glass.</p><p>Emma certainly seemed to know what she was doing. He asked her about it over dinner as he swallowed every noodle and scraped up every last drop of the delicious sauce.</p><p>\u201cMy mom was the cook in the family. I miss her so much,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve made puttanesca since she died and I was a little concerned it wouldn\u2019t be the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t, don\u2019t change anything. This was fabulous.\u201d</p><p>Emma smiled and picked up her glass of wine.</p><p>She rarely mentioned her mother. Oliver knew the subject was a painful one, but he sensed that she wanted to talk about her now.</p><p>\u201cShe taught you to cook, right?\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded. \u201cMom insisted I should know my way around a kitchen. Isn\u2019t that something in these days of convenience food? I can\u2019t remember Mom ever resorting to processed food. I didn\u2019t taste macaroni and cheese from a box until I was almost an adult.\u201d She grimaced comically. \u201cThat\u2019s what comes of living on a student budget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like cooking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded again. \u201cI don\u2019t do it often enough. If Mom were alive, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019d be a disappointment to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true.\u201d He was sincere; her mother would be very proud of Emma and rightly so. \u201cSpeaking of mothers, I talked to mine this afternoon and she read your articles.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s eyes brightened. \u201cDid she enjoy them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom was very impressed.\u201d Oliver was a little disgruntled that Emma hadn\u2019t let him know those fruitcake pieces had been published. He\u2019d also been put out over her lack of appreciation for the Christmas tree. She had the tree up, but it didn\u2019t have a single strand of lights or even one decoration. It leaned rather forlornly against the corner of her living room. She hadn\u2019t bought a stand; she\u2019d just stuck it in a large, dirt-filled flower pot.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Emma seemed pleased by his mother\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Walt say?\u201d</p><p>Emma chuckled. \u201cHis only comment after he read the final drafts was that I gave him clean copy. Which is high praise from Walt.\u201d</p><p>Oliver helped himself to the last of the pasta sauce and sopped it up with his bread. \u201cGetting back to my mother, she wants to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does?\u201d</p><p>Oliver played this part cool. \u201cYeah. I told her I could arrange it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted to meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Christmas Day?\u201d he asked, again casually.</p><p>Emma\u2019s smile faded. \u201cChristmas Day,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d Oliver felt like smacking his forehead. He should\u2019ve realized she\u2019d have plans. Everyone did on Christmas.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it won\u2019t work.\u201d At least she had the good grace to look regretful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already got plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d she said after a brief hesitation.</p><p>Oliver straightened. \u201cEither you have plans or you don\u2019t. Which is it?\u201d</p><p>Emma set her napkin on the table, stood up and carried their plates to the sink. \u201cI know you have a hard time understanding this, but I don\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>He looked over at the bare tree he\u2019d gotten her. Point taken.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t anything religious,\u201d she explained. \u201cChristmas just hasn\u2019t been the same since my mother died. I tried to continue all the traditions we\u2019d done together. It was too sad. So I stopped.\u201d</p><p>She returned from the kitchen, carrying a pie and a couple of small glass plates. \u201cMy...father and I are estranged. He invites me out of obligation, but I can\u2019t go to him and his new wife. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She sat down at the table again. \u201cFriends invited me over a couple of years in a row, but it made me feel like a charity case.\u201d She lowered her head. \u201cPeople tend to feel sorry for me and I don\u2019t want that. The last two years I\u2019ve spent the day alone and, really, it isn\u2019t so bad. I\u2019ve come to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Oliver shrugged off her rejection as if it didn\u2019t matter. His invitation had been issued in an offhand manner, which he now decided was a mistake. He should\u2019ve made a big deal of it.</p> <p>Because it was a big deal. Christmas was important to him and to his family, and he wanted Emma to be part of that. He wanted Emma with him.</p><p>Now all he had to do was figure out how to convince her.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Emma knew she\u2019d disappointed Oliver and she felt bad about that. She was quite fond of him and\u2014Okay, that was a mild assessment of her feelings. She was crazy about him.</p><p>\u201cI think I blew it with Oliver,\u201d she told Phoebe on the phone later that evening.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>Emma sat down and put her feet up as she mentally reviewed their dinnertime conversation. \u201cHe invited me to meet his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrific! Oh, Emma, Oliver\u2019s letting you know that you\u2019re more than just a friend. He\u2019s asking you to meet his family. That\u2019s a huge step in a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all very casual,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cOf course it was....\u201d Phoebe paused. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me you refused, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe invited me to Christmas dinner.\u201d</p><p>The line went silent for a moment. \u201cYou mean to tell me that Oliver invited you to meet his parents on Christmas Day and you turned him down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word was barely audible, even to Emma.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand that\u2019s as good as it gets with a guy\u2014his parents and Christmas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no.\u201d</p><p>Phoebe groaned. \u201cI was afraid of that. I thought you liked Oliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said in a small voice. Emma was afraid to admit how much. She knew now that he wasn\u2019t like her father. Oliver was caring, generous and had a great relationship with his family. He was kind to animals. He had a sense of humor. If she were to make a list of what she wanted in a man, those traits would be at the very top.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so smart and so stupid at the same time?\u201d Phoebe muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gift,\u201d Emma said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Oliver say after you told him no?\u201d</p><p>Emma closed her eyes and pressed her palm against her forehead. \u201cHardly anything. I\u2019d made dinner, he offered to help with the dishes, but there weren\u2019t that many and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there,\u201d Phoebe commanded. \u201cOliver offered to help with the dishes and you refused that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever, I repeat\u2014never\u2014turn down a man\u2019s offer to do the dishes. Men are like puppies that have to be trained. This training takes place during the courtship period. Men will take their cues from you and if you let them know you\u2019re fine with doing all the housework, they\u2019ll simply accept it. Who wouldn\u2019t? That, my friend, was mistake number two. Okay, now tell me what happened next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much. He said he had an errand to run and he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he thank you for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. He really seemed to enjoy it.\u201d His enjoyment gratified her. This was a special recipe\u2014a special meal. In her own way, she\u2019d been letting him know he was important to her.</p><p>\u201cBut he left almost right afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Emma was feeling worse by the minute.</p><p>Her friend exhaled slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you blew it.\u201d</p><p>Emma swallowed around the lump forming in her throat. \u201cAny suggestions on what I should do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall and tell him you\u2019ve had a change of heart and would love to spend Christmas with him and his family.\u201d She gulped in an urgent breath. \u201cAnd do it soon.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t what Emma wanted to hear. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love this guy or not?\u201d Phoebe demanded.</p><p>Love? Love. Love! She didn\u2019t know. Okay, maybe she did. She loved him. And deep down she knew that if she didn\u2019t act quickly, she might lose him.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d Phoebe interrupted. \u201cDo you honestly think this is how your mother wants you to spend Christmas? You told me how much she liked the holidays and all the things you used to do together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m not opposed to Christmas for other people,\u201d Emma said, defending herself. \u201cBut it\u2019s not for me. Christmas makes me sad and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>When had Phoebe become so dictatorial? \u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom would want me to be with people at Christmas,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>Emma knew Phoebe was right about this. Her mother had always said there was something special about Christmas. Oliver had tried to tell her there was something special about her, too, and she\u2019d brushed him off.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve made your point.\u201d Now all she had to do was explain to Oliver that she\u2019d been wrong. That she\u2019d mourned her mother in a negative way instead of a positive one. That she should have celebrated all the things they\u2019d shared\u2014like Christmas. Phoebe was right about something else. This dinner had been a turning point in Emma\u2019s relationship with Oliver. Unfortunately, she\u2019d made the wrong choice once again.</p><p>\u201cCall him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him you\u2019ve changed your mind and mean it,\u201d Phoebe said.</p><p>Emma nodded dutifully. \u201cWhat do you think he\u2019ll say?\u201d</p><p>Phoebe didn\u2019t answer for a long moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Call me back after you talk to him, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Emma promised. This wasn\u2019t going to be easy. Before she lost her nerve she punched out his phone number. After three rings, voice mail came on and she left a message. \u201cHi,\u201d she said awkwardly. \u201cThis is Emma...Listen, about Christmas. I am so honored that you invited me. I\u2019d love to meet your mother. I was thinking I might\u2019ve offended you and I\u2019d never want to do that and so\u2014\u201d BEEP.</p><p>Emma had been cut off. She dialed the number again, then replaced the receiver before the recorded message began. She wondered if Oliver was screening his calls and preferred not to talk to her. The last thing she wanted to be was a pest.</p><p>Sleeping was out of the question. The big office party was the following afternoon. The Subway Express lunch had fallen through\u2014apparently the county Health Department had some concerns about them\u2014and Walt had made another deal with a brand-new catering company. Emma had purchased the requisite gift and dutifully wrapped it for the Secret Santa exchange, but her heart wasn\u2019t in it.</p><p>The following morning when she showed up at the office, Phoebe met her with a cup of coffee. \u201cHere, you look like you need this. Why didn\u2019t you call me back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t talk to Oliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, twice.\u201d She hadn\u2019t left a message the second time. One message was enough, she reasoned.</p><p>Phoebe frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s still early.\u201d</p><p>Two days was all she had. The office closed for the holidays at the end of business hours today. Saturday was Christmas Eve and then Sunday was Christmas Day itself. She had to settle this with Oliver and soon.</p><p>Needless to say, Emma wasn\u2019t looking forward to the office party, but she was required to attend. No one said as much; it was simply understood. Staff and freelance writers mingled in the upstairs office, and the conference room table was covered with an elaborate culinary display.</p><p>Emma wasn\u2019t sure how much free advertising Walt had agreed to with the catering company. A lot, she assumed. The spread was gorgeous, with huge shrimp arranged around a bowl of cocktail sauce, smoked salmon and cream cheese on small rounds of rye bread, chicken teriyaki tidbits, veggie trays, cheese and crackers and enough desserts to send the entire staff racing to Weight Watchers on the second of January. To Emma\u2019s delight, among the desserts was a large platter of sliced fruitcake.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Emma Collins?\u201d the young female caterer asked when Emma paused to admire it.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really enjoyed your articles,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name is Dixie Rogers.\u201d</p><p>They shook hands. \u201cI enjoyed meeting the finalists\u2014and trying their fruitcake,\u201d Emma told her.</p><p>\u201cHas the winner been announced?\u201d</p><p>Emma nodded. \u201cIt was a woman from South Carolina.\u201d She\u2019d checked the Web last night, just before she went to bed, and had seen the results.</p><p>\u201cOh. I hope the Washington State finalists aren\u2019t too disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Emma thought that Earleen, Sophie and Peggy were thrilled to have made the final cut. She\u2019d heard from each one after the articles were published and they\u2019d all been pleased.</p><p>\u201cAs you probably guessed, the no-bake fruitcake is Peggy Lucas\u2019s recipe.\u201d Dixie pointed to the tray Emma had recently admired. \u201cI think everyone who normally dislikes fruitcake will be eager to give it a second try after reading your articles. I know I was.\u201d</p><p>The praise felt good. \u201cThank you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext year I\u2019m determined to bake all three fruitcakes. The chocolate one especially interests me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Emma assured her. The three finalists had made a believer out of her. Her intense dislike of fruitcake had come about more because of its association with Christmas than any aversion to the cake itself. It was an unreasonable dislike, she recognized, since she\u2019d only tasted it a couple of times. Next year, she\u2019d bake one herself. Maybe even all three.</p><p>Emma filled her plate and joined Phoebe while Walt made the traditional Christmas champagne toast. The Secret Santa gift exchange turned out, surprisingly, to be a lot of fun, and Emma ended up the proud possessor of a pair of Christmas tree earrings. Soon everyone was getting ready to leave for the night. There were plenty of hugs and holiday greetings as the office staff began to drift away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bundled against the cold, Emma walked out of the office, Phoebe and Walt behind her. Being alone over the holidays had never troubled Emma this much in the past. It was the thought of not being with Oliver. She wanted to be in his life and she wanted him in hers.</p><p>Just before the office party, Walt had sought her out. He hadn\u2019t openly praised her work; that would\u2019ve been asking too much. But he\u2019d given her another assignment. Shortly after the first of the year, the big Bridal Fair would be held at the Tacoma Dome. Walt seemed to feel she\u2019d find plenty of human interest stories at an event like that.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a random choice, Emma realized. When Phoebe returned to work after Christmas, Emma expected to see her wearing an engagement ring. In fact, she was virtually certain that Phoebe had whispered the idea for her new assignment in Walt\u2019s ear.</p><p>The wind sent icy shivers down Emma\u2019s back as she headed toward the parking lot. A dog barked. Could it possibly be Oscar, which meant Oliver would be close by? She scanned the area but didn\u2019t see either Oliver or his terrier.</p> <p>As she drove through town, Emma noticed\u2014as if for the first time\u2014all the street decorations. Wreaths, striped candy canes and snowmen were suspended from light posts, with evergreen boughs stretched from one side of the street to the other. These decorations were truly an expression of the community\u2019s spirit. Before, she\u2019d barely glanced at them, viewing it all as evidence of the commercialization of Christmas. Now she looked at the scene in front of her with fresh eyes.</p><p>Snowflakes floated down. She caught her breath at the sheer wonder of it. Carolers stood in the center of a roundabout with their songbooks open. Even through the noise of the traffic, Emma could hear the harmonic blend of voices. It was lovely and peaceful and festive\u2014and so was Christmas.... Just like it\u2019d been when she was a kid growing up.</p><p>Emma thought about the women she\u2019d met and the articles she\u2019d written. Earleen had taught her to look at her mother and herself in an entirely different way. Pamela Collins had made her own choice, and that choice had been to remain in a failed marriage. Even though she knew Oliver was nothing like her father, Emma had been afraid of repeating her mother\u2019s mistakes. But she was her own woman, a masterpiece in her own right. From Sophie she\u2019d learned about the value of compromise and the importance of recognizing what you want and making it part of your life. And Peggy had shown her how to live in the moment.</p><p>Fortified with enthusiasm, Emma drove to the local Wal-Mart and, using her Christmas bonus, bought lights and decorations for her tree. While she was there, she loaded up on groceries. Then she went to a local strip mall and did her first real Christmas shopping in years.</p><p>Nothing had been resolved with Oliver; still, she felt wonderful. Christmas music played loudly from her car radio as she arrived home and carried all her bags into the apartment. Boots jumped up and down with happiness at her homecoming.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t stop to see if the red light was blinking on her answering machine. It didn\u2019t matter if Oliver had tried to return her call or not. Riding on the crest of her newborn appreciation for Christmas\u2014and for him\u2014she went directly to his apartment with Boots in tow. She didn\u2019t hesitate before she rang his doorbell.</p><p>He looked surprised to see her. He waited for her to speak.</p><p>She smiled warmly. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself,\u201d he repeated without much animation.</p><p>Her smile grew wider. \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cMerry Christmas? The original Ms. Scrooge is wishing me Merry Christmas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d With that, she launched herself into his arms and spread eager kisses over his face. She started with his cheek, gradually working her way to his mouth.</p><p>Sliding his arms around her waist, Oliver lifted her from the ground. His mouth hungrily covered hers. Somehow he managed to bring her into his apartment\u2014Boots scurrying past them\u2014and kick the door shut. Emma wrapped her arms around his neck and hung on tight. This was exactly where she wanted to be. If the fervor with which he returned her kisses was any indication, Oliver shared her feeling.</p><p>\u201cDid you get my message?\u201d she asked when she could breathe again.</p><p>\u201cDid you get mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His lips went back to hers. \u201cI decided to give you another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She kissed his jaw, then cradled his face between her hands so she could gaze into his eyes. \u201cCan I still join you and your family for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>Oliver\u2019s expression grew solemn. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve already asked another girl.\u201d</p> <p>His answer shocked her until she realized he was teasing. Playfully she punched him in the ribs. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>Oliver laughed. Emma had always loved his robust laughter and closed her eyes to hold on to the sound of it as long as possible.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to help me decorate the tree?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Oliver pretended to stagger back, hand to his heart. \u201cThis is indeed a complete transformation. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso,\u201d she said, slipping her arm around his waist. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be joining your family for Christmas dinner, it\u2019s only polite that I bring something.\u201d</p><p>Oliver disagreed. \u201cMom won\u2019t hear of it. You\u2019re our guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I insist. Besides, I\u2019ve already been to the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Bring whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>She tilted back her head. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what I intend to make for your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, tell me.\u201d</p><p>So she did. \u201cFruitcake, of course.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>I\u2019m not a fruitcake fan generally speaking, but then there\u2019s my mother\u2019s. She makes a fabulous, upscale fruitcake using a high-quality sherry. She bakes the cakes in November, wraps them in cheesecloth and lets them marinate for a couple of weeks, routinely adding sherry to keep them moist. Each year she sends me a few of her superb fruitcakes and they always disappear surprisingly quickly\u2014especially for fruitcake!</p><p>\u2014Robert Carter, executive chef at Peninsula Grill in Charleston, South Carolina</p><p>A year later</p><p>Her mother had been right; Christmas was good for the human spirit.</p><p>\u201cEmma, would you take this out to the table?\u201d Oliver\u2019s mother asked, handing her a bowl piled high with fluffy mashed potatoes. She didn\u2019t wait for a response before she gave Oliver\u2019s sister, Laurel, a second bowl, and picked up a third, filled with Brussels sprouts, herself. Walking in single file, the Hamilton women brought the serving dishes to the huge dining room table for Christmas dinner.</p><p>A turkey, roasted to golden perfection, rested on a huge oval platter at the far end of the table for Oliver\u2019s father to carve. Nieces and nephews, plus dogs and cats, raced around the house with sounds of glee.</p><p>Oliver was talking to his father but glanced up when she entered the room. They exchanged a smile. For the second year in a row, she\u2019d joined his family for the holiday festivities. Only this year, Emma was a member of the family. Oliver and Emma had been married in June, two months after Phoebe and Walt. Following the reception, they flew\u2014yes, flew\u2014to Hawaii for a two-week honeymoon. Thankfully, their flight was aboard a 747 and not Oliver\u2019s Cessna Caravan.</p><p>With Oliver\u2019s urging and support, Emma had called her father. That first conversation had been tense, and she\u2019d realized Bret Collins wished their relationship was different. To her surprise, he showed up for the wedding. He attended the reception, too, and made a point of meeting Emma\u2019s in-laws. Though he\u2019d left shortly afterward, they\u2019d talked a number of times since. In fact, he\u2019d called that very morning to wish her and Oliver a merry Christmas.</p><p>It was a start.</p><p>Emma\u2019s journalism career was progressing, and although she was still responsible for her share of obituaries, she routinely wrote feature articles for The Examiner. Walt sometimes offered suggestions, but lately he\u2019d allowed her to write whatever she chose. Emma\u2019s work had even garnered attention from some of the larger newspapers in the area. For now, she was content to continue writing for The Examiner. She enjoyed living in Puyallup, home of the Western Washington Fairgrounds and the Victorian Christmas extravaganza. She\u2019d covered both events for the paper this year.</p><p>Oliver\u2019s freight business was doing well, too. He\u2019d managed to pick up another exclusive contract with an Alaska fishing company. Five days a week, he flew in fresh salmon and other seafood to restaurants in Washington and Oregon. Emma was proud of his company\u2019s success. In November Oliver had hired another pilot and leased a second plane in order to meet demand. He advertised regularly in The Examiner, and Emma wrote all his ads.</p><p>Oliver\u2019s mother stepped out of the kitchen and removed her apron, signaling the start of the Christmas meal. \u201cOllie, dinner\u2019s on the table,\u201d she called to her husband. The family migrated to the dining room.</p><p>Oliver and Emma stood in front of their chairs as his sisters and brother and their families found their way to the table. Emma smiled, admiring the meal. In addition to turkey and all the fixings, there were a number of salads and vegetable dishes, plus fresh-baked rolls still warm from the oven. Desserts lined the sideboard. For the second year in a row, Emma had brought fruitcake\u2014three varieties this year, all made from the recipes contributed by the three women she\u2019d interviewed last Christmas.</p><p>When the family surrounded the table, they all joined hands and Oliver\u2019s father offered a simple grace. Emma closed her eyes; at the end of the prayer she whispered a heartfelt \u201cAmen.\u201d She was in love, and she felt as though she\u2019d reclaimed herself\u2014and reclaimed the joy of Christmas.</p><p>With dinner came a lot of good-natured teasing between Oliver and his younger brother and three younger sisters. Although he was the oldest, he\u2019d been the last to marry.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you put up with him,\u201d Laurel said, speaking to Emma.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the stuff he pulled on us as kids,\u201d Carrie added.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the time Mom made you babysit, and Donny put a huge hole in the living room wall?\u201d Jenny asked Oliver.</p><p>\u201cRemember it?\u201d he said with a groan. \u201cI knew the minute Mom saw that hole, I\u2019d be grounded my entire senior year.\u201d</p><p>Oliver\u2019s mother waved her fork at him and turned to Emma. \u201cDo you know what he did? My genius son rearranged the living room furniture so the wall was covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hid the hole,\u201d Oliver said in a stage whisper.</p><p>\u201cThen he demanded extra pay because he claimed he did housework in addition to babysitting,\u201d his mother reminded them.</p><p>The whole family laughed.</p><p>Laurel spoke to Emma again. \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve been married to our big brother for six months now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months,\u201d Donny repeated. \u201cLeslie was pregnant a month after our wedding. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Oliver laughed. \u201cTrust me, there\u2019s no problem.\u201d</p><p>This was her cue, Emma realized. \u201cWe\u2019re due in July.\u201d</p><p>Amid cheers and gasps, Oliver\u2019s parents rose to their feet and applauded. His siblings and their spouses joined in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oliver slipped his arm around her shoulders. \u201cI told you they\u2019d be happy,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think this was their first grandchild,\u201d Emma said, overwhelmed by the family\u2019s reaction to their news. She\u2019d never known families could be like this.</p><p>By the end of a memorable Christmas Day, Emma was tired and ready to go home. After a series of hugs and promises to meet again soon, Oliver steered her to the car parked out front, his arm protectively around her. The dogs followed obediently in their wake.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit overpowering, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy family, when we\u2019re all together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re wonderful, each and every one.\u201d Oliver\u2019s sisters were among her closest friends. Her circle of family, friends and acquaintances had increased from the day she\u2019d met him.</p><p>\u201cThey love you, too.\u201d He opened the car door for her and helped her inside. Oscar and Boots piled into the back.</p><p>As they neared their newly constructed home, Oliver glanced at her. Emma\u2019s eyes were closed, her head back against the leather seat. \u201cYou\u2019ve really taken to Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cHard to believe that just over a year ago you didn\u2019t want anything to do with it. Now look at you.\u201d</p> <p>Emma opened her eyes and smiled. Their home was decorated with not one, but two, Christmas trees. The second, a smaller one, was for the dogs. She\u2019d written a series of articles about Christmas customs around the world. And she\u2019d started baking right after Thanksgiving. As Oliver had said last year, the transformation had been complete.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you,\u201d she said with a laugh, \u201cexcept to repeat what my mother told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d he asked, a smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something special about Christmas.\u201d</p><p>HERE COMES TROUBLE</p><p>Prologue</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Christmas Eve, Mom!\u201d nine-year-old Courtney Adams said.</p><p>\u201cMom, you have my list for Santa, don\u2019t you?\u201d seven-year-old Bailey asked anxiously. She knelt on her bed, her large brown eyes beseeching.</p><p>This, Maryanne Adams recognized, was a blatant attempt to postpone bedtime. Both girls were supposed to turn out their lights ten minutes ago but, as usual, they were looking for any excuse to delay the inevitable. The one thing Maryanne hoped to avoid was yet another discussion about the top item on both their Christmas lists\u2014a puppy.</p><p>\u201cWhat about my list?\u201d Courtney asked from her bed. She, at least, had crawled between the covers, but remained in a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure Santa has both your lists by now,\u201d Maryanne reassured her daughters. She stood in the doorway, her hand poised over the light switch. Both her daughters slept in canopy beds their Simpson grandparents had insisted on purchasing for them. It was their prerogative to spoil the grandkids, her father had told her so she didn\u2019t argue too much. The grandchildren were the delight of their grandparents\u2019 lives and could do no wrong.</p><p>\u201cDid you read the list before you gave it to Santa?\u201d Courtney asked.</p><p>At nine, Courtney was well aware that Santa was actually her mom and dad, but she was generous enough not to spoil the fantasy for her younger sister.</p><p>\u201cYou said your prayers?\u201d Maryanne asked, wanting to turn the subject away from a dog.</p> <p>Bailey nodded. \u201cI prayed for a puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, too.\u201d Courtney echoed.</p><p>They were certainly persistent. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Maryanne said.</p><p>Bailey glanced at her older sister. \u201cIs \u2018we\u2019ll see\u2019 good news?\u201d</p><p>Courtney looked uncertain. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She turned pleading eyes to her mother. \u201cMom, we have to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, please, I beg of you,\u201d Bailey cried dramatically. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to have a dog. We\u2019ve got to.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne sighed. \u201cI hate to disappoint you, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for our family to get a puppy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Courtney demanded, her sweet face filling with disappointment.</p><p>Instinctively, Maryanne pressed her hand to her stomach. It was time to tell the girls that there\u2019d be a new family member in six months\u2014past time, really, for them to know. She\u2019d wanted to share the news earlier, but this baby was a complete surprise; she and Nolan had needed time to adjust to the idea first.</p><p>Stepping all the way into the room, Maryanne sat on the edge of Courtney\u2019s bed. She\u2019d prefer to tell the girls with Nolan at her side, but her husband was on deadline and had barricaded himself in his home office, coming out once or twice a day. The last fifty pages of a book were always the most difficult for him to write, winding down the plot and tying up all the loose ends. It was never easy, according to Nolan, to part with the characters he\u2019d lived with for the past number of months. They were as real to him as his own flesh and blood, and because she was a writer, too, she understood that.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this later.\u201d Checking her watch, she frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s past your bedtime as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Mom,\u201d Bailey moaned.</p><p>\u201cMom, please,\u201d Courtney chimed in. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to sleep if you don\u2019t tell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them what?\u201d Nolan asked from the doorway.</p><p>At the sight of their father both girls squealed with delight. Bailey was out of bed first, flying across the room at breakneck speed. Anyone would think it\u2019d been weeks since she\u2019d last seen their father, when in fact he\u2019d had breakfast with the girls that morning.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Courtney leaped off the bed, as well.</p><p>Bailey was in Nolan\u2019s arms, fiercely hugging his neck, and Courtney clasped her skinny arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cAre you finished the book?\u201d Maryanne asked, her gaze connecting with his. She remained seated on the bed, tired out from a long day of Christmas preparations.</p><p>\u201cI typed The End about five minutes ago,\u201d her husband said, smiling down at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked. As a wildly popular suspense author, Nolan generally had an excellent feel for his own work.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s good, but I\u2019ll wait for your feedback.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne loved the way they worked together as husband and wife and as two professional writers. Nolan wrote his novels, and it was the income he generated from the sales of his books that supported their family. Maryanne tackled nonfiction projects. She wrote a weekly column for the Seattle Review and contributed articles to various parenting magazines. One day, she might try her hand at fiction, but for the present she was content.</p><p>\u201cMom says now isn\u2019t a good time for us to get a puppy,\u201d Courtney whined, and it wasn\u2019t long before her younger sister added her own disconsolate cries.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we, Daddy?\u201d Bailey cried. \u201cEvery kid should have a puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA puppy,\u201d Nolan repeated, locking eyes with Maryanne. He sat down on the bed beside her and exhaled slowly. \u201cWell, the truth is, there are other considerations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Courtney asked. It was inconceivable to her that anything should stand in the way of her heart\u2019s desire.</p><p>Nolan placed his arm around Maryanne\u2019s shoulders, indicating that perhaps now was the time to explain. \u201cWell,\u201d he began in thoughtful tones. \u201cWhen a man and a woman fall in love and marry, they sometimes...\u201d He paused and waited for Maryanne to finish.</p><p>\u201cThey love each other so much that they...\u201d She hesitated, thinking this might not be the right approach.</p><p>\u201cThey make babies,\u201d Nolan supplied.</p><p>\u201cYou were a baby once,\u201d Maryanne continued, reaching out to tickle Bailey\u2019s tummy.</p><p>\u201cAnd you, too,\u201d Nolan told Courtney.</p><p>The girls sat cross-legged on Bailey\u2019s bed, their attention on Nolan and Maryanne. Their long brown hair spilled over their shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat has this got to do with a puppy?\u201d Courtney asked, cocking her head to one side, a puzzled frown on her face. How like Nolan she looked just then, Maryanne thought. The Nolan she remembered from the days of their courtship, the newspaper reporter who always seemed to be frowning at her for one reason or another.</p><p>\u201cWhat your mother and I are attempting to explain is that...\u201d He paused and a smile crept across his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both going to be big sisters,\u201d Maryanne said.</p><p>Courtney understood the implications before her little sister did. \u201cMom\u2019s going to have a baby?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne nodded.</p><p>The girls screamed with happiness. As if they\u2019d been practicing the move for a week, they leaped off the bed and immediately started jumping up and down. Soon Nolan was laughing at their antics.</p><p>\u201cI want another sister,\u201d Bailey insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, a brother,\u201d Courtney said.</p><p>\u201cPersonally I\u2019ll be overjoyed with either,\u201d Nolan assured them all. His arm tightened around Maryanne\u2019s shoulders, and he buried his face in her neck as she hid a smile. While this baby was certainly unexpected, he was most welcome. Yes, he! Earlier in the day Maryanne had been at the doctor\u2019s, had her first ultrasound and received the news. How appropriate for Christmas-time...She\u2019d tell Nolan as soon as the kids were asleep.</p><p>\u201cAre you excited, Mom?\u201d Courtney asked.</p><p>Maryanne nodded and held out her arms to her daughter. \u201cVery much so.\u201d</p><p>Courtney came into the circle of Maryanne\u2019s arms. \u201cA baby is even better than a puppy.\u201d She grinned. \u201cBut a puppy\u2019s good, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bailey said. She climbed into Nolan\u2019s lap, leaning her head against his chest.</p><p>\u201cBut you girls understand that a baby and a puppy at the same time would be too much, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Both girls nodded.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d Courtney said in a solemn voice. \u201cWhen the baby\u2019s older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bailey said again.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it bedtime yet?\u201d Nolan asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m too excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t either.\u201d Courtney gazed up at her mother.</p><p>\u201cTell us a story,\u201d Bailey suggested. \u201cA long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should get into bed first,\u201d Nolan said, and both girls reluctantly climbed back into their beds, and pulled the covers all the way up to their chins.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to read to you?\u201d Nolan asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a book,\u201d Courtney said. \u201cTell us a real story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Grandpa and the newspaper business?\u201d Maryanne knew how much her daughters loved to hear about their grandfather Simpson when he\u2019d first started his business.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Courtney shook her head. \u201cTell us about how you and Daddy met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know that story,\u201d Nolan said.</p><p>\u201cWe want the unabridged version this time,\u201d Bailey piped up.</p><p>Unabridged? Only the seven-year-old daughter of a writer would know the meaning of that word.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Annie?\u201d Nolan asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grinning, Maryanne lowered her head. When they\u2019d first met, Nolan had been convinced she was nothing more than a spoiled debutante. From that point on, he\u2019d taken to referring to her as Deb, Trouble and, with obvious affection, Annie.</p><p>\u201cIt was love at first sight,\u201d Nolan told his children.</p><p>Maryanne smiled again. Despite his sometimes cynical manner, her husband could be a real romantic.</p><p>\u201cYour mother was head over heels in love with me the minute we met,\u201d he went on.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember it quite that way,\u201d Maryanne protested.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d Nolan feigned surprise.</p><p>\u201cNo, because you infuriated me no end.\u201d She remembered the notorious column he\u2019d written about her\u2014\u201cMy Evening with the Debutante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d His expression turned to one of exaggerated indignation.</p><p>\u201cYou thought I was a spoiled rich kid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly was not.\u201d Although Maryanne could see the gleam in his eye, she wasn\u2019t going to let him get away with this. It was true her father owned the newspaper and had arranged for her position, but that didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t deserve the opportunity. She might not have worked her way up through the normal channels, but in time she\u2019d proved herself to the staff at the Seattle Review. She\u2019d also proved herself to Nolan\u2014in a rather different way.</p><p>Courtney and Bailey exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cAre you fighting?\u201d Bailey asked.</p><p>Nolan chuckled. \u201cNo, I was just setting your mother straight.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne raised her eyebrows. \u201cApparently your father remembers things differently from the way I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStart at the beginning,\u201d Bailey urged.</p><p>Excitedly clapping her hands, Courtney added, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to tell us about the time Daddy embarrassed you in front of the whole city.\u201d</p><p>Nolan had worked for the Sun, the rival paper in town. It wasn\u2019t as if Maryanne would ever forget the column he\u2019d written about his evening with her. Even now, after all these years, she bristled at the memory. He\u2019d informed the entire city of Seattle that she was a naive idealist, and worst of all, he\u2019d announced that she was away from home for the first time and lonely.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get why that column upset your mother so much,\u201d Nolan said, gesturing helplessly toward his daughters. \u201cAll I did was thank her for making me dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Daddy kiss you that night?\u201d Bailey asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell us,\u201d Courtney cried, interrupting Maryanne. \u201cStart at the very beginning and don\u2019t leave anything out.\u201d</p><p>Nolan looked at Maryanne. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell them, sweetheart?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell them everything, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d Nolan repeated.</p><p>Courtney rubbed her hands together. \u201cOh, boy, this is going to be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all started fifteen years ago...\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>\u201cMaryanne Simpson of the New York Simpsons, I presume?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne glared at the man standing across from her in the reception area of the radio station. She pointedly ignored his sarcasm, keeping her blue eyes as emotionless as possible.</p><p>Nolan Adams\u2014Seattle\u2019s most popular journalist\u2014looked nothing like the polished professional man in the black-and-white photo that headed his daily column. Instead he resembled a well-known disheveled television detective. He even wore a wrinkled raincoat, one that looked as if he\u2019d slept in it for an entire week.</p><p>\u201cOr should I call you Deb?\u201d he taunted.</p><p>\u201cMs. Simpson will suffice,\u201d she said in her best finishing-school voice. The rival newspaperman was cocky and arrogant\u2014and the best damn journalist Maryanne had ever read. Maryanne was a good columnist herself, or at least she was desperately striving to become one. Her father, who owned the Seattle Review and twelve other daily newspapers nationwide, had seen to it that she was given this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with the Seattle paper. She was working hard to prove herself. Perhaps too hard. That was when the trouble had begun.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s the heart?\u201d Nolan asked, reaching for a magazine and flipping idly through the dog-eared pages. \u201cIs it still bleeding from all those liberal views of yours?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne ignored the question, removed her navy-blue wool coat and neatly folded it over the back of a chair. \u201cMy heart\u2019s just fine, thank you.\u201d</p><p>With a sound she could only describe as a snicker, he threw himself down on a nearby chair and indolently brought an ankle up to rest on his knee.</p><p>Maryanne sat across from him, stiff and straight in the high-backed chair, and boldly met his eyes. Everything she needed to know about Nolan Adams could be seen in his face. The strong well-defined lines of his jaw told her how stubborn he could be. His eyes were dark, intelligent and intense. And his mouth...well, that was another story altogether. It seemed to wrestle with itself before ever breaking into a smile, as if a gesture of amusement went against his very nature. Nolan wasn\u2019t smiling now. And Maryanne wasn\u2019t about to let him see how much he intimidated her. But some emotion must have shone in her eyes, because he said abruptly, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who started this, you know?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne was well aware of that. But this rivalry between them had begun unintentionally, at least on her part. The very morning that the competition\u2019s paper, the Seattle Sun, published Nolan\u2019s column on solutions to the city\u2019s housing problem, the Review had run Maryanne\u2019s piece on the same subject. Nolan\u2019s article was meant to be satirical, while Maryanne\u2019s was deadly serious. Her mistake was in stating that there were those in the city who apparently found the situation amusing, and she blasted anyone who behaved so irresponsibly. This was not a joking matter, she\u2019d pointed out.</p><p>It looked as if she\u2019d read Nolan\u2019s column and set out to reprimand him personally for his cavalier attitude.</p><p>Two days later, Nolan\u2019s column poked fun at her, asking what Ms. High Society could possibly know about affordable housing. Clearly a debutante had never had to worry about the roof over her head, he\u2019d snarled. But more than that, he\u2019d made her suggestions to alleviate the growing problem sound both frivolous and impractical.</p><p>Her next column came out the same evening and referred to tough pessimistic reporters who took themselves much too seriously. She went so far as to make fun of a fictional Seattle newsman who resembled Nolan Adams to a T.</p><p>Nolan retaliated once more, and Maryanne seethed. Obviously she\u2019d have to be the one to put an end to this silliness. She hoped that not responding to Nolan\u2019s latest attack would terminate their rivalry, but she should\u2019ve known better. An hour after her column on community spirit had hit the newsstands, KJBR, a local radio station, called, asking Maryanne to give a guest editorial. She\u2019d immediately agreed, excited and honored at the invitation. It wasn\u2019t until later that she learned Nolan Adams would also be speaking. The format was actually a celebrity debate, a fact of which she\u2019d been blithely unaware.</p><p>The door opened and a tall dark-haired woman walked into the station\u2019s reception area. \u201cI\u2019m Liz Walters,\u201d she said, two steps into the room. \u201cI produce the news show. I take it you two know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike family,\u201d Nolan muttered with that cocky grin of his.</p><p>\u201cWe introduced ourselves five minutes ago,\u201d Maryanne rebutted stiffly.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Liz said without glancing up from her clipboard. \u201cIf you\u2019ll both come this way, we\u2019ll get you set up in the control booth.\u201d</p><p>From her brief conversation with the show\u2019s host, Brian Campbell, Maryanne knew that the show taped on Thursday night wouldn\u2019t air until Sunday evening.</p><p>When they were both seated inside the control booth, Maryanne withdrew two typed pages from her bag. Not to be outdone, Nolan made a show of pulling a small notepad from the huge pocket of his crumpled raincoat.</p><p>Brian Campbell began the show with a brief introduction, presenting the evening\u2019s subject: the growing popularity of the Seattle area. He then turned the microphone over to Maryanne, who was to speak first.</p><p>Forcing herself to relax, she took a deep calming breath, tucked her long auburn hair behind her ears and started speaking. She managed to keep her voice low and as well modulated as her nerves would allow.</p><p>\u201cThe word\u2019s out,\u201d she said, quickly checking her notes. \u201cSeattle has been rated one of the top cities in the country for several years running. Is it any wonder Californians are moving up in droves, attracted by the area\u2019s economic growth, the lure of pure fresh air and beautiful clean waters? Seattle has appeal, personality and class.\u201d</p><p>As she warmed to her subject, her voice gained confidence and conviction. She\u2019d fallen in love with Seattle when she\u2019d visited for a two-day stopover before flying to Hawaii. The trip had been a college graduation gift from her parents. She\u2019d returned to New York one week later full of enthusiasm, not for the tourist-cluttered islands, but for the brief glimpse she\u2019d had of the Emerald City.</p><p>From the first, she\u2019d intended to return to the Pacific Northwest. Instead she\u2019d taken a job as a nonfiction editor in one of her father\u2019s New York publishing houses; she\u2019d been so busy that travelling time was limited. That editorial job lasted almost eighteen months, and although Maryanne had thoroughly enjoyed it, she longed to write herself and put her journalism skills to work.</p><p>Samuel Simpson must have sensed her restlessness because he mentioned an opening at the Seattle Review, a long-established paper, when they met in Nantucket over Labor Day weekend. Maryanne had plied him with questions, mentioning more than once that she\u2019d fallen in love with Seattle. Her father had grinned, chewing vigorously on the end of his cigar, and looked towards his wife of twenty-seven years before he\u2019d casually reached for the telephone. After a single call lasting less than three minutes, Samuel announced that the job was hers. Within two weeks, Maryanne was packed and on her way west.</p><p>\u201cIn conclusion I\u2019d like to remind our audience that there\u2019s no turning back now,\u201d Maryanne said. \u201cSeattle sits as a polished jewel in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Seattle, the Emerald City, awaits even greater prosperity, even more progress.\u201d</p><p>She set her papers aside and smiled in the direction of the host, relieved to be finished. She watched in dismay as Nolan scowled at her, then slipped his notepad back inside his pocket. He apparently planned to wing it.</p><p>Nolan\u2014who needed, Brian declared, no introduction\u2014leaned toward the microphone. He glanced at Maryanne, frowned once more, and slowly shook his head.</p><p>\u201cGive me a break, Ms. Simpson!\u201d he cried. \u201cDoesn\u2019t anyone realize it rains here? Did you know that until recently, if Seattle went an entire week without rain, we sacrificed a virgin? Unfortunately we were running low on those until you moved to town.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne barely managed to restrain a gasp.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think Seattle has remained so beautiful?\u201d Nolan continued. \u201cWhy do you think we aren\u2019t suffering from the pollution problems so prevalent in Southern California and elsewhere? You seem to believe Seattle should throw open her arms and invite the world to park on our unspoiled doorstep. My advice to you, and others like you, is to go back where you came from. We don\u2019t want you turning Seattle into another L.A.\u2014or New York.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The hair on the back of Maryanne\u2019s neck bristled. Although he spoke in general terms, his words seemed to be directed solely at her. He was telling her, in effect, to pack up her suitcase and head home to Mommy and Daddy where she belonged.</p><p>When Nolan finished, they were each given two minutes for a rebuttal.</p><p>\u201cSome of what you have to say is true,\u201d Maryanne admitted through clenched teeth. \u201cBut you can\u2019t turn back progress. Only a fool,\u201d she said pointedly, \u201cwould try to keep families from settling in Washington state. You can argue until you\u2019ve lost your voice, but it won\u2019t help. The population in this area is going to explode in the next few years whether you approve or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true, but it doesn\u2019t mean I have to sit still and let it happen. In fact, I intend to do everything I can to put a stop to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe in Seattle have a way of life to protect and a duty to future generations. If growth continues in this vein, our schools will soon be overcrowded, our homes so overpriced that no one except those from out of state will be able to afford housing\u2014and that\u2019s only if they can find it. If that\u2019s what you want, then fine, bask in your ignorance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d Maryanne burst out. \u201cSetting up road blocks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a start,\u201d Nolan returned sarcastically. \u201cSomething\u2019s got to be done before this area becomes another urban disaster.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne rolled her eyes. \u201cDo you honestly think you\u2019re going to single-handedly turn back the tide of progress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure as hell going to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s our Celebrity Debate for this evening,\u201d Brian Campbell said quickly, cutting off any further argument. \u201cJoin us next week when our guests will be City Council candidates Nick Fraser and Robert Hall.\u201d</p><p>The microphone was abruptly switched off. \u201cThat was excellent,\u201d the host said, flashing them a wide enthusiastic smile. \u201cThank you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got your head buried in the sand,\u201d Maryanne felt obliged to inform Nolan, although she knew it wouldn\u2019t do any good. She dropped her notes back in her bag and snapped it firmly shut, as if to say the subject was now closed.</p><p>\u201cYou may be right,\u201d Nolan said with a grin. \u201cBut at least the sand is on a pollution-free beach. If you have your way, it\u2019ll soon be cluttered with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have my way?\u201d she cried. \u201cYou make it sound as though I\u2019m solely responsible for the Puget Sound growth rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are responsible, and those like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, excuse me,\u201d she muttered sarcastically. She nodded politely to Brian Campbell, then hurried back to the reception room where she\u2019d left her coat. To her annoyance Nolan followed her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t excuse you, Deb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to use my name,\u201d she said furiously, \u201cand it isn\u2019t Deb.\u201d</p><p>Crossing his arms over his chest, Nolan leaned lazily against the doorjamb while she retrieved her wool coat.</p><p>Maryanne crammed her arms into the sleeves and nearly tore off the buttons in her rush to leave. The way he stood there studying her did little to cool her temper.</p><p>\u201cAnd another thing...\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re darn right there is. That crack about virgins was intolerably rude! I...I expected better of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d</p><p>He grinned that insufferable grin of his, infuriating her even more.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything better to do than follow me around?\u201d she demanded, stalking out of the room.</p><p>\u201cNot particularly. Fact is, I\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting you.\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d recovered from the shock of learning that he\u2019d be her opponent in this radio debate, Maryanne had eagerly anticipated this evening, too. Long before she\u2019d arrived at the radio station, she\u2019d planned to tell Nolan how much she admired his work. This silly rivalry between them was exactly that: silly. She hadn\u2019t meant to step on his toes and would\u2019ve called and cleared the air if he hadn\u2019t attacked her in print at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>\u201cSure you wanted to meet me. Hurling insults to my face must be far more fun.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that and Maryanne was astonished at how rich and friendly his amusement sounded.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Simpson, don\u2019t take everything so personally. Admit it. We\u2019ve been having a good time poking fun at each other.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. Actually he was partially right. She had enjoyed their exchanges, although she wouldn\u2019t have admitted that earlier. She wasn\u2019t entirely sure she wanted to now.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it,\u201d he coaxed, again with a grin.</p><p>That uneven smile of his was her undoing. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t exactly been fun,\u201d she answered reluctantly, \u201cbut it\u2019s been...interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d He thrust his hands into his pockets, looking pleased with himself.</p><p>She glanced at him appraisingly. The man\u2019s appeal was definitely of the rugged variety: his outrageous charm\u2014Maryanne wasn\u2019t sure charm was really the right word\u2014his craggy face and solid compact build. She\u2019d been surprised to discover he wasn\u2019t as tall as she\u2019d imagined. In fact, he was probably under six feet.</p><p>\u201cWord has it Daddy was the one responsible for landing you this cushy job,\u201d he commented, interrupting her assessment.</p><p>\u201cCushy?\u201d she repeated angrily. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding!\u201d She often put in twelve-hour days, trying to come up with a column that was both relevant and entertaining. In the four weeks since she\u2019d joined the Seattle Review, she\u2019d worked damn hard. She had something to prove, not only to herself but to her peers.</p><p>\u201cSo being a journalist isn\u2019t everything it\u2019s cracked up to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d she returned. To be perfectly honest, Maryanne had never tried harder at anything. Her pride and a whole lot more was riding on the outcome of the next few months. Samuel Simpson\u2019s daughter or not, she was on probation, after which her performance would be reviewed by the managing editor.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if you\u2019ve ever done anything without Daddy\u2019s approval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if you\u2019ve always been this rude.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at that. \u201cAlmost always. As I said, don\u2019t take it personally.\u201d</p><p>With her leather purse tucked securely under her arm, she marched to the exit, which Nolan was effectively blocking. \u201cExcuse me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways so polite,\u201d he murmured before he straightened, allowing her to pass.</p><p>Nolan followed her to the elevator, annoying her even more. Maryanne felt his scrutiny, and it flustered her. She knew she was reasonably attractive, but she also knew that no one was going to rush forward with a banner and a tiara. Her mouth was just a little too full, her eyes a little too round. Her hair had been fire-engine red the entire time she was growing up, but it had darkened to a deep auburn in her early twenties, a fact for which she remained truly grateful. Maryanne had always hated her red hair and the wealth of freckles that accompanied it. No one else in her family had been cursed with red hair, let alone freckles. Her mother\u2019s hair was a beautiful blonde and her father\u2019s a rich chestnut. Even her younger brothers had escaped her fate. If it weren\u2019t for the distinctive high Simpson forehead and deep blue eyes, Maryanne might have suspected she\u2019d been adopted. But that wasn\u2019t the case. Instead she\u2019d been forced to discover early in life how unfair heredity could be.</p><p>The elevator arrived, and both Maryanne and Nolan stepped inside. Nolan leaned against the side\u2014he always seemed to be leaning, Maryanne noticed. Leaning and staring. He was studying her again; she could feel his eyes as profoundly as a caress.</p><p>\u201cWould you kindly stop?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaring at me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d She was curious about him, too, but far too civilized to make an issue of it.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to see if all that blue blood showed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am being honest,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou know, you intrigue me, Simpson. Have you eaten?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne\u2019s heart raced with excitement at the offhand question. He seemed to be leading up to suggesting they dine together. Unfortunately she\u2019d been around Nolan long enough to realize she couldn\u2019t trust the man. Anything she said or did would more than likely show up in that column of his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an Irish stew simmering in a pot at home,\u201d she murmured, dismissing the invitation before he could offer it.</p><p>\u201cGreat! I love stew.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne opened her mouth to tell him she had no intention of asking him into her home. Not after the things he\u2019d said about her in his column. But when she turned to tell him so, their eyes met. His were a deep, dark brown and almost...she couldn\u2019t be sure, but she thought she saw a faint glimmer of admiration. The edge of his mouth quirked upward with an unmistakable hint of challenge. He looked as if he expected her to reject him.</p><p>Against her better judgment, and knowing she\u2019d live to regret this, Maryanne found herself smiling.</p><p>\u201cMy apartment\u2019s on Spring Street,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll follow you.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze, feeling chagrined and already regretful about the whole thing. \u201cI didn\u2019t drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your chauffeur waiting?\u201d he asked, his voice and eyes mocking her in a manner that was practically friendly.</p><p>\u201cI took a cab,\u201d she said, glancing away from him. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of life in Manhattan and I\u2019m not accustomed to dealing with a car. So I don\u2019t have one.\u201d She half expected him to make some derogatory comment and was thankful when he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a lift, then.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d parked his car, a surprisingly stylish sedan, in a lot close to the waterfront. The late-September air was brisk, and Maryanne braced herself against it as Nolan cleared the litter off the passenger seat.</p><p>She slipped inside, grateful to be out of the chill. It didn\u2019t take her more than a couple of seconds to realize that Nolan treated his car the same way he treated his raincoat. The front and back seat were cluttered with empty paper cups, old newspapers and several paperback novels. Mysteries, she noted. The great Nolan Adams read mysteries. A container filled with loose change was propped inside his ashtray.</p><p>While Maryanne searched for the seatbelt, Nolan raced around the front of the car, slid inside and quickly started the engine. \u201cI hope there\u2019s a place to park off Spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Maryanne quickly assured him, \u201cI\u2019ve got valet service.\u201d</p><p>Nolan murmured something under his breath. Had she made an effort, she might\u2019ve been able to hear, but she figured she was probably better off not knowing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned up the heater and Maryanne was warmed by a blast of air. \u201cLet me know if that gets too hot for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot\u201d seemed to describe their relationship. From the first, Maryanne had inadvertently got herself into scalding water with Nolan, water that came closer to the boiling point each time a new column appeared. \u201cHot\u201d also described the way they seemed to ignite sparks off each other. The radio show had proved that much. There was another popular meaning of \u201chot\u201d\u2014one she refused to think about.</p><p>Nevertheless, Maryanne was grateful for the opportunity to bridge their differences, because, despite everything, she genuinely admired Nolan\u2019s writing.</p> <p>They chatted amicably enough until Nolan pulled into the crescent-shaped driveway of The Seattle, the luxury apartment complex where she lived.</p><p>Max, the doorman, opened her car door, his stoic face breaking into a smile as he recognized her. When Nolan climbed out of the driver\u2019s side, Maryanne watched as Max\u2019s smile slowly turned into a frown, as though he wasn\u2019t certain Nolan was appropriate company for a respectable young lady.</p><p>\u201cMax, this is Mr. Adams from the Seattle Sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan Adams?\u201d Max\u2019s expression altered immediately. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like your picture. I read your work faithfully, Mr. Adams. You gave ol\u2019 Larson hell last month. From what I heard, your column was what forced him to resign from City Council.\u201d</p><p>Nolan had given Maryanne hell, too, but she refrained from mentioning it. She doubted Max had ever read her work or was even aware that Nolan had been referring to her in some of his columns.</p> <p>\u201cWould you see to Mr. Adams\u2019s car?\u201d Maryanne asked.</p><p>\u201cRight away, Ms. Simpson.\u201d</p><p>Burying his hands in his pockets, Nolan and Maryanne walked into the extravagantly decorated foyer with its huge crystal chandelier and bubbling fountain. \u201cMy apartment\u2019s on the eleventh floor,\u201d she said, pushing the elevator button.</p><p>\u201cNot the penthouse suite?\u201d he teased.</p><p>Maryanne smiled weakly in response. While they rode upward, she concentrated on taking her keys from her bag to hide her sudden nervousness. Her heart was banging against her ribs. Now that Nolan was practically at her door, she wondered how she\u2019d let this happen. After the things he\u2019d called her, the least of which were Ms. High Society, Miss Debutante and Daddy\u2019s Darling, she felt more than a little vulnerable in his company.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to change your mind?\u201d he asked. Apparently, he\u2019d read her thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she lied.</p><p>She noticed\u2014but sincerely hoped Nolan didn\u2019t\u2014that her hand was shaking when she inserted the key.</p><p>She turned on the light as she walked into the spacious apartment. Nolan followed her, his brows raised at the sight of the modern white leather-and chrome-furniture. There was even a fireplace.</p><p>\u201cNice place you\u2019ve got here,\u201d he said, glancing around.</p><p>She thought she detected sarcasm in his voice, then decided it was what she could expect from him all evening; she might as well get used to it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your raincoat,\u201d she said. Considering the fondness with which he wore the thing, he might well choose to eat in it, too.</p><p>To Maryanne\u2019s surprise, he handed it to her, then walked over to the fireplace and lifted a family photo from the mantel. The picture had been taken several summers earlier, when they\u2019d all been sailing off Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Maryanne was facing into the wind and laughing at the antics of her younger brothers. It certainly wasn\u2019t her most flattering photo. In fact, she looked as if she was gasping for air after being underwater too long. The wind had caught her red hair, its color even more pronounced against the backdrop of white sails.</p><p>\u201cThe two young men are my brothers. My mom and dad are at the helm.\u201d</p> <p>Nolan stared at the picture for several seconds and then back at her. \u201cSo you\u2019re the only redhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow kind of you to mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re in luck. I happen to like redheads.\u201d He said this with such a lazy smile that Maryanne couldn\u2019t possibly be offended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check the stew,\u201d she said, after hanging up their coats. She hurried into the kitchen and lifted the lid of the pot. The pungent aroma of stewing lamb, vegetables and basil filled the apartment.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding, were you?\u201d Nolan asked, sounding mildly surprised.</p><p>\u201cKidding? About what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Irish stew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I put it on this morning, before I left for work. I\u2019ve got one of those all-day cookers.\u201d After living on her own for the past couple of years, Maryanne had become a competent cook. When she\u2019d rented her first apartment in New York, she used to stop off at a deli on her way home, but that had soon become monotonous. Over the course of several months, she\u2019d discovered some excellent recipes for simple nutritious meals. Her father wasn\u2019t going to publish a cookbook written by her, but she did manage to eat well.</p><p>\u201cI thought the stew was an excuse not to have dinner with me,\u201d Nolan remarked conversationally. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect. You\u2019re my first deb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome white wine?\u201d she asked, ignoring his comment.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne got a bottle from the refrigerator and expertly removed the cork. She filled them each a glass, then gave Nolan his and carried the bottle into the living room, where she set it on the glass-topped coffee table. Sitting down on one end of the white leather sofa, she slipped off her shoes and tucked her feet beneath her.</p><p>Nolan sat at the other end, resting his ankle on his knee, making himself at home. \u201cDare I propose a toast?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Seattle,\u201d he said, his mischievous gaze meeting hers. \u201cMay she forever remain unspoiled.\u201d He reached over and touched the rim of her glass with his.</p><p>\u201cTo Seattle,\u201d Maryanne returned. \u201cThe most enchanting city on the West Coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, please, don\u2019t let anyone know,\u201d he coaxed in a stage whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making any promises,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>They tasted the wine, which had come highly recommended by a colleague at the paper. Maryanne had only recently learned that wines from Washington state were quickly gaining a world reputation for excellence. Apparently the soil, a rich sandy loam over a volcanic base, was the reason for that.</p><p>They talked about the wine for a few minutes, and the conversation flowed naturally after that, as they compared experiences and shared impressions. Maryanne was surprised by how much she was enjoying the company of this man she\u2019d considered a foe. Actually, they did have several things in common. Perhaps she was enjoying his company simply because she was lonely, but she didn\u2019t think that was completely true. Still, she\u2019d been too busy with work to do any socializing; she occasionally saw a few people from the paper, but other than that she hadn\u2019t had time to establish any friendships.</p><p>After a second glass of wine, feeling warm and relaxed, Maryanne was willing to admit exactly how isolated she\u2019d felt since moving to Seattle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I went out on a real date,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere does seem to be a shortage of Ivy League guys in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>She giggled and nodded. \u201cAt least Dad\u2019s not sending along a troupe of eligible men for me to meet. I enjoyed living in New York, don\u2019t get me wrong, but every time I turned around, a man was introducing himself and telling me my father had given him my phone number. You\u2019re the first man I\u2019ve had dinner with that Dad didn\u2019t handpick for me since I moved out on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to tell you this, sugar, but I have the distinct impression your daddy would take one look at me and have me arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the least bit true,\u201d Maryanne argued. \u201cMy dad isn\u2019t a snob, only...only if you do meet him take off the raincoat, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe raincoat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like you sleep in it. All you need is a hat and a scrap of paper with \u2018Press\u2019 scrawled on it sticking out of the band\u2014you\u2019d look like you worked for the Planet in Metropolis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to disillusion you, sugar, but I\u2019m not Ivy League and I\u2019m not Superman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darn,\u201d she said, snapping her fingers. \u201cAnd we had such a good thing going.\u201d She was feeling too mellow to remind him not to call her sugar.</p><p>\u201cSo how old are you?\u201d Nolan wanted to know. \u201cTwenty-one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d she amended. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred and three in comparison.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne wasn\u2019t sure what he meant, but she let that pass, too. It felt good to have someone to talk to, someone who was her contemporary, or at least close to being her contemporary.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to tell me how old you are, then at least fill in some of the details of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, my life isn\u2019t nearly as interesting as yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBore me, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, drawing a deep breath. \u201cMy family was dirt-poor. Dad disappeared about the time I was ten and Mom took on two jobs to make ends meet. Get the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cWhat about women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a long and glorious history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding, Nolan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged as if it was of little consequence. \u201cNo time for it. I came close once, but her family didn\u2019t consider my writing career noble enough. Her father tried to fix me up with a job in his insurance office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much. I told her I was going to work for the paper, and she claimed if I really loved her I\u2019d accept her father\u2019s generous offer. It didn\u2019t take me long to decide. I guess she was right\u2014I didn\u2019t love her.\u201d</p><p>He sounded nonchalant, implying that the episode hadn\u2019t cost him a moment\u2019s regret, but just looking at him told Maryanne otherwise. Nolan had been deeply hurt. Every sarcastic irreverent word he wrote suggested it.</p><p>In retrospect, Maryanne mused one afternoon several days later, she\u2019d thoroughly enjoyed her evening with Nolan. They\u2019d eaten, and he\u2019d raved about her Irish stew until she flushed at his praise. She\u2019d made them cups of caf\u00e9 au lait while he built a fire. They\u2019d sat in front of the fireplace and talked for hours. He\u2019d told her more about his own large family, his seven brothers and sisters. How he\u2019d worked his way through two years of college, but was forced to give up his education when he couldn\u2019t afford to continue. As it turned out, he\u2019d been grateful because that decision had led to his first newspaper job. And, as they said, the rest was history.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly seem to be in a good mood,\u201d her coworker, Carol Riverside, said as she strolled past Maryanne\u2019s desk later that same afternoon. Carol was short, with a pixielike face and friendly manner. Maryanne had liked her from the moment they\u2019d met. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in a fabulous mood,\u201d Maryanne said, smiling. Nolan had promised to pay her back by taking her out to dinner. He hadn\u2019t set a definite date, but she half expected to hear from him that evening.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but someone has to tell you, and I was appointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me? What?\u201d Maryanne glanced around the huge open office and noted that several faces were staring in her direction, all wearing sympathetic looks. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Carol moved her arm out from behind her and Maryanne noticed that she was holding a copy of the rival paper\u2019s morning edition. \u201cIt\u2019s Nolan Adams\u2019s column,\u201d Carol said softly, her eyes wide and compassionate.</p> <p>\u201cW-what did he say this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s put it this way. He titled it, \u2018My Evening with the Debutante.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Maryanne was much too furious to stand still. She paced her living room from one end to the other, her mind spitting and churning. A slow painful death was too good for Nolan Adams.</p><p>Her phone rang and she went into the kitchen to answer it. She reached for it so fast she nearly ripped it off the wall. Rarely did she allow herself to become this angry, but complicating her fury was a deep and aching sense of betrayal. \u201cYes,\u201d she said forcefully.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Max,\u201d her doorman announced. \u201cMr. Adams is here. Shall I send him up?\u201d</p><p>For an instant Maryanne was too stunned to speak. The man had nerve, she\u2019d say that much for him. Raw courage, too, if he knew the state of mind she was in.</p><p>\u201cMs. Simpson?\u201d</p><p>It took Maryanne only about a second to decide. \u201cSend him up,\u201d she said with deceptive calm.</p><p>Arms hugging her waist, Maryanne continued pacing. She was going to tell this man in no uncertain terms what she thought of his duplicity, his treachery. He might have assumed from their evening together that she was a gentle, forgiving soul who\u2019d quietly overlook this. Well, if that was his belief, Maryanne was looking forward to enlightening him.</p><p>Her doorbell chimed and she turned to glare at it. Wishing her heart would stop pounding, she gulped in a deep breath, then walked calmly across the living room and opened the door.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Maryanne,\u201d Nolan said, his eyes immediately meeting hers.</p><p>She stood exactly where she was, imitating his tactic of leaning against the door frame and blocking the threshold.</p><p>\u201cMay I come in?\u201d he asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d He was wearing the raincoat again, which looked even more disreputable than before.</p><p>\u201cI take it you read my column?\u201d he murmured, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cRead it?\u201d she nearly shouted. \u201cOf course I read it, and so, it seems, did everyone else in Seattle. Did you really think I\u2019d be able to hold my head up after that? Or was that your intention\u2014humiliating me and...and making me a laughingstock?\u201d She stabbed her index finger repeatedly against his solid chest. \u201cAnd if you think no one\u2019ll figure out it was me just because you didn\u2019t use my name, think again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re angry?\u201d He raised his eyebrows again, as if to suggest she was overreacting.</p><p>\u201cAngry! Angry? That isn\u2019t the half of it, buster!\u201d The problem with being raised in a God-fearing, flag-loving family was that the worst thing she could think of to call him out loud was buster. Plenty of other names flashed through her mind, but none she dared verbalize. No doubt Nolan would delight in revealing this in his column, too.</p> <p>Furious, she grabbed his tie and jerked him into the apartment. \u201cYou can come inside,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I think I will,\u201d Nolan said wryly. He smoothed his tie, which drew her attention to the hard defined muscles of his chest. The last thing Maryanne wanted to do was notice how virile he looked, and she forced her gaze away from him.</p><p>Because it was impossible to stand still, she resumed her pacing. With the first rush of anger spent, she had no idea what to say to him, how to make him realize the enormity of what he\u2019d done. Abruptly, she paused at the edge of her living room and pointed an accusing finger at him. \u201cYou have your nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I said was true,\u201d Nolan stated, boldly meeting her glare. \u201cIf you\u2019d bothered to read the column all the way through, objectively, you\u2019d have noticed there were several complimentary statements.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019A naive idealist, an optimist...\u2019\u201d she said, quoting what she remembered, the parts that had offended her the most. \u201cYou made me sound like Mary Poppins!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly unspoiled and gentle,\u201d Nolan returned, \u201cand very much a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told the entire city I was lonely,\u201d she cried, mortified to even repeat the words.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were lonely,\u201d Nolan insisted, his voice all too reasonable and controlled. That infuriated her even more. \u201cI said you were away from your family for the first time.\u201d</p><p>She poked his chest again, punctuating her speech. \u201cBut you made it sound like I should be in a day-care centre!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t imply anything of the kind,\u201d he contended. \u201cAnd I did mention what a good cook you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be grateful for that? As I recall you said, I was \u2018surprisingly adept in the kitchen\u2019\u2014as if you were amazed I knew the difference between a goldfish bowl and an oven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blowing the whole thing out of proportion.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne barely heard him. \u201cThe comment about my being insecure was the worst. You want security, buster, you\u2019re looking at security. My feet could be molded in cement, I\u2019m that secure.\u201d Defiant angry eyes flashed to him as she pointed at her shoes.</p><p>Nolan didn\u2019t so much as blink. \u201cYou work twice as hard as anyone else at the Review, and twice as many hours. You push yourself because you\u2019ve got something to prove.\u201d</p><p>A strained silence followed his words. She did work hard, she was trying to prove herself, and Nolan knew it. Except for high school and college, she\u2019d had no experience working at a newspaper.</p><p>\u201cDid you wake up one morning and decide to play Sigmund Freud with my life?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWho, may I ask, gave you that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I said is true, Maryanne,\u201d he told her again. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to admit it to me, but if you\u2019re honest you\u2019ll at least admit it to yourself. Your family is your greatest asset and your weakest link. From everything I\u2019ve read about the Simpsons, they\u2019re good people, but they\u2019ve cheated you out of something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what do you mean by that?\u201d she snapped, ready to defend her father to the death, if need be. How dared this pompous, arrogant, argumentative man insult her family?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never know if you\u2019re a good enough journalist to get a job like this without your father\u2019s help. He handed you this plum position, and at the same time cheated you out of a just reward.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne opened her mouth, an argument on the tip of her tongue. Instead, she lowered her gaze, since she couldn\u2019t deny what he\u2019d just said. From the moment she arrived at the Seattle Review, she\u2019d known that Carol Riverside was the one who\u2019d earned the right to be the local-affairs columnist, not her. And yet Carol had been wonderfully supportive and kind.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my intention to insult you or your family,\u201d Nolan continued.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you write that column?\u201d she asked, her voice quavering. \u201cDid you think I was going to be flattered by it?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been so quick with the answers that his silence caught her attention more effectively than anything he could\u2019ve said. She watched as he started pacing. He drew his fingers through his hair and his shoulders rose in a distinct sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. In retrospect, I believe I wanted to set the record straight. At least that was my original intent. I wrote more than I should have, but the piece was never meant to ridicule you. Whether you know it or not, you impressed the hell out of me the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to be grateful you chose to thank me publicly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered sharply. Once more he jerked his fingers roughly through his hair. He didn\u2019t wince, but Maryanne did\u2014which was interesting, since only a few minutes earlier she\u2019d been daydreaming about the joy she\u2019d experience watching this man suffer.</p><p>\u201cInviting myself to dinner the other night was an impulse,\u201d he admitted grudgingly. \u201cThe words slipped out before I realized what I was saying. I don\u2019t know who was more surprised, you or me. I tried to act like I knew what I was doing, play it cool, that sort of thing. The fact is, I discovered I like you. Trust me, I wasn\u2019t in any frame of mind to talk civilly to you when you got to the radio station. All along I\u2019d assumed you were a spoiled rich kid, but I was wrong. Since I\u2019d published several pieces that suggested as much, I felt it was only fair to set the record straight. Besides, for a deb you aren\u2019t half-bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it every time you compliment me I feel a knife between my shoulder blades?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe certainly don\u2019t have a whole lot in common,\u201d Nolan said thoughtfully. \u201cI learned most everything I know on the streets, not in an expensive private school. I doubt there\u2019s a single political issue we can agree on. You\u2019re standing on one side of the fence and I\u2019m way over on the other. We\u2019re about as far apart as any two people could ever be. Socially. Economically. And every other way I could mention. We have no business even speaking to each other, and yet we sat down and shared a meal and talked for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt betrayed by that column today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I apologize, although the damage is already done. I guess I wasn\u2019t aware it would offend you. Like I said, that wasn\u2019t what I intended at all.\u201d He released a giant sigh and paused, as though collecting his thoughts. \u201cAfter I left your place, I felt good. I can\u2019t remember a time I\u2019ve enjoyed myself more. You\u2019re a charming, interesting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have said that in your column!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, only you were obviously too upset to notice it. When I got home that night, I couldn\u2019t sleep. Every time I\u2019d drift off, I\u2019d think of something you\u2019d said, and before I knew it I\u2019d be grinning. Finally I got up and sat at my desk and started writing. The words poured out of me as fast as I could type them. The quality that impressed me the most about you was your honesty. There\u2019s no pretense in you, and the more I thought about that, the more I felt you\u2019ve been cheated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you decided it was your duty to point all this out\u2014for everyone in town to read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I admit I went further than I should have and came over to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re telling me this to make me feel better, it isn\u2019t working.\u201d Her ego was rebounding somewhat, but he still had a lot of apologizing to do.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t give the column a second thought until this afternoon, when someone in the office said I\u2019d really done it now. If I was hoping to make peace with you, I\u2019d failed. This friend said I was likely to get hit by the wrath of a woman scorned and suggested I run for cover.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRightly so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Maryanne.

I solemnly promise I\u2019ll never write another word about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so humble\u2014it doesn\u2019t suit you,\u201d she muttered, gnawing on her lower lip. \u201cBesides, I won\u2019t be able to print a rebuttal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on working for the Review any more, or at least not after tomorrow.\u201d The idea seemed to emerge fully formed; until that moment she hadn\u2019t known what she was going to say.</p><p>The silence following her words was fraught with tension. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act so surprised. I\u2019m quitting the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Nolan had been standing during their whole conversation, but he suddenly found it necessary to sit. He lowered himself slowly to the sofa, his face pale. \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting! There\u2019s no need to do anything so drastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s every need. You said so yourself. You told me I\u2019ve been cheated, that if I\u2019m even half as good a reporter as I think I am I would\u2019ve got this \u2018plum position\u2019 on my own. I\u2019m just agreeing with you.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded stiffly.</p><p>\u201cAs painful as this is to admit, especially to you,\u201d she went on, \u201cyou\u2019re right. My family is wonderful, but they\u2019ve never allowed me to fall on my face. Carol Riverside is the one who deserved the chance to write that column. She\u2019s been with the paper for five years\u2014I\u2019d only been there five minutes. But because my name is Simpson, and because my father made a simple phone call, I was given the job. Carol was cheated. She should\u2019ve been furious. Instead, she was kind and helpful.\u201d Maryanne sat down next to Nolan and propped her feet on the coffee table. \u201cAnd maybe worse than what happened to Carol is what happened to me as a result of being handed this job. What you wrote about me wondering if I had what it takes to make it as a journalist hit too close to home. All my life my father\u2019s been there to tell me I can be anything I want to be and then he promptly arranges it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuitting the Review isn\u2019t going to change that,\u201d Nolan argued. \u201cCome on, Maryanne, you\u2019re taking this too seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you say is going to change my mind,\u201d Maryanne informed him primly. \u201cThe time has come for me to cut myself loose and sink or swim on my own.\u201d</p><p>Her mind was galloping ahead, adjusting to the coming changes. For the first time since she\u2019d read Nolan\u2019s column that afternoon, she experienced the beginnings of excitement. She glanced around the apartment as another thought struck her. \u201cNaturally I\u2019ll have to move out of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going back to New York?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHeavens, no!\u201d she declared, unaccountably thrilled at the reluctance she heard in his voice. \u201cI love Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me, would you? You\u2019re leaping into the deep end, you don\u2019t know how to swim and the lifeguard\u2019s off duty.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne hardly heard Nolan, mainly because she didn\u2019t like what he was saying. How like a man to start a bonfire and then rush to put out the flames. \u201cThe first thing I need to worry about is finding another job,\u201d she announced. \u201cA temporary one, of course. I\u2019m going to continue writing, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to support myself on that, not at first, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist on this folly, you could always freelance for the Sun.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne discounted that suggestion with a shake of her head. \u201cI\u2019d come off looking like a traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d His eyebrows drew together as he frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou know what else I\u2019m going to do?\u201d She shifted her position, tucking her legs beneath her. \u201cI\u2019ve got this trust fund that provides a big interest payment every month. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been using to pay my bills. You and I both know I couldn\u2019t afford this place on what I make at the paper. Well, I\u2019m not going to touch those interest payments and I\u2019ll live solely on what I earn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...wouldn\u2019t do that right away, if I were you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said you were quitting your job.\u201d Nolan sounded uneasy. \u201cI can see that I\u2019ve set off an avalanche here, and I\u2019m beginning to feel mildly concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCapitol Hill. Listen, if you\u2019re serious about moving, you need to give some thought as to what kind of neighborhood you\u2019re getting into. Seattle\u2019s a great town, don\u2019t get me wrong, but like any place we have our problem areas.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cAnnie, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s ever called me Annie before.\u201d Her eyes smiled into his. \u201cWhat do you pay in rent?\u201d</p><p>With his hands buried deep in his pants pockets, he mumbled something under his breath, then mentioned a figure that was one-third of what she was currently dishing out every month.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more than reasonable.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne saw surprise in his eyes, and smiled again. \u201cIf you\u2019re so concerned about my finding the right neighborhood, then you pick one for me. Anyplace, I don\u2019t care. Just remember, you\u2019re the one who got me into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d Nolan\u2019s frown darkened.</p><p>\u201cI may not have appreciated what you said about me in your column,\u201d Maryanne said slowly, \u201cbut I\u2019m beginning to think good things might come of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think I should be dragged to the nearest tree and hanged,\u201d Nolan grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Maryanne slipped into the booth opposite Nolan at the greasy spoon called Mom\u2019s Place. She smiled, feeling like a child on a grand adventure. Perhaps she was going off the deep end, as Nolan had so adamantly claimed the day before. Perhaps, but she doubted it. Everything felt so right.</p><p>Once the idea of living on her own\u2014on income she earned herself, from a job she\u2019d been hired for on her own merits\u2014had taken hold in her mind, it had fast gained momentum. She could work days and write nights. That would be perfect.</p><p>\u201cDid you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI handed in my notice this morning,\u201d she said, reaching for the menu. Nolan had insisted on meeting her for a late lunch and suggested this greasy spoon with its faded neon sign that flashed Home Cooking. She had the impression he ate there regularly.</p><p>\u201cI talked to the managing editor this morning and told him I was leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine he took kindly to that,\u201d Nolan muttered, lifting a white ceramic mug half-full of coffee. He\u2019d been wearing a frown from the moment she\u2019d entered the diner. She had the feeling it was the same frown he\u2019d left her apartment with the night before, but it had deepened since she\u2019d last seen him.</p><p>\u201cLarry wasn\u2019t too upset, but I don\u2019t think he appreciated my suggestion that Carol Riverside take over the column, because he said something I\u2019d rather not repeat about how he was the one who\u2019d do the hiring and promoting, not me, no matter what my name was.\u201d</p><p>Nolan took a sip of coffee and grinned. \u201cI\u2019d bet he\u2019d like my head if it could be arranged, and frankly I don\u2019t blame him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t mention your name or the fact that your column was what led to my decision.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne doubted Nolan even heard her. \u201cI\u2019m regretting that column more with each passing minute. Are you sure I can\u2019t talk you out of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and shook his head. \u201cHow\u2019d the job hunting go?\u201d</p><p>The waitress came by, automatically placing a full mug of coffee in front of Maryanne. She fished a pad from the pocket of her pink apron. \u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a turkey sandwich on rye, no sprouts, a diet soda and a side of potato salad,\u201d Maryanne said with a smile, handing her the menu.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, we don\u2019t serve sprouts here,\u201d she said, scribbling down the order.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the chili, Barbara,\u201d Nolan said. The waitress nodded and strolled away from the booth. \u201cI was asking how your job hunting went,\u201d Nolan reminded Maryanne.</p><p>\u201cI found one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? What will you be doing? And for how much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beginning to sound like my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to feel like your father. Annie, you\u2019re a babe in the woods. You don\u2019t have a clue what you\u2019re getting involved in. Heaven knows I\u2019ve tried to talk some sense into you, but you refuse to listen. And, as you so delight in reminding me, I\u2019m the one responsible for all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop blaming yourself.\u201d Maryanne leaned across the table for her water glass. \u201cI\u2019m grateful, I honestly am\u2014though, trust me, I never thought I\u2019d be saying that. But what you wrote was true. By insulting me, you\u2019ve given me the initiative to make a name for myself without Dad\u2019s help and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cJust answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, about the job. It\u2019s for a...service company. It looks like it\u2019ll work out great. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have any chance of getting hired, since I don\u2019t have much experience, but they took that into consideration. You see, it\u2019s a new company and they can\u2019t afford to pay much. Everyone seems friendly and helpful. The only drawback is my salary and the fact that I won\u2019t be working a lot of hours at first. In fact, the money is a lot less than I was earning at the paper. But I expect to be able to sell a couple of articles soon. I\u2019ll get along all right once I learn to budget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much less than the paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you, you\u2019ll only get angry.\u201d His scowl said he\u2019d be even angrier if she didn\u2019t tell him. From the way he was glaring at her, Maryanne knew she\u2019d reached the limits of his patience. She muttered the amount and promptly lowered her gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t taking the job,\u201d Nolan said flatly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. It\u2019s the best I can do for now. Besides, it\u2019s only temporary. It isn\u2019t all that easy to find work, you know. I must\u2019ve talked to fifteen companies today. No one seemed too impressed with my double degree in Early American History and English. I wanted to find employment where I can use my writing skills, but that didn\u2019t happen, so I took this job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie, you won\u2019t be able to live on so little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that. I\u2019ve got a list of community newspapers and I\u2019m going to contact them about freelance work. I figure between the writing and my job, I\u2019ll do okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what will you be doing?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cCleaning,\u201d she mumbled under her breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working for Rent-A-Maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear Lord,\u201d Nolan groaned. \u201cI hope you\u2019re kidding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet your mind out of the gutter, Adams. I\u2019m going to work six hours a day cleaning homes and offices and I\u2019ll spend the rest of the time doing research for my articles. Oh, and before I forget, I gave your name as a reference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to go back and tell whoever hired you that you\u2019re terribly sorry, but you won\u2019t be able to work there, after all,\u201d Nolan said, and the hard set of his mouth told her he brooked no argument.</p><p>Maryanne was saved from having to say she had no intention of quitting, because the waitress, bless her heart, appeared with their orders at precisely that moment.</p><p>\u201cNow what about an apartment?\u201d Maryanne asked. After his comment about living in a safe neighborhood, she was more than willing to let him locate one for her. \u201cHave you had a chance to check into that for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t give your notice at The Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing a bite of her sandwich, Maryanne nodded eagerly. \u201cFirst thing this morning. I told them I\u2019d be out by the fifteenth, which, in case you were unaware of it, happens to be early next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford the place! And I won\u2019t be able to eat in restaurants everyday or take cabs or buy things whenever I want them.\u201d She smiled proudly as she said it. Money had never been a problem in her life\u2014it had sometimes been an issue, but never a problem. She felt invigorated just thinking about her new status.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop grinning at me like that?\u201d Nolan burst out.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s sort of a novelty to say I can\u2019t afford something, that\u2019s all,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt actually feels kind of good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a couple of weeks it\u2019s going to feel like hell.\u201d Nolan\u2019s face spelled out apprehension and gloom.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll learn that for myself.\u201d She noticed he hadn\u2019t touched his meal. \u201cGo ahead and eat your chili before it gets cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost my appetite.\u201d He immediately contradicted himself by grabbing a small bottle of hot sauce and dousing the chili with several hard shakes.</p><p>\u201cNow did you or did you not find me a furnished studio apartment to look at this afternoon?\u201d Maryanne pressed.</p><p>\u201cI found one. It\u2019s nothing like you\u2019re used to, so be prepared. I\u2019ll take you there once we\u2019re finished lunch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Maryanne said eagerly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one main room, small kitchen, smaller bathroom, tiny closet, no dishwasher.\u201d He paused as if he expected her to jump to her feet and tell him the whole thing was off.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d she said, reaching for her soda.</p><p>\u201cThe floors are pretty worn but they\u2019re hardwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be nice.\u201d She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever lived in a place that didn\u2019t have carpeting, but she\u2019d adjust.</p><p>\u201cThe furniture\u2019s solid enough. It\u2019s old and weighs a ton, but I don\u2019t know how comfortable it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll be working just about every day, so I can\u2019t see that there\u2019ll be a problem,\u201d Maryanne returned absently. As soon as she\u2019d spoken, she realized her mistake.</p><p>Nolan stabbed his spoon into the chili. \u201cYou seem to have forgotten you\u2019re resuming your job hunt. You won\u2019t be working for Rent-A-Maid, and that\u2019s final.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sound like a parent again. I\u2019m old enough to know what I can and can\u2019t do, and I\u2019m going to take that job whether you like it or not, and that\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we will,\u201d she retorted. Nolan might be an astute journalist, but there were several things he had yet to learn about her, and one of them was her stubborn streak. The thought produced a small smile as she realized she was thinking of him in a way that suggested a long-term friendship. He was right when he said they stood on opposite sides of the fence on most issues. He was also right when he claimed they had no business being friends. Nevertheless, Nolan Adams was the most intriguing man she\u2019d ever met.</p><p>Once they\u2019d finished their meal, Nolan reached for the bill, but Maryanne insisted on splitting it. He clearly wasn\u2019t pleased about that but let it pass. Apparently he wasn\u2019t going to argue with her, which suited Maryanne just fine. He escorted her to his car, parked outside the diner, and Maryanne slid inside, absurdly pleased that he\u2019d cleaned up the front seat for her.</p><p>Nolan hesitated when he joined her, his hands on the steering wheel. \u201cAre you sure you want to go through with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you were going to say that.\u201d His mouth twisted. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m aiding and abetting this nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my friend, and I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he started the engine.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the apartment?\u201d Maryanne asked as the car progressed up the steep Seattle hills. \u201cI mean, what neighborhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCapitol Hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how nice. Isn\u2019t that the same part of town you live in?\u201d It wasn\u2019t all that far from The Seattle, either, which meant she\u2019d still have the same telephone exchange. Maybe she could even keep her current number.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he muttered. He didn\u2019t seem to be in the mood for conversation and kept his attention on his driving, instead. He pulled into a parking lot behind an eight-storey post-World War II brick building. \u201cThe apartment\u2019s on the fourth floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She climbed out of the car and stared at the old structure. The Dumpster was backed against the wall and full to overflowing. Maryanne had to step around it before entering by a side door. Apparently there was no elevator, and by the time they reached the fourth floor she was so winded she couldn\u2019t have found the breath to complain, anyway.</p><p>\u201cThe manager gave me the key,\u201d Nolan explained as he paused in the hallway and unlocked the second door on the right. Nolan wasn\u2019t even breathing hard, while Maryanne was leaning against the wall, dragging deep breaths into her oxygen-starved lungs.</p><p>Nolan opened the door and waved her in. \u201cAs I said, it\u2019s not much.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne walked inside and was struck by the sparseness of the furnishings. One overstuffed sofa and one end table with a lamp on a dull stained-wood floor. She blinked, squared her shoulders and forced a smile to her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou honestly think you can live here after The Seattle?\u201d He sounded incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she said with a determination that would\u2019ve made generations of Simpsons proud. \u201cHow far away is your place?\u201d</p><p>Nolan walked over to the window, his back to her. He exhaled sharply before he announced, \u201cI live in the apartment next door.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a baby-sitter,\u201d Maryanne protested. She had some trouble maintaining the conviction in her voice. In truth, she was pleased to learn that Nolan\u2019s apartment was next door, and her heart did a little jig all its own.</p><p>Nolan turned away from the window. His mouth was set in a thin straight line, as if he was going against his better judgment in arranging this. \u201cThat night at the radio station,\u201d he mumbled softly. \u201cI knew it then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he shook his head, apparently lost in his musings. \u201cI took one look at you and deep down inside I heard a small voice cry out, \u2018Here comes trouble.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Despite his fierce expression, Maryanne laughed.</p><p>\u201cLike a fool I ignored it, although Lord only knows how I could have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not blaming me for all this, are you?\u201d Maryanne asked, placing her hands on her hips, prepared to do battle. \u201cIn case you\u2019ve forgotten, you\u2019re the one who invited yourself to dinner that night. Then you got me all mellow with wine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who brought out the bottle. You can\u2019t blame me for that.\u201d He was muttering again and buried his hands deep in the pockets of his raincoat.</p><p>\u201cI was only being a good hostess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, I get the picture,\u201d he said through clenched teeth, shaking his head again. \u201cI was the one stupid enough to write that column afterward. I\u2019d give a week\u2019s pay to take it all back. No, make that a month\u2019s pay. This is the last time,\u201d he vowed, \u201cthat I\u2019m ever going to set the record straight. Any record.\u201d He jerked his hand from his pocket and stared at it.</p><p>Maryanne crossed to the large overstuffed sofa covered with faded chintz fabric and ran her hand along the armrest. It was nearly threadbare in places and nothing like the supple white leather of her sofa at The Seattle. \u201cI wish you\u2019d stop worrying about me. I\u2019m not as fragile as I look.\u201d</p><p>Nolan snickered softly. \u201cA dust ball could bowl you over.\u201d</p><p>A ready argument sprang to her lips, but she quickly swallowed it. \u201cI\u2019ll take the apartment, but I want it understood, right now, that you have no responsibilities toward me. I\u2019m a big girl and I\u2019ll manage perfectly well on my own. I have in the past and I\u2019ll continue to do so in the future.\u201d</p><p>Nolan didn\u2019t respond. Instead he grumbled something she couldn\u2019t hear. He seemed to be doing a lot of that since he\u2019d met her. Maybe it was a long-established habit, but somehow she doubted it.</p><p>Nolan drove her back to The Seattle, and the whole way there Maryanne could hardly contain a feeling of delight. For the first time, she was taking control of her own life. Nolan, however, was obviously experiencing no such enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to sign anything for the apartment? What about a deposit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that later. You realize this studio apartment is the smallest one in the entire building? My own apartment is three times that size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop worrying?\u201d Maryanne told him. A growing sense of purpose filled her, and a keen exhilaration unlike anything she\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>Nolan pulled into the circular driveway at her building. \u201cDo you want to come up for a few minutes?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His dark eyes widened as if she\u2019d casually suggested they play a round of Russian roulette. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He held up both hands. \u201cNo way. Before long, you\u2019ll be serving wine and we\u2019ll be talking like old friends. Then I\u2019ll go home thinking about you, and before I know how it happened\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, then,\u201d she said, disappointed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Later.\u201d But the way he said it suggested that if he didn\u2019t stumble upon her for a decade or two it would be fine with him.</p><p>Maryanne climbed out of his car and was about to close the door when she hesitated. \u201cNolan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Predictably, he started mumbling and drove off the instant she closed the door. In spite of his sour mood, Maryanne found herself smiling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once inside her apartment, she was immediately struck by the contrast between this apartment at The Seattle and the place Nolan had shown her. One was grey, cramped and dingy, the other polished and spacious and elegant. Her mind\u2019s eye went over the dreary apartment on Capitol Hill, and she felt a growing sense of excitement as she thought of different inexpensive ways to bring it color and character. She\u2019d certainly faced challenges before, but never one quite like this. Instinctively she knew there\u2019d be real satisfaction in decorating that place with her newly limited resources.</p><p>Turning her new apartment into a home was the least of her worries, however. She had yet to tell her parents that she\u2019d quit her job. Their reaction would be as predictable as Nolan\u2019s.</p><p>The phone seemed to draw her. Slowly she walked across the room toward it, sighing deeply. Her fingers closed tightly around the receiver. Before she could change her mind, she closed her eyes, punched out the number and waited.</p><p>Her mother answered almost immediately.</p> <p>\u201cI was sitting at my desk,\u201d Muriel Simpson explained. She seemed delighted to hear from Maryanne. \u201cHow\u2019s Seattle? Are you still as fascinated with the Northwest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than ever,\u201d Maryanne answered without a pause; what she didn\u2019t say was that part of her fascination was now because of Nolan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased you like it so well, but I don\u2019t mind telling you, sweetie, I miss you terribly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t lived at home for years,\u201d Maryanne reminded her mother.</p><p>\u201cI know, but you were so much closer to home in Manhattan than you are now. I can\u2019t join you for lunch the way I did last year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeattle\u2019s lovely. I hope you\u2019ll visit me soon.\u201d But not too soon, she prayed.</p><p>\u201cSometime this spring, I promise,\u201d Muriel said. \u201cI was afraid once you settled there all that rain would get you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, honestly, New York City has more annual rainfall than Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, dear, but in New York the rain all comes in a few days. In Seattle it drizzles for weeks on end, or so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad.\u201d Maryanne had been far too busy to pay much attention to the weather. Gathering her courage, she forged ahead. \u201cThe reason I called is that I\u2019ve got a bit of exciting news for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re madly in love and want to get married.\u201d</p> <p>Muriel Simpson was looking forward to grandchildren and had been ever since Maryanne\u2019s graduation from college. Both her brothers, Mark and Sean, were several years younger, so Maryanne knew the expectations were all focused on her. For the past couple of years they\u2019d been introducing her to suitable young men.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing that dramatic,\u201d Maryanne said, then, losing her courage, she crossed her fingers behind her back and blurted out, \u201cI\u2019ve got a special assignment...for the\u2014uh\u2014paper.\u201d The lie nearly stuck in her throat.</p><p>\u201cA special assignment?\u201d</p><p>All right, she was stretching the truth about as far as it would go, and she hated doing it. But she had no choice. Nolan\u2019s reaction would look tame compared to her parents\u2019 if they ever found out she was working as a janitor. Rent-A-Maid gave it a fancy name, but basically she\u2019d been hired to clean. It wasn\u2019t a glamorous job, nor was it profitable, but it was honest work and she needed something to tide her over until she made a name for herself in her chosen field.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of special assignment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a research project. I can\u2019t really talk about it yet.\u201d Maryanne decided it was best to let her family assume the \u201cassignment\u201d was with the newspaper. She wasn\u2019t happy about this; in fact, she felt downright depressed to be misleading her mother this way, but she dared not hint at what she\u2019d actually be doing. The only comfort she derived was from the prospect of showing them her published work in a few months.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not anything dangerous, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens, no,\u201d Maryanne said, forcing a light laugh. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to be involved in it for several weeks, so I won\u2019t be mailing you any of my columns, at least not for a while. I didn\u2019t want you to wonder when you didn\u2019t hear from me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you be travelling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d Only a few city blocks, as a matter of fact, but she couldn\u2019t very well say so. \u201cOnce everything\u2019s completed, I\u2019ll get in touch with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even be able to phone?\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice carried a hint of concern.</p><p>Not often, at least not on her budget, Maryanne realized regretfully.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll phone,\u201d she hurried to assure her mother. She didn\u2019t often partake in subterfuge, and being new to the game, she was making everything up as she went along. She hoped her mother would be trusting enough to take her at her word.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of your columns, dear, tell me what happened with that dreadful reporter who was harassing you earlier in the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreadful reporter?\u201d Maryanne repeated uncertainly. \u201cOh,\u201d she said with a flash of insight. \u201cYou mean Nolan Adams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s his name?\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice rose indignantly. \u201cI hope he\u2019s stopped using that column of his to irritate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all in good fun, Mother.\u201d All right, he had irritated her, but Maryanne was willing to forget their earlier pettiness. \u201cWe\u2019re friends now. As it happens, I like him quite a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d her mother echoed softly. Slowly. \u201cYour newfound friend isn\u2019t married, is he? You know your father and I started our own relationship at odds with each other, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, honestly. Stop matchmaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answer me one thing. Is he married or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot. He\u2019s in his early thirties and he\u2019s handsome.\u201d A noticeable pause followed the description. \u201cMother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re attracted to him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne wasn\u2019t sure she should admit it, but on the other hand she\u2019d already given herself away. \u201cYes,\u201d she said stiffly, \u201cI am...a little. There\u2019s a lot to like about him, even though we don\u2019t always agree. He\u2019s very talented. I\u2019ve never read a column of his that didn\u2019t make me smile\u2014and think. He\u2019s got this\u2014er\u2014interesting sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems. Has he asked you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d But he will, her heart told her.</p><p>\u201cGive him time.\u201d Muriel Simpson\u2019s voice had lowered a notch or two. \u201cNow, sweetie, before we hang up, I want you to tell me some more about this special assignment of yours.\u201d</p><p>They talked for a few minutes longer, and Maryanne was astonished at her own ability to lie by omission\u2014and avoid answering her mother\u2019s questions. She hated this subterfuge, and she hated the guilt she felt afterward. She tried to reason it away by reminding herself that her motives were good. If her parents knew what she was planning, they\u2019d be sick with worry. But she couldn\u2019t remain their little girl forever. She had something to prove, and for the first time she was going to compete like a real contender\u2014without her father standing on the sidelines, bribing the judges.</p><p>Maryanne didn\u2019t hear from Nolan for the next three days, and she was getting anxious. At the end of the week, she\u2019d be finished at the Review; the following Monday she\u2019d be starting at Rent-A-Maid. To her delight, Carol Riverside was appointed as her replacement. The look the managing editor tossed Maryanne\u2019s way suggested he\u2019d given Carol the job not because of her recommendation, but despite it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not convinced you\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d Carol told her over lunch on Maryanne\u2019s last day at the paper.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m convinced, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d Maryanne returned. \u201cWhy is everyone so afraid I\u2019m going to fall flat on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d she pressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think Nolan stopped grumbling from the moment I announced I was quitting the paper, finding a job and moving out on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd well he should grumble!\u201d Carol declared righteously. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who started this whole thing. You\u2019re such a nice girl. I can\u2019t see you getting mixed up with the likes of him.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne had a sneaking suspicion her friend wasn\u2019t saying this out of loyalty to the newspaper. \u201cMixed up with the likes of him? Is there something I don\u2019t know about Seattle\u2019s favorite journalist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan Adams may be the most popular newspaper writer in town, but he\u2019s got a biting edge to him. Oh, he\u2019s witty and talented, I\u2019ll give him that, but he has this scornful attitude that makes me want to shake him till he rattles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s a bit cynical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good deal more than cynical. The problem is, he\u2019s so darn entertaining that his attitude is easy to overlook. I\u2019d like two minutes alone with that man just so I could set him straight. He had no business saying what he did about you in that \u2018My Evening with the Debutante\u2019 piece. Look where it\u2019s led!\u201d</p><p>For that matter, Maryanne wouldn\u2019t mind spending two minutes alone with Nolan, either, but for an entirely different reason. The speed with which the thought entered her mind surprised her enough to produce a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cOnly this time his words came back to bite him,\u201d Carol continued.</p><p>\u201cEverything he wrote was true,\u201d Maryanne felt obliged to remind her friend. She hadn\u2019t been all that thrilled when he\u2019d decided to share those truths with the entire western half of Washington state, but she couldn\u2019t fault his perceptions.</p><p>\u201cNeedless to say, I\u2019m not as concerned about Nolan as I am about you,\u201d Carol said, gazing down at her sandwich. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that little spark in your eye when you talk about him, and frankly it worries me.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne immediately lowered her betraying eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re mistaken. Nolan and I are friends, but that\u2019s the extent of it.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure Nolan would even want to claim her as a friend; she rather suspected he thought of her as a nuisance.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s friendship on his part, but it\u2019s a lot more on yours. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to fall in love with that scoundrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Maryanne countered swiftly. \u201cI\u2019ve only just met him.\u201d Carol\u2019s gaze narrowed on her like a diamond drill bit and Maryanne sighed. \u201cHe intrigues me,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut that\u2019s a long way from becoming emotionally involved with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help worrying about you. And, Maryanne, if you\u2019re falling in love with Nolan, that worries me more than the idea of you being a Rent-a-Maid or finding yourself an apartment on Capitol Hill.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne swallowed tightly. \u201cNolan\u2019s a talented, respected journalist. If I was going to fall in love with him, which I don\u2019t plan to do in the near future, but if I did fall for him, why would it be so tragic?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re sweet and caring and he\u2019s so...\u201d Carol paused and stared into space. \u201cBecause he\u2019s so scornful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but underneath that gruff exterior is a heart of gold. At least I think there is,\u201d Maryanne joked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I doubt it,\u201d Carol went on. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I respect Nolan\u2019s talent. It\u2019s his devil-may-care attitude that troubles me.\u201d</p><p>But it didn\u2019t trouble Maryanne. Not in the least. Perhaps that was what she found most appealing about him. Yet everything Carol said about Nolan was true. He did tend to be cynical and a bit sardonic, but he was also intuitive, reflective and, despite Carol\u2019s impression to the contrary, considerate.</p> <p>Since it was her last day at the paper, Maryanne spent a few extra minutes saying goodbye to her coworkers. Most were sorry to see her go. There\u2019d been a fair amount of resentment directed at her when she arrived, but her hard work seemed to have won over all but the most skeptical doubters.</p><p>On impulse, Maryanne stopped at the diner where Nolan had met her earlier in the week, hoping he\u2019d be there. Her heart flew into her throat when she saw him sitting in a booth by the window, a book propped open in front of him. He didn\u2019t look up when she walked in.</p><p>Nor did he notice her when she approached his booth. Without waiting for an invitation, she slid in across from him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she murmured, keeping her voice low and secretive. \u201cHere comes trouble to plague you once more.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, with obvious reluctance, Nolan dragged his gaze from the novel. Another mystery, Maryanne noted. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Trouble?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Have you thought up any other ways to test my patience? How about walking a tightrope between two skyscrapers? That sounds right up your alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t heard from you in the past few days.\u201d She paused, hoping he\u2019d pick up the conversation. \u201cI thought there was something I should do about the apartment. Sign a lease, give the manager a deposit, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you realize I don\u2019t even know the address. I only saw it that one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to worry about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want anyone else to rent it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t.\u201d He laid the book aside just as the waitress appeared carrying a glass of water and a menu. Maryanne recognized her from the other day. \u201cHello, Barbara,\u201d she said, reading the woman\u2019s name tag. \u201cWhat\u2019s the special for the day? Mr. Adams owes me a meal and I think I\u2019ll collect it while I\u2019ve got the chance.\u201d She waited for him to ask her what she was talking about, but apparently he remembered his promise of dinner to pay her back for the Irish stew he\u2019d eaten at her house the first evening they\u2019d met.</p><p>\u201cCabbage rolls, with soup or salad,\u201d Barbara said, pulling out her pad and pencil while Maryanne quickly scanned the menu.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a cheeseburger and a chocolate shake,\u201d Maryanne decided.</p><p>Barbara grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure it comes up with Mr. Adams\u2019s order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, handing her back the menu. Barbara sauntered off toward the kitchen, scribbling on her order pad as she walked.</p><p>\u201cIt was my last day at the paper,\u201d Maryanne said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask you one more time\u2014are you sure you want to go through with this?\u201d Nolan demanded. \u201cHell, I never thought for a moment you\u2019d want that apartment. Damn it all, you\u2019re a stubborn woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m taking the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d He closed his eyes briefly. \u201cWhat did the Rent-A-Maid agency say when you told them you wouldn\u2019t be taking the job?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne stared purposely out the window. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cNothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could they say?\u201d she asked, trying to ignore the doubt reflected in his eyes. Maybe she was getting good at this lie-telling business, which wasn\u2019t a comforting thought. The way she\u2019d misled her mother still bothered her.</p><p>Nolan drew one hand across his face. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell them, did you? Apparently you intend to play the Cinderella role to the hilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you intend to play the role of my wicked stepmother to perfection.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. \u201cIs there a part in that fairy tale where Cinderella gets locked in a closet for her own good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she couldn\u2019t resist asking. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you had more faith in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have faith in you. I have faith that you\u2019re going to make my life hell for the next few months while you go about proving yourself. Heaven knows what possessed me to write that stupid column, but, trust me, there hasn\u2019t been a minute since it hit the streets that I haven\u2019t regretted it. Not a single minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you insist on moving into the apartment next to mine. That\u2019s just great. Wonderful. Whatever peace I have in my life will be completely and utterly destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Maryanne cried. \u201cBesides, I\u2019d like to remind you, you\u2019re the one who found that apartment, not me. I have no intention of pestering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I figured just seeing the apartment would be enough to put you off. Now I won\u2019t have a minute to myself. I know it, and you know it.\u201d His eyes were darker and more brooding than she\u2019d ever seen them. \u201cI wasn\u2019t kidding when I said you were trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Maryanne said, doing her best to disguise her crushing sense of defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious you never expected me to take the place. I suppose you arranged it to look as bleak as you could. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll find somewhere else to live. Another apartment as far away from you as I can possibly get.\u201d She was out of the booth so fast, so intent on escaping, that she nearly collided with Barbara.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your cheeseburger?\u201d the waitress asked.</p><p>Maryanne glanced at Nolan. \u201cWrap it up and give it to Mr. Adams. I\u2019ve lost my appetite.\u201d</p><p>The tears that blurred her eyes only angered her more. Furious with herself for allowing his words to wound her, she hurried down the street, headed in the direction of the Seattle waterfront. It was growing dark, but she didn\u2019t care; she needed to vent some of her anger, and a brisk hike would serve that purpose nicely.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t concerned when she heard hard quick footsteps behind her. As the wind whipped at her, she shivered and drew her coat closer, tucking her hands in her pockets and hunching her shoulders forward.</p><p>Carol and Nolan both seemed to believe she needed a keeper! They apparently considered her incompetent, and their doubts cut deeply into her pride.</p><p>Her head bowed against the force of the wind, she noticed a pair of male legs matching steps with her own. She looked up and discovered Nolan had joined her.</p><p>For the longest time, he said nothing. They were halfway down a deserted pier before he spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to find another apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be for the best if I did.\u201d He\u2019d already told her she was nothing but trouble, and if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, he\u2019d implied she was going to be a constant nuisance in his life. She had no intention of bothering him. As far as she was concerned, they could live on opposite sides of town. That was what he wanted and that was what he was going to get.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t for the best,\u201d he argued.</p><p>\u201cIt is. We obviously rub each other the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>Nolan turned and gripped her by the shoulders. \u201cThe apartment\u2019s been cleaned. It\u2019s ready for you to move into anytime you want. The rent is reasonable and the neighborhood\u2019s a good one. As I recall, this whole ridiculous business between us started over an article about the lack of affordable housing. You\u2019re not going to find anyplace else, not with what you intend to live on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you live next door!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne bristled. \u201cI won\u2019t live beside a man who considers me a pest. And furthermore, you still owe me dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you were trouble,\u201d he pointed out, ignoring her claim. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you were a pest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you were going to destroy my peace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014of mind,\u201d he went on. He closed his eyes briefly and expelled a sharp frustrated sigh, then repeated, \u201cYou\u2019re going to destroy my peace of mind.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne wasn\u2019t sure she understood. She stared up at him, intrigued by the emotion she saw in his intense brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell should it matter if you live next door to me or in The Seattle?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cMy serenity was shot the minute I laid eyes on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, surprised when her voice came out a raspy whisper. She continued to look up at him, trying to read his expression.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a clue, do you?\u201d he whispered. His fingers found their way into her hair as he lowered his mouth with heart-stopping slowness toward hers. \u201cHeaven keep me from redheaded innocents.\u201d</p><p>But heaven apparently didn\u2019t receive the message, because even as he whispered the words Nolan\u2019s arms were pulling her toward him. With a sigh of regret\u2014or was it pleasure?\u2014his mouth settled over hers. His kiss was light and undemanding, and despite her anger, despite his words, Maryanne felt herself melting.</p><p>With a soft sigh, she flattened her hands on his chest and slid them up to link behind his neck. She leaned against him, letting his strength support her, letting his warmth comfort her.</p><p>He pulled her even closer, wrapped his arms around her waist and half lifted her from the pier. Maryanne heard a low hungry moan; she wasn\u2019t sure if it came from Nolan or from her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. Nothing mattered except this wonderful feeling of being cherished and loved and protected.</p><p>Over the years, Maryanne had been kissed by her share of men. She\u2019d found the experience pleasant, but no one had ever set her on fire the way Nolan did now.</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean,\u201d he whispered unsteadily. \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble here. Big trouble.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Maryanne stood in the doorway of her new apartment, the key held tightly in her hand. She was embarking on her grand adventure, but now that she\u2019d actually moved out of The Seattle her confidence was a bit shaky.</p><p>Carol joined her, huffing and puffing as she staggered the last few steps down the narrow hallway. She sagged against the wall, panting to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cThis place doesn\u2019t have an elevator?\u201d she demanded, when she could speak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being repaired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they always say.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne nodded, barely hearing her friend. Her heart in her throat, she inserted the key and turned the lock. The door stuck, so she used the force of one hip to dislodge it. The apartment was just as she remembered: worn hardwood floors, the bulky faded furniture, the kitchen appliances that would soon be valuable antiques. But Maryanne saw none of that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was her new life.</p><p>She walked directly to the window and gazed out. \u201cI\u2019ve got a great view of Volunteer Park,\u201d she announced to her friend. She hadn\u2019t noticed it the day Nolan had shown her the apartment. \u201cI had no idea the park was so close.\u201d She turned toward Carol, who was still standing in the threshold, her expression one of shock and dismay. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens,\u201d Carol whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t really intend to live here, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d Maryanne said with a smile, glancing around to be sure she hadn\u2019t missed anything. \u201cI\u2019ve got lots of ideas on how to decorate the place.\u201d She leaned back against the windowsill, where much of the dingy beige paint was chipped away to reveal an even dingier grey-green. \u201cWhat it needs is a fresh coat of paint, something light and cheerful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even half the size of your other place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a lot of wasted space at my apartment.\u201d That might be true, Maryanne thought privately, but she wouldn\u2019t have minded bringing some of it with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your neighbor?\u201d Carol asked in a grudging voice. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who started this. The least he could do is offer a little help.\u201d</p><p>Straightening, Maryanne brushed the dust from her palms and looked away. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask him to. I don\u2019t think he even knows when I was planning to move in.\u201d</p><p>Nolan was a subject Maryanne wanted to avoid. She hadn\u2019t talked to him since the night he\u2019d followed her to the waterfront...the night he\u2019d kissed her. He\u2019d stopped off at The Seattle to leave the apartment key and a rental agreement with the doorman. Max had promptly delivered both. The implication was obvious; Nolan didn\u2019t want to see her and was, in fact, doing his best to avoid her.</p> <p>Clearly he disapproved of the way things had developed on the pier that night. She supposed he didn\u2019t like kissing her. Then again, perhaps he did. Perhaps he liked it too much for his oft-lamented \u201cpeace of mind.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne knew how she felt about it. She couldn\u2019t sleep for two nights afterward. Every time she closed her eyes, the image of Nolan holding her in his arms danced through her mind like a waltzing couple from a 1940s movie. She remembered the way he\u2019d scowled down at her when he\u2019d broken off the kiss and how he\u2019d struggled to make light of the incident. And she remembered his eyes, so warm and gentle, telling her another story.</p><p>\u201cHey, lady, is this the place where I\u2019m supposed to bring the boxes?\u201d A lanky boy of about fourteen stood in the doorway, carrying a large cardboard box.</p><p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d Maryanne said, recognizing the container as one of her own. \u201cHow\u2019d you know to bring it up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Adams. He promised a bunch of us guys he\u2019d play basketball with us if we\u2019d help unload the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. How nice. I\u2019m Maryanne Simpson,\u201d she said, her heart warming at Nolan\u2019s unexpected thoughtfulness.</p> <p>\u201cNice to meet you, lady. Now where do you want me to put this?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne pointed to the kitchen. \u201cJust put it in the corner over there.\u201d Before she finished, a second and third boy appeared, each hauling boxes.</p><p>Maryanne slipped past them and ran down the stairs to the parking area behind the building. Nolan was standing in the back of Carol\u2019s husband\u2019s pickup, noisily distributing cardboard boxes and dire warnings. He didn\u2019t see her until she moved closer. When he did, he fell silent, a frown on his face.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, feeling a little shy. \u201cI came to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have gone up and left the truck unattended,\u201d he barked, still frowning. \u201cAnyone could\u2019ve walked off with this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol Riverside and me. She\u2019s upstairs trying to regain her breath. How long will it be before the elevator\u2019s fixed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot soon.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Well, if he\u2019d hoped to discourage her, she wasn\u2019t going to let him. So what if she had to walk up four flights of stairs every day! It was wonderful aerobic exercise. In the past she\u2019d paid good money to attend a health club for the same purpose.</p><p>Nolan returned to his task, lifting boxes and handing them to a long line of teenage boys. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t have a moving company manage this for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d she joked. \u201cOnly rich people use moving companies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this all of it, or do you need to make a second trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is it. Carol and I put everything else in storage earlier this morning. It\u2019s only costing me a few dollars a month. I have to be careful about money now, you know.\u201d</p><p>He scowled again. \u201cWhen do you start with the cleaning company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday morning.\u201d</p><p>Nolan placed his hands on his hips and glared down at her. \u201cIf you\u2019re really intending to take that job\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the first thing you\u2019ll need to do is ask for a raise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, Nolan,\u201d she protested, walking backward. \u201cI can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you can\u2019t do is live on that amount of money, no matter how well you budget,\u201d he muttered. He leapt off the back of the truck as agilely as a cat. \u201cWill you listen to me for once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am listening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just so happens I don\u2019t agree. Quit worrying about me, would you? I\u2019m going to be perfectly all right, especially once I start selling articles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a knight in shining armor, understand?\u201d he shouted after her. \u201cIf you think I\u2019ll be racing to your rescue every time you\u2019re in trouble, then you need to think again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insulting me by even suggesting I\u2019d accept your help.\u201d She tried to be angry with him but found it impossible. He might insist she was entirely on her own, but all the while he was lecturing her he was doling out her boxes so she wouldn\u2019t have to haul them up the stairs herself. Nolan might claim not to be a knight riding to her rescue, but he was behaving suspiciously like one.</p><p>Two hours later, Maryanne was alone in her new apartment for the first time. Standing in the middle of her living room, she surveyed her kingdom. As she\u2019d told Carol, it wasn\u2019t so bad. Boxes filled every bit of available space, but it wouldn\u2019t take her long to unpack and set everything in order.</p><p>She was grateful for the help Carol, Nolan and the neighborhood teenagers had given her, but now it was up to her. And she had lots of plans\u2014she\u2019d paint the walls and put up her pictures and buy some plants\u2014to make this place cheerful and attractive. To turn it into a home.</p><p>It was dark before she\u2019d finished unpacking, and by that time she was both exhausted and hungry. Actually famished more adequately described her condition. Her hunger and exhaustion warred with each other: she was too tired to go out and buy herself something to eat, but too hungry to go to bed without eating. Making the decision about which she should do created a dilemma of startling proportions.</p><p>She\u2019d just decided to make do with a bowl of cornflakes, without milk, when there was a loud knock at her door. She jerked it open to find Nolan there, wearing grey sweatpants and a sweat-soaked T-shirt. He held a basketball under one arm and clutched a large white paper sack in his free hand.</p><p>\u201cNever open the door without knowing who\u2019s on the other side,\u201d he warned, walking directly into the apartment. He dropped the basketball on the sofa and placed his sack\u2014obviously from a fast-food restaurant\u2014on the coffee table. \u201cThat security chain\u2019s there for a reason. Use it.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne was still standing at the door, inhaling the aroma of french fries and hamburgers. \u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get testy with me, either. I\u2019ve just lost two years of my life on a basketball court. I\u2019m too old for this, but luckily what I lack in youth I make up for in smarts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said, closing the door. For good measure she clipped the chain in place and turned the lock.</p><p>\u201cA little show of appreciation would go a long way toward soothing my injuries,\u201d he told her, sinking on to the sofa. He rested his head against the cushion, eyes drifting shut.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be that smart, otherwise you\u2019d have managed to get out of playing with boys twenty years younger than you,\u201d she said lightly. She had trouble keeping her eyes off the white sack on the scratched mahogany coffee table.</p><p>Nolan straightened, wincing as he did so. \u201cI thought you might be hungry.\u201d He reached for the bag and removed a wrapped hamburger, which he tossed to her before taking a second for himself. Next he set out two cardboard cartons full of hot french fries and two cans of soda.</p><p>Maryanne sat down beside him, her hand pressed against her stomach to keep it from growling. \u201cYou\u2019d better be careful,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re beginning to look suspiciously like that knight in shining armor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne was too hungry to waste time arguing. She devoured the hamburger and fries within minutes. Then she relaxed against the back of the sofa and sighed, content.</p><p>\u201cI came to set some ground rules,\u201d Nolan explained. \u201cI think you and I need to get a few things straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she agreed, although she was fairly certain she knew what he wanted to talk about. \u201cI\u2019ve already promised not to pester you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I intend to stay out of your way, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d It didn\u2019t really sound all that wonderful, but it seemed to be what he wanted, so she didn\u2019t have much choice. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Nolan hesitated. Then he leaned forward, resting his forearms on his knees. \u201cYes, one other thing.\u201d He turned to her with a frown. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should...you know, kiss again.\u201d</p><p>A short silence followed his words. At first Maryanne wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d heard him correctly.</p><p>\u201cI realize talking about this may be embarrassing,\u201d Nolan continued, sounding as detached as if he\u2019d introduced the subject of football scores. \u201cI want you to know I\u2019m suggesting this for your own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear that.\u201d It was an effort not to mock him by rolling her eyes.</p><p>He nodded and cleared his throat, and Maryanne could see he wasn\u2019t nearly as indifferent as he wanted her to believe.</p><p>\u201cThere appears to be a certain amount of physical chemistry between us,\u201d he said, avoiding even a glance in her direction. \u201cI feel that the sooner we settle this, the less likelihood there\u2019ll be for misunderstandings later on. The last thing I need is for you to fall in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d she cried, throwing up her arms. The ridiculousness of his comment revived her enough to indulge in some good-natured teasing. \u201cIf I can\u2019t have your heart and soul, then I\u2019m leaving right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Annie, this is nothing to joke about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s joking?\u201d she asked. She made her voice absurdly melodramatic. \u201cI knew the minute I walked into the radio station for the Celebrity Debate that if I couldn\u2019t taste your lips there was nothing left to live for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to make a joke out of this, then you can forget the whole discussion.\u201d He vaulted to his feet and stuffed the wrappers from their burgers and fries into the empty sack. \u201cI was hoping we could have a mature talk, one adult to another, but that\u2019s obviously beyond you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get so bent out of shape,\u201d she said, trying not to smile. \u201cSit down before you do something silly, like leave in a huff. We both know you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d She didn\u2019t know anything of the sort, but it sounded good.</p><p>He complied grudgingly, but he stared past her, training his eyes on the darkened window.</p> <p>Maryanne got stiffly to her feet, every muscle and joint protesting. \u201cIt seems to me that you\u2019re presuming a great deal with this hands-off decree,\u201d she said with all the dignity she could muster. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019d even want you to kiss me again?\u201d</p><p>A slow cocky grin raised the corners of his mouth. \u201cA man can tell. My biggest fear is that you\u2019re going to start thinking things I never meant you to think. Eventually you\u2019d end up getting hurt. I intend to make damn sure nothing romantic develops between us. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying my head\u2019s in the clouds when it comes to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re a sweet kid, stubborn and idealistic, but nonetheless naive. One kiss told me you\u2019ve got a romantic soul, and frankly I don\u2019t want you fluttering those pretty blue eyes at me and dreaming of babies and a white picket fence. You and I are about as different as two people can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent?\u201d To Maryanne\u2019s way of thinking, she had more in common with Nolan Adams than with any other man she\u2019d ever dated.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You come from this rich upstanding family\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she cried. \u201cDon\u2019t say another word about our economic differences. They\u2019re irrelevant. If you\u2019re looking for excuses, find something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need excuses. It\u2019d never work between us and I want to make sure neither of us is ever tempted to try. If you want someone to teach you about being a woman, go elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>His words were like a slap in the face. \u201cNaturally a man of your vast romantic experience gets plenty of requests.\u201d She turned away, so angry she couldn\u2019t keep still. \u201cAs for being afraid I might fall in love with you, let me assure you right now that there\u2019s absolutely no chance of it. In fact, I think you should be more concerned about falling for me!\u201d Her voice was gaining strength and conviction with every word. The man had such colossal nerve. At one time she might have found herself attracted to him, but that possibility had disappeared the minute he walked in her door and opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself,\u201d he argued. \u201cYou\u2019re halfway in love with me already. I can see it in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Carol had said something about her eyes revealing what she felt for Nolan, too.</p> <p>Maryanne whirled around, intent on composing a suitably sarcastic retort, away from his searching gaze. But before any mocking words could pass her lips, a sharp pain shot through her neck, an ache so intense it brought immediate tears to her eyes. She must have moved too quickly, too carelessly.</p><p>Her hands flew to the back of her neck.</p><p>Nolan was instantly on his feet. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she mumbled, easing her way back to the sofa. She sat down, hand still pressed to her neck, waiting a moment before slowly rotating her head, wanting to test the extent of her injury. Quickly, she realized her mistake.</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d Nolan demanded, kneeling in front of her, \u201cwhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know. I moved wrong, I guess.\u201d</p><p>His hands replaced hers. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a crick in your neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I do, it\u2019s all your fault. You say the most ridiculous things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d His voice was as gentle as his hands. He began to knead softly, his fingers tenderly massaging the tight muscles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d he whispered. \u201cJust close your eyes and relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d How could he possibly expect her to do that when he was so close, so warm and sensual? He was fast making a lie of all her protestations.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d he said, his voice low and seductive. He leaned over her, his face, his lips, scant inches from hers. His hands were working the tightness from her neck and shoulders and at the same time creating a dizzying heated sensation that extended to the tips of her fingers and the soles of her feet.</p><p>She sighed and clasped his wrist with both hands, wanting to stop him before she made a fool of herself by swaying toward him or doing something equally suggestive. \u201cI think you should stop. Let me rephrase that. I know you should stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I should, too,\u201d he admitted quietly. \u201cRemember what I said earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the hands-off policy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She could hardly hear him. \u201cLet\u2019s delay it for a day\u2014what do you think?\u201d</p><p>At that moment, clear organized thought was something of a problem. \u201cW-whatever you feel is best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know what\u2019s best,\u201d he whispered. \u201cUnfortunately that doesn\u2019t seem to make a damn bit of difference right now.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure exactly when it happened, but her hands seemed to have left his wrists and were splayed across the front of his T-shirt. His chest felt rigid and muscular; his heart beneath her palms pounded hard and fast. She wondered if her own pulse was keeping time with his.</p><p>With infinite slowness, Nolan lowered his mouth to hers. Maryanne\u2019s eyes drifted closed of their own accord and she moaned, holding back a small cry of welcome. His touch was even more compelling than she remembered. Nolan must have felt something similar, because his groan followed, an echo of hers.</p><p>He kissed her again and again. Maryanne wanted more, but he resisted giving in to her desires\u2014or his own. It was as if he\u2019d decided a few kisses were of little consequence and wouldn\u2019t seriously affect either one of them.</p><p>Wrong. Maryanne wanted to shout it at him, but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>His mouth left hers and blazed a fiery trail of kisses across her sensitized skin. His lips brushed her throat, under her chin to the vulnerable hollow. Only minutes earlier, moving her neck without pain had been impossible; now she did so freely, turning it, arching, asking\u2014no, demanding\u2014that he kiss her again the way he had that night at the waterfront.</p><p>Nolan complied, and he seemed to do it willingly, surrendering the battle. He groaned anew and the sound came from deep in his throat. His fingers tangled in the thick strands of her hair as his mouth rushed back to hers.</p><p>Maryanne was experiencing a renewal of her own. She felt as if she had lain dormant and was bursting to life, like a flower struggling out of winter snows into the light and warmth of spring.</p><p>All too soon, Nolan pulled away from her. His eyes met and held hers. She knew her eyes were filled with questions, but his gave her no answers.</p><p>He got abruptly to his feet.</p><p>\u201cNolan,\u201d she said, shocked that he would leave her like this.</p><p>He looked back at her and she saw it then. The regret. A regret tinged with compassion. \u201cYou\u2019re so exhausted you can barely sit up. Go to bed and we\u2019ll both forget this ever happened. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Too stunned to reply, she nodded. Maybe Nolan could forget it, but she knew she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLock the door after me. And next time don\u2019t be so eager to find out who\u2019s knocking. There isn\u2019t any doorman here.\u201d</p><p>Once more she nodded. She got up and followed him to the door, holding it open.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Annie, don\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that,\u201d he accused, then slowly shook his head as if to clear his thoughts. He rubbed his face and sighed, then pressed his knuckle under her chin. \u201cThe two of us are starting over first thing tomorrow. There won\u2019t be any more of this.\u201d But even as he was speaking, he was leaning forward to gently brush her mouth with his.</p><p>It was the sound of Nolan pounding furiously away on his electric typewriter\u2014a heavy, outdated office model\u2014that woke Maryanne the next morning. She yawned loudly, stretching her arms high above her head, arching her back. Her first night in her new apartment, and she\u2019d slept like a rock. The sofa, which opened into a queen-size sleeper, was lumpy and soft, nearly swallowing her up, but she\u2019d been too exhausted to care.</p><p>Nolan\u2019s fierce typing continued most of the day. Maryanne hadn\u2019t expected to see him, so she wasn\u2019t disappointed when she didn\u2019t. He seemed determined to avoid her and managed it successfully for most of the week.</p><p>Since she\u2019d promised not to make a nuisance of herself, Maryanne kept out of his way, too. She started work at the cleaning company and wrote three articles in five days, often staying up late into the night.</p><p>The work for Rent-A-Maid was backbreaking and arduous. She spent three afternoons a week picking up after professional men who were nothing less than slobs. Maryanne had to resist the urge to write them each a note demanding that they put their dirty dishes in the sink and their soiled clothes in the laundry basket.</p><p>Rent-A-Maid had made housekeeping sound glamorous. It wasn\u2019t. In fact, it was the hardest, most physically exhausting job she\u2019d ever undertaken.</p><p>By the end of the week, her nails were broken and chipped and her hands were red and chapped.</p><p>It was by chance rather than design that Maryanne bumped into Nolan late Friday afternoon. She was carrying a bag of groceries up the stairs when he bounded past her, taking the steps two at a time.</p><p>\u201cAnnie.\u201d He paused on the landing, waiting for her to catch up. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne didn\u2019t know what to say. She couldn\u2019t very well inform him that the highlight of her week was scraping a crusty patch off the bottom of an oven at one of the apartments she cleaned. She\u2019d had such lofty expectations, such dreams. Nor could she casually announce that the stockbroker she cleaned for had spilled wine on his carpet and she\u2019d spent an hour trying to get the stain out and broken two nails in the process.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she lied. \u201cEverything\u2019s just wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, let me take that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She handed him the single bag, her week\u2019s allotment of groceries. Unfortunately it was all she could afford. Everything had seemed so exciting when she started out; her plans had been so promising. The reality was proving to be something else again.</p><p>\u201cWell, how do you like cleaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great, really great.\u201d It was shocking how easily the lie came. \u201cI\u2019m finding it...a challenge.\u201d</p><p>Nolan smiled absently. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it. Have you got your first paycheck yet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI cashed it this afternoon.\u201d She used to spend more each week at the dry cleaners than she\u2019d received in her first paycheck from Rent-A-Maid. The entire amount had gone for food and transportation, and there were only a few dollars left. Her budget was tight, but she\u2019d make it. She\u2019d have to.</p><p>Nolan paused in front of her door and waited while she scrabbled through her bag, searching for the key. \u201cI hear you typing at night,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you working on anything special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him curiously. \u201cHow fast do you type? Eighty words a minute? A hundred? And for heaven\u2019s sake, why don\u2019t you use a computer like everyone else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSixty words a minute on a good day. And for your information, I happen to like my electric. It may be old, but it does the job.\u201d</p><p>She finally retrieved her key, conscious of his gaze on her hands.</p><p>Suddenly he grasped her fingers. \u201cAll right,\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s happened to me,\u201d Maryanne insisted hotly, pulling her hand free of Nolan\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cLook at your nails,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one that\u2019s not broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like I should be dragged before a firing squad at dawn. So I chipped a few nails this week. I\u2019ll survive.\u201d Although she was making light of it, each broken fingernail was like a small loss. She took pride in her perfect nails, or at least she once had.</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he scrutinized her. \u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d appointed yourself my father confessor.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed in his dark eyes as he took the key from her unresisting fingers. He opened the door and, with one hand at her shoulder, urged her inside. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d Maryanne marched into the apartment, plunked her bag of groceries on the kitchen counter and spun around to confront her neighbor. \u201cListen here, buster, you\u2019ve made it perfectly clear that you don\u2019t want anything to do with me. That\u2019s your choice, and I\u2019m certainly not going to bore you with the sorry details of my life.\u201d</p> <p>He ignored her words and started pacing the small living area, pausing in front of the window. His presence filled the apartment, making it seem smaller than usual. He pivoted sharply, pointing an accusatory finger in her direction. \u201cThese broken nails came from swinging a dust mop around, didn\u2019t they? What the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne didn\u2019t answer him right away. She was angry, and his sudden concern for her welfare made her even angrier. \u201cI told you before, I don\u2019t need a guardian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgainst my advice, you took that stupid job. Anyone with half a brain would know it wasn\u2019t going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop acting like you\u2019re responsible for me?\u201d Maryanne snapped.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I am responsible for you. You wouldn\u2019t be here if I hadn\u2019t written that damn column. I don\u2019t want to intrude on your life any more than you want me to, but let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s no one else to look out for you. Sooner or later someone\u2019s going to take advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>That did it. Maryanne stalked over to him and jabbed her index finger into his chest with enough force to bend what remained of her nail. \u201cIn case you need reminding, I\u2019m my own woman. I make my own decisions. I\u2019ll work any place I damn well please. Furthermore, I can take care of myself.\u201d She whirled around and opened her front door. \u201cNow kindly leave!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she repeated.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said again, returning to the window. He crossed his arms over his chest and sighed impatiently. \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten, have you? I can tell, because you get testy when you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d leave my apartment the way I asked, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about having dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>The invitation took Maryanne by surprise. Her first impulse was to throw it back in his face. After an entire week of pretending she didn\u2019t exist, he had a lot of nerve even asking.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d As if that made a difference. Maryanne was famished, and the thought of sharing her meal with Nolan was more tempting than she wanted to admit, even to herself.</p><p>\u201cThe diner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to order chili?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to ask them to remove the non-existent bean sprouts from your sandwich?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne hesitated. She felt confused by all her contradictory emotions. She was strongly attracted to Nolan and every time they were together she caught herself hoping they could become friends\u2014more than friends. But, equally often, he infuriated her or left her feeling depressed. He made the most outlandish remarks to her. He seemed to have appointed himself her guardian. When he wasn\u2019t issuing decrees, he neglected her as if she were nothing more than a nuisance. And to provide a finishing touch, she was lying to her parents because of him! Well, maybe that wasn\u2019t quite fair, but...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll throw in dessert,\u201d he coaxed with a smile.</p><p>That smile was her Waterloo, yet she still struggled. \u201cA la mode?\u201d</p><p>His grin widened. \u201cYou drive a hard bargain.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne\u2019s eyes met his and although Nolan could make her angrier than anyone she\u2019d ever known, a smile trembled on her own lips.</p><p>They agreed to meet a half-hour later. That gave Maryanne time to unpack her groceries, change clothes and freshen her make-up. She found herself humming as she applied lip gloss, wondering if she was reading too much into this impromptu dinner date.</p><p>When Nolan came to her door to pick her up, Maryanne noted that he\u2019d changed into jeans and a fisherman\u2019s sweater. It was the first time she\u2019d seen him without the raincoat, other than the day he\u2019d played basketball with the neighborhood boys. He looked good. All right, she admitted grudgingly, he looked fantastic.</p><p>\u201cYou dressed up,\u201d she said before she could stop herself, grateful she\u2019d understated her attraction to him.</p><p>\u201cSo did you. You look nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I forget to tell you, word has it the elevator\u2019s going to be fixed Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s the best news I\u2019ve heard all week.\u201d Goodness, could she take all these glad tidings at once? First Nolan had actually invited her out on a date, and now she wouldn\u2019t have to hike up four flights of stairs every afternoon. Life was indeed treating her well.</p><p>They were several blocks from the apartment building before Maryanne realized Nolan was driving in the opposite direction of the diner. She said as much.</p><p>\u201cDo you like Chinese food?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe diner\u2019s short-staffed\u2014one of the waitresses quit. I thought Chinese food might be interesting, and I promise we won\u2019t have to wait for a table.\u201d</p><p>It sounded heavenly to Maryanne. She didn\u2019t know how significant Nolan\u2019s decision to take her to a different restaurant might be. Perhaps it was foolish, but Maryanne hoped it meant she was becoming special to him. As if he could read her mind, Nolan was unusually quiet on the drive into Seattle\u2019s International District.</p><p>So much for romance. Maryanne could almost hear his thoughts. If she were a betting woman, she\u2019d place odds on the way their dinner conversation would go. First Nolan would try to find out exactly what tasks had been assigned to her by Rent-A-Maid. Then he\u2019d try to convince her to quit.</p><p>Only she wasn\u2019t going to let him. She was her own woman, and she\u2019d said it often enough to convince herself. If this newsman thought he could sway her with a fancy dinner and a few well-spoken words, then he was about to learn a valuable lesson.</p><p>The restaurant proved to be a Chinese version of the greasy spoon where Nolan ate regularly. The minute they walked into the small room, Maryanne was greeted by a wide variety of tantalizing scents. Pungent spices and oils wafted through the air, and the smells were so appealing it was all she could do not to follow them into the kitchen. She knew before sampling a single bite that the food would be some of the best Asian cuisine she\u2019d ever tasted.</p><p>An elderly Chinese gentleman greeted Nolan as if he were a long-lost relative. The two shared a brief exchange in Chinese before the man escorted them to a table. He shouted into the kitchen, and a brightly painted ceramic pot of tea was quickly delivered to their table.</p><p>Nolan and Maryanne were never given menus. Almost from the moment they were seated, food began appearing on their table. An appetizer plate came first, with several items Maryanne couldn\u2019t readily identify. But she was too hungry to care. Everything was delicious and she happily devoured one after another.</p><p>\u201cYou seem well acquainted with the waiter,\u201d Maryanne commented, once the appetizer plate was empty. She barely had time to catch her breath before a bowl of thick spicy soup was brought to them by the same elderly gentleman. He paused and smiled proudly at Nolan, then glanced at Maryanne, before nodding in a profound way.</p><p>\u201cWong Su\u2019s the owner. I went to school with his son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where you picked up Chinese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I only know a few words, just enough to get the gist of what he\u2019s saying,\u201d he answered brusquely, reaching for his spoon.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it he said when we first came in? I noticed you seemed quick to disagree with him.\u201d</p><p>Nolan dipped his spoon into the soup, ignoring her question.</p><p>\u201cNolan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said you\u2019re too thin.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne shook her head, immediately aware that he was lying. \u201cIf he really thought that, you\u2019d have agreed with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Nolan muttered, looking severely displeased. \u201cI should\u2019ve known better than to bring a woman to Wong Su\u2019s place. He assumed there was something romantic between us. He said you\u2019d give me many fine sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet.\u201d</p><p>Nolan reacted instantly to her words. He dropped his spoon beside the bowl with a clatter, planted his elbows on the table and glared at her heatedly. \u201cNow don\u2019t go all sentimental on me. There\u2019s nothing between us and there never will be.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne promptly saluted. \u201cAye, aye, Captain,\u201d she mocked.</p><p>\u201cGood. Well, now that\u2019s settled, tell me about your week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about yours,\u201d she countered, unwilling to change the subject to herself quite so easily. \u201cYou seemed a whole lot busier than I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to work, came home...\u201d</p><p>\u201c...worked some more,\u201d she finished for him. Another plate, heaped high with sizzling hot chicken and crisp vegetables, was brought by Wong Su, who offered Maryanne a grin.</p><p>Nolan frowned at his friend and said something in Chinese that caused the older man to laugh outright. When Nolan returned his attention to Maryanne, he was scowling again. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t encourage him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d To the best of her knowledge she was innocent of any wrongdoing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nolan thought it over for a moment. \u201cNever mind, no point in telling you.\u201d</p><p>Other steaming dishes arrived\u2014prawns with cashew nuts, then ginger beef and barbecued pork, each accompanied by small bowls of rice until virtually every inch of the small table was covered.</p><p>\u201cYou were telling me about your week,\u201d Maryanne reminded him, reaching for the dish in the centre of the crowded table.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Nolan retorted.</p> <p>With a scornful sigh, Maryanne passed him the chicken. \u201cAll right, have it your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to needle me to death until you find out what I\u2019m working on in my spare time, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d If he didn\u2019t want her to know, then fine, she had no intention of asking again. Acting as nonchalant as possible, she helped herself to a thick slice of the pork. She dipped it into a small dish of hot mustard, which proved to be a bit more potent than she\u2019d expected; her eyes started to water.</p><p>Mumbling under his breath, Nolan handed her his napkin. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d She wiped the moisture from her eyes and blinked a couple of times before picking up her water glass. Once she\u2019d composed herself, she resumed their previous discussion. \u201cOn the contrary, Mr. Adams, whatever project so intensely occupies your time is your own concern.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpoken like a true aristocrat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously you don\u2019t care to share it with me.\u201d</p><p>He gave an exaggerated sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s a novel,\u201d he said. \u201cThere now, are you satisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA novel,\u201d she repeated coolly. \u201cReally. And all along, I thought you were taking in typing jobs on the side.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her, but the edges of his mouth turned up in a reluctant grin. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the plot, all right? I\u2019m afraid that would water it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand perfectly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn it all, Annie, would you stop looking at me with those big blue eyes of yours? I already feel guilty as hell without you smiling serenely at me and trying to act so blas\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty about what?\u201d</p><p>He expelled his breath sharply. \u201cListen,\u201d he said in a low voice, leaning toward her. \u201cAs much as I hate to admit this, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s none of my business where you work or how many nails you break or how much you\u2019re paid. But damn it all, I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>She raised her chopsticks in an effort to stop him. \u201cIt seems to me I\u2019ve heard this argument before. Actually, it\u2019s getting downright boring.\u201d</p><p>Nolan dropped his voice even lower. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sheltered all your life. I know you don\u2019t want me to feel responsible for what you\u2019re doing\u2014or for you. And I wish I didn\u2019t. Unfortunately I can\u2019t help it. Believe me, I\u2019ve tried. It doesn\u2019t work. Every night I lie awake wondering what trouble you\u2019re going to get into next. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen first\u2014you working yourself to death, or me getting an ulcer.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne\u2019s gaze fell to her hands, and the uneven length of her once perfectly uniform fingernails. \u201cThey are rather pitiful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Nolan glanced at them and grimaced. \u201cAs a personal favor to me would you consider giving up the job at Rent-A-Maid?\u201d He ran his fingers through his hair, sighing heavily. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t come easy to ask you this, Annie. If for no other reason, do it because you owe me a favor for finding you the apartment. But for heaven\u2019s sake, quit that job.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him right away. She wanted to do as he asked, because she was falling in love with him. Because she craved his approval. Yet she wanted to reject his entreaties, flout his demands. Because he made her feel confused and contrary and full of unpredictable emotions.</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019ll do any good, I\u2019ll promise not to interfere again,\u201d he said, his voice so quiet it was almost a whisper. \u201cIf you\u2019ll quit Rent-a-Maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a personal favor to you,\u201d she repeated, nodding slowly. So much for refusing to be swayed by dinner and a few well-chosen words.</p><p>Their eyes met and held for a long moment. Deliberately, as though it went against his will, Nolan reached out and brushed an auburn curl from her cheek. His touch was light yet strangely intimate, as intimate as a kiss. His fingers lingered on her cheek and it was all Maryanne could do not to cover his hand with her own and close her eyes to savor the wealth of sensations that settled around her.</p><p>Nolan\u2019s dark eyes narrowed, and she could tell he was struggling. She could read it in every line, every feature of his handsome face. But struggling against what? She could only speculate. He didn\u2019t want to be attracted to her; that much was obvious.</p><p>As if he needed to break contact with her eyes, he lowered his gaze to her mouth. Whether it was intentional or not, Maryanne didn\u2019t know, but his thumb inched closer to her lips, easing toward the corner. Then, with an abrupt movement, he pulled his hand away and returned to his meal, eating quickly and methodically.</p><p>Maryanne tried to eat, but her own appetite was gone. Wong Su refused payment although Nolan tried to insist. Instead the elderly man said something in Chinese that sent every eye in the place straight to Maryanne. She smiled benignly, wondering what he could possibly have said that would make the great Nolan Adams blush.</p><p>The drive back to the apartment was even more silent than the one to the restaurant had been. Maryanne considered asking Nolan exactly what Wong Su had said just before they\u2019d left, but she thought better of it.</p><p>They took their time walking up the four flights of stairs. \u201cWill you come in for coffee?\u201d Maryanne asked when they arrived at her door.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tonight,\u201d Nolan said after several all-too-quiet moments.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bite, you know.\u201d His eyes didn\u2019t waver from hers. The attraction was there\u2014she could feel it as surely as she had his touch at dinner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to finish my chapter.\u201d</p><p>So he was going to close her out once again. \u201cDon\u2019t work too hard,\u201d she said, opening the apartment door. Her disappointment was keen, but she managed to disguise it behind a shrug. \u201cThank you for dinner. It was delicious.\u201d</p><p>Nolan thrust his hands into his pockets. It might have been her imagination, but she thought he did it to keep from reaching for her. The idea comforted her ego and she smiled up at him warmly.</p><p>She was about to close the door when he stopped her. \u201cYes?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His eyes were as piercing and dark as she\u2019d ever seen them. \u201cMy typing. Does it keep you awake nights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she told him and shook her head for emphasis. \u201cThe book must be going well.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then sighed. \u201cListen, would it be possible...\u201d He paused and started again. \u201cAre you busy tomorrow night? I\u2019ve got two tickets to the Seattle Repertory Theatre and I was wondering...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to go,\u201d she said eagerly, before he\u2019d even finished the question.</p><p>Judging by the expression on his face, the invitation seemed to be as much a surprise to him as it was to her. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she answered brightly. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The afternoon was glorious, with just the right mixture of wind and sunshine. Hands clasped behind her back, Maryanne strolled across the grass of Volunteer Park, kicking up leaves as she went. She\u2019d spent the morning researching an article she hoped to sell to a local magazine and she was taking a break.</p><p>The basketball court was occupied by several teenage boys, a couple of whom she recognized from the day she\u2019d moved. With time on her hands and an afternoon to enjoy, Maryanne paused to watch the hotly contested game. Sitting on a picnic table, she swung her legs, content to laze away the sunny afternoon. Everything was going so well. With hardly any difficulty she\u2019d found another job. Nolan probably wasn\u2019t going to approve of this one, either, but that was just too bad.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d A girl of about thirteen, wearing a jean jacket and tight black stretch leggings, strolled up to the picnic table. \u201cYou\u2019re with Mr. Adams, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne would\u2019ve liked to think so, but she didn\u2019t feel she could describe it quite that way. \u201cWhat makes you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou moved in with him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. I live in the apartment next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe Eddie when he said Mr. Adams had a woman. He\u2019s never had anyone live with him before. He\u2019s just not the type, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne did know. She was learning not to take his attitude toward her personally. The better acquainted she became with Nolan, the more clearly she realized that he considered all women a nuisance. The first night they met, he\u2019d mentioned that he\u2019d been in love once, but his tone had been so casual it implied this romance was merely a long-ago mistake. He\u2019d talked about the experience as if it meant little or nothing to him. Maryanne wasn\u2019t sure she believed that.</p><p>\u201cMr. Adams is a really neat guy. All the kids like him a lot.\u201d The girl smiled, suggesting she was one of his legion of admirers. \u201cI\u2019m Gloria Masterson.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne held out her hand. \u201cMaryanne Simpson.\u201d</p><p>Gloria smiled shyly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t live with him, are you his girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said when I asked him about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as though she could expect him to admit anything more.</p><p>\u201cMr. Adams comes around every now and then and talks to us kids in the park. I think he\u2019s checking up on us and making sure no one\u2019s into drugs or gangs.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne smiled. That sounded exactly like the kind of thing Nolan would do.</p><p>\u201cOnly a few kids around here are that stupid, but you know, I think a couple of the boys might\u2019ve been tempted to try something if it wasn\u2019t for Mr. Adams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Gloria.\u201d A lanky boy from the basketball court called out. \u201cCome here, woman.\u201d</p><p>Gloria sighed loudly, then shouted. \u201cJust a minute.\u201d She turned back to Maryanne. \u201cI\u2019m really not Eddie\u2019s woman. He just likes to think so.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne smiled. She wished she could say the same thing about her and Nolan. \u201cIt was nice to meet you, Gloria. Maybe I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloria,\u201d Eddie shouted, \u201care you coming or not?\u201d</p><p>The teenage girl shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I put up with him.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne left the park soon afterward. The first thing she noticed when she got home was an envelope taped to her door.</p><p>She waited until she was inside the apartment to open it, and as she did a single ticket and a note slipped out. \u201cI\u2019m going to be stuck at the office,\u201d the note read. \u201cThe curtain goes up at eight\u2014don\u2019t be late. N.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne was mildly disappointed that Nolan wouldn\u2019t be driving her to the play, but she decided to splurge and take a taxi. By seven-thirty, when the cab arrived, she was dressed and ready. She wore her best evening attire, a long black velvet skirt and matching blazer with a cream-colored silk blouse. She\u2019d even put on her pearl earrings and cameo necklace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The theatre was one of the nicest in town, and Maryanne\u2019s heart sang with excitement as the usher escorted her to her seat. Nolan hadn\u2019t arrived yet and she looked around expectantly.</p><p>The curtain was about to go up when a man she mentally categorized as wealthy and a bit of a charmer settled in the vacant seat next to hers.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, leaning toward her, smiling warmly. \u201cI\u2019m Griff Bradley. Nolan Adams sent me.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Maryanne two seconds to figure out what Nolan had done. The low-down rat had matched her up with someone he considered more appropriate. Someone he assumed she had more in common with. Someone wealthy and slick. Someone her father would approve of.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Nolan?\u201d Maryanne demanded. She bolted to her feet and grabbed her bag, jerking it so hard the gold chain strap threatened to break.</p><p>Griff looked taken aback by her sharp question. \u201cYou mean he didn\u2019t discuss this with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe invited me to this play. I assumed...I believed the two of us would be attending it together. He didn\u2019t say a word about you. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t agree to this arrangement.\u201d She started to edge her way out of the row just as the curtain rose.</p><p>To her dismay, Griff followed her into the aisle. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s been some misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet there has,\u201d Maryanne said, loudly enough to attract the angry glares of several patrons sitting in the aisle seats. She rushed toward the exit with Griff in hot pursuit.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll give me a moment to explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are Maryanne Simpson of the New York Simpsons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, walking directly outside. Moving to the curb, she raised her hand and shouted, \u201cTaxi!\u201d</p><p>Griff raced around to stand in front of her. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any need to rush off like this. Nolan was just doing me a good turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me a rotten one. Listen, Mr. Bradley, you look like a very nice gentleman, and under any other circumstances I would\u2019ve been more than happy to make your acquaintance, but there\u2019s been a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really am.\u201d A cab raced toward her and squealed to a halt.</p><p>Griff opened the back door for her, looking more charming and debonair than ever. \u201cI\u2019m not sure my heart will recover. You\u2019re very lovely, you know.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne sighed. The man was overdoing it, but he certainly didn\u2019t deserve the treatment she was giving him. She smiled and apologized again, then swiftly turned to the driver and recited her address.</p><p>Maryanne fumed during the entire ride back to her apartment. Rarely had she been more furious. If Nolan Adams thought he could play matchmaker with her, he was about to learn that everything he\u2019d ever heard about redheads was true.</p><p>\u201cHey, lady, you all right?\u201d the cabbie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cThat guy you were with back at the theatre didn\u2019t try anything, did he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, some other man did, only he\u2019s not going to get away with it.\u201d The driver pulled into her street. \u201cThat\u2019s the building there,\u201d Maryanne told him. She reached into her bag for her wallet and pulled out some of her precious cash, including a generous tip. Then she ran into the apartment building, heedless of her clothes or her high-heeled shoes.</p><p>For the first time since moving in, Maryanne didn\u2019t pause to rest on the third-floor landing. Her anger carried her all the way to Nolan\u2019s apartment door. She could hear him typing inside, and the sound only heightened her temper. Dragging breath through her lungs, she slammed her fist against the door.</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute,\u201d she heard him grumble.</p><p>His shocked look as he threw open the door would have been comical in different circumstances. \u201cMaryanne, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a rotten underhanded thing to do, you deceiving, conniving, low-down...rat!\u201d</p><p>Nolan did an admirable job of composing himself. He buried his hands in his pockets and smiled nonchalantly. \u201cI take it you and Griff Bradley didn\u2019t hit it off?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Maryanne was so furious she couldn\u2019t find the words to express her outrage. She opened and closed her mouth twice before she collected herself enough to proceed.</p><p>\u201cI told you before that I don\u2019t want you interfering in my life, and I meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was doing you a favor,\u201d Nolan countered, clearly unmoved by her angry display. In fact, he yawned loudly, covering his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cGriff\u2019s a stockbroker friend of mine and one hell of a nice guy. If you\u2019d given him half a chance, you might have found that out yourself. I could see the two of you becoming good friends. Why don\u2019t you give it a try? You might hit it off, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I\u2019d consider hitting is you.\u201d To her horror, tears of rage flooded her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t ever try that again. Do you understand?\u201d Not waiting for his reply, she turned abruptly, stalked down the hall to her apartment and unlocked the door. She flung it shut with sufficient force to rattle the windows on three floors.</p><p>She paced back and forth several times, blew her nose once and decided she hadn\u2019t told him nearly enough. Throwing open her door, she rushed down the hall to Nolan\u2019s apartment again. She banged twice as hard as she had originally.</p><p>Nolan opened the door, wearing a martyr\u2019s expression. He cocked one eyebrow expressively. \u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd furthermore you\u2019re the biggest coward I\u2019ve ever met. If I still worked for the newspaper, I\u2019d write a column so all of Seattle would know exactly what kind of man you are.\u201d Her voice wobbled just a little, but that didn\u2019t diminish the strength of her indignation.</p><p>She stomped back to her own apartment and she hadn\u2019t been there two seconds before there was a pounding on her door. It didn\u2019t surprise her to find Nolan Adams on the other side. He might have appeared calm, but his eyes sparked with an angry fire. They narrowed slightly as he glowered at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. You\u2019re nothing but a coward. Coward, coward, coward!\u201d With that she slammed her door so hard that a framed family photo hanging on the wall crashed to the floor. Luckily the glass didn\u2019t break.</p><p>Her chest heaving, Maryanne picked up the photo, wiped it off and carefully replaced it. But for all her outward composure, her hands were trembling. No sooner had she completed the task than Nolan beat on her door a second time.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she demanded, whipping open the door. \u201cI would have thought you got my message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it all right. I just don\u2019t happen to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough.\u201d She would have slammed the door again, but before she could act, a loud banging came from the direction of the floor. Not knowing what it was, Maryanne instinctively jumped back.</p><p>Nolan drew a deep breath, and Maryanne could tell he was making an effort to compose himself. \u201cAll right, Mrs. McBride,\u201d Nolan shouted at the floor, \u201cwe\u2019ll hold it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Mrs. McBride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lady who lives in the apartment below you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Maryanne had been too infuriated to realize she was shouting so loudly half the apartment building could hear. She felt ashamed at her loss of control and guilty for disturbing her neighbors\u2014but she was still furious with Nolan.</p><p>The man in question glared at her. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible to discuss this situation without involving any more doors?\u201d he asked sharply. \u201cOr would you rather wait until someone phones the police and we\u2019re both arrested for disturbing the peace?\u201d</p><p>She glared back at him defiantly. \u201cVery funny,\u201d she said, turning around and walking into her apartment. As she knew he would, Nolan followed her inside.</p><p>Maryanne moved into the kitchen. Preparing a pot of coffee gave her a few extra minutes to gather her dignity, which had been as abused as her apartment door. Mixed with the anger was a chilling pain that cut straight through her heart. Nolan\u2019s thinking so little of her that he could casually pass her on to another man was mortifying enough. But knowing he considered it a favor only heaped on the humiliation.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, please listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it ever occur to you that arranging this date with Griff might offend me?\u201d she cried.</p><p>Nolan seemed reluctant to answer. \u201cYes,\u201d he finally said, \u201cit did. I tried to catch you earlier this afternoon, but you weren\u2019t in. This wasn\u2019t the kind of situation I felt comfortable explaining in a note, so I took the easy way out and left Griff to introduce himself. I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d take it so personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else was I supposed to take it?\u201d</p><p>Nolan glanced away uncomfortably. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I was hoping you\u2019d meet him and the two of you would spend the evening getting to know each other. Griff comes from a well-established family and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s supposed to impress me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the type of man your father would arrange for you to meet,\u201d Nolan said, his voice sandpaper-gruff.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you I don\u2019t need a second father?\u201d His mention of her family reminded her of the way she was deceiving them, which brought a powerful sense of remorse.</p><p>He muttered tersely under his breath, then shook his head. \u201cObviously I blew it. Would it help if I apologized?\u201d</p><p>An apology, even a sincere one, wouldn\u2019t dissolve the hurt. She looked up, about to tell him exactly that, when her eyes locked with his.</p><p>He stood a safe distance from her, his expression so tender that her battered heart rolled defencelessly to her feet. She knew she ought to throw him out of her home and refuse to ever speak to him again. No one would blame her. She tried to rally her anger, but something she couldn\u2019t explain or understand stopped her.</p><p>All the emotion must have sharpened her perceptions. Never had she been more aware of Nolan as a man. The space separating them seemed to close, drawing them toward each other. She could smell the clean scent of the soap he used and hear the music of the rain as it danced against her window. She hadn\u2019t even realized, until this moment, that it was raining.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Maryanne nodded and wiped the moisture from her eyes. She wasn\u2019t a woman who cried easily, and the tears were a surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat you said about my being a coward is true,\u201d Nolan admitted. He sighed heavily. \u201cYou frighten me, Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean my temper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I deserved that.\u201d He grinned that lazy insolent grin of his.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about me you find so unappealing?\u201d She had to know what was driving him away, no matter how much the truth damaged her pride.</p><p>\u201cUnappealing?\u201d His abrupt laugh was filled with irony. \u201cI wish I could find something, anything, unappealing about you, but I can\u2019t.\u201d Dropping his gaze, he stepped back and cleared his throat. When he spoke again, his words were brusque, impatient. \u201cI was a lot more comfortable with you before we met.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou thought of me as a debutante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed you were a pampered immature...girl. Not a woman. I expected to find you ambitious and selfish, so eager to impress your father with what you could do that it didn\u2019t matter how many people you stepped on. Then we did the Celebrity Debate, and I discovered that none of the things I wanted to believe about you were true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to understand,\u201d Nolan added forcefully, \u201cis that I don\u2019t want to become involved with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat message has come through loud and clear.\u201d She moistened her lips and cast her gaze toward the floor, afraid he\u2019d see how vulnerable he made her feel.</p><p>Suddenly he was standing directly in front of her, so close his breath warmed her face. With one gentle finger, he lifted her chin, raising her eyes to his.</p><p>\u201cAll evening I was telling myself how noble I was,\u201d he said. \u201cGriff Bradley is far better suited to you than I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying that!\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her against him. \u201cThere can\u2019t ever be any kind of relationship between us,\u201d he said, his voice rough. \u201cI learned my lesson years ago, and I\u2019m not going to repeat that mistake.\u201d But contrary to everything he was saying, his mouth lowered to hers until their lips touched. The kiss was slow and familiar. Their bottom lips clung as Nolan eased away from her.</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t supposed to happen,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone if you won\u2019t,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cJust remember what I said,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cI don\u2019t do well with rich girls. I already found that out. The hard way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember,\u201d she said softly, looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d And then he kissed her again.</p><p>It was three days before Maryanne saw Nolan. She didn\u2019t need anyone to tell her he was avoiding her. Maybe he thought falling in love would wreak havoc with his comfortable well-ordered life. If he\u2019d given her a chance, Maryanne would\u2019ve told him she didn\u2019t expect him to fill her days. She had her new job, and she was fixing up her apartment. Most importantly, she had her writing, which kept her busy the rest of the time. She\u2019d recently queried a magazine about doing a humorous article on her experiences working for Rent-A-Maid.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s Nolan now,\u201d Barbara whispered as she hurried past Maryanne, balancing three plates.</p><p>Automatically Maryanne reached for a water glass and a menu and followed Nolan to the booth. He was halfway into his seat when he saw her. He froze and his narrowed gaze flew across the room to the middle-aged waitress.</p><p>Barbara didn\u2019t appear in the least intimidated. \u201cHey, what did you expect?\u201d she called out. \u201cWe were one girl short, and when Maryanne applied for the job she gave you as a reference. Besides, she\u2019s a good worker.\u201d</p><p>Nolan didn\u2019t bother to look at the menu. Standing beside the table, Maryanne took her green order pad out of her apron pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the chili,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cWith or without cheese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout,\u201d he bellowed, then quickly lowered his voice. \u201cHow long have you been working here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Monday morning. Don\u2019t look so angry. You were the one who told me about the job. Remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you working here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s a respectable establishment. Honestly, Nolan, what did you expect me to do? I had to find another job, and fast. I can\u2019t expect to sell any articles for at least a month, if then. I\u2019ve got to have some way of paying the bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve done a hell of a lot better than Mom\u2019s Place if you wanted to be a waitress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to argue? Again?\u201d she asked with an impatient sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered, grabbing his napkin just in time to catch a violent sneeze.</p><p>Now that she had a chance to study him, she saw his nose was red and his eyes rheumy. In fact he looked downright miserable. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this brilliant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try to be. And I\u2019ll try to ignore your rudeness. Would you like a glass of orange juice or a couple of aspirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Florence Nightingale, all I want is my usual bowl of chili, without the cheese. Have you got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said, writing it down. Nolan certainly seemed to be in a rotten mood, but that was nothing new. Maryanne seemed to bring out the worst in him.</p><p>Barbara met her at the counter. \u201cFrom the looks your boyfriend\u2019s been sending me, he\u2019d gladly cut off my head. What\u2019s with him, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s feeling well,\u201d Maryanne answered in a low worried voice.</p><p>\u201cMen, especially sick ones, are the biggest babies on earth,\u201d Barbara said wryly. \u201cThey get a little virus and think someone should rush in to make a documentary about their life-threatening condition. My advice to you is let him wallow in his misery all by himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he looks like he might have a fever,\u201d Maryanne whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd he isn\u2019t old enough to take an aspirin all on his own?\u201d The older woman glanced behind her. \u201cHis order\u2019s up. You want me to take it to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if he gets smart with me I\u2019ll just whack him upside the head. Someone needs to put that man in his place.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne picked up the large bowl of chili. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Barbara said, grinning broadly. \u201cI have a feeling you will.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne got home several hours later. Her feet hurt and her back ached, but she felt a pleasant glow of satisfaction. After three days of waitressing, she was beginning to get the knack of keeping orders straight and remembering everything she needed to do. It wasn\u2019t the job of her dreams, but she was making a living wage, certainly better money than she\u2019d been getting from Rent-A-Maid. Not only that, the tips were good. Maryanne didn\u2019t dare imagine what her family would say if they found out, though. She suffered a stab of remorse every time she thought about the way she was deceiving them. In fact, it was simpler not to think about it at all.</p><p>After his initial reaction, Nolan hadn\u2019t so much as mentioned her working at Mom\u2019s Place. He clearly wasn\u2019t thrilled, but that didn\u2019t surprise her. Little, if anything, she\u2019d done from the moment she\u2019d met him had gained his approval.</p><p>Maryanne had grown accustomed to falling asleep most nights to the sound of Nolan\u2019s typing. She found herself listening for it when she climbed into bed. But she didn\u2019t hear it that night or the two nights that followed.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Nolan?\u201d Barbara asked her on Friday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Maryanne hadn\u2019t seen him in days, but then, she rarely did.</p><p>\u201cHe must have got a really bad bug.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne hated the way her heart lurched. She\u2019d tried not to think about him. Not that she\u2019d been successful...</p><p>\u201cHis column hasn\u2019t been in the paper all week. The Sun\u2019s been running some of his old ones\u2014Nolan\u2019s Classics. Did you read the one last night?\u201d Barbara asked, laughing. \u201cIt was about how old-fashioned friendly service has disappeared from restaurants today.\u201d She grinned. \u201cHe said there were a few exceptions, and you know who he was talking about.\u201d</p><p>As a matter of fact, Maryanne had read the piece and been highly amused\u2014and flattered, even though the column had been written long before she\u2019d even come to Seattle, let alone worked at Mom\u2019s Place. As always she\u2019d been impressed with Nolan\u2019s dry wit. They often disagreed\u2014Nolan was too much of a pessimist to suit her\u2014but she couldn\u2019t help admiring his skill with words.</p><p>Since the afternoon he\u2019d found her at Mom\u2019s, Nolan hadn\u2019t eaten there again. Maryanne didn\u2019t consider that so strange. He went to great lengths to ensure that they didn\u2019t run into each other. She did feel mildly guilty that he\u2019d decided to stay away from his favorite diner, but it was his choice, after all.</p><p>During the rest of her shift, Maryanne had to struggle to keep Nolan out of her mind. His apartment had been unusually quiet for the past few days, but she hadn\u2019t been concerned about it. Now she was.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s all right?\u201d she asked Barbara some time later.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a big boy,\u201d the older woman was quick to remind her. \u201cHe can take care of himself.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne wasn\u2019t so sure. After work, she hurried home, convinced she\u2019d find Nolan hovering near death, too ill to call for help. She didn\u2019t even stop at her own apartment, but went directly to his.</p><p>She knocked politely, anticipating all kinds of disasters when there was no response.</p><p>\u201cNolan?\u201d She pounded on his door and yelled his name, battling down a rising sense of panic. She envisioned him lying on his bed, suffering\u2014or worse. \u201cNolan, please answer the door,\u201d she pleaded, wondering if there was someone in the building with a passkey.</p><p>She\u2019d waited hours, it seemed, before he yanked open the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she demanded, so relieved to see him she could hardly keep from hurling herself into his arms. Relieved, that was, until she got a good look at him.</p><p>\u201cI was feeling just great,\u201d he told her gruffly, \u201cuntil I had to get out of bed to answer the stupid door. Which, incidentally, woke me up.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne pressed her fingers over her mouth to hide her hysterical laughter. If Nolan felt anywhere near as bad as he looked, then she should seriously consider phoning for an ambulance. He wore grey sweatpants and a faded plaid robe, one she would guess had been moth fodder for years. His choice of clothes was the least of her concerns, however. He resembled someone who\u2019d just surfaced from a four-day drunk. His eyes were red and his face ashen. He scowled at her and it was clear the moment he spoke that his disposition was as cheery as his appearance.</p><p>\u201cI take it there\u2019s a reason for this uninvited visit?\u201d he growled, then sneezed fiercely.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d Maryanne hedged, not knowing exactly what to do now. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019ve seen me. I\u2019m going to live, so you can leave in good conscience.\u201d He would have closed the door, but Maryanne stepped forward and boldly forced her way into his apartment.</p><p>In the weeks they\u2019d lived next door to each other, she\u2019d never seen his home. The muted earth colors, the rich leather furniture and polished wood floors appealed to her immediately. Despite her worry about his condition, she smiled; this room reminded her of Nolan, with papers and books littering every available space. His apartment seemed at least twice the size of hers. He\u2019d once mentioned that it was larger, but after becoming accustomed to her own small rooms, she found the spaciousness of his a pleasant shock.</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m in no mood for company,\u201d he informed her in a surly voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you been to a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace and quiet,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>\u201cYou could have bronchitis or pneumonia or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine. At least, I was until you arrived.\u201d He walked across the carpet\u2014a dark green-and-gold Persian, Maryanne noted automatically\u2014and slumped onto an overstuffed sofa piled with blankets and pillows. The television was on, its volume turned very low.</p><p>\u201cThen why haven\u2019t you been at work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I would\u2019ve chosen a tropical island over a sofa in my own apartment.\u201d She advanced purposefully into his kitchen and stopped short when she caught sight of the dirty dishes stacked a foot high in the stainless-steel sink. She was amazed he could cram so much into such a tight space.</p> <p>\u201cThis place is a mess!\u201d she declared, hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and call the health department if you\u2019re so concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably should.\u201d Instead, she walked straight to the sink, rolled up her sleeves and started stacking the dishes on the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d Nolan shouted from the living room.</p><p>\u201cCleaning up.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something she couldn\u2019t hear, which was probably for the best.</p> <p>\u201cGo lie down, Nolan,\u201d she instructed. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done here, I\u2019ll heat you some soup. You\u2019ve got to get your strength back in order to suffer properly.\u201d</p><p>At first he let that comment pass. Then, as if she was taxing him to the limit of his endurance, he called out, \u201cThe way you care is truly touching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d notice.\u201d For someone who\u2019d been outraged at the sight of her dishpan hands a week earlier, he seemed oddly unconcerned that she was washing his dirty dishes. Not that Maryanne minded. It made her feel good to be doing something for him.</p><p>She soon found herself humming as she rinsed the dishes and set them in his dishwasher.</p><p>Fifteen minutes passed without their exchanging a word. When Maryanne had finished, she looked in the living room and wasn\u2019t surprised to find him sound asleep on the sofa. A curious feeling tugged at her heart as she gazed down at him. He lay on his back with his left hand flung across his forehead. His features were relaxed, but there was nothing remotely angelic about him. Not about the way his thick dark lashes brushed the arch of his cheek\u2014or about the slow hoarse breaths that whispered through his half-open mouth.</p><p>Maryanne felt a strong urge to brush the hair from his forehead, to touch him, but she resisted. She was afraid he\u2019d wake up. And she was even more afraid she wouldn\u2019t want to stop touching him.</p><p>Moving about the living room, she turned off the television, picked up things here and there and straightened a few piles of magazines. She should leave now; she knew that. Nolan wouldn\u2019t welcome her staying. She eyed the door regretfully, looking for an excuse to linger. She closed her eyes and listened to the sound of Nolan\u2019s raspy breathing.</p><p>More by chance than design, Maryanne found herself standing next to his typewriter. Feeling brave, and more than a little foolish, she looked down at the stack of paper resting beside it. Glancing over her shoulder to make sure he was still asleep, Maryanne carefully turned over the top page and quickly read the last couple of paragraphs on Chapter Seventeen. The story wasn\u2019t finished, but she could tell he\u2019d stopped during a cliff-hanger scene.</p> <p>Nolan had been so secretive about his project that she dared not invade his privacy any more than she already had. She turned the single sheet back over, taking care to place it exactly as she\u2019d found it.</p><p>Once again, she reminded herself that she should go back to her own apartment, but she felt strangely reluctant to end these moments with Nolan. Even a sleeping Nolan who would certainly be cranky when he woke up.</p><p>Seeking some way to occupy herself, she moved down the hall and into the bathroom, picking up several soiled towels on the way. His bed was unmade. She would\u2019ve been surprised to find it in any other condition. The sheets and blankets were sagging onto the floor, and two or three sets of clothing were scattered all about.</p><p>Without questioning the wisdom of her actions, she bundled up the dirty laundry to take to the coin-operated machine in the basement. She loaded it into a large garbage bag, then set about vigorously cleaning the apartment. Scrubbing, scouring and sweeping were skills she\u2019d perfected in her Rent-A-Maid days. If nothing else, she\u2019d had lots of practice cleaning up after messy bachelors.</p><p>Studying the contents of his refrigerator, more than an hour later, proved to be a humorous adventure. She found an unopened bottle of wine, a carton of broken egg shells and one limp strand of celery. Concocting anything edible from that would be impossible, so she searched the apartment until she found his keys. Then, with his garbage bag full of laundry in her arms, she let herself out the door, closing it softly.</p><p>She returned a half-hour later, clutching two bags of groceries bought with her tip money. Then she went down to put his laundry in the dryer. To her relief, Nolan was still asleep. She smiled down at him indulgently before she began preparing his dinner. After another forty-five minutes she retrieved his clean clothes and put them neatly away.</p><p>She was in the kitchen peeling potatoes when she heard Nolan get up. She continued her task, knowing he\u2019d discover she was there soon enough. He stopped cold when he did.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking your dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d he snapped with no evidence of appreciation for her efforts.</p><p>His eyes widened as he glanced around. \u201cWhat happened here? Oh, you\u2019ve cleaned the place up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d notice,\u201d she answered sweetly, popping a small piece of raw potato in her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll get soup to the boiling stage before I leave you to your...peace of mind. It should only take another ten or fifteen minutes. Can you endure me that much longer?\u201d</p><p>He made another of his typical grumbling replies before disappearing. No more than two seconds had passed before he let out a bellow loud enough to shake the roof tiles.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to my bed?\u201d he demanded as he stormed into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else have you been up to? Damn it, a man isn\u2019t safe in his own home with you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so put out, Nolan. All I did was straighten up the place a bit. It was a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to like messes. I thrive in messes. The last thing I want or need is some neat-freak invading my home, organizing my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t exaggerate,\u201d Maryanne said serenely, as she added a pile of diced carrots to the simmering broth. \u201cAll I did was pick up a few things here and there and run a load of laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did my laundry, too?\u201d he exploded, jerking both hands through his hair. Heaven only knew, she thought, what would happen if he learned she\u2019d read a single word of his precious manuscript.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s been folded and put away, so you needn\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Nolan abruptly left the kitchen, only to return a couple of moments later. He circled the table slowly and precisely, then took several deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cListen, Annie,\u201d he began carefully, \u201cit isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t appreciate what you\u2019ve done, but I don\u2019t need a nurse. Or a housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, meeting his eyes, her own large and guileless. \u201cI quite agree,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Some of the stiffness left his shoulders. \u201cThen you aren\u2019t going to take offence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d he answered, eyeing her suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking that what you really need,\u201d she said, smiling at him gently, \u201cis a wife.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cA wife,\u201d Nolan echoed. His dark eyes widened in undisguised horror. It was as if Maryanne had suggested he climb to the roof of the apartment building and leap off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get so excited. I wasn\u2019t volunteering for the position.\u201d</p><p>With his index finger pointing at her like the barrel of a shotgun, Nolan walked around the kitchen table again, his journey made in shuffling impatient steps. He circled the table twice before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou cleaned my home, washed my clothes and now you\u2019re cooking my dinner.\u201d Each word came at her like an accusation.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly look at me with those baby-blues of yours and expect me to believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re not applying for the job. From the moment we met, you\u2019ve been doing all these...these sweet girlie things to entice me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet girlie things?\u201d Maryanne repeated, struggling to contain her amusement. \u201cI don\u2019t think I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the foggiest idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he accused her with an angry shrug.</p><p>\u201cObviously I don\u2019t. What could I possibly have done to make you think I\u2019m trying to entice you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet girlie things,\u201d he said again, but without the same conviction. He chewed on his bottom lip for a moment while he mulled the matter over. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll give you an example\u2014that perfume you\u2019re always wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWindchime? It\u2019s a light fragrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the name of it. But it hangs around for an hour or so after you\u2019ve left the room. You know that, and yet you wear it every time we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worn Windchime for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all,\u201d he continued quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I catch you looking at me sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking at you?\u201d She folded her arms at her waist and rolled her eyes toward the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, sounding even more peevish. He pressed his hand to his hip, cocked his chin at a regal angle and fluttered his eyelashes like fans.</p><p>Despite her effort to hold in her amusement, Maryanne laughed. \u201cI can only assume that you\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>Nolan dropped his hand from his hip. \u201cI\u2019m not. You get this innocent look and your lips pout just so...Why, a man\u2014any man\u2014couldn\u2019t keep from wanting to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s preposterous.\u201d But Maryanne instinctively pinched her lips together and closed her eyes.</p><p>Nolan\u2019s arm shot out. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you get this helpless flustered look and it\u2019s all a simpleminded male can do not to rush in and offer to take care of whatever\u2019s bothering you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy this time you should know I\u2019m perfectly capable of taking care of myself,\u201d Maryanne felt obliged to remind him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lamb among wolves,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long you intend to play out this silly charade, but personally I think you\u2019ve overdone it. This isn\u2019t your world, and the sooner you go back where you belong, the better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBetter for whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe!\u201d he cried vehemently. \u201cAnd for you,\u201d he added with less fervor, as though it was an afterthought. He coughed a couple of times and reached for a package of cough drops in the pocket of his plaid robe. Shaking one out, he popped it in his mouth with barely a pause.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s doing you any good to get so excited,\u201d Maryanne said with unruffled patience. \u201cI was merely making an observation and it still stands. I believe you need a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo observe someone else\u2019s life,\u201d he suggested, sucking madly on the cough drop.</p> <p>\u201cAha!\u201d she cried, waving her index finger at him. \u201cHow does it feel to have someone interfering in your life?\u201d</p><p>Nolan frowned and Maryanne turned back to the stove. She lifted the lid from the soup to stir it briskly. Then she lowered the burner. When she was through, she saw with a glimmer of fun that Nolan was standing as far away from her as humanly possible, while still remaining in the same room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something else!\u201d he cried. \u201cYou give the impression that you\u2019re in total agreement with whatever I\u2019m saying and then you go about doing exactly as you damn well please. I\u2019ve never met a more frustrating woman in my entire life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Maryanne argued. \u201cI quit my job at Rent-A-Maid because you insisted.\u201d It had worked out for the best, since she had more time for her writing now, but this wasn\u2019t the moment to mention that.</p><p>\u201cOh, right, bring that up. It\u2019s the only thing you\u2019ve ever done that I wanted. I practically had to get down on my knees and beg you to leave that crazy job before you injured yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, it was a humbling experience and not one I intend to repeat. I\u2019ve known you how long? A month?\u201d He paused to gaze at the ceiling. \u201cIt seems like an eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to make me feel guilty. It isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should you feel anything of the sort? Just because living next door to you is enough to drive a man to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who found me this place. If you don\u2019t like living next door to me, then I\u2019m not the one to blame!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>The comment about Nolan finding himself a wife had been made in jest, but he\u2019d certainly taken it seriously. In fact, he seemed to have strong feelings about the entire issue. Realizing her welcome had worn extremely thin, Maryanne headed for his apartment door. \u201cEverything\u2019s under control here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>She hated the enthusiastic lift in his voice, as if he couldn\u2019t wait to be rid of her. Although he wasn\u2019t admitting it, she\u2019d done him a good turn. Fair exchange, she supposed; Nolan had been generous enough to her over the past month.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to disguise his delight.</p><p>\u201cBut I still think you\u2019d do well to consider what I said.\u201d Maryanne had the irresistible urge to heap coals on the fires of his indignation. \u201cA wife could be a great help to you.\u201d</p><p>Nolan frowned heavily, drawing his eyebrows into a deep V. \u201cI think the modern woman would find your suggestion downright insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That you marry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly. Haven\u2019t you heard? A woman\u2019s place isn\u2019t in the home anymore. It\u2019s out there in the world, forging a career for herself. Living a fuller life, and all that. It\u2019s not doing the mundane tasks you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t suggesting you marry for the convenience of gaining a live-in housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>His brown eyes narrowed. \u201cThen what were you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re a capable talented man,\u201d she explained. She glanced surreptitiously at his manuscript, still tidily stacked by the typewriter. \u201cBut unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t mean a whole lot if you don\u2019t have someone close\u2014a friend, a companion, a...wife\u2014to share it with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about me, Little Miss Muffet. I\u2019ve lived my own life from the time I was thirteen. You may think I need someone, but let me assure you, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d she said reluctantly. She opened his door, then hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019ll call if you want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She released a short sigh of frustration. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. The soup should be done in about thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then, looking a bit chagrined, added, \u201cI suppose I should thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you should, too, but it isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the money you spent on groceries? You can\u2019t afford acts of charity, you know. Wait a minute and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI can spend my money on whatever I damn well please. I\u2019m my own person, remember? You can just owe me. Buy me dinner sometime.\u201d She left before he could say anything else.</p><p>Maryanne\u2019s own apartment felt bleak and lonely after Nolan\u2019s. The first thing she did was walk around turning on all the lights. No sooner had she finished when there was a loud knock at her door. She opened it to find Nolan standing there in his disreputable moth-eaten robe, glaring.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she inquired sweetly.</p><p>\u201cYou read my manuscript, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he boomed in a voice that echoed like thunder off the apartment walls.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly did not,\u201d she denied vehemently. She straightened her back as if to suggest she found the very question insulting.</p><p>Without waiting for an invitation, Nolan stalked into her living room, then whirled around to face her. \u201cAdmit it!\u201d</p><p>Making each word as clear and distinct as possible, Maryanne said, \u201cI did not read your precious manuscript. How could I possibly have cleaned up, done the laundry, prepared a big kettle of homemade soup, and still had time to read Chapter Seventeen of manuscript?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know it was Chapter Seventeen?\u201d Sparks of reproach shot from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d she swallowed uncomfortably \u201c\u2014it was a guess, and from the looks of it, a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t any guess.\u201d</p><p>He marched toward her and for every step he took, she retreated two. \u201cAll right,\u201d she admitted guiltily, \u201cI did look at it, but I swear I didn\u2019t read more than a few lines. I was straightening up the living room and...it was there, so I turned over the last page and read a couple of paragraphs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha! Finally, the truth!\u201d Nolan pointed directly at her \u201cYou did read it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few lines,\u201d she repeated in a tiny voice, feeling completely wretched.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d His eyes softened.</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d He looked at her expectantly, then frowned. \u201cNever mind, I shouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing her palms together, Maryanne took one step forward. \u201cNolan, it was wonderful. Witty and terribly suspenseful and...I would have given anything to read more. But I knew I didn\u2019t dare because, well, because I was invading your privacy...which I didn\u2019t want to do, but I did and I really didn\u2019t want...that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked almost smugly, then his expression sobered as quickly as it had before.</p><p>She grinned, nodding enthusiastically. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>He seemed undecided, then launched excitedly into his idea. \u201cIt\u2019s about a Seattle newspaperman, Leo, who stumbles on a murder case. Actually, I\u2019m developing a series with him as the main character. This one\u2019s not quite finished yet\u2014as I\u2019m sure you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a woman in Leo\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne wasn\u2019t. The few paragraphs she\u2019d read had mentioned a Maddie who was apparently in danger. Leo had been frantic to save her.</p><p>\u201cYou had no business going anywhere near that manuscript,\u201d Nolan reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI know, but the temptation was so strong. I shouldn\u2019t have peeked, I realize that, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. Nolan, I\u2019m not lying when I say how good the writing was. Do you have a publisher in mind? Because if you don\u2019t, I have several New York editor friends I could recommend and I know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not using you or any influence you may have in New York. I don\u2019t want anything to do with your father\u2019s publishing company. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but you\u2019re overreacting.\u201d He seemed to be doing a lot of that lately. \u201cMy father wouldn\u2019t stay in business long if he ordered the editors to purchase my friends\u2019 manuscripts, would he? Believe me, it would all be on the up and up, and if you\u2019ve got an idea for a series using Leo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Annie. This is my book and I\u2019ll submit it myself without any help from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d she concurred meekly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be.\u201d The stern un-yielding look slipped back into place. \u201cNow if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll quietly go back to my messy little world, sans wife and countless interruptions from a certain neighbor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to bother you again,\u201d Maryanne said sarcastically, since he was the one who\u2019d invaded her home this time.</p><p>\u201cIt would be appreciated,\u201d he said, apparently ignoring her tone.</p><p>\u201cYour apartment is yours and mine is mine, and I\u2019ll uphold your privacy with the utmost respect,\u201d she continued, her voice still faintly mocking. She buried her hands in her pockets and her fingers closed around something cold and metallic.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Nolan was nodding. \u201cPrivacy, that\u2019s what we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Nolan...\u201d She paused. \u201cThis is somewhat embarrassing, but it seems I have...\u201d She hesitated again, then resolutely squared her shoulders. \u201cI suppose you\u2019d appreciate it if I returned your keys, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy keys?\u201d Nolan exploded.</p><p>\u201cI just found them. They were in my pocket. You see, all you had in your refrigerator was one limp strand of celery and I couldn\u2019t very well make soup out of that, so I had to go to the store and I didn\u2019t want to leave your door unlocked and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He held out his palm, casting his eyes toward the ceiling. Feeling like a pickpocket caught in the act, Maryanne dropped the keys into his hand and stepped quickly back, almost afraid he was going to grab her by the shoulders and shake her. Which, of course, was ludicrous.</p><p>Nolan left immediately and Maryanne followed him to the door, staring out into the hallway as he walked back to his own apartment.</p><p>The next Thursday, Maryanne was hurrying to get ready for work when the phone rang. She frowned and stared at it, wondering if she dared take the time to answer. It might be Nolan, but every instinct she possessed told her otherwise. They hadn\u2019t spoken all week. Every afternoon, like clockwork, he\u2019d arrived at Mom\u2019s Diner. More often than not, he ordered chili. Maryanne waited on him most of the time, but she might have been a robot for all the attention he paid her. His complete lack of interest dented her pride; still, his attitude shouldn\u2019t have come as any surprise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said hesitantly, picking up the receiver.</p><p>\u201cMaryanne,\u201d her mother responded, her voice rising with pleasure. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I finally got hold of you. I\u2019ve been trying for the past three days.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne immediately felt swamped by guilt. \u201cYou didn\u2019t leave a message on my machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how I hate those things.\u201d</p> <p>Maryanne did know that. She also knew she should have phoned her parents herself, but she wasn\u2019t sure how long she could continue with this farce. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Your father\u2019s working too hard, but that\u2019s nothing new. The boys are busy with soccer and growing like weeds.\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice fell slightly. \u201cHow\u2019s the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour special assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d Maryanne had rarely been able to fool her mother, and she could only wonder how well she was succeeding now. \u201cIt\u2019s going...well. I\u2019m learning so much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll make a terrific investigative reporter, sweetie, and the secrecy behind this assignment makes it all the more intriguing. When are your father and I going to learn exactly what you\u2019ve been doing? I wish we\u2019d never promised not to check up on your progress at the paper. We\u2019re both so curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be finished with it soon.\u201d Maryanne glanced at her watch and was about to close the conversation when her mother asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Nolan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan?\u201d Maryanne\u2019s heart zoomed straight into her throat. She hadn\u2019t remembered mentioning him, and just hearing his name sent a feverish heat through her body.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed quite enthralled with him the last time we spoke, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetie, you were. You claimed he was very talented, and although you were tight-lipped about it I got the impression you were strongly attracted to this young man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNolan\u2019s a friend. But we argue more than anything.\u201d</p><p>Her mother chuckled. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could that possibly be good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re comfortable enough with each other to be yourselves, and that\u2019s a positive sign. Why, your father and I bickered like old fishwives when we first met. I swear there wasn\u2019t a single issue we could agree on.\u201d She sighed softly. \u201cThen one day we looked at each other, and I knew then and there I was going to love this man for the rest of my life. And I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it isn\u2019t like that with Nolan and me. I...I don\u2019t even think he likes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan doesn\u2019t like you?\u201d her mother repeated. \u201cWhy, sweetie, that would be impossible.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne started to laugh then, because her mother was so obviously biased, yet sounded completely objective and matter-of-fact. It felt good to laugh again, good to find something amusing. She hadn\u2019t realized how melancholy she\u2019d become since her last encounter with Nolan. He was still making such an effort to keep her at arm\u2019s length for fear...She didn\u2019t know exactly what he feared. Perhaps he was falling in love with her, but she\u2019d noticed precious little evidence pointing to that conclusion. If anything, Nolan considered her an irritant in his life.</p><p>Maryanne spoke to her mother for a few more minutes, then rushed out the door, hoping she wouldn\u2019t be late for her shift at Mom\u2019s Place. Some investigative reporter she was!</p> <p>At the diner, she slipped the apron around her waist and hurried out to help with the luncheon crowd. Waiting tables, she was learning quite a lot about character types. This could be helpful for a writer, she figured. Some of her customers were pretty eccentric. She observed them carefully, wondering if Nolan did the same thing. But she wasn\u2019t going to think about Nolan....</p><p>Halfway through her shift, she began to feel light-headed and sick to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d Barbara asked as she slipped past, carrying an order.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you ate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning. No,\u201d she corrected, \u201clast night. I didn\u2019t have much of an appetite this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Barbara set the hamburger and fries on the counter in front of her customer and walked back to Maryanne. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve got a good look at you, you do seem a bit peaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>Hands on her hips, Barbara continued to study Maryanne as if memorizing every feature. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She had the beginnings of a headache, but nothing she could really complain about. It probably hadn\u2019t been a good idea to skip breakfast and lunch, but she\u2019d make up for it when she took her dinner break.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I believe you,\u201d Barbara muttered, dragging out a well-used phone book. She flipped through the pages until she apparently found the number she wanted, then reached for the phone.</p><p>\u201cWho are you calling?\u201d</p><p>She held the receiver against her shoulder. \u201cNolan Adams, who else? Seems to me it\u2019s his turn to play nursemaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbara, no!\u201d She might not be feeling a hundred per cent, but she wasn\u2019t all that sick, either. And the last person she wanted running to her rescue was Nolan. He\u2019d only use it against her, as proof that she should go back to the cosy comfortable world of her parents. She\u2019d almost proved she could live entirely on her own, without relying on interest from her trust fund.</p><p>\u201cNolan\u2019s not at the office,\u201d Barbara said a moment later, replacing the receiver. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him when he comes in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t! Barbara, I swear to you I\u2019ll personally give your phone number to every trucker who comes into this place if you so much as say a single word to Nolan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d the other waitress said, raising her eyebrows, \u201cyou\u2019d be doing me a favor!\u201d</p><p>Grumbling, Maryanne returned to her customers.</p><p>By closing time, however, she was feeling slightly worse. Not exactly sick, but not exactly herself, either. Barbara was watching Maryanne closely, regularly feeling her cheeks and forehead and muttering about her temperature. If there was one thing to be grateful for, it was the fact that Nolan hadn\u2019t shown up. Barbara insisted Maryanne leave a few minutes early and shooed her out the door. Had she been feeling better, Maryanne would have argued.</p><p>By the time she arrived back at her apartment, she knew beyond a doubt that she was coming down with some kind of virus. Part of her would\u2019ve liked to blame Nolan, but she was the one who\u2019d let herself into his apartment. She was the one who\u2019d lingered there, straightening up the place and staying far longer than necessary.</p><p>After a long hot shower, she put on her flannel pyjamas and unfolded her bed, climbing quickly beneath the covers. She\u2019d turned the television on for company and prepared herself a mug of soup. As she took her first sip, she heard someone knock at her door.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she called out.</p><p>\u201cNolan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in bed,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen me in my robe. It\u2019s only fair I see you in yours,\u201d he yelled back.</p><p>Maryanne tossed aside her covers and sat up. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>A sharp pounding noise came from the floor, followed by an equally loud roar that proclaimed it time for \u201cJeopardy\u201d. Apparently Maryanne\u2019s shouting match with Nolan was disrupting Mrs. McBride\u2019s favorite television show.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Maryanne cupped her hands over her mouth and yelled at the hardwood floor.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to let me in, or do I have to get the passkey?\u201d Nolan demanded.</p><p>Groaning, Maryanne shuffled across the floor in her giant fuzzy slippers and turned the lock. \u201cYes?\u201d she asked with exaggerated patience.</p><p>For the longest moment, Nolan said nothing. He shoved his hands deep into the pockets of his beige raincoat. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne glared at him with all the indignation she could muster, which at the moment was considerable. \u201cDo you mean to say you practically pounded down my door to ask me that?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to answer, but walked into her apartment as though he had every right to do so. \u201cBarbara phoned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother! And what exactly did she say?\u201d She continued to hold open the door, hoping he\u2019d get the hint and leave.</p><p>\u201cThat you caught my bug.\u201d His voice was rough with ill-disguised worry.</p><p>\u201cWrong. I felt a bit under the weather earlier, but I\u2019m fine now.\u201d The last thing she wanted Nolan motivated by was guilt. He\u2019d succeeded in keeping his distance up to now; if he decided to see her, she wanted to be sure his visit wasn\u2019t prompted by an overactive sense of responsibility.</p><p>\u201cYou look...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>His gaze skimmed her, from slightly damp hair to large fuzzy feet. \u201cFine,\u201d he answered softly.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see I\u2019m really not sick, so you needn\u2019t concern yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her words were followed by a lengthy silence. Nolan turned as though to leave. Maryanne should have felt relieved to see him go, instead, she experienced the strangest sensation of loss. She longed to reach out a hand, ask him to stay, but she didn\u2019t have the courage.</p><p>She brushed the hair from her face and smiled, even though it was difficult to put on a carefree facade.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop by in the morning and see how you\u2019re doing,\u201d Nolan said, hovering by the threshold.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhen did you get so prickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get so caring?\u201d The words nearly caught in her throat and escaped on a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI do care about you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, the same way you\u2019d care about an annoying younger sister. Believe me, Nolan, your message came through loud and clear. I\u2019m not your type. Fine, I can accept that, because you\u2019re not my type, either.\u201d She didn\u2019t really think she had a type, but it sounded philosophical and went a long way toward salving her badly bruised ego. Nolan couldn\u2019t have made his views toward her any plainer had he rented a billboard. He\u2019d even said he\u2019d taken one look at her and immediately thought, \u201cHere comes trouble.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never been more attracted to a man in her life, and here she was, standing in front of him lying through her teeth rather than admit how she truly felt.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m not your type, either?\u201d he asked, almost in a whisper.</p><p>Maryanne\u2019s heartbeat quickened. He studied her as intently as she studied him. He gazed at her mouth, then slipped his hand behind her neck and slowly, so very slowly, lowered his lips to hers.</p><p>He paused, their mouths a scant inch apart. He seemed to be waiting for her to pull away, withdraw from him. Everything inside her told her to do exactly that. He was only trying to humiliate her, wasn\u2019t he? Trying to prove how powerful her attraction to him was, how easily he could bend her will to his own.</p><p>And she was letting him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart was beating so furiously her body seemed to rock with the sheer force of it. Every throb seemed to drive her directly into his arms, right where she longed to be. She placed her palms against his chest and sighed as his mouth met hers. The touch of his lips felt warm and soft. And right.</p><p>His hand cradled her neck while his lips continued to move over hers in the gentlest explorations, as though he feared she was too delicate to kiss the way he wanted.</p><p>Gradually his hands slipped to her shoulders. He drew a ragged breath, then put his head back as he stared up at the ceiling. He exhaled slowly, deliberately.</p><p>It took all the restraint Maryanne possessed not to ask him why he was stopping. She wanted these incredible sensations to continue. She longed to explore the feelings his kiss produced and the complex responses she experienced deep within her body. Her pulse hammered erratically as she tried to control her breathing.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, now we\u2019ve got that settled, I\u2019ll leave.\u201d He backed away from her.</p><p>\u201cGot what settled?\u201d she asked swiftly, then realized she was only making a bigger fool of herself. Naturally he was talking about the reason for this impromptu visit, which had been her health. Hadn\u2019t it? \u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you do,\u201d Nolan said enigmatically. He turned and walked away.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cWhose turn next?\u201d Maryanne asked. She and her two friends were sitting in the middle of her living room floor, having a \u201cpity party.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will,\u201d Carol Riverside volunteered eagerly. She ceremonially plucked a tissue from the box that rested in the centre of their small circle, next to the lit candle. Their second large bottle of cheap wine was nearly empty, and the three of them were feeling no pain.</p><p>\u201cFor years I\u2019ve wanted to write a newspaper column of my own,\u201d Carol said, squaring her shoulders and hauling in a huge breath. \u201cBut it\u2019s not what I thought it\u2019d be like. I ran out of ideas for things to write about after the first week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Maryanne sighed sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Barbara echoed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all,\u201d Carol said sadly. \u201cI never knew the world was so full of critics. No one seems to agree with me. I\u2014I didn\u2019t know Seattle had so many cantankerous readers. I try, but it\u2019s impossible to make everyone happy. What happens is that some of the people like me some of the time and all the rest hate everything I write.\u201d She glanced up. \u201cExcept the two of you, of course.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne nodded her head so hard she nearly toppled over. She spread her hands out at either side in an effort to maintain her balance. The wine made her yawn loudly.</p> <p>Apparently in real distress, Carol dabbed at her eyes. \u201cBeing a columnist is hard work and nothing like I\u2019d always dreamed.\u201d The edges of her mouth turned downward. \u201cI don\u2019t even like writing anymore,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a pity!\u201d Maryanne cried, ritually tossing her tissue into the centre of the circle. Barbara followed suit, and then they both patted Carol gently on the back.</p><p>Carol brightened once she\u2019d finished. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without the two of you. You and Betty are my very best friends in the whole world,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cBarbara,\u201d Maryanne corrected. \u201cYour very best friend\u2019s name is Barbara.\u201d</p><p>The three of them looked at each other and burst into gales of laughter. Maryanne hushed them by waving her hands. \u201cStop! We can\u2019t allow ourselves to become giddy. A pity party doesn\u2019t work if all we do is laugh. We\u2019ve got to remember this is sad and serious business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad and serious,\u201d Barbara agreed, sobering. She grabbed a fresh tissue and clutched it in her hand, waiting for the others to share their sorrows and give her a reason to cry.</p><p>\u201cWhose idea was the wine?\u201d Maryanne wanted to know, taking a quick sip.</p><p>Carol blushed. \u201cI thought it would be less fattening than the chocolate ice-cream bars you planned to serve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d Barbara said, narrowing her eyes at Maryanne. \u201cYou haven\u2019t said anything about your problem.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne suddenly found it necessary to remove lint from her jeans. Sharing what disturbed her most was a little more complicated than being disappointed in her job or complaining about fingernails that cracked all too easily, as Barbara had done. She hadn\u2019t sold a single article since she\u2019d quit the paper, or even received a positive response to one of her queries. But worst of all she was falling in love with Nolan. He felt something for her, too\u2014she knew that\u2014but he was fighting her every step of the way. Fighting her and fighting himself.</p><p>He was attracted to her, he couldn\u2019t deny it, although he\u2019d tried to, more than once. When they were alone together, the tension seemed to throb between them.</p><p>He was battling the attraction so hard he\u2019d gone as far as arranging a date for her with another man. Since the evening they\u2019d met, Nolan had insulted her, harangued her and lectured her. He\u2019d made it plain that he didn\u2019t want her around. And yet there were times he sought out her company. He argued with her at every opportunity, took it upon himself to be her guardian, and yet...</p><p>\u201cMaryanne?\u201d Carol said, studying her with concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan Adams,\u201d she whispered. Lifting her wineglass, she took a small swallow, hoping that would give her the courage to continue.</p><p>\u201cI should have guessed,\u201d Carol muttered, frowning. \u201cFrom the moment you moved in here, next door to that madman, I just knew he\u2019d cause you nothing but problems.\u201d</p><p>Her friend\u2019s opinion of Nolan had never been high and Maryanne had to bite back the urge to defend him.</p><p>\u201cTell us everything,\u201d Barbara said, drawing up her knees and leaning against the sofa.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who got you into this craziness in the first place, remember?\u201d Carol pointed out righteously\u2014as if Maryanne needed reminding. Carol then turned to Barbara and began to explain to the older woman how it had all started. \u201cNolan wrote a derogatory piece about Maryanne in his column a while back, implying she was a spoiled debutante, and she took it to heart and decided to prove him wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean it. In fact, he\u2019s regretted every word of that article.\u201d This time Maryanne did feel obliged to defend him. As far as she was concerned, all of that was old business, already resolved. It was the unfinished business, the things happening between them now, that bothered her the most.</p><p>The denial. The refusal on both their parts to accept the feelings they shared. Only a few days earlier, Maryanne had tried to convince Nolan he wasn\u2019t her type, that nothing about them was compatible. He\u2019d been only too eager to agree.</p><p>But they\u2019d been drawn together, virtually against their wills, by an attraction so overwhelming, so inevitable, they were powerless against it. Their sensual and emotional awareness of each other seemed more intense every time they met. This feeling couldn\u2019t be anything except love.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re among friends, so tell us everything,\u201d Barbara pressed, handing Maryanne the entire box of tissues. \u201cRemember, I\u2019ve known Nolan for years, so nothing you say is going to shock me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, he\u2019s impossible,\u201d Maryanne whispered, finding it difficult to express her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHe deserves to be hanged from the closest tree,\u201d Carol said scornfully.</p><p>\u201cAnd at the same time he\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Maryanne concluded, ignoring Carol\u2019s comment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not...\u201d Carol paused, her face tightening as if she was having trouble forming the words. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to suggest you\u2019re falling in\u2014\u201d she swallowed \u201c\u2014love with him, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Maryanne crumpled the soggy tissue. \u201cBut I think I might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Carol cried, covering her mouth with both hands, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to do something quick. A man like Nolan Adams eats little girls like you for breakfast. He\u2019s cynical and sarcastic and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalented and generous,\u201d Maryanne finished for her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking clearly. It probably has something to do with that fever you had. You\u2019ve got to remember the facts. Nolan insulted you in print, seriously insulted you, and then tried to make up for it. You\u2019re mistaking that small attack of conscience for something more\u2014which could be dangerous.\u201d Awkwardly, Carol rose to her feet and started pacing.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably one of the most talented writers I\u2019ve ever read,\u201d Maryanne continued, undaunted by her friend\u2019s concerns. \u201cEvery time I read his work, I can\u2019t help being awed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Carol said, \u201cI\u2019ll concede he does possess a certain amount of creative talent, but that doesn\u2019t change who or what he is. Nolan Adams is a bad-tempered egotistical self-centred...grouch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to say this,\u201d Barbara said softly, shaking her head, \u201cbut Carol\u2019s right. Nolan\u2019s been eating at Mom\u2019s Place for as long as I\u2019ve worked there, and that\u2019s three years. I feel I know him better than you do, and he\u2019s everything Carol says. But,\u201d she said thoughtfully, \u201cunderneath it all, there\u2019s more to him. Oh, he\u2019d like everyone to believe he\u2019s this macho guy. He plays that role to the hilt, but after you\u2019ve been around him awhile, you can tell it\u2019s all a game to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you he\u2019s wonderful!\u201d Maryanne exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s a constant,\u201d Carol insisted. \u201cConstantly in a bad mood, constantly making trouble, constantly getting involved in matters that are none of his business. Maryanne here is the perfect example. He should never have written that column about her.\u201d Carol plopped back down and jerked half a dozen tissues from the box in quick succession. She handed them to Maryanne. \u201cYou\u2019ve got blinders on where he\u2019s concerned. Take it from me, a woman can\u2019t allow herself to become emotionally involved with a man she plans to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to change Nolan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d Carol echoed, her voice low and disbelieving. \u201cYou mean to say you like him as he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t know him the way I do,\u201d Maryanne said. \u201cNolan\u2019s truly generous. Did either of you know he\u2019s become sort of a father figure to the teenagers in this neighborhood? He\u2019s their friend in the very best sense. He keeps tabs on them and makes sure no one gets involved in drugs or is lured into gang activities. The kids around here idolize him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan Adams does that?\u201d Carol sounded skeptical. She arched her brows as though she couldn\u2019t completely trust Maryanne\u2019s observations.</p><p>\u201cWhen Barbara told him I was coming down with a virus, he came over to check on me and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well he should!\u201d Barbara declared. \u201cHe was the one who gave you that germ in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure I caught it from him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol and Barbara exchanged a look. Slowly each shook her head, and then all three shared a warm smile.</p><p>\u201cI think we might be too late,\u201d Barbara said theatrically, speaking from the side of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s showing all the signs,\u201d Carol agreed solemnly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I fear,\u201d Barbara responded in kind. \u201cShe\u2019s already in love with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood grief, no,\u201d Carol wailed, pressing her hands to her mouth. \u201cSay it isn\u2019t so. She\u2019s too young and vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity, such a pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but agree. Maryanne is much too sweet for Nolan Adams. I just hope he appreciates her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Carol muttered, reverting to her normal voice, \u201cbut then no man ever fully appreciates a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a pity men act the way they do.\u201d Barbara said in a sad voice.</p> <p>\u201cSome men,\u201d Maryanne added.</p><p>Carol and Barbara dabbed their eyes and solemnly tossed the used tissues into the growing heap in the middle of their circle.</p><p>The plan had been to gather all the used tissues and ceremonially dump them in the toilet, flush their \u201cpity pot\u201d, and then celebrate all the good things in their lives.</p><p>The idea for this little party had been an impromptu one of Maryanne\u2019s on a lonely Friday night. She\u2019d been feeling blue and friendless and decided to look for a little innocent fun. She\u2019d phoned Carol and learned she was a weekend widow; her husband had gone fishing with some cronies. Barbara had thought the idea was a good one herself, since she\u2019d just broken her longest fingernail and was in the mood for a shoulder to cry on.</p><p>A pity party seemed just the thing to help three lonely women make it through a bleak Friday night.</p><p>Maryanne awoke Saturday morning with a humdinger of a headache. Wine and the ice cream they\u2019d had at the end of the evening definitely didn\u2019t mix.</p> <p>If her head hadn\u2019t been throbbing so painfully, she might have recognized sooner that her apartment had no heat. Her cantankerous radiator was acting up again. It did that some mornings, but she\u2019d always managed to coax it back to life with a few well-placed whacks. The past few days had been unusually cold for early November\u2014well below freezing at night.</p><p>She reached for her robe and slippers, bundling herself up like a December baby out in her first snowstorm. Cupping her hands over her mouth, she blew until a frosty mist formed.</p><p>A quickly produced cup of coffee with two extra-strength aspirin took the edge off her headache. Maryanne shivered while she slipped into jeans, sweatshirt and a thick winter coat. She suspected she resembled someone preparing to join an Arctic expedition.</p><p>She fiddled with the radiator, twisting the knobs and slamming her hand against the side, but the only results were a couple of rattles and a hollow clanking.</p><p>Not knowing what else to try, she got out her heavy cast-iron skillet and banged it against the top of the rad in hopes of reviving the ageing pipes.</p><p>The noise was deafening, vibrating through the room like a jet aircraft crashing through the sound barrier. If that wasn\u2019t enough, Maryanne\u2019s entire body began to quiver, starting at her arm and spreading outward in a rippling effect that caused her arms and legs to tremble.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on over there?\u201d Nolan shouted from the other side of the wall. He didn\u2019t wait for her to answer and a couple of seconds later came barreling through her front door, wild-eyed and dishevelled.</p><p>\u201cWhat...Where?\u201d He was carrying a baseball bat, and stalked to the middle of her apartment, scanning the interior for what Maryanne could only assume were invaders.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any heat,\u201d she announced, tucking the thin scarf more tightly around her ears.</p><p>Nolan blinked. She\u2019d apparently woken him from a sound sleep. He was barefoot and dressed in pyjama bottoms, and although he wore a shirt, it was unbuttoned, revealing a broad muscular chest dusted with curly black hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you? Are you going to a costume party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, this is no party. I\u2019m simply trying to keep warm.\u201d</p><p>His gaze lowered to the heavy skillet in her hand. \u201cDo you plan to cook on that radiator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might if I could get it to work. In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, there isn\u2019t any heat in this place.\u201d</p><p>Nolan set the baseball bat aside and moved to the far wall to look at the radiator. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>How like a man to ask stupid questions! If Maryanne had known what was wrong with it, she wouldn\u2019t be standing there shivering, with a scarf swaddling her face like an old-time remedy for toothache.</p><p>\u201cHow in heaven\u2019s name am I supposed to know?\u201d she answered testily.</p><p>\u201cWhat went on here last night, anyway? A wake?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the mound of tissues and shrugged. He was scanning the area as if it were a crime scene and he should take caution not to stumble over a dead body.</p><p>Walking across the living room, he picked up the two empty wine bottles and held them aloft for her inspection, pretending to be shocked.</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d She put the skillet down and removed the bottles from his hands, to be deposited promptly in the garbage.</p><p>\u201cSo you had a party and I wasn\u2019t invited.\u201d He made it sound as though he\u2019d missed the social event of the year.</p><p>Maryanne sighed loudly. \u201cIf you must know, Carol, Barbara and I had a pity party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what? You\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to hide his mocking grin.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She should\u2019ve realized he\u2019d only poke fun at her. \u201cCan you figure out how to get this thing working before the next ice age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, give me a shot at it.\u201d He gently patted the top of the radiator as he knelt in front of it. \u201cOkay, ol\u2019 Betsy, we\u2019re trusting you to be good.\u201d He began fiddling with knobs, still murmuring ridiculous endearments\u2014like a cowboy talking to his horse.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t do any good to talk to an inanimate object,\u201d she advised primly, standing behind him.</p><p>\u201cYou want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered. Having Nolan in her home, dressed in his night clothes, did something odd to her, sent her pulse skittering erratically. She deliberately allowed her attention to wander to the scene outside her window. The still-green lawns of Volunteer Park showed in the distance and she pretended to be absorbed in their beauty.</p><p>\u201cI thought I told you to keep that door chain in place,\u201d he said casually as he worked. \u201cThis isn\u2019t The Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think you need to remind me of that now?\u201d She rubbed her hands together, hoping to generate some warmth before her fingers went numb.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, sounding satisfied. \u201cAll she needed was a little loving care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Maryanne said with relief.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, only the next time something like this happens don\u2019t try to fix it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTranslated, that means I shouldn\u2019t try to fix the radiator again while you\u2019re trying to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him, her eyes alive with appreciation. He really had been good to her from the day she\u2019d moved in\u2014before then, too. Discounting what he\u2019d written about her in his column, of course. And even that had ended up having a positive effect.</p><p>It\u2019d been a week since she\u2019d seen him. A long week. A lonely week. Until now, she\u2019d hardly been able to admit, even to herself, how much she\u2019d missed him. Standing there as he was, Maryanne was struck by just how attractive she found him. If only he\u2019d taken the time to button his shirt! She reveled in his lean strength and his aura of unquestionable authority\u2014and that chest of his was driving her to distraction.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the only one enthralled. Nolan was staring at her, too. The silence lingered between them, lengthening moment by moment as they gazed into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d he finally said, breaking eye contact by glancing past her, out the window.</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2014I understand,\u201d she stammered, stepping back. Her hands swung at her sides as she followed him to the door. \u201cI really do appreciate this.\u201d Already she could feel the warmth spilling into her apartment. And none too soon, either.</p><p>\u201cJust remember to keep the door locked.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and mockingly saluted him. \u201cAye, aye, sir.\u201d</p><p>He left then. Maryanne hated to see him go, hated to see him walk away from her, and yet it seemed he was always doing exactly that.</p><p>Later that same afternoon, after she\u2019d finished her errands, Maryanne was strolling through the park when a soft feminine voice spoke from behind her.</p><p>Maryanne turned around and waved when she discovered Gloria, the teenager she\u2019d met here earlier. But this time Gloria wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cThis is my little sister, Katie, the pest,\u201d Gloria explained. \u201cShe\u2019s three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Katie,\u201d Maryanne said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I a pest?\u201d Katie asked, gazing at Gloria, but apparently not offended that her older sister referred to her that way.</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d Looking annoyed, the teenager shrugged in the same vague manner Maryanne had so often seen in her younger brothers. \u201cKatie\u2019s three and every other word is \u2018why\u2019. Why this? Why that? It\u2019s enough to drive a person straight to the loony bin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have brothers, so I know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re several years younger than I am. So trust me, I understand what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your brothers want to go every place you did? And did your mother make you take them even if it was a terrible inconvenience?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne tried to disguise a smile. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie asked me to come and watch him play basketball this afternoon with Mr. Adams, and I had to drag Katie along because she wanted to come to the park, too. My mom pressured me into bringing her. I didn\u2019t even get a chance to say no.\u201d Gloria made it sound as if she were being forced to swim across Puget Sound with the three-year-old clinging to her back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a pest,\u201d Katie insisted now, flipping her braid over one shoulder in a show of defiance. Looking up at Maryanne, the little girl carefully manipulated her fingers and proudly exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree?\u201d Maryanne repeated, raising her eyebrows, feigning surprise. \u201cReally? I would\u2019ve thought you were four or five.\u201d</p><p>Katie grinned delightedly. \u201cI\u2019m nearly four, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Adams is already here,\u201d Gloria said, brightening. She frowned as she glanced down at her little sister and jerked the small arm in an effort to hurry her along. \u201cCome on, Katie, we have to go. Eddie wants me to watch him play ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Gloria groaned. \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go on,\u201d Maryanne said, offering Katie her hand. The youngster obediently slipped her small hand into Maryanne\u2019s much larger one, willingly abandoning her cranky older sister. \u201cKatie and I will follow behind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gloria looked surprised by the offer. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t mind? I mean, Katie\u2019s my responsibility and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to palm her off on you. You\u2019re not going to kidnap her or anything, are you? I mean, I know you\u2019re not\u2014you\u2019re Mr. Adams\u2019s friend. I wouldn\u2019t let her go with just anyone, you know. But if anything happened to her, my mother would kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to take the very best care of her.\u201d</p><p>Gloria grinned, looking sheepish for having suggested anything else. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind in the least. I don\u2019t think Katie does, either. Is that right, Katie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really sure? Okay, then...\u201d Once she\u2019d made a token protest Gloria raced off to join her friends.</p><p>Katie was content to skip and hop at Maryanne\u2019s side until they reached a huge pile of leaves under a chestnut tree, not far from the basketball court. Almost before Maryanne realized it, Katie raced toward the leaves, bunching as many as she could in her small arms and carrying them back to Maryanne as though presenting her with the rarest of jewels.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she cried happily. \u201cLeafs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaves,\u201d Maryanne corrected, bending over and grabbing an armful herself. She tossed them in the air and grinned as Katie leapt up to catch as many as she could and in the process dropped the armload she was holding.</p> <p>Laughing, Maryanne clasped the child by the waist and swung her around, while Katie shrieked with delight. Dizzy, Maryanne leaned against the tree in an effort to regain her equilibrium and her breath.</p><p>It was then that she saw Nolan had stopped playing and was standing in the middle of the basketball court, staring at her. The game was going on all around him, boys scattering in one direction and then another, racing to one end of the court and back again. Nolan seemed oblivious to them and to the game\u2014to everything but her.</p><p>A tall boy bumped into him from behind and Nolan stumbled. Maryanne gasped, fearing he might fall, but he caught himself in time. Without a pause, he rejoined the game, racing down the court at breakneck speed. He stole the ball and made a slam dunk, coming down hard on the pavement.</p><p>Gloria ran back toward Maryanne and Katie. \u201cI thought you said you and Mr. Adams were just friends?\u201d she teased. She was grinning in a way that suggested she wasn\u2019t about to be fooled again. \u201cHe nearly got creamed because he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off you.\u201d</p><p>With Katie on her lap, Maryanne sat beside the teenage girls watching the game. Together she and the three-year-old became Nolan\u2019s personal cheering squad, but whether or not he appreciated their efforts she didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t give a single indication that he heard them.</p><p>When the game was finished, Nolan walked breathlessly off the court. His grey sweatshirt was stained with perspiration, and his face was red and damp from the sheer physical exhaustion of keeping up with kids half his age.</p> <p>For an anxious moment, Maryanne assumed he was planning to ignore her and simply walk away. But after he\u2019d stopped at the water fountain, he came over to the bench where she and Katie were sitting.</p><p>He slumped down beside her, dishevelled and still breathing hard. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI happened to be in the park,\u201d she answered, feeling self-conscious now and unsure. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, Nolan. I didn\u2019t follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look nice in blue,\u201d he said hoarsely, then cleared his throat as if he hadn\u2019t meant to say that, as if he wanted to withdraw the words.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d The blue sweater was one of her favorites. She\u2019d worn her long wool coat and was surprised he\u2019d even noticed the periwinkle-blue sweater beneath.</p><p>\u201cHello, Katie.\u201d</p><p>Katie beamed, stretching out both arms for Nolan to lift her up, which he did. The little girl hugged him quickly, then leapt off the bench and ran to her sister, who stood talking to her boyfriend.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with children,\u201d Nolan said. His voice fell slightly, as though the fact surprised him.</p><p>\u201cI do have a knack with them. I always have.\u201d She\u2019d been much-sought as a baby-sitter by her parents\u2019 friends and for a time had considered becoming a teacher. If she\u2019d pursued that field of study she would have preferred to teach kindergarten. She found five-year-olds, with their eagerness to learn about the world, delightful. A couple of articles she\u2019d written the week before were geared toward children\u2019s magazines. If only she\u2019d hear something soon. It seemed to take so long.</p><p>\u201cHow many years of your life did you lose this time?\u201d Maryanne asked teasingly.</p><p>\u201cAnother two or three, at least.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her and it was that rare special smile he granted her only in those brief moments when his guard was lowered. His resistance to the attraction he felt to her was at its weakest point, and they both knew it.</p><p>Maryanne went still, almost afraid to move or speak for fear of ruining the moment. His eyes, so warm and gentle, continued to hold hers. When she tried to breathe, the air seemed to catch in her lungs.</p><p>\u201cMaryanne.\u201d Her name was little more than a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He raked his hand through his hair, then looked away. \u201cNothing. Never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she pressed, unwilling to let the matter drop.</p><p>The muscles along the side of his jaw clenched. \u201cI said it was nothing,\u201d he answered gruffly.</p><p>Maryanne gazed down at her hands, feeling an overwhelming sense of frustration and despair. The tension between them was so thick she could practically touch it, but nothing she could say or do would make any difference. If anything, her efforts would only make it worse.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nolan,\u201d Eddie called out, loping toward them. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you, man?\u201d He laughed, tossing his basketball from one hand to the other. \u201cYou nearly lost that game \u2019cause you couldn\u2019t take your eyes off your woman.\u201d</p><p>Nolan scowled at him. \u201cYou looking for a rematch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d Shaking his head, Nolan slowly pushed the sleeves of his sweatshirt past his elbows.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Eddie said with a knowing laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so, with your woman here and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryanne isn\u2019t my woman,\u201d Nolan informed him curtly, his frown darkening.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Eddie responded. \u201cHey, dude, this is me, Eddie. Can\u2019t fool me! You practically went comatose when you saw her. I don\u2019t blame you, though. She ain\u2019t bad. So when are you two getting married?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d Barbara announced at closing time Monday evening.</p><p>Maryanne was busy refilling the salt and pepper shakers and reloading the napkin holders. \u201cAbout what?\u201d she asked absently, stuffing napkins into the small chrome canisters.</p><p>\u201cYou and Nolan.\u201d</p><p>If Barbara hadn\u2019t had Maryanne\u2019s attention earlier, she did now. Nolan had left the restaurant about forty minutes earlier, after having his customary meal of chili and coffee. He\u2019d barely said two words to Maryanne the whole time he was there. He\u2019d buried his face in the evening edition of the Sun and done a brilliant job of pretending he didn\u2019t know her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about us?\u201d Maryanne\u2019s expression might have remained aloof, but her heart was pounding furiously.</p><p>\u201cSince the night of our pity party, I\u2019ve had a change of heart. You\u2019re exactly the right kind of woman for Nolan. The two of you...balance each other. At first I agreed with Carol. My opinion of Nolan isn\u2019t as negative as hers, but you have to remember that those two work for rival papers. At any rate, I was concerned. You are really sweet.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne winced at the \u201csweet.\u201d It rather sounded as though friendship with her was like falling into a jar of honey.</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what changed my mind. Partly it was watching Nolan when he was here. I got quite a kick out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Barbara\u2019s grin was broad as she continued to wipe the counter. \u201cI swear that man couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off you.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne was puzzled. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Nolan didn\u2019t look my way even once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019d scowl every time you were close, but behind that cross expression of his was an intensity I\u2019ve never seen in him before. It was like he had to come in and get his daily fix of you.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t decide whether to lift with happiness or sink with doubt. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Other than ordering his meal, he didn\u2019t speak to me at all. I might as well have been a robot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019d like you to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was reading the paper,\u201d Maryanne said. \u201cThe same way he reads it every time he comes here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrection,\u201d Barbara said, and her face broke into a spontaneous smile. \u201cHe pretended to be reading the paper, but when you weren\u2019t looking his eyes were following you like a hawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Barbara, really?\u201d It seemed almost more than she dared hope for. He\u2019d hardly spoken to her in the past few days, and he seemed to be avoiding her. The kids in the park had taken to teasing them about being \u201cin love\u201d and asking pointed questions, and Nolan had practically fallen all over himself denying that they were anything other than friends.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than just the way he was watching you,\u201d Barbara said, slipping on to a stool. \u201cHave you read his columns the past couple of weeks?\u201d</p><p>Naturally Maryanne had, more impressed by his work every time she did. The range of his talent and the power of his writing were unmistakable. Within a few years, if not sooner, she expected his newspaper column to be picked up for syndication.</p><p>\u201cLately, I\u2019ve noticed something unusual about his writing,\u201d Barbara said, still clutching the dishrag. \u201cThat cynical edge of his\u2014it isn\u2019t quite as sharp. His writing\u2019s less sarcastic now. I heard one of my customers comment earlier today that Nolan\u2019s going soft on us. I hadn\u2019t thought about it much until then, but Ernie\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s made the difference, but I figure it must be love. Oh, I doubt there\u2019s much in this life that\u2019s going to change Nolan Adams. He\u2019ll always be stubborn as a mule, headstrong and temperamental. That\u2019s just part of his nature. But mark my words, he\u2019s in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you said earlier, about us being so different...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, with you so nice and all, and Nolan such a grouch. At least he likes to pretend he\u2019s one. You and I know better, but most folks don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Maryanne probed.</p><p>\u201cAnd, well, it seems to me the two of you fit together perfectly. Like two pieces of a puzzle.\u201d</p><p>It seemed that way to Maryanne, too.</p><p>\u201cYou heard, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Barbara muttered, abruptly changing the subject.</p><p>Maryanne nodded. Mom\u2019s Place was going to close in a month for remodelling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Maryanne didn\u2019t know yet. \u201cFind a temporary job, I suppose. What about you?\u201d By then, she should have sold a few of the articles she\u2019d submitted. At least she hadn\u2019t been rejected yet. She should be hearing any time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that worried about taking a month or so off work,\u201d Barbara returned, her look thoughtful. \u201cI could use a vacation, especially over the holidays. I was thinking of staying home and baking Christmas gifts this year. My fudge is out of this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should start looking for another job now.\u201d Maryanne was already worried about meeting expenses. Mom\u2019s Place couldn\u2019t have chosen a worse time to close.</p> <p>A half hour later, she was waiting for the bus, her mind spinning with what Barbara had said. The diner\u2019s closing was a concern, but Barbara\u2019s comments about Nolan gladdened Maryanne\u2019s heart.</p><p>Nolan did feel something for her, something more powerful than he\u2019d let on.</p><p>She supposed she should confront him with it, force him to acknowledge his feelings. A brief smile crossed her lips as she envisioned what would happen if she actually did such a thing. She nearly laughed out loud at the thought.</p><p>Nolan would deny it, of course, loudly and vehemently, and she\u2019d have to counteract with a loud argument of her own. The smile appeared again. Her decision was made.</p><p>Feeling almost light-headed, Maryanne glanced down the street, eager for the bus to arrive so she could get home. The first thing she intended to do was march into Nolan\u2019s apartment and demand the truth. If he tried to ignore her, as he usually did, then she had the perfect solution.</p> <p>She\u2019d kiss him.</p><p>A kiss would silence his protests in the most effective way she could imagine. Maryanne almost melted at the memory of being kissed by Nolan, being held in his arms. It was like walking through the gates of an undiscovered paradise. Just remembering those moments made her feel faint with desire, weak with excitement. He seemed to experience the same emotions, Maryanne remembered hopefully.</p><p>Cheered by the thought, she nearly applauded when her bus arrived. The ride passed quickly and she hurried into the building, eager to see Nolan.</p><p>Consumed by her sense of purpose, she went directly to his apartment. She stood in front of his door, took several deep breaths, then knocked politely. No answer. She tried again, harder this time.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Nolan growled from the other side.</p><p>\u201cMaryanne. I want to talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>She was only a little discouraged by his unfriendliness. \u201cThis\u2019ll just take a minute.\u201d</p><p>The door was yanked opened with excessive force. Nolan stood before her, dressed in a black tuxedo and white cummerbund, looking so handsome that he caught her completely by surprise. Her mouth sagged open.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he asked crossly.</p><p>\u201cHello, Nolan,\u201d she said, aware that her mission had been thwarted. Nothing he could\u2019ve said or done would have affected her as profoundly as finding him dressed like this. Because it meant he was going out on a date.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said, tugging at the cuffs of his jacket, adjusting the fit. He frowned, apparently waiting for her to say something.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d She tried to gather her scattered composure, and finally managed to squeak, \u201cYou\u2019re going out?\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cI don\u2019t dress like this for a jaunt to the corner store.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted something?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been so confident, so sure she was doing the right thing. But now, seeing Nolan looking more dressed up and formal than he\u2019d ever looked for her, she found herself speechless.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help wondering where he was going\u2014and with whom. The \u201cwith whom\u201d part bothered her the most.</p><p>He glanced pointedly at his wristwatch. \u201cHow long is this going to take?\u201d he asked coolly. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to pick up Prudence in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrudence?\u201d His face, tight with impatience, drew her full attention. Prudence, her mind repeated. Who was this woman?</p><p>Then in a flash, Maryanne knew. It was all she could do not to laugh and inform him that his little plan just wasn\u2019t working. No imaginary date was going to make her jealous.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t seeing anyone named Prudence. Good grief, if he had to invent a name, the least he could\u2019ve done was come up with something a little more plausible than Prudence.</p><p>In fact, Maryanne remembered Nolan casually mentioning a week or so earlier that he\u2019d been asked to speak at a Chamber of Commerce banquet. There had also been a notice in the paper. Who did he think he was kidding?</p><p>Of course he wanted her to believe he was dating another woman. That was supposed to discourage her, she guessed. Except that it didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t important...\u201d she said, gesturing vaguely. \u201cThe radiators were giving me trouble this morning, but I\u2019ll manage. I was planning to go out tonight myself.\u201d</p><p>His eyes connected with hers. \u201cAnother pity party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d She considered announcing she had a hot date herself, but that would have been carrying this farce a little too far. \u201cBarbara and I will probably go to a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be.\u201d She smiled up at him, past the square cut of his jaw to his incredibly dark eyes. \u201cHave a good time with...Prudence,\u201d she said with a bright knowing smile.</p><p>Holding back a laugh, she returned to her own apartment. The rat. The low-down dirty rat! He was pretending to escort some imaginary woman to a fancy affair. Oh, he\u2019d like nothing better than for Maryanne to think he considered her a pest. But she knew that wasn\u2019t quite the case.</p><p>Where was the man who\u2019d rushed to her rescue when the pipes needed a little coaxing? Where was the man who\u2019d nearly been run over on a basketball court when he saw her standing on the sidelines? Where was the man who\u2019d tried to set her up with someone else he thought more suitable? Nolan Adams had just proved what she\u2019d suspected all along. He was a coward\u2014at least when it came to love.</p><p>Suddenly depressed, Maryanne slowly crossed the living room and sank on to her sofa, trying to gather her wits. Ten minutes later, she still sat there, mulling things over and feeling sorry for herself, when she heard Nolan\u2019s door open and close. She immediately perked up, wondering if he\u2019d had a change of heart. He seemed to pause for a moment outside her door, but any second thoughts he might be having didn\u2019t last long.</p><p>Barbara phoned soon after, full of apologies, to cancel their movie plans, so Maryanne spent the evening drowning her sorrows in television reruns and slices of cold pizza.</p><p>She must have fallen asleep because a harsh ringing jolted her awake a couple of hours later. She leapt off the sofa and stumbled dazedly around before she realized the sound came from the phone. She rushed across the room.</p><p>A greeting had barely left her lips when her father\u2019s booming voice assailed her.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Dad,\u201d she muttered, her heart sinking. How like him to get to the subject at hand without anything in the way of preliminaries. \u201cHow are you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know where you\u2019re living and I want to know right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d she asked, stalling for time. Obviously her father had discovered her small deception.</p><p>\u201cI talked to the managing editor of the Seattle Review this morning and he told me you haven\u2019t worked there in weeks. He said you\u2019d quit! Now I want to know what this craziness is you\u2019ve been feeding your mother and me about a special assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d By now, Maryanne was awake enough to know her father wasn\u2019t in any mood to listen to excuses.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to us, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly...\u201d She paused, searching for the right words. \u201cIt was more a case of omission, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had us worried sick. We\u2019ve been trying to get hold of you all afternoon. Where were you? And who the hell is Nolan Adams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan Adams?\u201d she echoed, playing dumb, which wasn\u2019t all that difficult at the moment.</p><p>\u201cYour mother mentioned his name, and when I called the paper, some woman named...Riverside, Carol Riverside, claimed this was his fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, listen, it\u2019s all rather complicated, so I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want excuses, I want facts. You decided to work on the other side of the country. Against my better judgment, I arranged it for you with the promise that I wouldn\u2019t intrude\u2014and look where it\u2019s gotten me! To have you deceive us by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, please, just settle down.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be making an effort to calm himself, but more than likely the effort was thanks to her mother. Maryanne could hear her arguing softly in the background.</p><p>\u201cCan I explain?\u201d she asked, waiting a minute for the tension to ease, although she wasn\u2019t sure what to say, what excuses she could possibly offer.</p><p>\u201cYou can try to explain, but I doubt it\u2019ll do any good,\u201d he answered gruffly.</p><p>Now that she had the floor, Maryanne floundered.</p><p>\u201cI take it this all revolves around that columnist friend of yours from the Sun?\u201d her father asked. \u201cThat Adams character?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Maryanne admitted reluctantly. But she didn\u2019t feel she could place the whole blame on him. \u201cLeaving the paper was my decision\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you living?\u201d</p><p>That was one of several questions Maryanne was hoping to avoid. \u201cI\u2014I rented an apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in an apartment before. It doesn\u2019t make the least bit of sense for you to move. The Seattle has a reputation for excellence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad, I know, but moving was necessary.\u201d She didn\u2019t go on to explain why. She didn\u2019t want to mislead her father more than she already had. But at the same time, if she told him she couldn\u2019t afford to continue living at The Seattle, he\u2019d certainly demand to know why.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain a damn thing,\u201d Samuel Simpson boomed.</p><p>Maryanne held the phone away from her ear and sighed heavily. She was groggy from her nap and discouraged by her relationship with Nolan. To complicate matters, she was truly in love for the first time in her life. Loving someone shouldn\u2019t be this difficult!</p><p>\u201cI insist you tell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d her father said, in the tone she remembered from childhood confrontations about missed curfews and other transgressions.</p><p>She tried again. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have three seconds, young lady, to tell me why you\u2019ve lied to your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize for that. I\u2019ve felt horrible about it, I really have, but I didn\u2019t want to say anything for fear you\u2019d worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019d worry! Now tell me exactly what it is we should be worrying about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, honestly, I\u2019m over twenty-one. I should be able to live and work where I please. You can\u2019t keep me your little girl forever.\u201d This conversation was not only reminiscent of several she\u2019d had with Nolan, it was one she should have had with her father years ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI demand to know why you quit the paper!\u201d</p><p>Maryanne refused to be intimidated. \u201cI already explained that.

Besides, I happen to like what I do, and I\u2019ve managed to live entirely on what I make, which is no small feat. I\u2019m happy, Dad, really happy.\u201d She tried to force some cheerful enthusiasm into her voice, but unfortunately she didn\u2019t entirely succeed. How she wished she could brag about selling her articles. Surely she\u2019d receive word soon!</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so pleased about this change in jobs, then why do you seem upset?\u201d her mother asked reasonably, joining the conversation from an extension.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m fine, really I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow, sweetie, that just doesn\u2019t ring true\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of this,\u201d her father interrupted impatiently. \u201cI made a mistake in arranging this Seattle assignment for you. It seems to me it\u2019d be best if you quit whatever you\u2019re doing and moved back to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I refuse to quit now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you to move back home. As far as I can see, you\u2019ve got one hell of a lot of explaining to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me,\u201d Maryanne said after a moment of strained silence, \u201cthat we should both take time to cool down and think this over before one of us says or does something we\u2019re all going to regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calm.\u201d The voice that roared over the long-distance wires threatened to impair Maryanne\u2019s hearing.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I love you and Mom dearly, but I think it would be best if we both slept on this. I\u2019m going to hang up now, not to be rude, but because I don\u2019t think this conversation is accomplishing anything. I\u2019ll call you first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryanne...Maryanne, don\u2019t you dare\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t allow him to finish, knowing it would do no good to argue with him when he was in this frame of mind. Her heart was heavy with regret as she replaced the receiver. Knowing her father would immediately call again, she unplugged the phone.</p> <p>Now that her family had discovered she wasn\u2019t working at the Review, everything would change. And not for the better. Her father would hound her until she was forced to tell him she\u2019d taken a job as a waitress. Once he discovered that, he\u2019d hit the roof.</p><p>Still thinking about what had happened, she put on her flannel pyjamas and pulled out her bed. With the demanding physical schedule she kept, sleeping had never been a problem. Tonight, she missed the clatter of Nolan\u2019s typing. She\u2019d grown accustomed to its comforting familiarity, in part because it was a sign of his presence. She often lay awake wondering how his mystery novel was developing. Some nights she even fantasized that he\u2019d let her read the manuscript, which to her represented the ultimate gesture of trust.</p><p>But Nolan wasn\u2019t at his typewriter this evening. He was giving a speech. Closing her eyes, she imagined him standing before the large dinner crowd. How she would have enjoyed being in the audience! She knew beyond a doubt that his eyes would have sought her out....</p><p>Instead she was spending the night alone. She lay with her eyes wide open; every time she started to drift off, some small noise would jerk her into wakefulness. She finally had to admit that she was waiting to hear the sounds of Nolan\u2019s return.</p><p>Some time in the early morning hours, Maryanne did eventually fall asleep. She woke at six to the familiar sound of Nolan pounding on his typewriter.</p><p>She threw on her robe, thrust her feet into the fuzzy slippers and began pacing, her mind whirling.</p><p>When she could stand it no longer, she banged on the wall separating their two apartments.</p><p>\u201cYour typing woke me up!\u201d Which, of course, wasn\u2019t fair or even particularly true. But she\u2019d spent a fretful night thinking about him, and that was excuse enough.</p> <p>Her family had found out she\u2019d quit her job and all hell was about to break loose. Time was running out for her and Nolan. If she was going to do something\u2014and it was clear she\u2019d have to be the one\u2014she\u2019d need to do it soon.</p><p>\u201cJust go back to bed,\u201d Nolan shouted.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life, Nolan Adams!\u201d Without questioning how wise it was to confront him now, Maryanne stormed out of her apartment dressed as she was, and beat hard on his door.</p><p>Nolan opened it almost immediately, still wearing the tuxedo from the night before, without the jacket and cummerbund. The sleeves of his shirt were rolled past his elbows and the top three buttons were open. His dishevelment and the shadows under his eyes suggested he hadn\u2019t been to bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d he demanded. \u201cIs my breathing too loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she stated calmly as she marched into his apartment.</p><p>Nolan remained standing at the door. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in and make yourself at home?\u201d he muttered sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI already have.\u201d She sat on the edge of his sofa and waited until he turned to face her. \u201cSo?\u201d she asked with cheerful derision. \u201cHow\u2019d your hot date go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He smiled grimly. \u201cJust fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you go for dinner? The Four Seasons? Fullers?\u201d She named two of the best restaurants in town. \u201cBy the way, do I know Prudence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered with sharp impatience.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryanne\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have coffee made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made.\u201d But he didn\u2019t offer her any. The fact that he was still standing by the door suggested he wanted her out of his home. But when it came to dealing with Nolan, Maryanne had long since learned to ignore the obvious.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll get myself a cup.\u201d She walked into the kitchen and found two clean mugs in the dishwasher. \u201cYou want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some,\u201d he said pointedly, stationing himself in the kitchen doorway. He heaved a long-suffering sigh. \u201cMaryanne, I\u2019m busy, so if you could get on with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father knows,\u201d she said calmly, watching him closely for some sort of reaction. If she\u2019d been looking for evidence of concern or regret, he showed neither. The only emotion she was able to discern was a brief flicker of what she could only assume was relief. That wasn\u2019t encouraging. He appeared all too willing to get her out of his life.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she probed. \u201cSay something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell have you been telling him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing about you, so don\u2019t worry. I did mention you to my mother, but you don\u2019t need to worry about that, either. She thinks you and I...Never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your father know?\u201d Nolan asked.</p><p>She sipped from the edge of the mug and shrugged. \u201cHe found out I wasn\u2019t on special assignment for the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial assignment? What does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told my mother when I moved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would you tell her something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was expecting me to send her my columns, and call every other day. I couldn\u2019t continue to do either of those things. I had to come up with some excuse.\u201d</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cYou might have tried the truth.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne nodded her agreement. If she\u2019d bungled any part of this arrangement, it had been with her parents. However, there wasn\u2019t time for regrets now.</p><p>\u201cDad learned I moved out of The Seattle. I didn\u2019t tell him where I was living, but that won\u2019t deter him. Knowing Dad, he\u2019ll have all the facts by noon today. To put it mildly, he isn\u2019t pleased. He wants me to return to the East Coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d Nolan\u2019s question was casual, as though her response was of little concern to him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d The impatient look was back. \u201cFor the love of heaven, Annie, will you kindly listen to reason? You don\u2019t belong here. You\u2019ve proved your point. If you\u2019re waiting for me to admit I was wrong about you, then fine, I\u2019ll admit it, and gladly. You\u2019ve managed far better than I ever dreamed you would, but it\u2019s time to get on with your life. It\u2019s time to move back into the world where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...I\u2019ve fallen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Annie, it\u2019s barely seven and I have to go to work,\u201d he said brusquely, cutting her off. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be getting dressed? Walking around the hallway in your pyjamas isn\u2019t wise\u2014people might think something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face wearily, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cNolan,\u201d Maryanne said softly, her heart in her throat. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t go out with anyone named Prudence. You made the whole thing up. This game of yours isn\u2019t going to work. It\u2019s too late. I\u2019m...already in love with you.\u201d</p><p>The whole world seemed to come to an abrupt halt. Maryanne hadn\u2019t intended to blurt out her feelings this way, but she didn\u2019t know how else to cut through the arguments and the denial.</p><p>For one wild-eyed moment Nolan didn\u2019t say anything. Then he raised his hand, as though fending off some kind of attack, and retreated from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be in love with me,\u201d he insisted, slowly sinking to the sofa, like a man in the final stages of exhaustion. \u201cI won\u2019t allow it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s too late,\u201d Maryanne told him again, no less calmly. \u201cI\u2019m already in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow just a minute,\u201d Nolan said, apparently regaining his composure. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice kid, and to be honest I\u2019ve been impressed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a kid,\u201d she corrected with quiet authority, \u201cand you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie...Maryanne,\u201d he said, \u201clisten to me. What you feel for me isn\u2019t love.\u201d His face revealed a bitterness she hadn\u2019t seen before. He walked toward her, gripped her shoulders and gazed down at her.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work, either,\u201d she said in the same quiet voice. She wasn\u2019t a poor little rich girl who\u2019d only recently discovered who she was. Nor had she mistaken admiration for love. \u201cI know what I feel.\u201d</p><p>She slipped her arms around his neck and stood on tiptoe, wanting to convince him of her sincerity with a kiss.</p><p>But before her mouth could meet his, Nolan jerked his head back, preventing the contact. He dropped his arms and none too gently pushed her away.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid to kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right I am,\u201d he said, burying his hands in his pockets as he hastily moved even farther away.</p><p>Maryanne smiled softly. \u201cAnd with good reason. We both know what would happen if you did. You\u2019ve done a good job of hiding your feelings, I\u2019ll grant you that much. I was nearly fooled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally I\u2019m flattered.\u201d His expression was darkening by the second. He stalked across the room, his shoulders hunched forward. He didn\u2019t say anything else, and Maryanne strongly suspected he was at a loss for words. Nolan was never at a loss for words. Words were his stock-in-trade. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he was confronting emotions now, not words or concepts, and she knew him well enough to realize how uncomfortable that made him.</p><p>He\u2019d hidden his feelings behind a mask of gruff annoyance, allowing her to believe she\u2019d become a terrible nuisance in his life. He needed to disguise what he felt for her\u2014to prevent her from learning what everyone else already knew.</p><p>Nolan was in love with her.</p><p>The mere thought thrilled her and gave her more courage than she\u2019d ever possessed in her life.</p> <p>\u201cI fully expect you to be flattered,\u201d she said gently, \u201cbut I\u2019m not telling you this to give your ego a boost. I honestly love you, and nothing my parents say is going to convince me to leave Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryanne, please...\u201d</p><p>He was prepared to push her away verbally, as he had so often. This time she wouldn\u2019t let him. This time she walked over to him, threw both arms around his waist and hugged him close.</p><p>He raised his hands to her shoulders, ready to ease her from him, but the moment they came to rest on her he seemed to lose his purpose.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d she heard him mumble. He held himself rigid for a moment or two, then with a muttered curse buried his face in her hair. A ragged sigh tore through his body.</p> <p>Experiencing a small sense of triumph, Maryanne pressed her ear to his chest and smiled contentedly when she heard his racing uneven heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let me hold you like this.\u201d His voice was low and hushed. \u201cTell me not to,\u201d he breathed as his lips moved through her hair and then lower to the pulse point behind her ear and the slope of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to stop...\u201d She turned her head, begging him to touch and kiss her.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be in your arms more than anywhere. More than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying....\u201d</p> <p>She lifted her head enough for their eyes to meet. Placing her finger on his lips, she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m a woman, a grown woman, and there\u2019s no question of my not knowing what I want.\u201d</p><p>His hands gently grazed her neck, as though he was still hesitant and unsure. Kissing her was what he wanted\u2014she could read it clearly in his dark eyes\u2014but he was holding himself back, his face contorted with indecision.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, kiss me,\u201d she urged softly, wanting him so much her whole body seemed to ache. \u201cI dare you to.\u201d</p><p>His breathing was labored, and Maryanne could sense the forces raging within him. A fresh wave of tenderness filled her.</p><p>\u201cYou make it so hard to do what\u2019s right,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>\u201cLoving each other is what\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to believe that, but I can\u2019t.\u201d He placed his hand on her cheek and their eyes locked hungrily. He searched her face.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered, smiling up at him. She didn\u2019t want him to question her feelings. She\u2019d say it a thousand times a day if that was what it took to convince him.</p> <p>Flattening her hands against his hard chest, she leaned into his strength and offered him her mouth. Only moments earlier he\u2019d pushed her away, but not now. His gaze softened and he closed his eyes tightly. He was losing the battle.</p><p>It was while his eyes were closed that Maryanne claimed the advantage and kissed him. He moaned and seemed about to argue, but once their mouths met, urgency took hold and Nolan was rendered speechless.</p><p>To her delight, he responded with the full-fledged hunger she\u2019d witnessed in his eyes. He slid his hands through her hair, his fingers tangling with the thick auburn mass as he angled her head to one side. Maryanne felt herself savoring the taste of his kiss. It was so long since he\u2019d held her like this, so long since he\u2019d done anything but keep her at arm\u2019s length. She wanted to cherish these moments, delight in the rush of sensations.</p><p>So many thoughts crowded her mind. So many ideas. Plans for their future.</p><p>He tore his mouth from hers and nestled his face in the hollow of her neck as he drew in several deep breaths.</p><p>Maryanne clung to him, hugging him as close as humanly possible. \u201cNolan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t going to work\u2014you and me together...it isn\u2019t right,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more right than anything I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Annie, the things you do to me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled gently. \u201cYou know what I think?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him the opportunity to answer. \u201cI love you and you love me and when two people feel that way about each other, they usually\u2014\u201d she paused and swallowed once \u201c\u2014get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nolan exploded, leaping away from her as though he\u2019d received an electrical shock.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a crazy woman. You know that, don\u2019t you? Downright certifiable.\u201d Nolan backed away from her, eyes narrowed. He began pacing rapidly in one direction, then another.</p><p>\u201cMarriage was just a suggestion,\u201d she said mildly. \u201cI am serious, though, and if you\u2019re at all interested we should move fast. Because once my father gets wind of it there\u2019ll be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of even considering the idea! In fact, I think it\u2019s time you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan, okay, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have mentioned marriage. I was just thinking, hoping actually, that it was something you wanted, too. There\u2019s no need to overreact.\u201d He had already ushered her across the living room toward the door. She tried to redirect his efforts, turning in his arms, but he wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about this,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said, opening the door and steering her into the hallway. \u201cYour idea of talking doesn\u2019t seem to coincide with mine. Before I figure out how it happens, you\u2019re in my arms and we\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryanne!\u201d Her father\u2019s voice came like a high-intensity foghorn from behind her.</p><p>Maryanne whirled around to discover both her parents standing in the hallway outside her apartment door. \u201cMom...Dad...\u201d Frantic, she looked at Nolan, hoping he\u2019d do the explaining part.</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Simpson,\u201d Nolan said formally, straightening. He removed his arms from around Maryanne, stepped forward and held out his hand to her father. \u201cI\u2019m Nolan Adams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d Muriel Simpson said in a brittle voice as the two men exchanged brief handshakes. Her mother\u2019s troubled gaze moved from the men to Maryanne, surveying her attire with a single devastating look.</p><p>Until that moment, Maryanne had forgotten she was still in her pyjamas. She closed her eyes and groaned.</p><p>\u201cSamuel,\u201d Muriel Simpson said in a shocked voice. \u201cMaryanne\u2019s coming out of...his apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like,\u201d Maryanne rushed to tell them. \u201cMom and Dad, please, you\u2019ve got to listen to me. I didn\u2019t spend the night at Nolan\u2019s, honest. We just happened to get into a tiff this morning and instead of shouting through the walls and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel.\u201d Her mother reached for her father\u2019s sleeve, gripping it hard. \u201cI feel faint.\u201d</p><p>Samuel Simpson clamped his arm about his wife\u2019s waist and with Nolan\u2019s assistance led her through his open apartment door. Maryanne hurried ahead of them to rearrange pillows on the sofa.</p><p>Crouched in front of her mother, Maryanne gently patted her hand. Muriel wasn\u2019t given to fainting spells; clearly, she\u2019d been worried sick about her daughter, which increased Maryanne\u2019s guilt a hundredfold.</p><p>\u201cMy little girl is safe, and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d Muriel whispered.</p><p>\u201cListen here, young man,\u201d Maryanne\u2019s father said sternly to Nolan. \u201cIt seems you two have some explaining to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, please.\u201d Jumping to her feet, Maryanne stood between her father and Nolan, loving them both so much and not sure which one to confront first. She took a deep breath and blurted out, \u201cI\u2019m in love with Nolan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I know the circumstances look bad, but I can assure you there\u2019s nothing between me and your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s nothing between us?\u201d Maryanne cried, furious with him. Good grief, she\u2019d just finished spilling out her heart to the man! The least he could do was acknowledge what they shared, what they both felt. Well, if he wasn\u2019t so inclined, she was. \u201cThat\u2019s a bold-faced lie,\u201d she announced to her father, hearing Nolan groan behind her as she spoke.</p><p>Samuel Simpson, so tall and formidable, so distinguished and articulate, seemed to find himself dumbstruck. He slumped onto the sofa next to his wife and rested his face in both hands.</p><p>\u201cMaryanne,\u201d Nolan said from between gritted teeth. \u201cYour parents appear to think the worst. Don\u2019t you agree it would be more appropriate to assure them that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what they think. Well, I do, of course,\u201d she amended quickly, \u201cbut I\u2019m more interested in settling things between you and me.\u201d</p><p>Nolan\u2019s frowned impatiently. \u201cThis is neither the time nor the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to think it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryanne, please,\u201d her mother wailed, holding out one hand. \u201cYour father and I have spent a long sleepless night flying across the country. We\u2019ve been worried half to death about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t answer her phone,\u201d Samuel muttered in dire tones, his eyes narrowing suspiciously on the two of them. \u201cIf Maryanne had been at her apartment, the way she claims, then she would have picked up the receiver. We must\u2019ve called fifteen or twenty times. If she was home, why didn\u2019t she answer the phone?\u201d</p><p>The question seemed to be directed at Nolan, but it was Maryanne who answered. \u201cI unplugged it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d Muriel asked. \u201cSurely you know we\u2019d try to reach you. We\u2019re your parents. We love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, young lady. You\u2019re moving back with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t force me to leave Seattle. I refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place...\u201d Muriel was looking around as though the building was likely to be condemned any minute. \u201cWhy would you want to live here? Have you rejected everything we\u2019ve given you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer is obvious,\u201d her father bellowed. \u201cShe\u2019s living here to be close to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why didn\u2019t her...friend move into her apartment building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Samuel stood abruptly and stalked to the other side of the room. \u201cAdams couldn\u2019t afford to live within a mile of The Seattle.\u201d He stopped short, then nodded apologetically at Nolan. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that in a derogatory way. You seem like a fine young man, but frankly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t care where Nolan lived,\u201d Maryanne informed them both, squaring her shoulders righteously. Any man she fell in love with didn\u2019t need to head a financial empire or be related to someone who did. \u201cI\u2019d live anywhere if it meant we could be together.\u201d Her eyes softened at her mother\u2019s shocked look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what it\u2019s like to be young and in love, Mom?\u201d Maryanne asked her. \u201cRemember all those things you told me about you and Dad?

He\u2019s so talented and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Nolan interrupted harshly. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for someone to blame for Maryanne\u2019s living in this building and working at Mom\u2019s Place\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Mom\u2019s Place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very nice diner,\u201d Maryanne inserted quickly. \u201cWe do a brisk lunch trade and carry a limited dinner menu.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother let out a cry of dismay. \u201cYou\u2019re...you\u2019re working as a waitress?\u201d</p><p>Miserable, Maryanne nodded. \u201cBut I\u2019m doing lots of freelance work. None of the feature articles I\u2019ve written have sold yet, but it\u2019s too soon for that. I just found out the community newspaper\u2019s buying a couple of my shorter pieces, and I plan on selling them lots more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might have warned me they didn\u2019t know about your being a waitress,\u201d Nolan muttered under his breath.</p><p>Samuel drew a hand across his eyes, as if that would erase the image of his daughter waiting on tables. \u201cWhy would you choose to quit the newspaper to work as a waitress?\u201d Asking the question seemed to cause him pain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s honest work, Dad. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re acting like this. You\u2019re making it sound like I\u2019m doing something that\u2019ll bring disgrace to the family name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut your education is being wasted,\u201d her mother said, shaking her head. \u201cYou could have any job in publishing you wanted.\u201d</p><p>That much was true when it was her family doing the hiring, but when she was looking on her own her employers were more interested in her job skills than who her father was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m the one who started this,\u201d Nolan interrupted. \u201cI wrote a column about Maryanne,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cIt was unfortunate, because I was out of line in some of the things I said, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan didn\u2019t write anything that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Maryanne hastened to say. \u201cHe made me stop and think about certain aspects of my life, and I decided it was time to prove I could make it on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy denouncing your family!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never did that, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel\u2019s shoulders sagged with defeat. The long hours her parents had spent travelling were telling on them both. They looked at her blankly, as though they couldn\u2019t quite believe, even now, what she\u2019d been doing for the past month and a half.</p><p>\u201cI did it for another reason, too.\u201d All three of them were staring at her as if they suspected she\u2019d lost her mind. \u201cI\u2019d met Nolan and we had dinner together and I discovered how much I liked him.\u201d She glanced at the man in question and saw him frown, knitting his brow, obviously searching for a way to stop her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom and Dad. I hated lying to you, but I couldn\u2019t see any way around it. I didn\u2019t want to worry you,\u201d she said, stepping next to Nolan and wrapping her arm around his waist. \u201cI belong here with Nolan.\u201d There, she\u2019d said it! \u201cI won\u2019t be returning to New York with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryanne, sweetie, you can\u2019t go on living like this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a wonderful life.\u201d</p><p>Her father was pacing again. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Daddy. I love him so much\u2014enough to defy you for the first time in my life.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyes slowly moved from his only daughter to Nolan. \u201cWhat about you, young man? How do you feel about my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Nolan was quiet for so long it was all Maryanne could do not to answer for him. Finally she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and did exactly that. \u201cHe loves me. He may not want to admit it, but he does\u2014lock, stock and barrel.\u201d</p> <p>Her father continued to look at Nolan. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said, gently removing Maryanne\u2019s arm, \u201cI don\u2019t return her feelings. You\u2019ve raised a wonderful daughter\u2014but I don\u2019t love her, not the way she deserves to be loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan!\u201d His name escaped on a cry of outrage. \u201cDon\u2019t lie. Not now, not to my family.\u201d</p><p>He took her by the shoulders, his face pale and expressionless. She searched his eyes, looking for something, anything to ease the terrible pain his words had inflicted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet and talented, and one day you\u2019ll make some man very proud\u2014but it won\u2019t be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan, stop this right now. You love me. You\u2019re intimidated because of who my father is. But don\u2019t you understand that money doesn\u2019t mean anything to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt rarely does to those who have it. Find yourself a nice rich husband and be happy.\u201d</p><p>She found his words insulting. If she hadn\u2019t been so desperate to straighten out this mess, she would have confronted him with it. \u201cI won\u2019t be happy without you. I refuse to be happy.\u201d</p><p>His face was beginning to show signs of strain. \u201cYes, you will. Now, I suggest you do as your family wants and leave with them.\u201d</p><p>Every word felt like a kick in the stomach, each more vicious than the one before.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Maryanne,\u201d he said coldly, \u201cdon\u2019t make this any more difficult than it already is. We don\u2019t belong together. We never have. I live in one world and you live in another. I\u2019ve been telling you that from the first, but you wouldn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne was too stunned to answer. She stared up at him, hoping, praying, for some sign that he didn\u2019t mean what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cSweetie.\u201d Her mother tucked an arm around Maryanne\u2019s waist. \u201cPlease, come home with us. Your friend\u2019s right, you don\u2019t belong here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m here now and I intend to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryanne, damn it, would you listen to your parents?\u201d Nolan barked. \u201cWhat do you intend to do once Mom\u2019s Place closes for remodeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome home, sweetie,\u201d her mother pleaded.</p><p>Too numb to speak, Maryanne stared at Nolan. She wouldn\u2019t leave if he gave the slightest indication he wanted her to stay. Anything. A flicker of his eye, a twitch of his hand, anything that would show her he didn\u2019t mean the things he\u2019d said.</p><p>There was nothing. Nothing left for her. She couldn\u2019t go back to the newspaper, not now. Mom\u2019s Place was closing, but the real hardship, the real agony, came from acknowledging that Nolan didn\u2019t want her around. Nolan didn\u2019t love her.</p><p>She turned her back on him and walked to her own apartment. Her mother and father joined her there a few minutes later, trying to hide their dismay at its bleakness.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t need to give my notice,\u201d she told them, sorting through the stack of folded clothes for a fresh uniform. \u201cBut I\u2019ll stay until Mom\u2019s closes. I wouldn\u2019t want to leave them short-staffed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d her mother answered softly, then suggested, \u201cIf you like, I can stay with you here in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne declined with a quick shake of her head, trying to conceal how badly Nolan\u2019s rejection had hurt. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She paused, then turned to her family. \u201cHe really is a wonderful man. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s terribly afraid of falling in love\u2014especially with someone like me. I have everything he doesn\u2019t\u2014an education, wealth, and perhaps most importantly, parents who love me as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne hadn\u2019t known it was possible for two weeks to drag by so slowly. But finally her last day of work arrived.</p><p>\u201cThe minute I set eyes on Nolan Adams again, I swear I\u2019ll give him a piece of my mind,\u201d Barbara declared, hands on her hips.</p><p>Nolan hadn\u2019t eaten at Mom\u2019s once in the past two weeks. That didn\u2019t surprise Maryanne; in fact, she would\u2019ve been shocked if he\u2019d decided to show up.</p><p>\u201cYou keep in touch, you hear? That Nolan Adams\u2014he\u2019s got a lot to answer for,\u201d Barbara said, her eyes filling. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you, girl. Are you sure you have to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Maryanne whispered, swallowing back her own tears.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so furious with Nolan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t all his fault.\u201d Maryanne hadn\u2019t told anyone the embarrassing details that had led to her leaving Seattle.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. He should stop you from going. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s got into that man, but I swear, for two cents I\u2019d give him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA piece of your mind,\u201d Maryanne finished for her.</p><p>They both laughed, and hugged each other one last time. Although they\u2019d only worked together a short while, they\u2019d become good friends. Maryanne would miss Barbara\u2019s down-to-earth philosophy and her reliable sense of humor.</p><p>When she arrived home, her apartment was dark and dismal. Cardboard boxes littered the floor. Her packing was finished, except for the bare essentials. She\u2019d made arrangements with a shipping company to come for her things in the morning. Then she\u2019d call a taxi to take her to Sea-Tac Airport in time to catch the noon flight for New York.</p><p>The next morning, dressed in jeans and a loose red sweatshirt, Maryanne was hauling boxes out of her living room and stacking them in the hallway when she heard Nolan\u2019s door open. She quickly moved back into her own apartment.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he demanded, following her in. He was wearing the ever-present beige raincoat, his mood as sour as his look.</p><p>\u201cMoving,\u201d she responded flippantly. \u201cThat was what I thought you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen leave the work to the movers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Nolan.\u201d Which was a lie. How could she possibly be fine when her heart was broken?</p><p>\u201cI guess this is goodbye, then,\u201d he said, glancing around the room, looking everywhere but at her.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll be gone before you get back this afternoon.\u201d She forced a trembling smile to her lips as she brushed the dust from her palms. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure knowing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cSome day I\u2019ll be able to tell my children I knew the famous Nolan Adams when he was a columnist for the Seattle Sun.\u201d But those children wouldn\u2019t be his....</p><p>\u201cI wish you only the best.\u201d His eyes had dimmed slightly, but she was too angry to see any significance in that.</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply and the silence stretched, tense and awkward.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she finally said, with a deep sigh, \u201cyou\u2019re really going to let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He spoke without hesitation, but she noticed that his mouth thinned, became taut.</p><p>\u201cIt may come as a surprise to learn you\u2019re not the only one with pride.\u201d She spoke as clearly and precisely as she could. \u201cI\u2019m going to do what you asked and leave Seattle. I\u2019ll walk away without looking back. Not once will I look back,\u201d she repeated, her throat constricting, making speech difficult. She waited a moment to compose herself. \u201cSomeday you\u2019ll regret this, Nolan. You\u2019ll think back to what happened and wish to hell you\u2019d handled the situation differently. Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s not what you\u2019ve done that will fill you with regret, but what you haven\u2019t done?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnnie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, let me finish. I\u2019ve had this little talk planned for days and I\u2019m going to deliver it. The least you can do is stand here and listen.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to haunt you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You won\u2019t be able to go into a restaurant without believing you see me there. I\u2019ll be hiding behind every corner. I\u2019ll follow you down every street. And as for enjoying another bowl of chili, you can forget that, as well.\u201d By now her voice was trembling.</p><p>\u201cI never meant to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She abruptly turned away from him, wiping the tears from her cheeks with both hands.</p><p>\u201cBe happy, Annie.\u201d</p> <p>She would try. There was nothing else to do.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cHave you had a chance to look over those brochures?\u201d Muriel asked Maryanne two weeks later. They were sitting at the breakfast table, savoring the last of their coffee.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I should find myself another job.\u201d It was either that or spend the rest of her life poring over cookbooks. Some people travelled to cure a broken heart, some worked\u2014but not Maryanne. She hadn\u2019t written a word since she\u2019d left Seattle. Not one word.</p><p>She\u2019d planned to send out new queries, start researching new articles for specialty magazines. Somehow, that hadn\u2019t happened. Instead, she\u2019d been baking up a storm. Cookies for the local day-care center, cakes for the senior citizens\u2019 home, pies for the clergy. She figured she\u2019d gone through enough flour in the past week to take care of the Midwest wheat crop. Since the holiday season was fast approaching, baking seemed the thing to do.</p><p>\u201cBut, sweetie, Europe this time of year is fabulous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom, I don\u2019t mean to be ungrateful, but travelling just doesn\u2019t interest me right now.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s face softened with concern. \u201cApparently, baking does. Maryanne, you can\u2019t bake cookies for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. If I keep this up I\u2019ll look like the Goodyear blimp by Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Her mother laughed. \u201cThat obviously isn\u2019t true. If anything, you\u2019ve been losing weight.\u201d She hesitated before adding, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been so quiet.\u201d</p><p>When she was in pain, Maryanne always withdrew into herself, seeking what comfort she could in routine tasks\u2014such as baking. She was struggling to push every thought of Nolan from her mind. But as her mother said, she had to get out of the kitchen and rejoin the world. Soon she\u2019d write again. Maybe there was a magazine for bakers\u2014she could submit to that, she thought wryly. It would be a place to start, anyway, to regain her enthusiasm. Soon she\u2019d find the strength to face her computer again. Even the sale of three articles hadn\u2019t cheered her. She\u2019d stared at the checks and felt a vague sense of disappointment. If only they\u2019d arrived before she left Seattle; then she might have considered staying.</p><p>\u201cIs it still so painful?\u201d Muriel asked unexpectedly. Nolan and Maryanne\u2019s time in Seattle, were subjects they all avoided, and Maryanne appreciated the opportunity to talk about him.</p><p>\u201cI wish you and Dad had known him the way I did,\u201d she said wistfully. \u201cHe\u2019s such a contradiction. Rough and surly on the outside, but gentle and compassionate on the inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds as though you\u2019re describing your father.\u201d</p> <p>She pondered her mother\u2019s words. \u201cNolan is a lot like Daddy. Principled and proud. Independent to a fault. I didn\u2019t realize that in the beginning, only later.\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cNo man could ever make me angrier than Nolan.\u201d Nor could any man hope to compete when it came to the feelings he evoked as he kissed her. She came to life in his arms.</p><p>\u201cHe drove me crazy with how stubborn he could be. At first all I could see was his defensiveness. He\u2019d scowl at me and grumble\u2014he always seemed to be grumbling, as if he couldn\u2019t wait to get me out of his hair. He used to look at me and insist I was nothing but trouble. Then he\u2019d do these incredibly considerate things.\u201d She was thinking of the day she\u2019d moved into the apartment and how he\u2019d organized the neighborhood teens to haul her boxes up four flights of stairs. How he\u2019d brought her dinner. The morning he\u2019d fixed her radiator. Even the time he\u2019d tried to find her a more \u201csuitable\u201d date.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be another man for you, sweetie, someone who\u2019ll love you as much as you love him.\u201d</p><p>A bittersweet smile crossed Maryanne\u2019s lips. That was the irony of it all.</p><p>\u201cNolan does love me. I know it now, in my heart. I believed him when he said he didn\u2019t, but he was lying. It\u2019s just that he was in love with someone else a long time ago and he was badly hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid to leave himself open to that kind of pain again. To complicate matters, I\u2019m Samuel Simpson\u2019s daughter. If I weren\u2019t, he might\u2019ve been able to let go of his insecurities and make a commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who\u2019s losing out.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne understood that her mother\u2019s words were meant to comfort her, but they had the opposite effect. Nolan wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d lost. \u201cI realize that and I think in some sense he does, too, but it\u2019s not much help.\u201d</p><p>Her mother was silent.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Mom,\u201d Maryanne said, surprising herself with a sudden streak of enthusiasm. \u201cI may not feel like flying off to Paris, but I think a shopping expedition would do us both a world of good. We\u2019ll start at the top floor of Sak\u2019s and work our way straight down to the basement.\u201d</p><p>They spent a glorious afternoon Christmas shopping. They arrived home at dinnertime, exhausted yet rejuvenated.</p><p>\u201cWhere was everyone after school?\u201d Mark, the older of the Simpson boys, complained. At sixteen, he was already as tall as his father and his dark eyes shone brightly with the ardor of youth. \u201cI had a rotten day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Every eye was on him. Mark sighed expressively. \u201cThere\u2019s this girl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusie Johnson. Mark\u2019s bonkers over her,\u201d fourteen-year-old Sean supplied, grinning shrewdly at his older brother.</p><p>Mark ignored him. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get Susie\u2019s attention for a long time. At first I thought she\u2019d notice me because of my brains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat brains? Why would she do anything as dumb as that?\u201d</p><p>Samuel tossed his son a threatening glare and Sean quickly returned to his meal.</p><p>\u201cSome girls really go for that intelligent stuff. You, of course\u2014\u201d he looked down his nose at Sean \u201c\u2014wouldn\u2019t know that, on account of only being in junior high. Which is probably where you\u2019ll stay for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>Samuel frowned again.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Maryanne urged Mark, not wanting the conversation to get sidetracked by her two brothers trading insults.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately Susie didn\u2019t even seem to be aware I was in three of her classes, let alone that I was working my head off to impress her. So I tried out for the soccer team. I figured she\u2019d have to notice me because she\u2019s a cheerleader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour skills have been developing nicely,\u201d Samuel said, nodding proudly at his eldest son.</p><p>\u201cSusie hasn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure,\u201d Maryanne said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s true.\u201d Mark signed melodramatically, as if the burden of his problem was too heavy to bear. \u201cThat was when I came up with the brilliant idea of paying someone\u2014another girl, one I trust\u2014to talk to Susie, ask her a few questions. I figured if I could find out what she really wants in life then I could go out of my way to\u2014\u201d he paused \u201c\u2014you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you were hoping was that she\u2019d say she wanted to date a guy who drove a red Camaro so you could borrow your mother\u2019s to take to school for the next week or so.\u201d Samuel didn\u2019t succeed in disguising his smile as he helped himself to salad.</p><p>\u201cWell, you needn\u2019t worry,\u201d Mark muttered, rolling his eyes in disgust. \u201cDo you know what Susie Johnson wants most in this world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo travel?\u201d his mother suggested.</p><p>Mark shook his head.</p><p>\u201cTo date the captain of the football team?\u201d Maryanne tried.</p><p>Mark shook his head again.</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d Sean demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe wants thinner thighs.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne couldn\u2019t help it; she started to smile. Her eyes met her younger brother\u2019s, and the smile grew into a full-fledged laugh.</p><p>Soon they were all laughing.</p><p>The doorbell chimed and Maryanne\u2019s parents exchanged brief glances. \u201cBennett will get it,\u201d Samuel said before the boys could vault to their feet.</p><p>Within a couple of minutes, Bennett appeared. He whispered something to Maryanne\u2019s father, who excused himself and hurried out of the dining-room.</p><p>Maryanne continued joking with her brothers until she heard raised voices coming from the front of the house. She paused as an unexpected chill shot down her spine. One of the voices sounded angry, even defensive. Nevertheless Maryanne had no difficulty recognizing whose it was.</p><p>Nolan\u2019s.</p><p>Her heart did a slow drumroll. Without hesitating, she tossed down her napkin and ran to the front door.</p><p>Nolan was standing just inside the entryway, wearing his raincoat. Everything about him, the way he stood, the way he spoke and moved, conveyed his irritation.</p><p>Maryanne went weak at the sight of him. She noticed things she never had before. Small things that made her realize how much she loved him, how empty her life had become without him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already explained,\u201d her father was saying. Samuel managed to control his legendary temper, but obviously with some difficulty.</p><p>Nolan\u2019s expression showed flagrant disbelief. He looked tired, Maryanne saw, as if he\u2019d been working nights instead of sleeping. His face was gaunt, his eyes shadowed. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to believe that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right I do,\u201d Maryanne\u2019s father returned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d she asked, stepping forward, her voice little more than a whisper. She was having trouble dealing with the reality that he was here, in New York, in her family\u2019s home. But from the look of things, this wasn\u2019t a social call.</p><p>\u201cMy newspaper column\u2019s been picked up nationally,\u201d Nolan said, his gaze narrowing on her. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that tell you something? Because it damn well should!\u201d</p><p>Maryanne couldn\u2019t conceal how thrilled she was. \u201cBut, Nolan, that\u2019s wonderful! What could possibly be wrong with that? I thought it was a goal you\u2019d set yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for another two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must be so pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when it was arranged by your father.\u201d</p><p>Before Maryanne could whirl around to confront her father, he vehemently denied it.</p><p>\u201cI tell you, I had nothing to do with it.\u201d Samuel\u2019s eyes briefly met Maryanne\u2019s and the honesty she saw there convinced her that her father was telling the truth. She\u2019d just opened her mouth to comment when Nolan went on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you had anything to do with the sale of my novel, either,\u201d he said sarcastically.</p><p>Samuel Simpson shook his head. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, man, I didn\u2019t even know you were writing one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour novel sold?\u201d Maryanne shrieked. \u201cOh, Nolan, I knew it would. The little bit I read was fabulous. Your idea was wonderful. I could hardly force myself to put it down and not read any more.\u201d She had to restrain the impulse to throw her arms around his neck and rejoice with him.</p><p>\u201cFor more money than I ever thought I\u2019d see in my life,\u201d he added, his voice hard with challenge. Although he was speaking to Samuel, his eyes rested on Maryanne\u2014eyes that revealed a need and a joy he couldn\u2019t disguise.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Nolan, I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded absently and turned to her father again. \u201cDo you honestly expect me to believe you had nothing to do with that?\u201d he asked, more mildly this time.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Samuel answered impatiently. \u201cWhat possible reason would I have for furthering your career, young man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Maryanne, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Maryanne couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. It was ridiculous. It made no sense.</p> <p>\u201cYour father\u2019s attempting to buy you a husband,\u201d Nolan growled. Then he turned to Samuel. \u201cFrankly, that upsets me, because Maryanne doesn\u2019t need any help from you.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyes were stern, and he seemed about to demand that Nolan leave his home.</p><p>Maryanne stepped directly in front of Nolan, her hands on her hips. \u201cTrust me, Nolan, if my father was going to buy me a husband, it wouldn\u2019t be you! Dad had nothing to do with your success. Even if he did, what would it matter? You\u2019ve already made it clear you don\u2019t want anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>His only response was silence.</p><p>\u201cI may have spoken a bit...hastily about not loving you,\u201d Nolan said a moment later, his voice hoarse.</p><p>Samuel cleared his throat, murmuring something about giving the two of them time to talk and promptly left the room.</p> <p>Maryanne stood gazing up at Nolan, her heart shining through her eyes. Nolan did love her; she\u2019d known that for a long time. Only he didn\u2019t love her enough to discard the burden of his self-doubts. The boy from the wrong side of the tracks. The self-educated, self-made newsman who feared he\u2019d never fit in with the very people who were awed by his talent.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d he grumbled, the way he always grumbled, as if he felt annoyed with her.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>His smile was almost bitter. \u201cAbout everything. I love you. Heaven knows I tried not to.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne closed her eyes, savoring the words she\u2019d never expected to hear. Her heart was pounding so furiously that her head spun. Only...only he didn\u2019t say he loved her as though it pleased him.</p><p>\u201cIs that such a terrible thing?\u201d she asked. \u201cTo love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...yes.\u201d</p><p>He seemed trapped by indecision, dragged down by their differences, yet buoyed by the need to see her again, hear the sound of her voice, gaze at her freckle-dotted nose and run his fingers through her hair. Nolan didn\u2019t have to say the words for Maryanne to realize what he was thinking.</p> <p>\u201cWhen everything started happening in my life, I thought\u2014I assumed\u2014your father was somehow involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really?\u201d she asked skeptically. The excuse was all too convenient.</p><p>Nolan lowered his gaze. \u201cNo, I guess I didn\u2019t believe he really had anything to do with the sale of my book. But having my columns picked up nationally came as a surprise. For a while I tried to convince myself your family had to be behind that, but I knew it wasn\u2019t true. What really happened is exactly what you said would happen. You haunted me, Annie. Every time I turned around I could\u2019ve sworn you were there. I\u2019ve never missed anyone in my life the way I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled shakily. \u201cThat\u2019s the most beautiful thing you\u2019ve ever said to me.\u201d</p><p>Nolan\u2019s look was sheepish. \u201cI tried to tell myself your father was out to buy you a husband. Namely me. Think about it, Annie. He got you that job with the Review, and for all I knew he could\u2019ve made it his primary purpose in life to give you everything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d proved otherwise,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents went out of their way to make sure none of us was spoiled. I was hoping I\u2019d convinced you of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d He slid his hands into the wide pockets of his raincoat. \u201cI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that if your father\u2019s willing to have me in the family, I\u2019d be more than happy to take you off his hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me off his hands. How very kind of you,\u201d Maryanne snapped, crossing her arms in annoyance. She was looking for romance, declarations of love and words that came straight from his heart. Instead he was handing out insults.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get all bent out of shape,\u201d he said and the smile that stole across his lips was so devastating Maryanne\u2019s breath caught. \u201cThe way I figure it,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou need someone...\u201d</p><p>Maryanne turned to walk away from him. Not any great distance, of course, just far enough for him to know he wasn\u2019t getting anywhere with this argument.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he amended, catching her by the hand and urging her around to face him again. \u201cI need someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d he concluded with a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re improving. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing seemed right after you left. There was this giant hole inside me I couldn\u2019t seem to fill. Work didn\u2019t satisfy me any more. Nothing did. Gloria and Eddie asked about you and I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was grateful Mom\u2019s Place was closed, because I couldn\u2019t have eaten there.\u201d</p><p>A part of her longed for all the romantic words a woman wanted to hear from the man she loved. But it wasn\u2019t too likely she\u2019d get them from Nolan. He wasn\u2019t telling her he\u2019d heard her name whispered in the wind or seen it written in his heart. Nolan would never say things like that.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to move back to Seattle so I\u2019ll quit haunting you,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cNo. I want you to come back because I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd need me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI still think you could do a hell of a lot better than marrying an ornery guy like me. I promise to be a good husband\u2014that is, if you\u2019re willing to put up with me...\u201d He let the rest fade. His eyes grew humble as he slowly, uncertainly, pulled her into his arms. \u201cWould you...be willing?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and hot tears gathered in the corners of her eyes. She nodded jerkily. \u201cYes. Oh, you idiot. I could slap you for putting us through all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t a kiss do just as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose, only...\u201d</p><p>But the thought was left unspoken. His kiss was long and thorough and said all the tender words, the fanciful phrases she\u2019d never hear.</p><p>It was enough.</p><p>More than enough to last her a lifetime.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>It was Christmas morning in the Adams household.</p><p>The wrapping paper had accumulated in a small mountain on the living-room carpet. The Christmas tree lights twinkled and \u201cSilent Night\u201d played in the background.</p><p>Maryanne sat on the sofa next to Nolan with her feet up, her head on her husband\u2019s shoulder. The girls were busy sorting through their stash of new toys and playing their favorite game\u2014\u201cbeing grown-ups.\u201d Bailey was pretending to be a young college graduate determined to make a name for herself in the newspaper business. Courtney played a jaded reporter from a rival newspaper, determined to thwart her. It was Maryanne and Nolan\u2019s romance all over again. The girls had loved hearing every detail of their courtship.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t seem too disappointed about not getting a puppy,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of them,\u201d Maryanne smiled. Both Courtney and Bailey were thrilled about the new baby, and although it had been hard, they\u2019d accepted that there wouldn\u2019t be a puppy in the family, after all. Not for a few years, anyway.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re adorable,\u201d Nolan agreed and kissed the top of her head. \u201cJust like their mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you say your parents would\u2014\u201d Nolan didn\u2019t get a chance to finish the question before the doorbell rang. \u201cIs that them?\u201d Samuel and Muriel Simpson had come from New York to spend Christmas week with the family.</p><p>Maryanne nodded. Sitting up, she called to her oldest daughter, \u201cCourtney, could you please answer the door?\u201d</p><p>Both girls raced to the front door, throwing it open. They were silent for just a second, then squealed with delight. \u201cGrandma! Grandpa Simpson!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas. Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne\u2019s parents stepped into the house, carrying a large wicker basket. Inside slept a small black-and-white puppy.</p><p>\u201cA puppy?\u201d Courtney said in a hushed voice. She stared at her grandparents, who grinned and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe think every family needs a dog,\u201d Maryanne\u2019s father said.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s so cute,\u201d Bailey whispered, covering her mouth with both hands.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s perfect,\u201d Courtney said, lifting the squirming puppy from his bed. \u201cIs he ours? Can we keep him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, this is a special-delivery Christmas gift for my two beautiful granddaughters.\u201d</p><p>Maryanne came over to take the puppy from Courtney. She cuddled the small, warm body and looked into sleepy brown eyes.\u201d I guess you\u2019ve come a long way, haven\u2019t you?\u201d she murmured. The puppy gazed up at her, unblinking, and Maryanne fell in love. Just like that, all her concerns disappeared. At least this baby would be house-trained well before their son was born. And the girls could help look after him. She looked up to meet Nolan\u2019s eyes, and he nodded. So, despite everything, there\u2019s be two new additions to the family this next year.</p><p>Nolan ushered her parents inside and took their coats. \u201cSit down and make yourselves comfortable. Maryanne and I have a Christmas surprise, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs good as a new puppy?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Courtney told him after a whispered consultation with her sister. She stroked the puppy, still cradled in her mother\u2019s arms. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re naming that surprise, but we\u2019re calling this one Jack.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
