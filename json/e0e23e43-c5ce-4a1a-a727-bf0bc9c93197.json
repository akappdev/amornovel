Even though Los Angeles traffic kept her from pushing the legendary sports coupe anywhere near its top speed of two-fifty-one, she\u2019d enjoyed her first ride off the showroom floor.</p><p>She shut off the engine and grabbed her purse from the passenger\u2019s seat. Through the window, her gaze halted on the charcoal four-wheel-drive Ford F150 parked nearby, and her mind veered toward its owner. He\u2019d become a permanent fixture in her mind\u2014those wide shoulders, that lazy stance, his cocky grin.</p><p>A giddy, tingling lust tightened her insides. Eye candy always enhanced a girl\u2019s mood, and there was no better place to grab a little sugar than among the studs of Renegades. But she\u2019d come to prefer the company of one stud in particular.</p> <p>She smiled down at the collection of notes she kept in the ashtray\u2014ones he\u2019d started leaving on the windshield of her car at different times of the day, almost every day, for the last two months. Because they always made her smile, she\u2019d transferred them from the Ferrari when she\u2019d traded it in. Sometimes the note of the day was a cartoon or a joke. Often it was some funny reference to physics, something they talked about regularly since she\u2019d started designing a series of stunt apps for the Renegades.</p><p>Today\u2019s had read:</p><p>I\u2019M AMPING THE PUCKER FACTOR TODAY.</p><p>YOU DON\u2019T WANT TO MISS THIS THRILL RIDE.</p><p>Which had been the first she\u2019d heard of a stunt running today. Confirmation of a stunt had come from the owner of the Renegades in a phone call later that morning.</p> <p>She grabbed her phone and notebook and stood from the car, turning her face up to the midday Southern California sun. Warmth bathed her skin, draining some of the morning\u2019s tension from her shoulders. It felt good to be out of the house, away from all that computer code, like a real person with real friends. Which was one of the major benefits of creating these apps for Jax\u2014she got to hang with this dynamic group of adrenaline junkies.</p><p>Of course, it didn\u2019t hurt that she and Jax had agreed that in exchange for building the applications for use on devices such as iPads and iPhones, she would be free to sell them, as she did her other apps and programs. The power she planned to incorporate into these apps with detailed physics calculations and mathematical equations for every aspect of every type of stunt, no other apps out there could even compare. She\u2019d make a decent chunk of change once she put them out on the open market.</p><p>The rumble of a motorcycle engine drew her attention down the long strip of concrete known as the Sixth Street Viaduct. The man-made cement canal guided the Los Angeles River through the heart of the city, but was now cluttered with all sorts of machinery, cameras and props.</p><p>She started toward the action, smoothing her hands over the filmy skirt that rode too high on her freakishly long legs. Tried to tug at her halter\u2019s bottom edge exposing a bare inch of skin, but ultimately couldn\u2019t hide the diamond stud at her belly button without exaggerating her cleavage. Oh well.</p><p>Finger-combing her hair off her forehead, she sauntered toward a group of tall, well-built men loitering near one of the cameras. She spotted Jax Chamberlin, the owner of Renegades and her best friend\u2019s new love, gesturing as he spoke to Daniel Craig\u2019s costar on the film, Jason Bolton, and the director. A couple of younger men Rubi knew as production assistants hung at the edge.</p><p>She passed one of the site\u2019s security guards, who grinned and saluted. Rubi returned the gesture.</p> <p>She approached the set and focused on Wes Lawson, Renegades\u2019 top stunt driver, where he straddled a cherry-red Ducati\u2014one of the world\u2019s fastest motorcycles. There was no outward sign the man covered in black from helmet to boot tips was him. It could have been any of the other Renegades\u2019 stunt men who rode motorcycles, which was, of course, all of them. But what gave Wes away completely\u2014beyond the studly build she\u2019d memorized\u2014was his impatience. He navigated a slow, tight pattern around the group, like a circling shark. Occasionally, he revved the engine, smothering their conversation with the bike\u2019s growl.</p><p>He maneuvered dangerously close to Jax on each pass, the action surely designed to either annoy Jax or hurry him up. Maybe both. Rubi grinned at his antsy behavior\u2014ever the kid who couldn\u2019t wait to reach the playground. Every last one of the Renegades she\u2019d met was a kid at heart. A smart-ass, feisty, too-sharp-for-his-own-good kid inside a hot man\u2019s body. But Wes was the most mischievous, most daring and, by far, the sexiest of them all.</p><p>The click of Rubi\u2019s heels drew the director\u2019s attention. The rest of the men followed his glance\u2014all with the same stupefied expressions. All except Jax.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you wearing?\u201d His voice tilted toward resigned frustration, one Jax often used with Wes. \u201cYou can\u2019t come out here dressed like...like...\u201d One hand lifted, gesturing the length of her body. \u201cLike...that. Guys are working here, Rubi. I can\u2019t have them off in porn fantasy land while they\u2019re running stunts.\u201d</p><p>He swung one hand toward a pile of crumpled cars down the length of the viaduct, burned out and still smoking, huddled in a haphazard heap as if they\u2019d recently crashed.</p><p>She stopped several yards away, crossed her arms, and smiled indulgently. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment, Jaxy-boy.\u201d The irritated press of his lips made her grin. He hated the nickname she\u2019d given him. \u201cI\u2019m taking your girl to lunch today, remember? And you didn\u2019t tell me you were running a stunt or that I\u2019d need to be here to watch? So I made other plans this morning\u2014and dressed accordingly.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been negotiating a sale price for the Aston when he\u2019d called, and estimated the outfit had saved her at least five grand.</p><p>The Ducati revved, and Wes shot the bike between the group and Rubi. She pulled up short with a gasp. Heat from the bike whooshed over her body.</p> <p>The helmet hid his mouth, but those deep gray-blue eyes crinkled at the corners with his smile.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him.\u201d His deep voice was muffled behind the gear. \u201cYou look perfect. And you\u2019re just in time. We\u2019re going to run the real thing.\u201d</p><p>That giddy electricity in her belly intensified. She lifted her sunglasses to the top of her head and worked up her easy, sexy grin. \u201cWes, if you run over Jax\u2019s toes, he\u2019s going to take away that pretty toy between your legs.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, his head falling back. The sound was so rich, so damn happy it trilled through Rubi, leaving her body a sizzling mess of carbonation. Then he released the Ducati\u2019s handles, letting the bike idle while he pulled off his helmet.</p><p>His hair fell all over the place as it came free. Light gold on top, wheat-colored underneath, it gleamed in the sunshine. Static electricity from the helmet\u2019s padding grabbed a few strands and pulled them into the air.</p><p>Rubi reached up to finger them back into place. Only when the soft, warm, sweat-dampened strands slipped between her fingers did she realize the misstep. A wicked craving kicked deep in her body. Delicious, languid desire tightened her throat.</p><p>And, shit, she\u2019d floated over that damn no-touching line again\u2014a line he had a way of making her forget all about.</p><p>She told herself to pull her hand back, but it had been such a long time since she\u2019d done something as simple as touch a man\u2019s hair. Okay, maybe not that long. Maybe it had been a long time since she\u2019d touched a man\u2019s hair with a purpose other than fisting it during sex.</p><p>An image of her hands fisted in Wes\u2019s hair, his hands and mouth pleasuring her body, flashed in her mind. Heat exploded at her core and spread. Quick. So damn quick, she almost didn\u2019t catch herself from a headlong fall straight into him. Her gaze lowered to his mouth, those lush, masculine lips she wanted to taste. To know.</p><p>He propped the helmet between his legs and leaned forward. The teasing heat in those smoky eyes had deepened. \u201cTrying to distract me? \u2019Cause it\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. But as long as I\u2019m here...\u201d</p><p>He let his gaze skim down her body again with an I-gotta-have-every-inch-of-that-now-or-I\u2019m-gonna-chew-my-arm-off groan. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes,\u201d Jax called as he walked toward another camera, \u201cwe\u2019re going again in five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so ready,\u201d Wes said without taking his eyes off Rubi. He definitely wasn\u2019t talking about the stunt, and his voice sounded as decadent, sinful as dark chocolate.</p><p>She lowered her gaze to ease the unsettling current growing between them. His body armor, tucked into pockets of the neoprene, covered his most vulnerable areas\u2014shoulders, elbows, chest, hips, package... A very nice package she\u2019d noticed on more than one occasion.</p><p>The thought forced her gaze back to his square jaw dusted with golden stubble, then higher. Avoiding those stormy gray eyes, she inspected his new haircut, shorter on the sides, longer on top.</p><p>\u201cI like the cut,\u201d she said, holding back from another suggestive comment.</p><p>Wes didn\u2019t show such restraint. \u201cFeel free to sink your hands in anytime.\u201d</p><p>She pretended the words didn\u2019t vibrate in her belly. \u201cDid you go to Sterling Shears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd saw Julie, just like you suggested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew she\u2019d do you right.\u201d</p><p>His grin heated, eyes sparked. \u201cI\u2019d rather you did me right.\u201d</p><p>The low vibration of his voice made her tingle everywhere. And he just kept smiling into her eyes, as if he really saw her. Saw beneath her looks, her attitude, all her smoke and mirrors. Her throat tightened.</p><p>She\u2019d been operating under the one-night-stand-only guideline for years, and that safety net worked for her. But she didn\u2019t throw friends into the pool of possible sex partners. She only had to remember the hearts she\u2019d damaged to remind herself she either did friendship or sex\u2014not both. Never both.</p><p>Narrowing her eyes, she met his gaze again. \u201cYou\u2019re extra playful today.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, still braced on the helmet, bringing him closer. So close the outer gray-blue ring of his irises contrasted with the lighter center and his spiky golden lashes. \u201cHave dinner with me tonight. Just us. No Jax. No Lexi.\u201d He paused, and Rubi felt the grip of his intent stare at the center of her chest. \u201cYou and me, Rubi.\u201d</p><p>His mouth was saying dinner. But his eyes were saying the best, eye-crossing, beg-for-mercy sex of your life.</p><p>And her body screamed yes with a flare of dizzying heat. But equally dizzying apprehension raised a wall that cooled her down. \u201cWhere\u2019s this coming from?\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not into the dating scene.\u201d</p><p>Vulnerability hinted in his eyes and tugged at Rubi\u2019s heart. \u201cThen don\u2019t call it a date. I\u2019d just like to get you alone.\u201d</p><p>Alone.</p><p>Oh dear God.</p><p>The battle of the Titans warred inside her, and she had to look away to find the strength to do the right thing. She sucked at letting guys down easy. She wasn\u2019t one of his typical nice girls, but she wasn\u2019t the type to use friends either.</p><p>\u201cNo, Wes, that\u2019s not my game. And I like what we have.\u201d Rubi forced her mouth into a smile, slipping into the flighty, careless cover she\u2019d perfected. \u201cGet to work, Lawson. I\u2019ve got information to gather, and a lunch date with Lexi.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRubi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be watching, taking notes, putting it all together for those apps you can\u2019t wait to get your hands on.\u201d She turned toward the camera where Jax bullshitted with the crew, and shot Wes one last grin over her shoulder. \u201cRemember\u2014no major injuries.\u201d</p><p>Wes leaned forward, revved the Ducati, and shot toward the bridge, pushing the bike to ridiculous speeds just to burn out this new streak of frustration.</p><p>Between the sun, the suit, and running the stunt three times already, he was sweating from every pore. That all would have been manageable if Rubi hadn\u2019t shown up looking like a goddamn Penthouse centerfold. Now his cock rubbed in all the wrong places.</p> <p>He was done with this all-flirtation-no-action shit. They\u2019d been building up to this for two months. Yeah, it had taken him a while to realize she was exactly the kind of woman he should have been dating for years. And, yeah, he\u2019d been easing closer to her because he also knew she was skittish about dating one guy. But he either had to get her into bed or out of his head.</p><p>And both had about the same chance of happening\u2014nil.</p><p>He\u2019d pulled every trick, every tactic in his arsenal to tug Rubi over the friendship-only threshold she\u2019d created between them, but she wouldn\u2019t budge. He knew she wanted to cross over. He saw it in her eyes when she looked at him. Heard it in her voice in those rare private moments when they found themselves out of earshot of Jax and Lexi.</p><p>And he was no quitter. He wouldn\u2019t give up on her without one hell of a battle of wills. Which meant it looked like he had a real challenge on his hands, because no one challenged him like Rubi.</p><p>Slowing the bike, he circled back to face the wreckage, pausing beneath the shadow of the condemned bridge for some heat relief. He dropped one foot to the cement and reached up to wipe sweat from his eyes through the opening in his helmet. When he glanced toward Jax and the crew, he found Rubi standing nearby. She had an ear bent toward Troy, one of Wes\u2019s fellow Renegades, and her gaze on the pile of metal Wes planned to annihilate.</p> <p>If Troy was flirting with her again, it was subtle. His hands gestured as he described the upcoming stunt so Rubi could get all the information she needed to program the apps she was developing for Jax. Her pen moved quickly over the page as she noted Troy\u2019s information.</p><p>Wes\u2019s mind flipped back to the way she\u2019d laughed at something he\u2019d said the night before. She\u2019d been sitting next to him at dinner with Lexi and Jax, leaning forward, elbows on the table, chin in one hand, twirling her drink with a straw. But those gorgeous green eyes had been on his, twinkling with happiness. Her smile had been wide and breathtaking. Her light-cocoa cheeks blushed with color.</p><p>Fierce want gripped his entire body\u2014the same desire he\u2019d suffered last night\u2014and he groaned.</p><p>As if she\u2019d heard him, Rubi glanced up from her notepad. With her sunglasses still on the top of her head, those light eyes were piercing. Her gaze remained directly on him even as Troy continued to talk, and he felt the sexual tension as if they were connected by a wire of electricity.</p><p>Frustration spiked, and he revved the bike. \u201cCome on, dude,\u201d he said to Jax through the headset feed. \u201cWait too much longer and we\u2019re going to have to realign the shot to kill shadows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold your dick on.\u201d Jax\u2019s voice pierced Wes\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019m putting three more cameras on this take. It\u2019s not like we can run it a dozen more times.\u201d</p> <p>He rolled the bike back and forth in a restless sway as he watched the key grip\u2014a guy who handled camera placement\u2014run between cameramen. The best boy, a kid who taped down all the electrical wires, worked frantically in the key grip\u2019s wake.</p><p>Waiting was one of his least favorite pastimes. Plus, today, every moment of downtime allowed his mind to drift toward his brother, which Wes had been trying to avoid by staying busy, dammit. And, just like every other time his mind had lolled toward Wyatt, his stomach balled into a fist. He\u2019d be out of surgery by now. At least that was Wes\u2019s hope. He hadn\u2019t had a chance to call his mother for a few hours now.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Jax\u2019s voice sounded in Wes\u2019s ear. \u201cWe\u2019re set to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>The familiar flutter of anxiety that came with every stunt\u2014stronger for some than others\u2014stung his breastbone. Down the stretch of concrete, all but two members of the crew cleared the area. The remaining members tossed lighter fluid on the crashed vehicles, and the fumes flooded his nose even this far away. He didn\u2019t like Rubi so close to that shit.</p><p>\u201cJax,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t Rubi watch from inside? The fumes are choking me all the way down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy.\u201d Jax turned from one of the cameras and spoke to Rubi. She shook her head, and Jax returned with, \u201cShe says she\u2019s fine. You good?\u201d</p><p>He should have known she\u2019d do whatever she damn well wanted. But he reminded himself he didn\u2019t have to like her stubbornness to admire it. \u201cYeah, good.\u201d</p> <p>Extinguishers filled with foam fire retardant passed through the staff clustered off to the side. They would run out and smother the flames poststunt. If this didn\u2019t take on the first round, it would be a royal bitch and a time suck to set up again.</p><p>He glanced toward Jax, but his gaze halted on Rubi. He got that delicious pinch low in his gut again, and instead of envisioning the death-defying act he was about to perform, Wes\u2019s mind filled with the little burst of warmth in Rubi\u2019s eyes when she\u2019d laughed at his helmet head. The glimmer of her perfect teeth when she\u2019d reached up and tried to straighten it out. The feel of her touching him. Yeah, she wanted him. Now, he just had to convince her of that.</p><p>He wiped sweat from his eyes one more time before dropping the Plexiglas on his helmet. God, he wanted out of this getup.</p><p>A scorching whoosh sounded as the cars went up in flames, dragging Wes\u2019s mind back. His body responded with a sympathetic burst of heat as fire licked the air. That was exactly what he felt like every time Rubi got within ten feet.</p><p>A different member of the crew ran into the center of the concrete near the inferno, a slate in his hands to mark the scene and take.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d Jax said in Wes\u2019s ear, \u201cSet...\u201d At Jax\u2019s pause, Wes revved the bike. \u201cAction.\u201d</p><p>The snap of the slate ricocheted off the concrete surroundings. Wes focused on the stunt, the placement, the timing, and lifted his foot as he shot forward.</p><p>\u201cAngle a little east,\u201d Jax said, watching how things looked from one of the cameras. \u201cYeah, good. Three. Two. One. Hit it.\u201d</p><p>Wes shut down all outside thought. His frustration with Rubi, his concern over Wyatt dissipated like vapor, and a familiar, consuming cohesiveness with the universe filled him\u2014brain and body. One making him intensely aware of the road, the air, his body, the laws of physics. The connection made him feel so alive, he vibrated with excitement.</p><p>He gunned the bike and shifted his weight backward. The front tire popped into a wheelie, and he kept just enough of his weight off the back end to allow the rear tire to spin against the slippery concrete. Vibrations rocketed through his body. Adrenaline flooded his veins. Acrid smoke spilled off the tire and enveloped him, filling his head with the scent of burning rubber\u2014an instant high. Even after decades of racing and thousands of rides, this shit electrified him every damn time.</p><p>With another shift of his weight and a jolt of fuel, Wes accelerated. He lowered his upper body until his chest rested on the fuel tank, until his view of the wreckage was framed in the handlebars, then kicked the bike into high gear. The engine screamed, echoing off the concrete and rattling Wes\u2019s brain. Every cell in his body exploded with life.</p><p>\u201cThree... Two... One...\u201d Jax said again, far too soon for Wes. He needed a good long ride\u2014in a couple of different ways. But this was business. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Wes slammed the front brakes and threw his weight forward. The bike\u2019s rear tire bucked into the air. With nothing but balance, brake pressure, and physical strength, Wes managed to keep his face off the concrete.</p><p>He controlled the bike\u2019s endo for two hundred feet, then clamped down on the brakes and threw his weight again. Bullying the bike to mesh with the laws of physics, Wes spun the opposite direction. He dropped his ass to the seat and the bike\u2019s back end to the ground. Then gunned the machine directly toward the metal inferno.</p><p>Hot damn. He\u2019d nailed those moves. This take would scream on screen.</p><p>\u201cStart your slide,\u201d Jax said.</p><p>Wes leaned the bike toward the ground, guiding the Ducati into a sideways suicide.</p><p>\u201cThree... Two... One...\u201d</p><p>Jax paused a beat and the pressure of the concrete burned across Wes\u2019s hip, then his thigh...</p><p>\u201cDrop it.\u201d</p><p>He gunned the gas and jerked his lower leg from between the concrete and the bike.</p><p>But his boot caught.</p><p>Ah fuck.</p><p>A flash of fear seared his spine. He gritted his teeth and yanked at his foot.</p><p>His leg popped loose. He released the handles. The bike speared toward the flames.</p><p>But the unexpected pull of his foot had altered the trajectory. Instantaneous thoughts pinged through his mind.</p><p>The bike would hit dead center. The crash would be bigger. The spread of debris wider.</p><p>Wes hit the concrete, and all thought vanished.</p><p>He bounced. Tucked. Rolled.</p><p>Two</p><p>One of Rubi\u2019s hands fused around her phone, the other around her notebook. She watched, frozen, helpless, as Wes tumbled end over end, his body bouncing with each hit against the concrete.</p><p>Over. And over. And fucking over.</p><p>Beside her, Jax swore and grew two inches as his easy stance tightened.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s heart slammed against her ribs. \u201cJax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good.\u201d One of the cameramen moved out from behind his equipment and took one giant step forward.</p><p>Jax smacked a hand against his chest. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>The word was barely out of Jax\u2019s mouth when the Ducati slammed into the fiery pile of cars. Debris exploded into the air. A shocked scream popped out of Rubi\u2019s throat. She stepped backward\u2014more out of surprise than force. Fear zinged through her blood like CO2. Her muscles jerked as fiery pieces of metal rained down around Wes.</p><p>Panic streaked through her, chest to belly, in electric jolts. \u201cOh God.\u201d Rubi dropped her notebook and started forward. \u201cWes.\u201d</p><p>Jax caught her arm. \u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>He and three other men stood ready to run\u2014their gazes watching the sky as the fiery debris continued to pummel Wes. The thick scent of smoke and chemicals snaked into Rubi\u2019s throat, filled her head.</p><p>She burned from the inside out. \u201cDo something, Jax.\u201d</p><p>On the floor of the viaduct, Wes curled into a ball and shielded his already-helmet-covered head. After the last piece of flaming metal hit the concrete, Jax released Rubi\u2019s arm and sprinted toward Wes. All the staff followed, abandoning equipment and pulling out telephones. Others did the same\u2014all from different directions, converging on Wes where he lay on his side.</p><p>Jax reached him first. Dropping to his knees, he leaned over Wes, his mouth moving as he spoke. A second later, they were both hidden behind a mass of people, and Rubi couldn\u2019t breathe. Couldn\u2019t move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, fuck.</p><p>Her whole body swam with terror. Her mind juggled fears.</p><p>He\u2019s okay. He\u2019s fine.</p><p>She swore she repeated the mantra in her head for excruciating minutes before the cluster of observers parted and Wes sat up. But it had to have been seconds, not minutes, because Rubi still hadn\u2019t breathed...and she hadn\u2019t passed out. Now, the air hissed out of her lungs through a tight throat, and the hammering of her heart seemed so much harder. So much faster. So much louder.</p> <p>Jax helped Wes pull off his helmet, and all that blond hair caught the sun. But only when Wes turned to Jax with a gleaming grin did Rubi\u2019s stomach finally untwist.</p><p>He said something that made everyone hovering howl with laughter.</p><p>Rubi didn\u2019t find this amusing. But relief uncoiled in her chest, creating a painful ache. She closed her eyes and pressed a hand to the discomfort. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>She crouched to pick up her notebook but stayed there a moment when her head went light. Residual fear choked her while her senses came back online\u2014the smell of chemicals and smoke, the sound of machinery and voices. That had been too close. Too damned close.</p><p>Pushing slowly to her feet so she didn\u2019t topple, Rubi turned, and walked toward the trailer, shaken. She\u2019d watched dozens of stunts over the last month while visiting the set to gather information for these apps. All their stunts were insane. All dangerous. But that...</p> <p>She\u2019d been fine until the bike tilted sideways. Until Wes had been sliding along the concrete at God only knew what speed. Looked like two hundred fucking miles an hour to her. She might even have continued to be okay if he hadn\u2019t simply thrown himself to the ground. Now, she felt unhinged. Confused over the distress. Terrorized over the fear of something happening to him.</p><p>She jogged the trailer\u2019s steps and entered the old piece of shit the guys dragged around with them from jobsite to jobsite. Thanks to Lexi, the trailer was now a remodeled piece of shit. The new secretary, Rachel, a darling little brunette, glanced over the top of her cute tortoiseshell rims with a breezy, \u201cHey, Rubi.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s best friend, Lexi LaCroix, her long, blonde hair loose, hanging shiny and straight to the middle of her back, turned from the window with a worried frown wrinkling her perfectly smooth forehead. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made everyone laugh, as usual.\u201d Rubi shrugged, trying to pretend her heart had not just tried to jump into her throat, but the irritation in her voice didn\u2019t fit the facade. \u201cI guess that means he\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>She needed a few minutes and turned for the small bathroom at the rear of the trailer.</p><p>Rubi closed the bathroom\u2019s thin door, but Rachel\u2019s voice filtered in. \u201cThey\u2019re fine. They do this all day, every day. If you fuss, they get all pissy. Pffft. Men.\u201d</p> <p>She ran the water, dipped her hands under the cool stream, and pressed them to her cheeks. Gripping the sink to hold herself up, Rubi looked in the mirror. Her eyes were dark with residual distress, her face drawn with tension.</p><p>She didn\u2019t like this at all. This worry. This fear. She wasn\u2019t made to weather this kind of emotional stress, which was why she lived the way she lived\u2014with very few attachments. But Rachel was right. This was nothing. They did it every day. Had done it every day for years. These guys knew what they were doing. Which was why they were the best in the business.</p><p>These feelings were so hypocritical considering her own love of speed. Her own maniacal driving tendencies. Wes was trained. Wes had won championship after championship in international motorcycle races the likes of MotoGP and Isle of Man before entering the world of stunts. Wes was a professional. Rubi was just a rebel\u2014breaking speed limits for the hell of it.</p><p>Alarm bells rang in her head. This stunt mishap shouldn\u2019t have disturbed her so deeply. If Troy or Keaton or Duke had been the Renegade bouncing along the viaduct, she\u2019d have been worried. Maybe a touched panicked, but she wouldn\u2019t be unraveling at the seams like this, and that told her Wes wasn\u2019t the only one with emotions pushing the boundaries of their friendship.</p><p>The floor shook with footsteps, and the trailer filled with muffled male voices\u2014laughing and chatting, bullshitting over the stunt.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d Rubi pushed off the sink and shook back her hair, shoving all the erratic feelings aside, then scolded herself in the mirror. \u201cYou\u2019re not falling for him, dumb shit. He is way out of your league. He doesn\u2019t do temporary, and you don\u2019t do permanent. Don\u2019t fuck up a good thing.\u201d</p><p>The lecture left a strange, painful hollow at the center of her belly, and she exited the bathroom, glad she and Lexi were having lunch together today. They hadn\u2019t gotten any girl time since Jax entered the picture, which, she realized, might be why these feelings, why this...deeper-than-normal friendship had developed between her and Wes.</p><p>Yes, a few hours with Lexi would set Rubi straight. That thought helped her pull it together. But only until she walked into the trailer\u2019s common area.</p> <p>All the Renegades were back, shrinking the trailer to the size of a microchip. Rubi could have choked on the testosterone thickening the air. But she was distracted.</p><p>Wes stood at the center of the room, the neoprene suit pulled off his shoulders, hanging low on his hips. She stopped short and pressed an open hand over her heart for the second time in fifteen minutes.</p><p>Her fantasies hadn\u2019t come close to the real deal, standing only six feet away. His stormy gray-blue eyes shone with residual excitement from that crazy-ass stunt. With his hands planted at his hips, his muscled pecs and biceps glistened with sweat. The fine line of golden hair low on his abdomen disappeared between his belly button and the waistband of whatever he wore beneath the neoprene.</p><p>\u201cPraise the gods of Olympus,\u201d she murmured, a little short of breath.</p><p>He was freaking carved.</p><p>And he had more ink than the tire treads circling his left bicep and the stylized checkered flag flowing down his right calf. He had something covering his right shoulder too. She narrowed her eyes at the image, taking in the detail, the definition of shadow, its sheer artistic beauty.</p><p>\u201cIs that a Terminator tat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly, but the same principle.\u201d Wes\u2019s gaze darted to his shoulder. \u201cLike it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Terminator tat?\u201d Lexi asked from where she stood behind Wes, fitting some type of harness to his hips.</p><p>These men had more toys and rigging and gear than God.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a 3-D rendition,\u201d Troy said from where he\u2019d sprawled his big body on a lounge chair. \u201cA cutaway view of the skin and what\u2019s beneath. But his isn\u2019t a real Terminator tat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it, dude,\u201d Wes said. \u201cIt\u2019s nicer than the one you\u2019ve got on your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not on my ass, dumb shit. It\u2019s on my hip. And it\u2019s way better than yours.\u201d He pushed to his feet and brought his hands to the button of his jeans. \u201cLet\u2019s let the ladies decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy.\u201d Jax\u2019s voice boomed up the steps and into the trailer. \u201cKeep your goddamned pants on for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Rachel yelled back. \u201cMind your own business out there. I want to see.\u201d</p><p>Keaton and Duke burst out laughing. Wes chuckled. Rubi couldn\u2019t even manage a smirk, and the fact that she couldn\u2019t shake off this funk only deepened her anxiety.</p><p>\u201cWe can work out a private showing, Rach,\u201d Troy said, his smoldering black eyes teasing her.</p><p>\u201cYou know the rules,\u201d Jax called. \u201cMess with my secretary, I\u2019ll mess with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Lexi added, \u201cI will. Rachel keeps Jax sane, which keeps me sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Daddy\u2019s happy,\u201d Keaton said, \u201ceveryone\u2019s happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLosers\u2014all of you,\u201d Troy shouted loud enough to make sure Jax heard where he stood at the base of the stairs talking with someone Rubi didn\u2019t know, then dropped back into the chair. \u201cA real Terminator tat, like mine, replaces muscles with gears and gadgets, cyborg-like.\u201d</p><p>Rubi didn\u2019t care about Troy\u2019s tattoo. She was inspecting Wes\u2019s. The ink rounded his right shoulder, the outline a double-pivoting bike chain with so much detail and shadow, she swore she could reach out and touch it. Parts of the chain fell away, broken, where a speeding motorcycle ripped from Wes\u2019s body, complete with torn skin and shattered chain links.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d Rubi said, subdued, but finally had a thought that made her smile. \u201cI should get one showing a motherboard underneath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Wes grinned. \u201cThat would be so cool. I\u2019ll take you to the guy who did mine if you want. He\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>Lexi circled Wes, then lowered to her knees in front of him, tightening Velcro straps around Wes\u2019s hips and thighs. Rubi had seen her friend do this hundreds of times over the years while fitting her couture wedding gowns to clients or measuring for alterations. And over the last two months since she\u2019d been seeing Jax, Lexi had taken on the new role for the Renegades as a seamstress to anything ripped, a designer to any new harness or bodysuit, even occasionally a costume or two.</p><p>And while Lexi\u2019s position on her knees in front of Wes was the perfect material for one of Rubi\u2019s typically suggestive, teasing comments, she wasn\u2019t in the mood. She really wanted to get out of this trailer, away from the handsome man who unnerved her\u2014her, a woman rarely ruffled by anything.</p><p>She crossed her arms and leaned into one hip. \u201cAlmost done there, Lex? I\u2019m ready for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Troy reached into the minifridge beside the sofa and popped the top on a Rockstar. \u201cSince when are you so eager to get away from us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not all that,\u201d Rubi teased, \u201cdespite what your bed bunnies tell you.\u201d</p><p>Keaton whistled through his teeth, the sound imitating a diving plane, then simulated the sound of an explosion. \u201cCrash...and...burn.\u201d</p><p>Troy shot Keaton a brotherly glare.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Lexi said, \u201cI want to get a better look at the fit in the back, but the straps keep slipping. Can you come hold these hinges so I can get a better look?\u201d</p><p>An absurd chuckle floated from her throat. Talk about sending mixed messages. \u201cUh, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Wes challenged with the rise of one golden brow. \u201cAfraid you might like it?\u201d</p><p>Afraid was right\u2014that she\u2019d like it. That he\u2019d like it. That the situation would lead them both down the wrong path. \u201cDon\u2019t goad me, Lawson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubi,\u201d Lexi said, \u201cwe\u2019re not getting out of here until this is done. Wes is holding the straps.\u201d She let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cTroy...?\u201d</p><p>Troy cut her off. \u201cNo way, no how am I getting on my knees for Lawson. I\u2019m gonna settle in for the show. Come on, Rubi. We ain\u2019t got all day here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it up, Troy,\u201d Wes said, staring into Rubi\u2019s eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s backing down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou little troublemaker,\u201d Rubi said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rubi,\u201d Lexi rounded behind Wes again. \u201cFive minutes, tops.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jesus, this was ridiculous. She was wasting more time not doing it than just getting it over with. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward, holding Wes\u2019s taunting gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas, Lawson. This doesn\u2019t change anything I said earlier.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and his grin took on an edge. \u201cI bet you say that to all the guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Rubi let the heat she used at the club slide into her grin. Maybe showing him a little more of her dark side would help him realize she wasn\u2019t one of the sweet little playmates he favored. \u201cI\u2019m glad we understand each other.\u201d</p> <p>In a purposely bold don\u2019t-play-with-fire move, she pressed both hands flat against his bare chest. His skin was damp and warm and soft, the sprinkle of golden chest hair crisp, the muscle beneath hard and radiating heat. A stream of liquid fire rolled through her body. His nipples tightened at her touch, stirring the craving she\u2019d been restraining for weeks. She ran her tongue over her bottom lip, wishing she could stroke it across the deep brown nub. He\u2019d taste salty now. And so very male, she had no doubt.</p><p>Even at five-nine and wearing three-inch heels, she had to tilt her head to look into his eyes. His gaze was heavy-lidded, but sharp, serious and scorching. Those full lips had lost their grin and his jaw ticked with pent up energy. There was definitely a more intense side to this easygoing country boy, born and raised in the heartland\u2014one that coaxed her interest and ramped her desire.</p><p>But she held her emotional ground and pushed through the chore with all her shields firmly in place.</p><p>Balancing herself with pressure against his chest, Rubi slowly lowered. Keeping her gaze pinned to his, sending the silent message that her will was just as strong as his, her hands slid down the hard wet muscle. God, he was utterly delicious.</p><p>Curling her fingers into the neoprene at his waist, she used his body to steady herself and rocked to her knees.</p> <p>Troy, Keaton, and Duke egged them on with whistles and a husky, \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d \u201cLooking good there,\u201d and \u201cMmm-mmm, getting hot in here\u201d encouragement. Rubi let it all fade into the background.</p><p>Wes\u2019s gaze had transitioned into something primal. Something hungry. Predatory. Rubi let herself imagine what he\u2019d do to her now if they were alone. How he\u2019d slide his big hands into her hair, guide her mouth to his cock, and draw her forward until he was buried to her throat. A telltale tickle signaled growing moisture between her thighs.</p><p>Lexi grabbed Rubi\u2019s hands, moving them to a pair of raised round components on the harness at either side of Wes\u2019s hips. \u201cHold these right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Wes let a hand fall to his side. He traced the tip of one finger across her forehead and lifted a lock of hair, setting it aside. The move was so intimate, tension balled in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou look good right there, Russo.\u201d His voice, low and thick, rolled over her skin like a warm breeze. \u201cReally good.\u201d</p> <p>He traced a tingling path down her cheek and across her jaw. Then his hand opened, and his thumb swept the angle of her cheekbone. A decadent sensation made it hard to keep her eyes open.</p><p>Footsteps sounded on the trailer\u2019s stairs. \u201cAre we ready for lunch?\u201d</p><p>Jax\u2019s question, clearly asked before he took in the scene, made Rubi grin.</p><p>Wes pressed his thumb against the center of her lower lip, dragging her mouth open a touch. \u201cJust say the word...\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019ll be your lunch.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to say the words for her to know what he was thinking. What they were both thinking.</p><p>\u201cRusso.\u201d The disbelief in Jax\u2019s voice finally drew Rubi\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA favor for Lexi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cYou can get up, Rubi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said with an infusion of thank God.</p><p>Wes leaned down and slid his hands up her arms. With a firm grip on her biceps, he lowered his mouth to her ear and whispered, \u201cTonight I\u2019ll be dreaming about finishing what we started here.\u201d</p><p>So would she. But she kept that to herself.</p><p>Rubi pushed against his chest and\u2014reluctantly\u2014eased herself from his grip.</p><p>Lexi glanced at Jax and gestured toward Wes. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Jax leaned back with that easy, negligent stance, dark brows pulled as his gaze inspected the harness.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He moved to Lexi\u2019s side and swung an arm around her shoulders, then reached down to fit the fingers of his other hand into the space between a circular contraption and Wes\u2019s hip. \u201cThat\u2019s a much better fit.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s phone double-chimed in his pocket, but his hands were busy fitting and refitting the Velcro strap holding the apparatus low on his waist.</p><p>\u201cYou asshole,\u201d Jax said with the same tone he\u2019d used with Rubi over her attire. \u201cYou know you shouldn\u2019t have your phone on you while you\u2019re running stunts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d A new intensity pulled Wes\u2019s forehead and mouth into a frown. He lifted one knee, and the straps around his thighs drew the metal strips along with the movement, pivoting at the hip joints. Then he lifted the other, crouched slowly, straightened. \u201cI hope this thing works.\u201d</p><p>He hoped? The fact that he would simply hope a piece of safety gear would work shot the heat of anger along her spine. But Rubi kept her mouth shut. She certainly wouldn\u2019t have nagged Troy or Keaton or Duke about their equipment. Or even Jax. And she wouldn\u2019t start with Wes.</p><p>\u201cIt will. It\u2019s a really nice rig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Wes turned away and ripped off all the straps, dragging the thing off.</p><p>His phone chimed again. He pulled it from a pocket beneath the neoprene and became engrossed in a message.</p><p>Jax stepped behind Lexi, wrapped his arms around her, and lowered his chin to her shoulder. Those blue-green beauties met Rubi\u2019s and turned innocent\u2014which meant he was about to pull something.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking us for lunch?\u201d he asked, hopeful.</p><p>\u201cUs? Who said you could come?\u201d</p><p>Before Jax answered, Rubi glanced at Lexi, who offered a lopsided grin.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s shoulders sagged. But she forced a smile and more enthusiasm than she felt. \u201cOf course. You\u2019re a package deal now, right?\u201d</p><p>Jax straightened, his gaze traveling to Wes, who was now leaning against a free desk, feet crossed at the ankles, blond head bent, his thumbs busily texting. Jax darted a questioning look toward Rubi. Over the last couple of months, they\u2019d all developed the ability to speak without talking, and now he was silently asking if he could invite Wes along.</p><p>Rubi lifted a shoulder. What was she supposed to do? Say no when they\u2019d been doing everything together for two months?</p><p>Jax\u2019s phone chimed, and he pulled it from his jeans\u2019 pocket. His gaze lifted to the other Renegades. \u201cThey\u2019re ready for you on set.\u201d</p><p>Troy, Keaton, and Duke rose from their seats and grabbed water bottles from the fridge before exiting the trailer.</p><p>When they were gone, Jax said, \u201cWes, come to lunch with us. Let Rubi distract you for a while.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up from his phone, his eyes glazed over in concern. \u201cI\u2019m filthy. You guys go ahead.\u201d</p><p>His disinterest swept a cool breeze of hope through Rubi. Maybe he wasn\u2019t as into her as he\u2019d seemed. Maybe he\u2019d been joking earlier. Her mind shot back to the intensity in his eyes. No, he hadn\u2019t been joking.</p><p>\u201cThe Crossroads has a patio,\u201d Jax said. \u201cOkay for you girls?\u201d</p><p>Not what Rubi had in mind at all, but... \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Wes peeled off the rest of the suit, showing tan cargo shorts beneath. He grabbed a white T-shirt off the corner of a desk and started toward the bathroom. \u201cLet me clean up. I\u2019ll just be a minute.\u201d</p><p>Rubi watched him go, soaking in the sight of the muscle play along his spine and ribs. Liquid warmth spread through her body, but she held in a sigh of longing. He was a beautiful man\u2014there was no denying that fact.</p><p>When he was gone, she returned her attention to Lexi and Jax. Here they were, the perfect foursome again. This whole pairing-off habit they\u2019d adopted over the past several weeks might be why Wes had tripped that line and asked her out. She had to admit, seeing Lexi and Jax together, so happy, so in love, so...connected, had tweaked Rubi\u2019s mind toward the idea of finding that perfect someone. But she only had to look into her past to know she wasn\u2019t Lexi. They might mirror each other in many ways but were completely opposite in just as many. Desiring and maintaining a romantic relationship was one of those opposites.</p><p>Yes, she wanted Wes. She was human. She was female. And he was...a freaking demigod. But talk about messing up perfect friendships\u2014breaking Wes\u2019s heart would cause rift upon rift upon rift within this new and expanding circle of Rubi\u2019s and Wes\u2019s friends.</p><p>To buffer the whole double-dating scenario, Rubi turned to Rachel. \u201cTake a break from that computer, Rach. Come with us.\u201d</p><p>Rachel groan, pulled her glasses off and rubbed her eyes. \u201cA break from this risk assessment sounds heavenly.\u201d</p><p>Wes returned with his muscles stretching the T-shirt\u2019s Hurley logo across his chest and his feet slung into worn, leather flip-flops. Rubi grinned at his surfer-boy look. But his head was still bent toward the phone in his hand, his handsome face pulled into that rare frown.</p><p>In an attempt to find equilibrium again, she teased, \u201cGirl problems?\u201d</p><p>He looked up with a lopsided grin and slid his phone into his pocket. \u201cYou\u2019re the only girl giving me problems, Russo.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand under her hair and squeezed her neck. Tingles spread over her skin, down her spine. The touch surprised her. Unsettled her. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Rachel stood and grabbed her purse.</p><p>Jax pulled Lexi by the hand toward the door. \u201cMy truck\u2019s right out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d Rubi said. \u201cI\u2019m going to head straight home from lunch. I\u2019ve got a lot of work waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>She stepped into the Los Angeles sunshine and slid her sunglasses on. At the bottom of the steps, Rachel turned to follow Jax and Lexi.</p><p>But Wes waited with a hauntingly sexy grin. \u201cCan I drive the Ferrari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>She always let him drive when they went anywhere together; it gave him such a thrill. And she\u2019d been brimming with anticipation of this moment when she\u2019d introduce him to her new\u2014even faster\u2014toy. But if she was going to keep things platonic between them, cutting back on these intimate habits would probably be a good start.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI traded it in today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d He reached out and placed the back of his hand to her forehead. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she laughed, batting his away. \u201cI don\u2019t need two cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you trade it for?\u201d</p><p>She heaved a sigh. There was no way she would be able to keep him out of this car without being downright mean. And that would be as detrimental to their friendship as fucking him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pointed her key fob toward the parking lot. The Aston\u2019s sidelights flashed with a corresponding chirp.</p><p>Wes\u2019s gaze held on the sleek machine for a long, disbelieving moment, before he uttered, \u201cIs that...? No...fucking...way.\u201d His voice overflowed with awe and appreciation, then he yelled, \u201cSuh-weet.\u201d</p><p>He jogged toward the Aston, and Rubi couldn\u2019t stop the soft grin that turned her mouth and lightened her heart. Jax followed, the two of them all smiles, as they opened the doors to peer inside, chattering like two-year-olds with a new Hot Wheels set.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t mentioned wanting a new car,\u201d Lexi said, coming up beside her with Rachel.</p> <p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t pass up a smokin\u2019 deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d Lexi crossed her arms and returned her gaze to the car, brow drawn. \u201cPretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty?\u201d Rachel said. \u201cIt\u2019s so gorgeous we might have to leave the boys behind. Don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll get them out of there now.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at Rachel\u2019s comment, but it was the confused concern in Lexi\u2019s voice that touched an uncomfortable spot inside Rubi. Sometimes it was great to have someone know you better than you knew yourself. Sometimes it was as uncomfortable as taking a cold shower.</p><p>Wes said something to Jax over the console and Jax laughed so hard he doubled over. The sight and sound eased Rubi\u2019s nerves and made her smile again. \u201cGod, they\u2019re so cute together.\u201d She cut a sidelong glance at Lexi. \u201cDon\u2019t think so hard. I can hear the gears grinding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019re out of sorts today. And this...\u201d She gestured toward the car. \u201cIs something going on with Wes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenial and redirect,\u201d Rachel said, crossing her arms with a huff and a teasing glare for Rubi. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ll get from her.\u201d</p><p>Wes glanced through the windshield, and his gaze linked with Rubi\u2019s. Electric current traveled between them and zapped her chest like a defibrillator\u2014the same way it had just before the stunt.</p><p>A sudden, swamping, completely irrational sense of loneliness opened in the pit of her stomach. She couldn\u2019t have him. No matter how much she might want him. But her brain was at war with her body. And those were both at war with some intangible part of her\u2014maybe her soul, if she had one. All the conflict created a niggling sense of panic deep in her chest.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going on,\u201d she said and forced a deep, easy breath into her lungs. \u201cAnd I\u2019m doing my damnedest to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s head popped from the car. \u201cCan I drive it? Please, please, please?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Rachel murmured under her breath. \u201cHow can you resist that?\u201d</p><p>Rubi shook her head. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>He rounded the door and held onto it as if he didn\u2019t want to let go. \u201cPlease? I\u2019ll be really nice to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew nice.\u201d Hearing Wes assign the Aston a gender as if it were a person broke any resistance Rubi had left. \u201cDrive the hell out of her. That\u2019s what she\u2019s made for.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s gorgeous face lit up like the sun. She tossed him the keys, and he whooped, fisting both hands in the air over his head.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d she said on an exhale. \u201cThe man steals my breath. Come on, Rachel. He\u2019s hot. And you\u2019re totally his sweet type. Can\u2019t you take him off the market?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as sweet as I look, but I still wouldn\u2019t know what to do with all that testosterone. You may think I\u2019m his type, but he\u2019s not mine. And, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, you are all he can look at or talk about.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to hear that. Rubi cut Lexi a sidelong glance. \u201cTell Jax to find him a damn girlfriend, would you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou traded your Ferrari?\u201d Wes jogged toward her, grabbed Rubi\u2019s hand, and tugged her toward the car. \u201cI put a note on your windshield this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d</p><p>His boyish glee eased a sliver of Rubi\u2019s discomfort. Or at least shoved it back into the dark for now. And a rush of adrenaline always soothed her nerves. Maybe this was just what the two of them needed to get back on even\u2014friendship\u2014ground.</p><p>\u201cGrab a table,\u201d he called over his shoulder to the others. \u201cWe\u2019re taking the long way.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>This wild drive might be an awesome distraction from Wes\u2019s angst over Wyatt\u2019s surgery, but the adrenaline rush did nothing to douse his infatuation with the woman next to him.</p><p>They\u2019d lowered the convertible roof, and the wind grazed their skin and tangled Rubi\u2019s hair into a dark, whipping halo. The midday sun burned down while the lightning-fast sports car gripped every curve in the road, the speed pumping thrill after thrill through Wes\u2019s veins.</p><p>But the best part was having Rubi beside him, her laughter filling his head with every new surge. Her squeals piercing his ears with each fresh skid.</p><p>He\u2019d known she was trouble from the moment he\u2019d seen her at the airport, all scarlet mini skirt, crimson Ferrari, and fiery flirtation. Nothing he\u2019d believed he\u2019d wanted until recently. While she was everything he\u2019d first thought\u2014feisty, funny, and flirty\u2014she\u2019d also turned out to be far more than he\u2019d ever expected\u2014wickedly intelligent, loyal to the core, and selflessly generous.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t even begin to calculate her heat quotient. She was off the fucking charts.</p><p>But Wes wanted more than friendship with Rubi, and he was ready to take a hammer to those walls she kept erecting between them.</p><p>Another tight curve appeared in the road. Wes slowed into the turn, then accelerated out, jetting the small car onto the straightaway at the crest of the Hollywood Hills and leaving the thick scent of burnt rubber in their wake to the sound of Rubi\u2019s thrilled scream.</p><p>He\u2019d driven this desolate road hundreds of times in as many different vehicles, but this was\u2014hands down\u2014the best ride ever. At the steepest grade, he pulled into a turnout where they overlooked all of Los Angeles and cut the engine.</p><p>A flush softened her light cocoa skin and her hair wound around her gorgeous face in a chaotic burst of darkness. Any other woman he knew would be cowering against the door. Or ranting over his insanity. But Rubi reveled in the speed, the adrenaline, the risk. The same way Wes did.</p><p>\u201cYou crazy bastard.\u201d She laughed the words and pushed her sunglasses to the top of her head. \u201cNow I know how Lexi feels when I drive.\u201d</p><p>Every time he looked at her, his brain slid sideways. He\u2019d seen photos from her previous years as a top model, but Wes thought she was the most gorgeous in her everyday casual state. Rubi\u2019s \u201ccasual\u201d might be another woman\u2019s \u201cdressed to the nines,\u201d but she had a way of appearing so absolutely comfortable in her own skin, she never gave the impression that much fazed her.</p><p>He\u2019d lain awake nights trying to figure out who she resembled. She called herself a poster child for the United Nations, a mix of Caucasian, Japanese, and African-American. Wes thought she looked like an exotic version of Halle Berry with higher cheekbones and a deeper slant to her eyes when she laughed. And she had the sweetest little nose. The way it squared off at the very tip made him want to kiss her there.</p><p>Hell, he wanted to kiss her everywhere.</p><p>She spread her hand over her chest, which rose with quick breaths, and the silver bangles around her wrist clinked. \u201cI may have to give you a speed limit, Lawson. You\u2019ve made my heart jump out of my chest twice already today.\u201d</p><p>The excitement glimmering in her eyes snapped his restraint. Want welled inside him, so thick, so fierce he couldn\u2019t hold back anymore.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try for a third.\u201d</p><p>With octane filling his veins, he twisted toward her, stretched across the console, and wrapped his hand behind her head, pulling her in.</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath a split second before his lips pressed hers. They were sun warmed, air dried, petal soft. She made the sweetest sound, a mix of surprise and pleasure, and the slow burn at the center of Wes\u2019s body burst into flame. Heat whooshed over him, the same heat that engulfed him during a stunt when one of his fellow Renegades lit him on fire.</p><p>Only this fire condensed in his chest before melting lower.</p><p>He eased the pressure of his mouth just enough to tilt his head, and kissed her again. This time she responded. Gently. Tentatively. Not at all what he\u2019d expected from this blazing-hot, ultraconfident party girl. But her tender response did confirm his theories about the real woman behind her smokescreen.</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d Her voice was barely a whisper between kisses, and her lashes fluttered just enough to expose a sparkling green hint of her eyes.</p><p>Her hand slid along his forearm and up his bicep, prickling heat across his skin. Then snuck under his sleeve and curled around the back of his arm, pulling him closer. The fist of want deep in his gut tightened.</p><p>Her lips came back to his, parted and firm. A hum of desire sounded in her throat, igniting a flurry of fireworks beneath his ribs.</p><p>Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>His focus homed in on every single detail of the moment\u2014the warmth of the sun, the growl in his throat, the luscious need building throughout his body.</p><p>He slid his tongue along the inside of her lower lip, urging her to open. He caught the hint of mint, but he needed more. He needed the taste of pure, potent Rubi.</p><p>Instead of letting him in, she pulled out of the kiss. With her gaze tilted down toward the console separating them, she licked her lips. \u201cListen...Wes...\u201d</p><p>The I\u2019m-sorry lilt in her tone flushed his brain with panic. This couldn\u2019t end. Not yet. He\u2019d been fighting her resistance for a goddamn month. Had been waiting to feel her since the first moment he\u2019d seen her. And he still hadn\u2019t tasted her.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby.\u201d He kept his voice soft, but it still sounded rough, needy. Sliding his hand beneath her hair, he cupped her neck and pressed his cheek to hers. His eyes slid closed, and he took a deep breath. She smelled exotic, like spice and sex. He wanted to sink into her. Deep into her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry...don\u2019t think... Just kiss me.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and covered her mouth with his. He wanted to devour her. Feel every inch of her. Hear more of those throaty purrs.</p><p>As if fulfilling his silent wish, she groaned. The soft sound was filled with so much desire, Wes\u2019s lust jerked against his control. Restraint snaked a fine tremor through his body.</p><p>\u201cKiss me back, baby,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cLet me taste you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d let this infatuation go on too long, and he was way the hell too far out on a limb here. He had to pull back.</p><p>Then her head tilted. Her mouth opened. And she stroked her tongue against his. Sensation filled his mouth\u2014wet, smooth, slick. The thrill slid down his body and filled his groin. He couldn\u2019t keep the growl of pleasure and relief from rolling out of his chest.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>Fucking finally.</p><p>He dove in, took greedily. Too much. Too fast. But he couldn\u2019t stop. She was sweet. And sultry. And succulent. She was everything he\u2019d ever dreamed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rubi pressed one hand against his cheek. The other curled into the shoulder of his T-shirt. And all the tension drifted from her body. She relaxed against him, bringing her deeper into the kiss. Into his mouth. The purely unique taste of Rubi flooded his senses.</p><p>Delirium.</p><p>He fisted her hair, soft, silky, thick. Pushing against the brake pedal, he lifted his upper body farther over the center console. Her lips slid across his, her tongue spiraling and teasing his in crazy sexual ways that made Wes think about how he wanted to move inside her body. He was rock-hard, his cock throbbing to the quick beat of his heart. He couldn\u2019t think. He only knew he needed her closer.</p><p>He slid his hand down her back and leaned in, wrapping her small waist with his forearm. Her body was tight, her curves perfectly placed to fit him. He lifted her until the full swells of her breasts pressed against his chest. Her fingers slid into his hair. Tingles spread over his scalp and shot down his spine, adding pressure across his hips.</p> <p>Ah God.</p><p>Wes let his hand roam down her back and over her ass cheek. Her ass felt as good as it looked, supple and taut. He squeezed the flesh then lowered his hand to the back of her thigh. When the skin of his hand met the warm skin of her thigh, Wes groaned into her mouth and pulled her closer.</p><p>This was not delirium. This was fucking euphoria.</p><p>He was about to pull her over the damn console and into his lap when she sighed into his mouth and reined in the kiss, lazily pressing her closed lips to his.</p><p>She finally broke off with a murmured, \u201cGood God...\u201d She pressed a hand to her temple. \u201cI should have known you\u2019d be a master with that mouth.\u201d</p> <p>His heart thundered. His breathing labored. She tried to ease back into her seat, but he tightened the hand at her thigh. He kissed her jaw, her neck, scraped his teeth along her throat. Pleasure vibrated beneath his lips, and the sound pounded Wes with iron fists.</p><p>\u201cAll right Golden Boy.\u201d Her voice was light, breathless. \u201cYou\u2019ve kissed me thoroughly stupid.\u201d She tugged gently at his hair. \u201cBut nothing else is happening here. Let\u2019s not get crazy.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his mouth from her skin and pressed his forehead to her shoulder, trying to clear his mind. She eased her thigh from his grasp.</p><p>Let\u2019s not get crazy.</p><p>Fuuuuuck.</p><p>He laughed at his own stupidity. Did he really think Rubi would do him right here in the convertible? On a public road? In the middle of the day?</p> <p>A man could dream.</p><p>\u201cSee me tonight.\u201d He dropped another slow kiss to her shoulder. \u201cAfter work. We can do dinner, drinks, a club... Anything you want. Just us.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. But didn\u2019t pull away. Just kept her hand deep in his hair, her fingers restlessly worrying the strands. When she finally eased back, she shook her head. \u201cNo, Wes.\u201d Her voice was deliberate but soft. A tone he\u2019d only heard her take with Lexi. \u201cI thought we understood each other.\u201d</p><p>He tried to focus on the affection in her voice, not the rejection in her words, and reached for her hand, threading their fingers. \u201cOh, we definitely understand each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve obviously pushed my teasing too far. I thought...you know...you understood it was just harmless flirting.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his grip on her hand. \u201cYou know it\u2019s more, Rubi.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, but the expression was sad. \u201cIt can\u2019t be. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to shake her and tell her to knock it off. \u201cYou did not just kiss me like a friend. Or a flirt. You kissed me like you want me.\u201d</p> <p>Guilt darkened her eyes. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubi.\u201d He didn\u2019t know why this was so important to him, but he needed to hear the words. \u201cYou want me.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers flexed beneath his. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a secret. Yes, I want you, just like the other two-dozen women on the set today. You\u2019re so damn hot, you singe my brain cells. As much time as we\u2019ve been spending together, it\u2019s a miracle I can think at all.\u201d</p><p>His frustration cooled. He released her thigh, skimmed his hand up her back, and cupped her jaw, lifting her face until her eyes met his again. Sexual intensity raged through his body like a fucking lightning strike. \u201cI want to burn out every last cell in your body, not just your brain. But I\u2019ll start there. See me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go out, we\u2019ll just stay in, and I\u2019ll get a head start on shutting down every circuit you own.\u201d</p><p>Something shifted in her eyes. Or maybe it was her expression. He didn\u2019t know what or why, only knew it signaled trouble.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you\u2019re looking for? A casual fuck?\u201d</p><p>His head jerked back, the harshness of her words, said in such a soft, sultry voice, taking him off guard. \u201cNo.\u201d He suddenly understood. \u201cI mean, of course I want sex, but I want this too. Us. Together. I want...all of you.\u201d</p><p>Her expression closed up. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Which is why the answer is no. We\u2019ve talked about this, Wes. One kiss isn\u2019t going to change the way I operate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t one,\u201d was the first idiotic thing to come out of his mouth. \u201cAnd it does change us.\u201d His brain clicked back on and darted to her earlier words. \u201cWait. Would you see me tonight if I\u2019d said that\u2019s all I wanted? Sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d She looked out the windshield and combed both hands through her hair, taming the wild strands. \u201cBut I would have had to think about it longer.\u201d</p><p>Wes stared at her like an idiot. What the hell did he say to that?</p><p>\u201cWe should get to the restaurant.\u201d She pulled her purse back into her lap.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not getting anywhere.\u201d Judging by the way Rubi\u2019s shoulders crawled toward her ears, he needed to soften his voice. \u201cWhat. The. Fuck?\u201d</p><p>She turned toward him, her gaze direct. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good between us. A lot. And your friendship means everything to me. More than you can understand. I don\u2019t want to screw that up.\u201d</p><p>Friendship.</p><p>The deathblow.</p><p>\u201cI hear you, Rubi. But I\u2019m not listening.\u201d He kept his voice level and low. He wanted his determination to reach her. \u201cBecause I know it\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to argue. Wes pressed his index finger against the supple swell of her lips and kept his eyes there. \u201cAnd I know you want more than friendship with me. I see it every time you look at me. And I sure as hell felt it in that kiss.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her head back with an expression that Wes knew usually preceded a battle. Before she started an argument, he sat back and turned the engine over. \u201cBut, I\u2019m giving you a break since\u201d\u2014he cast her a sidelong grin\u2014\u201cI did just kiss you stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes Lawson, you piece of\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gave her a talk-to-the-hand gesture and glanced in his side mirror before pulling back out onto the road. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything you\u2019ll regret, precious.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>The way Wes pushed her Aston to its limits on the second half of their drive helped her bank her frustration, but guilt and confusion continued to gnaw at her belly. By the time they\u2019d reached the restaurant, a familiar dark hollowness had settled in. The emptiness was intensified by the fun, the high, the connection they\u2019d shared on the first half of the trip...and then lost.</p><p>Which symbolized her greatest fear\u2014acting on their attraction and losing what they had.</p><p>She should have just kept her mouth shut and played the whole thing off as nothing. But that toe-curling kiss had really screwed with her mind. She\u2019d kissed more than her share of men, but Wes\u2019s kiss... Wes\u2019s kiss had been real. Filled with real emotion. Real passion. Wes\u2019s kiss had touched Rubi deep in her body\u2014in a place that had nothing to do with sex.</p><p>And that scared the shit out of her. Because she was fucking defective.</p><p>Wes pulled to a stop along the curb in front of the Crossroads restaurant. He clicked his seat belt free, gripped the top of the windshield, and used the frame to pull himself up. Rubi would have to be dead not to notice the roll of all that muscle in his arms and shoulders. Or the way his T-shirt rode up and showed a few inches of that washboard belly.</p><p>He twisted toward the patio, where Jax and Lexi sat at a table, holding hands and Rachel turned her glass of water in circles.</p><p>\u201cChamberlin,\u201d Wes called, his demeanor jovial and light, as if nothing had happened between the set and the restaurant. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta drive this thing.\u201d</p><p>He hopped over the side of the car and strode around to open the passenger\u2019s door. Maybe she was making too much out of this. After all, it was just a kiss. But then he curved his arm low around her waist and guided her into the restaurant, and she knew their unspoken hands-off policy between friends had been broken for good.</p><p>At the table, Wes released her only to pull out her chair. His chivalry was nothing new; he was always a gentleman, to both friends and strangers alike. But there was a new air of determined ownership about him that both excited and unnerved her.</p><p>Rubi met Lexi\u2019s and Rachel\u2019s suspicious gazes as Wes tucked her next to the table before sitting beside her. As if the two women had planned it ahead of time, they both cast curious glances at Wes, then back to Rubi, brows raised. Rubi returned a don\u2019t-start glare to each before picking up a menu and staring at it without reading.</p><p>She worried the inside of her lip, her mind bouncing all over the freaking place. She suddenly felt as helpless to control Wes\u2019s feelings as she did his driving.</p><p>Rubi scanned the table and the half-filled patio beyond. Half-finished iced teas sat in front of Lexi and Jax where she leaned into his body, looking blissfully content in the circle of his arm. Which only made Rubi feel even more freakishly abnormal. She returned her gaze to the menu with a sigh.</p><p>In her peripheral vision, Rubi saw the waiter approach. Wes ordered a beer.</p><p>She redirected her gaze from the menu to his face. \u201cAre you driving again after lunch? You probably shouldn\u2019t drink.\u201d</p><p>The look that heated his eyes shot butterflies into Rubi\u2019s stomach. He reached out and gripped the back of her neck in an affectionate squeeze. A warm, sexy smile lifted his mouth in that lopsided way that made her desire burn hotter. \u201cNo more driving for me today. And no more worrying for you, as adorable as it is.\u201d</p><p>She did worry about him, dammit. She didn\u2019t look at the waiter when she said, \u201cCosmo, please.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s hand slid off her neck, leaving it cold...and empty.</p><p>\u201cMoving away from your Sexy Bitch?\u201d The waiter\u2019s familiar voice held an edge of humor, and Rubi immediately knew who was serving them. She reserved a certain drink for each club she visited\u2014one of her quirky compulsions.</p><p>A sense of equilibrium crept in. She pulled off her sunglasses and smiled up at the head bartender of Stilettos, a club she hit when she was feeling particularly unsettled...or, okay, desperate...and needed something quick and dirty.</p><p>She stood and gave Rom\u00e9o a hug. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>His black hair was still long, his lip and eyebrow piercings subdued with simple silver studs. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you for a while. You look...\u201d\u2014his dark eyes darted to Wes, then back to Rubi, and his smile turned sly\u2014\u201ctousled.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She ignored the innuendo. \u201cWhy are you working here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPicking up some hours.

But she did know all about financial struggle through Lexi, so she nodded.</p><p>She introduced everyone around the table. The men shook hands.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m on at Stilettos tonight,\u201d Rom\u00e9o said to Rubi. \u201cA lot of people have been asking about you.

She lowered to her seat, her gaze searching out Lexi\u2019s, and Rubi found her friend already staring at her with the same alarm in her eyes that danced in Rubi\u2019s gut. But then...this might be a good thing. A way to illustrate to Wes that she wasn\u2019t really what he thought or what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cStilettos?\u201d Rachel said. \u201cReally? Isn\u2019t that a sex club?\u201d</p><p>Rom\u00e9o seemed to find this amusing, his grin growing. He shrugged, as if that didn\u2019t fully describe the club\u2014which it didn\u2019t. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s known for, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Rubi said. Couldn\u2019t hurt to get rid of some of this pent-up frustration. \u201cI\u2019ll stop by.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel gasped and reached across the table to cover Rubi\u2019s hand. \u201cCan I come? You can pretend you don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>Rubi laughed. \u201cYou? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, me,\u201d she said, sitting back with a scandalous little smirk. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m not as innocent as I may look\u2014a little like Wes, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStick close to Rubi if it\u2019s your first time there,\u201d Rom\u00e9o said. \u201cOnce you learn the ropes\u2014so to speak\u2014you\u2019ll be fine. And a hit. You may not be as innocent as you look, but that makes what you\u2019ve got going extra hot.\u201d He glanced around the table casually, as if this were a normal conversation. \u201cDo you know what you want, or do you all need a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Rubi said.</p><p>When Rom\u00e9o moved on to another table, Rubi forced her gaze to stay on the menu. Her stomach burned with discomfort. She didn\u2019t need to see Wes\u2019s face to know his outward ease had vanished. Tension radiated off him like electromagnetic waves.</p> <p>\u201cRubi?\u201d Lexi\u2019s voice pulled her distant gaze from the menu. Rom\u00e9o was back, setting down her cosmo. Jesus, how long had she been lost in her own head? \u201cDo you know what you want?\u201d</p><p>A new freaking brain. One without these hang-ups.</p><p>Rubi smiled at Rom\u00e9o. \u201cSalad.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cHoney, we\u2019ve got twelve different salads.\u201d</p><p>Crap. She scanned quickly and found one with candied pecans. When he turned away with their orders, Rubi picked up her cosmo and had to force herself not to down it in one gulp.</p><p>\u201cYou hang out at a sex club?\u201d Wes asked, his voice deep...and irritated.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s throat tightened around her drink, and she had to force herself to swallow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a sex club in the back,\u201d Lexi was quick to point out. She turned that angelic smile on Wes. \u201cI\u2019ve been there. Out front, it\u2019s just like a regular club. You know, a bar, dance floor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been to Stilettos?\u201d Jax asked, a strange smile on his face as he looked down at Lexi. Her pale cheeks burst into color.</p><p>\u201cI took her,\u201d Rubi said, clearing her throat when her voice emerged raspy. \u201cA tease, really. She\u2019d promised me a thank-you drink for recovering one of her crashed programs, and I took her to Stilettos. She didn\u2019t know what kind of club it was.\u201d Rubi took another sip of her drink and raised one shoulder. \u201cThat was the same night you broke out of your comfort zone and met Jax. Remember? Not all bad, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t stay in the front at Stilettos,\u201d Wes said, his voice filled with accusation. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Jax said, voice a low undertone. \u201cNot the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLighten up,\u201d Rachel added. \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk, Mr. Speed Demon. Like you don\u2019t do anything crazy on a daily basis.\u201d</p><p>Wes ignored them, his expectant gaze locked on Rubi\u2019s face.</p><p>A combination of frustration, regret, and anger swirled in her gut. She paused before answering, just an extra second to get her emotions under control. The more she showed, the more he\u2019d think she cared. And that would not help the situation.</p><p>She twirled the liquid in her glass, took a breath, and forced her gaze to meet his. His eyes were as dark as she\u2019d expected, the color of an impending storm ready to break. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask me what you really want to know, Wes?\u201d When his jaw tightened without answering, she asked what he wouldn\u2019t. \u201cDo I have sex with strangers at the club?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened beneath a hooded brow of anger.</p><p>She smiled, trying to act like his judgment didn\u2019t hurt, but she was pretty sure she\u2019d only managed a smirk. \u201cNot that it\u2019s your business, but, no, Wes. I don\u2019t have sex at Stilettos.\u201d</p><p>His expression remained a cross between anger and disbelief. Rubi tipped her drink back and finished it off.</p><p>Wes\u2019s cell rang. He scrambled to pull it from his pocket and glanced down at the display. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s my mom.\u201d And pushed back from the table, answering with a soft, \u201cHey, Mama.\u201d</p><p>His tone, so filled with concern and love, squeezed a strange pleasure-filled pain into Rubi\u2019s chest, but she set it aside as she watched him wander to the edge of the patio. \u201cIs he moody today, or is that my imagination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tense,\u201d Jax said. \u201cHis brother just had surgery.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s gaze darted back to Jax, but she didn\u2019t really see him. Too many thoughts were jumping around her brain. Why hadn\u2019t he told her? Was that the basis of this strange behavior? Her mind darted to the contraption they\u2019d been messing with in the trailer, one she\u2019d thought was a harness.</p><p>Before she could ask any questions, Wes returned.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Jax asked.</p><p>\u201cShe says the surgery went well.\u201d He looked relieved, sounded calm. Seemed the edge was off his mood. \u201cThe surgeon said they got most of the scar tissue and that in a few weeks his mobility should improve a lot.\u201d</p><p>Jax grinned and reached across the table to meet Wes\u2019s fist in a bump. \u201cGreat news, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of surgery?\u201d Rubi asked. She couldn\u2019t deny she was hurt that Jax, Lexi, and Rachel knew all about it, but she didn\u2019t. She spent almost as much time with him as they did.</p><p>\u201cSpine,\u201d was all he said before Rom\u00e9o came with their lunches. Once they\u2019d all been served, Wes took the side of ranch dressing from his plate and set it next to Rubi\u2019s salad. Then put a few fries on the rim of her salad bowl.</p><p>He grabbed another fry, popped it in his mouth, and chewed before saying, \u201cHe\u2019s a Marine. He was on his third tour in Afghanistan when an IED exploded inside a building where his unit was doing recon and lodged a shitload of shrapnel in his spine. Today was his second surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she said softly, absently picking the candied pecans from the top of her salad and collecting them in her palm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Wes acknowledged the utterly inadequate reply with a nod and took another pull on his beer, but hell, what did you say to news like that? Stress of that kind could completely explain Wes\u2019s rash behavior. He\u2019d mentioned his parents in passing, but never siblings. Granted, given their table had a three-out-of-five family-failure rate, it wasn\u2019t a big topic of conversation when they were together.</p><p>\u201cYounger or older brother?\u201d she asked as she set the nuts on a corner of Wes\u2019s plate, then picked up a fry, dipped it in the ranch, and bit it in half.</p><p>\u201cOlder,\u201d he said, ignoring his burger and using one fry to move around the others, but not really eating. \u201cBy four years. He\u2019s married with two little girls.\u201d</p><p>Nieces. The thought made Rubi smile. Her view of Wes settled into place. He had a family that loved each other, worried about each other. He called his mother Mama and talked to her in a voice filled with warmth. Yes, this was Wes. She might lust after the golden Adonis in her fantasies, but this was the Wes she\u2019d come to truly adore over the last two months.</p><p>\u201cSo that thing you were working on this morning was for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He tossed a pecan into his mouth. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to support him. He\u2019s my height, but he\u2019s a big guy, maybe thirty more pounds than me. And he\u2019s not going to have any strength for a while. He\u2019ll be like dead weight until he heals and rebuilds muscle.\u201d</p><p>Wes looked at Jax. \u201cMy dad is the only one in my family who\u2019s strong enough to help him walk, and he\u2019s in the middle of harvest. I know this is a bad time with the film, but I may need to go back every couple of weeks to help out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you need to do, man,\u201d Jax said. \u201cFamily comes first. We\u2019ll make do.\u201d</p><p>He released a relieved breath. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any way to make it stronger?\u201d he asked Jax.</p><p>Jax wiped his mouth after taking a bite of his burger. \u201cCan he stand on his own?\u201d</p><p>Wes nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s moving his legs he can\u2019t manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStronger metal on the thighs?\u201d Lexi asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Rachel nodded at Lexi, then Jax. \u201cMaybe a double design, more like those harnesses you use for falling and climbing where the straps go all the way around the leg?\u201d</p><p>Jax shook his head and took a drink of his iced tea. \u201cToo much chance of hurting him if he falls.\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded and poked at her own lunch, deep in thought. Rubi recalled the apparatus as she forked up blueberries and the others continued to drum up ideas for strengthening the design. She wasn\u2019t much good with machinery, but...</p><p>\u201cRubi,\u201d Lexi said drawing her attention. \u201cDidn\u2019t you do some work for a tech lab?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, thinking back to the robots and prosthetics she\u2019d helped program, trying to fit that into this scenario.</p><p>Lexi glanced at Wes, then back at Rubi, a glint of suspicion in her bright blue eyes. \u201cWhy are you so quiet?\u201d</p><p>She lifted a shoulder and feigned rapt attention in collecting as many blueberries as possible on her fork tines. \u201cJust listening. Thinking.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s lips curled on one side, and he glanced at her with a mixed look in his eyes she couldn\u2019t quite read. \u201cI kissed her stupid.\u201d Wes\u2019s low voice burned a path down the center of her chest. \u201cOr so she said.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s fork hit her plate, her brown eyes flying wide.</p><p>Rubi stiffened and cut him a look. \u201cWes, that\u2019s no one\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust answering the question.\u201d He ate another fry. \u201cSo what do you have up your sleeve, Rubi? Any ideas?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her fork and stared at the tines, thinking\u2014and avoiding the others\u2019 expressions at the news. \u201cYou could make the hinges at the hip stronger. Or...maybe add hinges at the knee and make them all stronger. I imagine the rig would have to handle more of his weight until his muscles strengthen, then less when he doesn\u2019t need as much leverage to move them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jax\u2019s hand paused with a cucumber slice halfway to his mouth. He and Wes exchanged a look Rubi recognized\u2014ideas were turning in their brains.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Wes said.</p><p>She met his gaze and found him fully attentive, intensely focused on her. \u201cI don\u2019t really know anything about medicine or mechanics, but the round things at the hip on the rig, those are the hinges, right? They have some type of mechanism inside that makes them pivot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do. A spring mechanism.\u201d</p> <p>Her mind focused on physics and function, much easier on her churning guts. \u201cThat would produce a movement equal to the pressure applied to the spring. To support a heavy weight, you\u2019d need heavy springs, which would need a certain amount of strength to operate. Strength your brother may not have initially.\u201d She tilted her head and rested her chin in her hand, gazing at a spot over his shoulder. \u201cYou might get better control with electromagnetic conductors.\u201d</p><p>He sat back, brow furrowed. And, oh crap, that expression was so freaking adorable she lost her train of thought.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think of that,\u201d he said, absently moving around his fries again. He still hadn\u2019t touched his burger, despite his earlier comment about being starved. \u201cI\u2019d have to get up to speed on the new EM products out there. Probably pretty easy to relay them with the electric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElectric?\u201d She lifted her brows. \u201cYou have that thing wired?\u201d</p><p>His gaze returned to hers. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s got a battery pack at the control center that sits at the base of the spine with an AC outlet for charging. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause with electrical capacity, you\u2019re talking almost limitless potential for the mechanism. You can put a computer chip between the relay and the device and make it sing Sinatra if you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s lips parted. His eyes filled with excitement. Then he hit an invisible wall, and his face fell. \u201cThat programming... That\u2019s some special shit, right?\u201d</p><p>Rubi suddenly realized what she\u2019d just walked herself into\u2014more entanglement with Wes. Yes, she could program this device for him, but she was already working on two other projects\u2014the NSA app and these new stunt apps for Jax. Not that she couldn\u2019t take on another; she often juggled several at once, but...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a specialty,\u201d she hedged, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s all that special.\u201d</p><p>Jax\u2019s cell rang, drawing Wes\u2019s attention and giving Rubi a millisecond of relief. She didn\u2019t want to tell him she couldn\u2019t do it, but hell, she really didn\u2019t need to be spending night and day with him\u2014not with his mind so set on starting something with her.</p><p>Rubi glanced at Lexi and found her friend studying her with a confused, suspicious look. They both knew Rubi could program the hell out of a freaking caterpillar if asked, and she could tell Lexi was wondering why she didn\u2019t offer up her services\u2014like she did for everything else. For now, Lexi was leaving it alone. Rubi had no doubt she\u2019d get a grilling later.</p> <p>When Jax disconnected from the call, he looked at Wes. \u201cBad news, bud. You\u2019ve got Bolton babysitting duty tonight.\u201d</p><p>Rubi winced. The costar of the film, Jason Bolton, was the actor Wes was doubling in the movie. He was also notorious for carousing, drinking, and starting fights. Because Wes coached Bolton on his part in the stunts, he and Wes had built a rapport. And the production company wanted to protect their investment in Bolton by having Wes go out with him as an unofficial keeper.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wes whined, dropping back in his chair. \u201cThat guy goes out more than anyone I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered to do it myself,\u201d Jax said, \u201cbut Bolton responds better to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat guy is a liver transplant waiting to happen,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cFucking Bolton,\u201d Wes grumbled. \u201cRemind me not to ever double the asshole again. Last week he nearly got me killed. If I\u2019m going to die, it\u2019s going to be on a bike, not from some jerk starting a bar brawl.\u201d</p><p>The whole topic of dying on a bike after what she\u2019d nearly witnessed today hit Rubi wrong. She needed some space.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get going, guys.\u201d She pulled her purse from the chair and bills from her wallet. \u201cI\u2019m behind on my mind-numbingly scintillating NSA project.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even eaten,\u201d Wes said. \u201cAnd you have to drive me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Jax will get you where you\u2019re going and finish my lunch.\u201d She stood and held out her hand. \u201cKeys, handsome.\u201d</p><p>He pushed to his feet and slid his hand into his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll give them to you at the car. That way you have to let me walk you.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hand and looked at Lexi. \u201cWe\u2019re still on tonight?\u201d</p><p>Lexi pursed her lips. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re kinda tight on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t break for an hour or two, my brain will fry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you can do it. If not, tomorrow\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me? And the club?\u201d Rachel asked, a beaming grin on her face. She really was adorable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>As Rubi and Wes started through the restaurant to the exit, he pressed his big, warm hand to her lower back. His fingers touched the skin exposed beneath the hem, and Rubi felt as if she\u2019d been shocked with a live wire.</p><p>As soon as they stepped out the front door, Wes slipped his arm fully around her waist and pulled her in the opposite direction from her car.</p><p>Her heart kicked. \u201cWes\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sidestepped into an alley bordering Crossroads and pushed her against a wall, then leaned his body into hers. All that warm muscle pressed into her, clouding her mind. Banked desire swelled in a hot wave and her entire body tingled to life. She barely managed to keep her hands pressed against his chest instead of wrapping them around his neck to pull his head down. Barely kept herself from sliding his zipper down and hiking a thigh to his hip, opening just enough to take him inside her body.</p><p>\u201cWes, come on.\u201d She sounded as breathless as she felt.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t go to Stilettos for sex, why do you go? There are hundreds of clubs in LA, Rubi. Why Stilettos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>He bent his head and kissed her. This wasn\u2019t anything like the sweet start he\u2019d used in the car. His mouth was heavy and hot. His lips demanded she respond. She shouldn\u2019t. She knew she shouldn\u2019t. But her mouth just...did.</p><p>Damn, but she loved the way he kissed. Every slid of his lips, every stroke of his tongue smooth and confident and lust-filled. Just the right pressure, depth and tilt. Just the right mix of sensual and sinful. She could easily spend hours kissing this man.</p><p>Which was why she pushed against his chest and pulled her head back. \u201cDon\u2019t start that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you go to Stilettos, Rubi?\u201d</p><p>She heaved a breath and blurted out the truth, \u201cBecause it\u2019s easy to pick men up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, it\u2019s easy for you to pick up men anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the kind who only want what I want.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cSex.\u201d</p><p>A lead fist sat in the middle of her chest. She didn\u2019t respond. She didn\u2019t have to. They both knew he was right. He eased one thigh deeper between her legs until the thick muscle pressed her sex and his heat tore through his jeans. The rigid line of his cock rode her hip, making her throat dry. Completely against her will, her eyes closed on an exhale of pleasure. Want tightened a strap around her chest. Need stretched a fiery rope from her shoulders through her hips.</p><p>Wes\u2019s growl brought her eyes open. His face was taut, his jaw jumping, his eyes fiery with lust. She desperately wanted to look into his face with this wicked expression as he fucked her. Drove deep and hard. Hammered her until she shattered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go pick up a stranger for a one-night hookup,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you won\u2019t say yes to me?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think, caught between needing to push back and needing to sink in. \u201cYou aren\u2019t interested in one night. And I\u2019m not interested in more. Can\u2019t you see the problems that would cause?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but he was thinking. The determination and cunning was back in his eyes. \u201cSo why hasn\u2019t the waiter seen you in a while? How long has it been since you were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she snapped, irritated. Turned on. Frustrated. \u201cI don\u2019t keep it on my calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week? Two?\u201d He pressed his thigh higher and rocked against her. Currents of pleasure shot from her sex to her chest and expanded in hot pressure. Rubi fisted his T-shirt. \u201cA month? More? How long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore...I think. I don\u2019t know.\u201d She was using all her concentration not to rock against the thickly muscled thigh between her legs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how long it\u2019s been. I\u2019ve been busy. And I don\u2019t need it. I haven\u2019t wanted it.\u201d</p><p>A knowing hot look crept into his eyes just before he moved his thigh. His heat and pressure rubbed her clit in a long, slow rocking slide. Fire leapt through her sex, across hips and climbed into her lower belly. She clutched his shirt tighter. \u201cWes...\u201d</p><p>His name came as more of a plea than a warning and Rubi\u2019s eyes closed as she bit her lip against a moan.</p><p>\u201cI think you both need it and want it,\u201d he murmured, his lips close to her ear. \u201cBut I think you need it and want it with me. And I\u2019m not at the club. I\u2019m hanging with Lexi and Jax, so that\u2019s where you are.\u201d</p><p>She huffed a disgusted sound. \u201cThe arrogance is not attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not arrogance. It\u2019s obvious. And ridiculous to risk yourself with strangers when I\u2019m right here. Ready, willing, and plenty able.\u201d He pulled his head back and looked into her eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s make an arrangement so you can get on with your day. If you need or want sex, you come to me.\u201d</p><p>She pulled in a breath. \u201cDream on, Lawson. You are not\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lowered her head and pulled her bottom lip between his. His tongue slipped over the flesh before he let go and murmured, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll give it to you any way you want it, any way you need it.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and gazed up at him. His skin was pulled tight in a serious expression, his eyes shadowed with lust. A delicious shiver traveled over her shoulders, into her chest, and tightened her nipples. She rarely appreciated men telling her what to do. Even in bed, she was generally the aggressor. She maintained control that way. And she could definitely see how control was slipping from her now, which was a very dangerous thing, because she knew this man.</p><p>His success hadn\u2019t been a whim. He was relentlessly driven. Intelligent. Clever. Even a little devious. A perfectionist when it came to his work. And, according to Jax, all his girlfriends had been solid, monogamous, serious relationships. She knew what he wanted, and she knew what he\u2019d do to reach his goals.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes and considered him, trying to pretend he wasn\u2019t pushing her far too close to climax in an alley with nothing but the pressure of his thigh. \u201cYou want a sex-only arrangement? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A shadow of doubt passed through his eyes. She hardened her shell before opening herself up to his judgment and rejection. She didn\u2019t see any other way at the moment.</p><p>\u201cBecause they get far less of me than you have now,\u201d she said. \u201cThey get one round of mindless sex. Nothing more. We aren\u2019t friends. We don\u2019t talk. We don\u2019t hang out. We don\u2019t do things for each other. We rarely even meet again unless it\u2019s at a club in passing. And I don\u2019t sleep with them again.\u201d She paused, reading the gradual decline of his expression. \u201cIs that really what you want, Wes?\u201d</p><p>The pressure of his body eased. And when his thigh pulled from between hers, she was left cold and frustrated, her sex throbbing. He stepped back, leaving Rubi\u2019s stomach churning uncomfortably with mingled disappointment and relief. Her body aching with unfulfilled need.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t let her go. He kept one arm wrapped tightly around her waist; the other held her jaw.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d was all he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s all I can give without hurting someone. And I really, really hate hurting people.\u201d</p><p>His gaze searched hers, and Rubi was struck again by just how handsome he was. She understood why he was often solicited to act instead of perform stunts. Those mysterious eyes, that wickedly seductive grin, the square jaw were movie-star quality. And he\u2019d learned enough from Jax to take on a bit part\u2014but only when a stunt called for it. Because Wes was a simple country boy at heart. Money didn\u2019t tempt him. He saw fame as a burden. He just wanted to have fun. Which was why they got along so well\u2014when things weren\u2019t serious.</p><p>A deep wave of affection washed through Rubi, pulling emotions to the surface. He was such a good man, and she was so damn crazy about him.</p><p>Which was why she wouldn\u2019t let either of them ruin that with sex.</p> <p>Five</p><p>The throbbing beat of \u201cLet\u2019s Get Loud\u201d by Jennifer Lopez thumped through the club, into the floor, up the legs of Wes\u2019s stool, and straight through his balls. And he didn\u2019t need anything jostling that area. His entire package already felt like stuffed sausage.</p><p>As soon as he had cut Bolton off and thrown him in bed, a drunken mess, Wes had come to Stilettos. And discovered the club wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected. The lighting was low and dramatic. The seating areas intimate, but not exclusive, with a high-quality look and feel.</p><p>Three different bars dotted the club. At the largest, positioned at the center of a seating area to the left of the massive dance floor, a big biker-looking dude slid his hand down the open back of Rubi\u2019s... Well, he guessed he should call it a dress. In reality, it was more like a sheath of black lace, fitted to every curve of her heavenly body, with a few sparkles covering the most private of her private areas. A few inches of sleek fringe bounced at the hem when she moved, the strands barely covering her ass cheeks.</p><p>The simple sight of her made so much heat and need build inside him, Wes couldn\u2019t stop shifting in his chair.</p><p>He\u2019d come here with one purpose\u2014to watch Rubi pick up another guy, sure it would turn his mind around, allowing him to let go of this ridiculous fantasy he\u2019d been clinging to for months.</p> <p>But she\u2019d been flirting with Biker Dude for a good thirty minutes, and nothing had happened. Other than Wes dreaming up ways to break every finger on the biker\u2019s hand, which was currently drifting toward Rubi\u2019s ass\u2014an ass Wes had been holding just hours ago.</p><p>She shifted out of his reach before he grabbed one perfect cheek.</p><p>Wes exhaled and rubbed his face. What the fuck was she doing? If she wasn\u2019t going to pick up someone for sex, why had she come?</p><p>\u201cLooks like your date got hung up.\u201d Andrea stopped beside his table, her full, painted mouth lifting in a seductive smile, dark eyes heavy-lidded.</p><p>The blonde had been coming on to him since he\u2019d walked in. He\u2019d given her the I\u2019m-waiting-for-someone spiel, and she\u2019d come around every fifteen minutes to check on his status. And, man, she had a body on her. Not Rubi\u2019s body, but, hell, no one had Rubi\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cLooks like,\u201d he said, averting his gaze toward Rubi again.</p><p>At least she\u2019d been off the dance floor for a little while. Watching her move, those sparkles shifting over her sleek body, the fringe flashing her perfect ass cheeks, had been pure torture.</p><p>Andrea leaned against his table. Her scent, something heavy and exotic, hung on the air. \u201cI might be able to arrange a threesome with her.\u201d</p> <p>A spear of shock pierced his chest, and Wes\u2019s gaze arced toward the blonde. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubi. That\u2019s who you\u2019ve been watching since you got here.\u201d</p><p>He had not just heard right. \u201cA threesome?\u201d</p><p>Andrea lifted one shoulder in a negligent shrug. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem too interested in the guys hitting on her tonight. You\u2019re not her type, but you never know.\u201d</p><p>Images of Rubi, Andrea and him in a threesome flashed in his head\u2014both women pleasuring Wes, Wes and Andrea pleasuring Rubi, Rubi and Wes pleasuring Andrea.</p><p>Fuck, yeah, a couple of those scenarios titillated Wes, but not near enough to give up exclusivity with Rubi. Threesomes just didn\u2019t interest him when they included having to share Rubi. And the thought of Rubi in a threesome without Wes made him want to choke somebody. But better he know now than later.</p><p>He finished off his beer and cleared his throat. \u201cIs that what she\u2019s into?\u201d</p><p>Andrea\u2019s lips twisted in consideration. \u201cRubi\u2019s pretty much an anything-goes girl.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the nasty fantasies popping to mind. Positions. Toys. A little light bondage... \u201cHave you...\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe he was going to ask this. \u201cYou know, been with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThen how do you know all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObservation. Chatter. Shit gets around.\u201d</p><p>Wes rubbed a hand over his mouth and leaned into his elbows resting on the table. \u201cSo if I\u2019m not her type, who is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s always hooking up with guys who are trashier, harder, colder. She\u2019s never interested in winners like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just met me. Why would you think I\u2019m any different?\u201d</p><p>A slow grin lit Andrea\u2019s face and turned her into a real person. And she was beautiful. But not at all what Wes wanted. \u201cHandsome, it\u2019s written all over you from the top of that great haircut to the hem of those upscale dress slacks. I\u2019d love to see your dirtier side if you\u2019ve got one.\u201d</p><p>Wes slid his gaze back to Rubi. She\u2019d finally extracted herself from the biker, her gaze now roaming the crowd.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s free,\u201d Andrea said, following his gaze. \u201cMaybe her tastes have changed. Wanna give it a shot?\u201d</p><p>A fist of discomfort had lodged beneath his sternum, and he couldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Andrea said, \u201cif the only way I\u2019m going to get you tonight is to share, so be it.\u201d</p><p>Ooooh. Kaaaay.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, shifting on the stool to ease the unbearable ache in his cock, \u201cbut I\u2019m gonna pass. I\u2019ve got an early morning.\u201d</p><p>The blonde shrugged and wandered away in search of another fuck buddy. \u201cLet\u2019s Get Loud\u201d faded into \u201cPump It\u201d by the Black Eyed Peas as Rubi set a leisurely pace toward the corner bar. She paused to chat with Rachel, who was on the dance floor with some wiry kid. Rachel had surprised the shit out of Wes when she\u2019d showed interest in coming here, but Lexi was right, the main area of the club was just a regular club\u2014drinking, dancing, socializing\u2014though the socializing here was far friendlier and bolder than the socializing he\u2019d seen at any other club.</p><p>But now that Rubi had gone through the night without going home with anyone, Wes was thrown right back into the dilemma he\u2019d come with\u2014wanting a woman who, despite wanting him as well, wouldn\u2019t cross that friendship boundary.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>Wes stood. Time to make his move on plan B\u2014a plan he hadn\u2019t expected to get a shot at tonight.</p><p>She slid into an empty space at the bar and crossed her arms, smiling at the bartender\u2014the same dude from the Crossroads earlier in the day. They chatted as he made and served drinks. A man beside Rubi said something that made her cast a glance his way and shake her head.</p><p>Wes drew close and hovered, waiting for Rom\u00e9o to serve the man beside Rubi, hoping he\u2019d grab and go. Within thirty seconds, the space opened. Wes planted his hand on the bar, then stepped in when the other man cleared the area, standing at an angle to Rubi, partially behind her, partially beside her.</p><p>Her scent immediately filled his head. He bent and drew a deep breath of the perfume\u2014something a little different from what she usually wore. A floral base with something rich and seductive and wholly feminine layered on top. A scent that clearly screamed\u2014smoking hot seduction right here.</p><p>\u201cIf that is anyone but Wes Lawson breathing my air,\u201d she said without turning to look at him, \u201cthere\u2019s going to be trouble.\u201d</p><p>He took a half step closer, letting the front of his body brush the back of hers, and dipped his head to kiss her temple. \u201cNormally, I like a fair amount of trouble, but I just came from my share, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the last place I ever thought you\u2019d show up.\u201d She turned her head but kept her gaze lowered toward the bar, a quirk to her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re a little far from your comfort zone, Mr. Lawson. Have you ventured into the back yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really know what my comfort zone is, Ms. Russo.\u201d And he was beginning to realize he didn\u2019t either. Rubi had slowly opened a new world of exciting possibilities for him. \u201cWant to show me the way to the back?\u201d</p><p>Her lips tilted into a full smile, and the way she kept her gaze down, her long lashes hiding the beautiful green sparkle, was incredibly alluring. \u201cMight want to rethink that. There are bad things back there. Scary things,\u201d she said with a teasing dark tone. \u201cWhips, chains, restraints...naked women.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close. \u201cI happen to be quite talented with all said equipment. My experience may lie in their appropriate uses, but I\u2019m a pretty creative guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are.\u201d She finally lifted her stunning eyes to his face. \u201cBut, if you\u2019re interested in learning their illicit uses, you\u2019ll have to find another woman to haul your fine ass into the back. That\u2019s not my scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he ran his fingertips along her waist. \u201cNot even a little bondage so a man could explore your body unhindered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she laughed the word, \u201cyou bad boy.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d like to be really, really bad, in a really, really good way\u2014something no woman he\u2019d ever been with had been interested in or comfortable with. He leaned his forehead against her temple. \u201cI hear a \u2018yes\u2019 in your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hearing what you want to hear,\u201d she said, shooting him a serious sidelong look. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to find another woman to be bad with tonight.\u201d</p><p>Movement caught his eye, and he lifted his head. The bartender extended his hand. \u201cRom\u00e9o. We met\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAt lunch,\u201d Wes finished and shook the guy\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d Rom\u00e9o asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo J\u00e4ger Bombs,\u201d Wes said.</p><p>Rom\u00e9o nodded and turned toward the bottles lining the mirrored wall.</p><p>Wes lowered his gaze to Rubi\u2019s again. Held it a moment. \u201cHave you fucked him?\u201d</p><p>Her brows flicked together. \u201cWho? Rom\u00e9o?\u201d She laughed, the sound light, as if the thought were ludicrous. \u201cNo. We\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Friends or sex. Not both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my motto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about threesomes?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs that your scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said. Someone propositioned me, said she\u2019d hit you up for a threesome if I was interested.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, shock and dismay in her expression. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blonde named Andrea.\u201d</p><p>Rubi shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know her, so she can\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s not why you come here? So you can fuck outside the box?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the sound bubbling with both humor and shock. \u201cYou do have a special way with words. I already told you why I come here.\u201d Her eyes narrowed in speculation. \u201cThe question is...why are you here? Testing your boundaries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m testing yours.\u201d Wes eased to the stool beside her and looked directly into her eyes. \u201cHaven\u2019t decided on a guy to take home yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I can guarantee it won\u2019t be you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her feistiness. \u201cI don\u2019t remember asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9. Why aren\u2019t you still with Bolton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the man is a lush and can\u2019t hold his liquor. I dumped him home an hour ago, after he started another brawl at Shooters. Busted up the place pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you keep him out of jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI paid for damages and bribed the manager.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my sweet country boy. Taking care of everyone. Making things right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mama would disagree. She\u2019d tell you I was trouble from the day I was born.\u201d He shifted on his stool, moving closer to Rubi. \u201cAnd since I know you love trouble as much as I do, I have a proposition for you.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose in question.</p><p>\u201cYou and me. Friends with benefits.\u201d He lifted his hand in a stop gesture. \u201cBut...benefits do not include threesomes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot into multiple partners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had a problem sharing my toys.\u201d</p><p>She broke out into laughter.</p><p>The sight and sound filled his chest with carbonation. \u201cI think that\u2019s a yes.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and made a derogatory sound in her throat. \u201cThat proposition sounds dubious at best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it sounds like someone might be chicken.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze transitioned into a glare. \u201cI hate the way you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can never turn down a challenge. It\u2019s your greatest weakness. I love that about you.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward him and rested her elbow on the bar. \u201cLawson, have you even had a one-night hookup\u2014ever? In your entire life?\u201d</p><p>A lick of embarrassment heated his face. Stupid, yeah, but real. \u201cWhat difference does that make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it makes a lot of difference considering you\u2019re trying to start nothing but a series of one-night hookups with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends with benefits is not a series of one-night hookup. There is no series in one-night hookup, Russo. Hence the title: One-night hookup.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth quirked, and she shook her head.</p><p>Rom\u00e9o set their drinks down and Wes handed him a twenty. He picked up the shots and offered one to Rubi. Then lifted his high. \u201cTo...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d Rubi said with a purposeful look in her eye.</p><p>\u201cWith benefits.\u201d Wes clinked their glasses and tilted his head back, downing the mixture of J\u00e4germeister and Red Bull.</p><p>When Rubi finished hers, Wes took her hand as the sassy, feisty beat of \u201cDie Young\u201d by Kesha pumped through the club. \u201cLet\u2019s take the idea for a test drive. Dance with me.\u201d</p><p>On the floor, they fell into an instant rhythm. He loved dancing with Rubi. She was smooth and hip and daring. They were always so in sync, playing off each other, making it fun and sexy. And Wes couldn\u2019t get enough of watching her body move.</p><p>When \u201cDie Young\u201d transitioned into Rihanna\u2019s upbeat \u201cWhere Have You Been,\u201d Rubi was laughing at Wes\u2019s improvised\u2014and overdramatized\u2014hip-hop moves. He loved making her laugh.</p><p>He was warm and loose when he took her hands and eased their bodies closer, lifting their arms overhead. The music pulsed through his blood. The J\u00e4ger tingled in his limbs. He felt relaxed and free, and with Rubi\u2019s body rocking to the rhythm alongside his, Wes was high on life.</p><p>He stepped back, released one of her hands, and turned her under his arm. With a small nudge to her shoulder, she twirled away from him, and when she circled back, Wes caught her with her spine to his chest. He held her there, his arms tight around her waist, her ass fitted to his cock, and swayed, rubbing against her.</p><p>She laid her head to his shoulder and met his grind. The return of pressure, that succulent ass cradling his erection, shot his blood into a rolling boil. Wes dropped his mouth to her neck. A hum of pleasure vibrated in her throat, and one arm came up to circle his head.</p><p>Wes was floating. Everything was so perfectly in sync\u2014the music, their bodies, their desire.</p><p>He released her hands and slid his own down her arms, skimming her breasts on the way past. Holding her waist, he soaked in every sexy movement of her body before continuing down to grip her hips. With their bodies fitted, he started a deliberate, erotic grind. In Wes\u2019s mind, he had her alone, naked, bent over a bed.</p><p>She had to be feeling the J\u00e4ger too. She didn\u2019t resist, didn\u2019t pull away. She was loose, her body meeting his thrusts and rolls with her own sensual flair. They\u2019d seriously tear up the sheets together. She had to feel that, too. Wes lowered his mouth to her cheek, her neck, her shoulder, licking and sucking every inch of exposed skin. He smoothed his hands up her ribs while meeting the rock and thrust of her ass against his cock. A moan of pleasure vibrated in her throat.</p><p>His brain was gone. His common sense, dust. She was the hottest, most exciting, and sexually uninhibited woman he\u2019d ever known. Rubi\u2019s sexual confidence allowed his own to flow without restriction, and he knew for a fact this was something he\u2019d been missing in past relationships.</p><p>He slid one hand down the middle of her belly, pressed the other to her face until she turned her head and met his eyes. Hers were heavy and hot. Needy. Knowing that heat was for him pushed his heart beat higher, and he lower his hand until his palm rested on her mound, then stretched his fingers to cover her. She was small and tight and hot. A knot of lust tightened between his legs.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Her eyes closed and her lips parted in a look of pleasure so rich, even more blood traveled south, filling his cock until he was painfully hard.</p><p>He covered her mouth with his, slid his tongue over hers, circling slowly as he matched the movement with his hand.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d she gasped, the sound part surprise, part ecstasy. That sound women made just before they came. \u201cWes...\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hand back, and pressed his temple to hers. \u201cEasy, baby. I\u2019m not ready for this to end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere Have You Been\u201d melted into the slower, steady beat of \u201cGlad You Came.\u201d Wes couldn\u2019t have choreographed the music more perfectly to his purpose. And as The Wanted sang about here and now, Wes focused on just that\u2014these perfect moments with Rubi.</p><p>He took her hand and pulled gently, turning her to face him. She stepped in, eased her body against his, and gazed into his eyes with an I-want-you-to-fuck-me-hard look of hunger. \u201cYou\u2019re good with your hands, Lawson.\u201d</p><p>A grin turned his mouth, but desire immediately wiped it away. \u201cIt only gets better.\u201d He slid one hand over her ass, paused to squeeze before traveling down the back of her smooth, tight thigh and lifted her leg to his hip. With his other hand supporting her, he dipped her slowly. Kissing her neck and moving south until his mouth was on the skin exposed in the open cleavage. He tugged the fabric from one barely covered nipple with his teeth and sucked it into his mouth. When her chest vibrated with a groan of pleasure, he closed his teeth gently around the peak and added pressure until her fingernails dug into his biceps.</p><p>With another tug of fabric, he covered her breast and pulled her out of the dip. Her gaze was a little shocked, but heavy with desire.</p><p>\u201cAll part of your benefits,\u201d he said close to her ear.</p><p>He moved his hand along her body to the other breast, and paused to squeeze and tease. Scanning the floor, Wes found everyone lost in their own worlds, many as hotly involved in each other as he and Rubi.</p><p>When he kissed her again, her mouth was open, hot and giving. The feel of her desire snapped a fuse on his brain. Made him deliriously reckless. He eased his hand between their bodies and over her sex.</p><p>They groaned at the same time, and Rubi\u2019s mouth grew more demanding, as if she were telling him what she wanted him to do with his hand. Keeping a rhythm on the dance floor while kissing and feeling someone up was harder than he\u2019d thought. Especially when Rubi had blown his circuits. His mind seemed to split, his thoughts flipping between the two\u2014dance, fuck. Dance, fuck. It took a deliberate effort to focus on the music and keep his movements synced. Every brain cell strained toward touching Rubi. Toward pleasuring her. Toward proving she would want for nothing if she gave him a chance.</p><p>He kept his body close to hers to cover their activities and pushed his hand deeper between her legs. Heat swallowed his fingers. She was soft and hot beneath the silk. Smooth. Deliciously curved.</p><p>He teased her, tracing her lips and folds. His fingertips stroked the dampness over her opening, and he groaned against her neck. \u201cFuck, baby. You\u2019re burning. And so wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d Her whisper was needy, insistent, and she pushed her hips into his hand.</p><p>Wes had to grit his teeth not to forge ahead and make her come. He wanted her to remember how badly she\u2019d needed his touch. The combination of throbbing music, pulsing darkness, writhing crowd, and growing sexual frenzy between them created a strange sense of privacy. With a little more alcohol in his system, he could see how easily he could fuck her right here, right now, on this public dance floor.</p><p>The woman made him feel almost invincible.</p><p>He slid his mouth from her lips to her cheek, her jaw. \u201cGod, I want to suck you,\u201d he murmured, keeping his fingers light over her pussy. \u201cI want to lick you. I want to eat you. I want to fuck you with my tongue. So good. It would be so good.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fisted in his shirt and she groaned, the sound dripping with need.</p><p>He stepped away to turn her in his arms and pull her back against him again. Once she\u2019d settled into their grind, Wes slid one hand from her waist to her hip, between their bodies to her ass. She lifted an arm back and around his neck, pulling his head down to her open mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her desire for him was a bigger rush than any stunt. More fulfilling than any accolade. He met her tongue, and they danced, responding to each other as if they\u2019d been together forever, the perfect match. If their kiss in the car had been euphoria, this was absolute ecstasy.</p><p>She pulled out of the kiss, breathless, and pressed her forehead to his jaw. \u201cWes...God...\u201d</p><p>He eased his hand beneath the fringe covering her ass. Slipped one finger under the edge of her thong and traced the path between her ass cheeks. He touched her sweet, sensitive pucker, and Rubi gasped, her head pushing harder against his jaw.</p><p>A whimper floated from her mouth. He lifted his free hand to her lips. \u201cSuck my fingers.\u201d Her lids lifted, exposing lazy, fiery green eyes before her lips parted and she took two fingers into her mouth. Wes\u2019s cock strained at the site. At the feel of her stroking tongue, the heat of her mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Get them good and wet.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled his fingers from her lips and traded the position of his hands on her body, sliding beneath her thong to tease her ass with his wet fingers. Rubi\u2019s eyes closed, teeth clenched and her head laid back against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGod that\u2019s so sweet.\u201d He wanted to explore, push her very tight boundaries here, but forced himself to ease his hand deeper between her legs, and found her opening, slick and hot.</p><p>He closed his teeth gently over the skin at the base of her neck and groaned with all his ferocious need.</p><p>\u201cOh my...\u201d Rubi\u2019s God muffled beneath Wes\u2019s mouth as he kissed her.</p><p>He stroked her with heavy hungry fingers. Lightened his touch and teased her. And finally broke the kiss to gather air, his lungs as tight as his cock.</p> <p>\u201cI want to fucking eat you alive.\u201d His voice was raspy, and his slipping control made him rough as he pushed one finger inside her.</p><p>Her quiet throaty sound of surprise and pleasure pushed Wes higher. Pillowy soft. Searingly hot. He stroked her walls, twisted his wrist and found the small swell of her G-spot.</p><p>\u201cFuck...Wes...\u201d</p><p>He withdrew, added a finger, and teased her opening again.</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d she complained, her hips rocking back and into his touch.</p><p>He teased her with shallow thrusts. \u201cCome and get it, baby. Rock that body.\u201d</p> <p>Her hips picked up a thrusting rhythm and Wes held his hand firm, letting Rubi pump herself toward the peak while he sucked at her lips, swirled his tongue with hers. And when her movements grew quicker, a little frantic, when the sounds from her throat grew higher in pitch, he met her thrusts, rubbing his knuckles over the small swell of her G spot. Lowering his other hand to her mound, he pressed his mouth to her neck and reveled in the moment\u2014something he\u2019d dreamed of for months.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck...\u201d she cried as her body squeezed his fingers so hard she immobilized his hand. She clutched his hair and trembled in his arms. He covered her moans with his mouth, wrapped the hand on her mound around her waist to steady her and pulled her body into his rhythm to simulate dancing.</p><p>When her sounds of pleasure faded and she grew heavy in his arms, he pulled from her body and raised his hand to slide a finger wet with her juices down her neck.</p><p>When her eyes fluttered open, he murmured, \u201cNext time...\u201d\u2014he lifted his hand to his mouth and licked her taste from his fingers\u2014\u201cI\u2019m going to do this all again\u2014with my mouth.\u201d</p><p>He turned her, wrapped an arm securely around her waist and walked her off the dance floor. Settling her in the corner of a sofa, he ordered her another drink from the passing waitress. He leaned down and kissed her forehead, then her lips. \u201cThis is just the beginning, baby.\u201d He kissed her once more. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. Keep an eye on our little Rachel, and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Rubi\u2019s sandals clicked along the viaduct\u2019s cement and echoed among the intermittent grunts and laughter coming from one of the many control rooms beneath the Sixth Street Bridge.</p><p>She stepped into the monolith\u2019s shadow and sighed with relief. They were experiencing one of those Indian summers in Los Angeles, and Rubi had broken a sweat between her car and the cave-like cement rooms where the Renegades were shooting this morning\u2019s fight scene. She\u2019d finished up the bulk of the crash app this morning and wanted to start on the fight app as soon as she finalized the coding for the other. Taping and pulling apart their fight scenes was the first step to that end.</p> <p>Pausing before stepping inside the building, Rubi glanced behind her, down the length of the cement channel where filming gear cluttered the view. Beyond, she spotted her car in the crew lot. She\u2019d been hoping the sight of her escape would settle her. Maybe...empower her. But it only intensified her urge to run.</p><p>She pulled out the note Wes had left on her windshield this morning and reread it.</p><p>I\u2019M STILL RUNNING A FEVER.</p><p>LITTLE HELP HERE?</p><p>A brief smile played over her lips, but apprehension tugged it away. Her most basic instincts knew starting something ongoing with him was a mistake. And she shouldn\u2019t have let the music, the alcohol and Wes carry her away last night. But that man was as good with his hands as he was with his mouth. And she\u2019d felt the size of his cock against her ass. Wes Lawson had \u2018lethal consequences\u2019 written across his forehead.</p><p>Yet he had a way of instilling a strange kind of hope, an irrational sense of security. As if some of his goodness or optimism might rub off and magically fix her. Or maybe it was a sense that he might truly be grounded or balanced enough to take on her issues without getting scarred.</p><p>Yet at the same time, he was clearly as much of a reckless rebel as she was, as demonstrated by him rocking her world on the busiest dance floor in Los Angeles.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t unheard of. Stilettos could get rowdy...and raunchy...even in the main area. But public displays of affection had never been her thing, let alone climaxing with hundreds of people around. Hello, that was one of the reasons she didn\u2019t have sex at Stilettos. And why she didn\u2019t play with more than one sexual partner at a time. Just because she\u2019d always been overly sexually active didn\u2019t mean she was also a sexual radical.</p><p>But she had to admit, Lawson\u2019s show of insane confidence on the dance floor had delivered an overwhelming sense of personal power and sexual freedom. The fact that Wes could do that for her was as electrifying as it was terrifying. Because she craved more.</p><p>And she\u2019d never before craved more.</p><p>She\u2019d been with her share of men\u2014not as many as she let others believe she\u2019d bedded\u2014but plenty enough to draw the conclusion that a truly gifted lover was more rare than virtue in Hollywood. And calculating the odds of finding a talented lover who was sincerely dedicated to pleasing a woman\u2014in Los Angeles, no less\u2014would screw statistics for all time.</p><p>If she had to sum it all up in three words\u2014guys were guys.</p><p>Or so she\u2019d thought.</p><p>But that alone didn\u2019t warrant using Wes and destroying their friendship. She drew a deep breath and closed her eyes before releasing it slowly. He was going to be pissed when she pulled back today. But better now than later.</p><p>Softening her steps so she wouldn\u2019t interfere with filming if they had cameras rolling, she eased through the open metal door and tiptoed toward the pain-filled grunts. The first room was empty, gloomy concrete on all sides. One filthy window was covered in iron bars and cast murky light into what felt like a dungeon.</p><p>Through doorways in the distance linking the rooms, Rubi spotted lighting, cameras, and a black pad on the floor. As she neared, she saw someone standing in the door to the room in use. Danny, one of the production assistants. He lifted his chin in greeting. Rubi smiled and pretended to crank her hand near her head in the silent question, Are they filming?</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Danny said quietly as Rubi neared. \u201cStill getting the moves down.\u201d He was tall and lanky, resting one shoulder against the concrete. With his gaze turning toward the middle of the room again\u2014an area Rubi could see now was five times the size of any of the other rooms individually\u2014he tilted his head toward Rubi\u2019s and lowered his voice. \u201cBolton\u2019s worth shit today, and Lawson\u2019s not happy.\u201d</p><p>Yards away, the costar and Keaton sparred on the mat. Wes doubled Bolton because they were physically similar\u2014same height, roughly the same build, both blond. But Wes was ten times more attractive and carried a hell of a lot more muscle. Wes also had values like human decency, humility, and kindness, whereas Bolton was an arrogant prick. But she wasn\u2019t partial or anything.</p><p>Keaton stood the same height as Wes and carried a similar build, but he was Japanese-American with black hair, darker skin and high cheekbones. And when that man smiled, a thousand-watt beam of light struck the heavens. Keaton had taken on a minor villain role and played opposite Wes\u2014standing in for Bolton\u2014in a lot of the stunt scenes.</p><p>Today Wes\u2019s blond hair was mussed. He had his hands planted on his hips where he stood barefooted on the mat, instructing Bolton on the fight. He wore a gray tank top, tattered jeans, and a scowl.</p><p>Dee-licious.</p><p>Rubi thought of his hands and held back a delicious sigh. A man who looked like that, with his sense of humor, his intelligence, his fun-loving nature was an awesome find in itself. But a man who had all that and the talent to bring her to orgasm within minutes of laying his hands on her? And then walked away without pushing for gratification of his own obvious needs?</p><p>That was something Rubi had never encountered.</p><p>A fist of excitement and uncertainty clutched her stomach as she slipped into the room. She\u2019d been anticipating seeing him for the first time after what transpired between them the night before since she\u2019d gotten behind the wheel of her Aston that morning. Did he think they were a couple now? Did he regret the whole thing? Or he couldn\u2019t care less about the exchange? Not knowing how he would respond, how his response might alter their existing friendship, unnerved her.</p><p>Wes turned as Bolton and Keaton sparred. His gaze clicked to hers as soon as she came within his line of sight, and she felt the sync at gut level. He lingered there a moment, his eyes on hers, but his expression never altered. His eyes were dark, his jaw tight in frustration. Then his gaze swung back toward Bolton without any acknowledgment.</p><p>Rubi simultaneously experienced both relief and dread.</p><p>\u201cSnap your head, dude,\u201d Wes said in a tone that indicated he\u2019d been saying it all morning. \u201cPut your shoulder into it\u2014\u201d</p><p>Keaton threw a quick solid punch, and, while Bolton reacted, his response wasn\u2019t near intense enough to make the reception believable.</p><p>Wes reached out and pulled Bolton aside by the arm. \u201cOkay.\u201d His voice held barely restrained patience. \u201cI\u2019m going to show you one more time.\u201d</p><p>Rubi lifted her phone, brought Wes and Keaton into the viewfinder, and hit the Record button. Then she held her hand steady while she lifted her gaze to watch Wes.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Wes said to Keaton.</p><p>The other Renegade struck out. Wes\u2019s head snapped sideways with a grunt, followed by his shoulder as he fell off balance. Rubi gasped and immediately covered her mouth. She sent a sidelong grin toward Danny and whispered, \u201cSorry. It looks so real.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt does when Wes and Keaton do it.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Wes straightened, setting his stance, pulling up his fists, Keaton hit him again. Again, Wes snapped his head, fell sideways. Keaton didn\u2019t wait for him to reset this time, and nailed another fist into\u2014what looked like\u2014Wes\u2019s face. And even though Rubi knew for a fact Keaton wasn\u2019t making contact, the punches looked authentic enough to make her cringe.</p><p>Wes put up a flat hand to Keaton, straightened, and turned to Bolton. \u201cGot it?\u201d</p><p>Bolton nodded. \u201cYeah, yeah. I can do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would hope so,\u201d Wes muttered.</p><p>Wes crossed his arms and stood back. Keaton waited as Bolton set himself up, then Wes said, \u201cReady...and...action.\u201d</p><p>Keaton threw another perfectly aimed punch, his arm muscles rippling with the effort, and Bolton jerked his head sideways.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Wes said, his voice infused with guarded enthusiasm. \u201cAgain. Bring your shoulder all the way through as you turn.\u201d</p><p>They went over that one punch three more times while Wes circled them, shooting instructions at Bolton. The man seemed wholly unsteady on his feet and was sweating like a glass of ice water in the sun.</p> <p>Wes continued instruction, pausing to show Bolton how to bleed one hit into a returned punch followed by a martial-arts kick. Rubi knew he was asking too much of the costar. Wes was fluid and practiced. Strong and sober. Confident and commanding. Bolton, one of the most famous up-and-coming stars, didn\u2019t just pale in comparison, he turned invisible.</p><p>Rubi leaned against the wall and enjoyed the simple but vivid pleasure of watching Wes move. His shoulder and arm muscles rolled with each punch. His ribbed abdomen clenched beneath the fitted cotton. His thick thigh muscles flexed when he kicked out in a roundhouse. His expression tightened with intensity as he spun and landed steady and strong.</p><p>She could still feel him pressed to her back. Marveled at the thought of how gently those hands had touched her most intimate places. Rubi\u2019s belly fluttered with a strange sensation. She tried to fit it into some known framework but couldn\u2019t. She pushed the uncomfortable feeling to the back of her mind and focused on the men.</p><p>Bolton stepped up, tried a few weak punches, one flailing roundhouse.</p><p>\u201cOkay, no,\u201d Wes barked. \u201cJust stop. You\u2019re way the fuck off your game today, Bolton.\u201d Wes drove both hands into his hair and lifted them out with a frustrated wave, leaving the blond strands standing out in all directions. \u201cEveryone take twenty.\u201d</p><p>As cameramen, assistants, and actors filed out of the room, Wes clasped his hands behind his head, elbows wide, and paced the mats. Rubi sagged against the wall and paused her camera. The room went quiet, voices floating in through the broken glass of the single, barred window where everyone clustered outside.</p> <p>Wes slumped into a vacant chair and closed his eyes on a heavy, frustrated breath. He dropped his head back, sliding his clasped hands to his forehead.</p><p>Neither of them spoke. Rubi\u2019s heart grew heavy for him.</p><p>She pushed off the wall and set a slow pace his direction. \u201cLooks and sounds like you\u2019ve had a rough morning.\u201d She kept her voice soft, but it still sounded ominous and hollow in the empty cement room. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jax? Or MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJax is bidding a job in San Diego, some quick fall and fight work at the harbor, which makes me stunt coordinator for the day.\u201d God he sounded so tired. \u201cAnd MacKenzie is at another location filming a scene with Craig.\u201d</p><p>He meant Daniel Craig, the Bond film\u2019s star.</p><p>She slid her phone into her back pocket as she came up behind him, and pressed both hands to that tense space between his neck and shoulders. His body was warm and damp with sweat. The same delicious sensation she\u2019d had at the club slammed into her again, creating a fist of want deep in her belly.</p><p>She squeezed Wes\u2019s muscle, and he groaned a long exhale, then massaged the tight, dense muscle\u2014something she would have done regardless of what had happened the night before. Something she would have done for any Renegade.</p><p>Right.</p> <p>\u201cTired today?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Someone wound me up tight last night. Took me forever to fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve got the winding-up part backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2019s your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, so good.\u201d He turned and glanced up at her. \u201cHey, can we talk more about those hinges?\u201d</p><p>She had known this was coming. After last night, it seemed spending time with him would be an ongoing issue. \u201cOf course.\u201d She pushed on his shoulders. \u201cLean forward. You\u2019re too tight to be throwing your body around like that. You\u2019re going to hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>He groaned as he braced his elbows on his thighs and his head in his hands. Rubi angled her elbow into the thick muscle at the base of his neck and added pressure until the muscle resisted, then held it.</p><p>\u201cHoly...fuck...\u201d His breathing turned choppy. \u201cWhat...are you...doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReleasing your muscle. Don\u2019t tense against me. Let go.\u201d</p><p>His muscle melted beneath her pressure as he let the tension ebb. \u201cOh my God...that\u2019s...better than an adrenaline rush.\u201d</p><p>Rubi smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s saying something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot that right.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell, and Rubi chewed on her bottom lip. Easing pressure off the muscle, she moved her elbow toward his shoulder blade and slowly leaned into the compression. \u201cWe...should talk about last night.\u201d</p><p>He reached back, grabbed her forearms and used them to pull her around in front of him. Then he gripped her waist, separated her knees with his and pulled her into a straddle across his lap.</p><p>She gasped and grabbed his shoulders. Her heart rate spiked. The chair had no rungs. Nowhere for her to plant her feet and lift off him. He gripped her hips and pulled her closer, growling when his package rubbed between her legs.</p><p>\u201cWes\u2014\u201c</p><p>\u201cI want you looking into my eyes when you try to trash our arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t make an arrangement.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that make last night? Other than a fucking fantasy come true, I mean?\u201d</p><p>A mistake. She scooted off his lap and stood. Crossed her arms. But that didn\u2019t stop the desire flooding her body in a waterfall of heat. \u201cLook, Wes, our friendship doesn\u2019t fit the whole friends-with-benefits model. I really think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed, eyes closed, smile stretched across his handsome face. \u201cBaby, you\u2019ve been spending too much time in business meetings. Where\u2019d you get this idea of a \u2018model\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment flushed her face and she bit the inside of her lip. \u201cInternet.\u201d As soon as his smile grew again, she added, \u201cDon\u2019t laugh. It makes a lot of sense.\u201d She covered her face, rubbing at the tingle in her cheeks. \u201cAnd I seem to need help making sense right now.\u201d</p><p>He sat forward and pressed his elbows on his knees. His gray eyes were clear and serious, but also rich with affection. \u201cIf you need help making sense of us, listen to your body. It knows exactly what you need. And even if there were some type of \u2018model\u2019 to this friends-with-benefits thing, I wouldn\u2019t follow it. I was born to break rules, baby. We both were. All we need is an understanding between the two of us, not a one-size-fits-all list of \u2018shoulds\u2019 created by some geek staff writer for an online rag.\u201d</p><p>Damn, she didn\u2019t know what to think or how to feel. She only knew she wanted to escape the pressure caused whenever she thought about this situation.</p><p>\u201cI know this freaks you out, so let\u2019s keep it simple for now\u2014sex when we want to fuck and friends the rest of the time.\u201d</p><p>Her belly burned with the implications. A huge part of her wanted to scream yes. Absolutely. Let\u2019s start now.</p><p>Instead, she frowned, narrowing her eyes on him. \u201cYou think you can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Never done it before.\u201d</p><p>Her wall of resistance reappeared. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of. Really, Wes, this isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you chicken, Russo?\u201d he asked, his voice low and taunting. \u201cAfraid you\u2019ll fall for me?\u201d</p><p>No. Yes. Shit, she didn\u2019t know. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this is the perfect setup for disaster.\u201d</p><p>A slow, hot grin lifted his mouth. \u201cSounds like the perfect challenge to me.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, her chest growing tight.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, razzing her with a fake punch to her gut. \u201cI expected more zing from you, Russo. I think you\u2019re...\u201d He made chicken noises.</p><p>A laugh bubbled up, and she reached out, covering his mouth. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her hand away and threaded their fingers. \u201cLet\u2019s set up some ground rules if that will make you feel better. I\u2019ll even give you a handicap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPfft. Like you don\u2019t need a handicap? And this\u201d\u2014she lifted their joined hands\u2014\u201cis not sex when we want it and friends the rest of the time.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled hard and pulled his hand back, but his smile faded into a tight, frustrated line. \u201cGo ahead, set up your first rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That would mean I believed this could work, and I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>More chicken noises.</p><p>\u201cDammit, how did you get so good at that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrew up on a farm. Duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep forgetting that. Bet you do a great pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue-ribbon winner in the county fair a decade running when I was a kid.\u201d He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, tilted his head back. \u201cSuuuuuu\u2014\u201d</p><p>She slapped a hand over his mouth before the \u201cweeeee!\u201d came out and doubled over with laughter. \u201cGod...you\u2019re such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her hand away with his free one and squeezed gently before letting it go. \u201cJust one thing you love about me. There will be lots more. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d</p><p>A scrape sounded near the door. His gaze darted that direction, then back. \u201cJust to show you I can do this, I\u2019m not going to haul you into my lap and kiss the hell out of you to mark you as mine.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s brow creased in confusion. She opened her mouth to ask what that had to do with anything when one of the cameramen strolled back into the room.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rubi,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you leave your e-mail, I\u2019ll get you the name of that cinematography app I use. If you could add those camera lens calculations into your stunt apps, man, that would be amazing.\u201d</p><p>Her lips were parted when the reality of what he hadn\u2019t done hit her. News of their kiss could have spread through the crew and Renegades by nightfall\u2014definitely not part of his friends with benefits strategy.</p><p>Thoughts ping-ponged around her brain. A strange giddy lightness darted through her belly. Could he really do this? Could she? The thought of being able to have him, experience all his alpha sexiness and beta sweetness without ruining what they already had as friends\u2014however briefly\u2014created a delicious, twisty feeling in her belly.</p><p>Wes flashed that knowing grin and stood, tugging at the thighs of his jeans, above which a sizeable bulge had taken up residence. Pulling out his phone from a back pocket, Wes pushed one number, crossed his arms over his wide chest, and put the phone to his ear. \u201cDude, you got a minute?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rubi took out her own phone and tapped into the camera again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got problems with Bolton,\u201d he said as he wandered back to the mat. \u201cI cut him off at the bar and poured him into bed by midnight, but he was still late to the set, isn\u2019t functioning worth his weight in shit, and he\u2019s off-gassing like a diesel truck. He must have gone out again after I left him. I doubt we\u2019re going to get anything workable out of him today.\u201d</p><p>Rubi made her way back toward the wall, leaned against it, and planted one foot to the concrete, pretending to check e-mail. But her mind was in a mishmash of confusion over Wes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d he grumbled, \u201cBut I\u2019d rather take him out back and beat the crap out of him. Come on, it would make me feel so much better. Please?\u201d He paused and rubbed his closed eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun anymore, you know that? I\u2019m short-sheeting your bed, dude. Better plan on staying with Lexi.\u201d</p> <p>He disconnected and swore as he slipped the phone back into his pocket. Rubi pressed her lips together to hold back laughter.</p><p>On the mat, Wes shook out his arms and started jumping on his toes, warming up for more work. He planted his feet wide and swung his arms across his chest. \u201cKeaton,\u201d he called. \u201cLet\u2019s go, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Bolton asked, stopping beside Rubi, hands on his hips.</p><p>Wes waved him closer. The production staff was trickling back in, camera and sound guys messing with their equipment.</p><p>Keaton took the mat across from Wes and brought his fists up like a boxer. Wes mirrored him but spoke to Bolton quietly, with an undertone of steel. \u201cI\u2019m shooting your scenes today.\u201d</p> <p>Keaton took a swing, and Wes received the hit like a pro, head whipping, body twisting, feet stumbling. Keaton came at him with an upper cut. Wes\u2019s head snapped up, and he fell back a step.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep the face shots to a minimum.\u201d Wes and Keaton circled each other. \u201cSo get your ass home and sleep off your hangover. If you\u2019re not sober and ready to work tomorrow, I might just take over your whole fucking role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Bolton sputtered, his face reddening with anger. \u201cWho the fuck died and made you boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChamberlin. If you have a problem, take it up with him.\u201d</p><p>Keaton twirled and kicked at Wes\u2019s head. Wes ducked and moved in for a body shot. He was so smooth, so confident. And so freaking hot.</p><p>Sex when we want to fuck and friends the rest of the time.</p> <p>Rubi\u2019s hunger surged to life. How long would that kind of arrangement last? But more importantly, what would happen when it ended?</p><p>Keaton crumpled with a grunt, stumbled back, and slammed his body against the concrete. Even standing only a few yards away, knowing it was fake, Rubi\u2019s stomach cramped with each hit.</p><p>Keaton swung his arm around Wes\u2019s neck, his handsome face in a grimace as he pretended to choke the life from Wes.</p><p>\u201cYou want to do all the work, fine,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cI\u2019m still the one who gets paid.\u201d He turned away from them and covered his dented ego with a superior grin and a swagger on his way out.</p><p>Rubi refocused on the mat, just as Keaton hooked his left fist at Wes. Rubi sucked in a breath, but Wes leaned back, gripped Keaton\u2019s arm and threw him. Keaton twisted three times in the air before he hit the mat.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a fucking fight scene.\u201d Danny straightened, grinning at Rubi. \u201cI\u2019d better get that man a costume. Looks like we\u2019re going to get some real filming done today.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d Lexi frowned up at Rubi from where she knelt in front of her. She held straight pins between her teeth and one between her fingers poised to poke the lingerie Rubi wore. \u201cDid you take espresso shots on your way here? If you don\u2019t stop fidgeting, you\u2019re going to become a pin cushion.\u201d</p> <p>Rubi planted her hands on her hips, took a deep breath, and blew it out. That didn\u2019t help the knot at the center of her body, but she managed to find stillness.</p><p>\u201cHands down,\u201d Lexi ordered.</p><p>Rubi rolled her eyes and dropped her arms.</p><p>Lexi tugged the fabric of the panties at Rubi\u2019s hip. Jax\u2019s rich voice floated up to the loft from where he sat at the desk downstairs in the main studio of LaCroix Designs, Lexi\u2019s couture wedding dress storefront, talking on the phone. Lexi took the extra fabric at Rubi\u2019s hip between her fingers, pinned it, then measured it with the tape measure hanging around her hip and removed the pin, jotting the numbers on a tablet.</p><p>\u201cQuarter turn,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make it to see the house day after tomorrow, right?\u201d</p><p>Rubi crossed her arms to keep them out of Lexi\u2019s way. \u201cYes. How many does this make now?\u201d</p><p>Lexi shot her a look from her spot on the floor and muttered around the pins between her lips, \u201cEight.\u201d</p><p>Jax wanted Lexi to move in with him, but his Malibu house was too far from Lexi\u2019s studio to be practical. He\u2019d talked her into looking at houses with him, but the whole thing made Lexi as jittery as Wes made Rubi. In this way, they were similar. Their scare-levels of commitment might differ\u2014for Lexi it was the financial commitment, for Rubi, the emotional commitment\u2014but the fear was the same.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Wes?\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s jitters returned, and she had to fight to keep still. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s...maddening. He\u2019s maddening. I keep pushing him away, and he finds all kinds of manipulative ways to get even closer. He\u2019s a conniving little shit.\u201d</p><p>Lexi laughed as Rubi made another quarter turn and Lexi smoothed her fingers across the lace band over Rubi\u2019s hips. \u201cYou like him.\u201d</p><p>A little too much girly giddiness filled Lexi\u2019s voice and sent an uncomfortable shiver down Rubi\u2019s spine. \u201cOf course I like him. I wouldn\u2019t hang out with all of you if I didn\u2019t. We\u2019re great as friends, but you know I\u2019m not going to stay with one guy. We both know what happens when I try that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know what used to happen. You\u2019re a different woman than you were five years ago. Don\u2019t try to feed me that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not shit. It\u2019s real. And I\u2019m not that different. Even the thought of a week down the line sets off an anxiety attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cI feel the same thing. Daily. But you work through it. One day at a time. Because a good relationship is worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not you, Lex.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, shaking her head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re so much stronger. So much smarter. So much...more.\u201d</p><p>The affection in Lexi\u2019s voice warmed Rubi. She thought back to the same loving tone in Wes\u2019s voice and her chest tightened up. Frustration clenched her jaw. She didn\u2019t want to feel like this. She just did. And the lack of control over her emotions added fuel to her self-directed anger.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s suggesting a friends-with-benefits arrangement,\u201d Rubi said.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s fingers paused. Her big blue eyes held surprise and disbelief as they lifted to Rubi\u2019s. \u201cWes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was my reaction.\u201d</p><p>Lexi pushed to her feet and folded a pucker in each bra cup, pinning it. \u201cOkay, corset\u2019s next.\u201d</p><p>Rubi stepped into Lexi\u2019s tiny bathroom and changed the bra and panties for a corset and new panties. Every piece in Lexi\u2019s signature line was done in crimson leather. Buttery soft, thin, embossed crimson leather, and the feel and scent made Rubi high.</p><p>She squeezed her boobs into the push-up cups and held the sides as she returned, her high heels clicking over the hardwood floor. She turned her back to Lexi, who tightened the crisscross lacing along the spine. Rubi faced her, and Lexi lowered to her knees again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really see a friends-with-benefits thing working with you two,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cI mean...\u201d She shook her head, shrugged. \u201cShit, I wish you\u2019d just go for it with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your romantic side talking, not your realistic side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that not realistic? You\u2019ve never gotten along better with someone. Never been so close with a man for so long with such good results. In some ways you two are so alike it\u2019s frightening. In others you\u2019re so opposite you complement each other perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kinda freaking me out. Can\u2019t you just tell me it\u2019s the stupidest idea ever and leave it at that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think friends with benefits is the stupidest idea ever, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Rubi closed her eyes and made a supremely frustrated sound in her throat. \u201cYou\u2019re right. And it\u2019s not what he wants. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019d suggest it.\u201d</p><p>When she made the final turn to face Lexi again, her friend was staring thoughtfully up at her. \u201cHe\u2019s either testing new waters\u2014which is rather obvious by going for you and not one of his typical sweet girls\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Rubi laughed out the word.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. Or...he\u2019s looking to hook up with you because you\u2019re hot, and he wants to tide himself over until he finds another one of those sweet girls to settle with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Rubi\u2019s lips twisted in consideration. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr\u201d\u2014Lexi pushed to her feet\u2014\u201che\u2019s as crazy about you as you are about him, and he\u2019s taking what you\u2019re willing to give because a spoonful of Ben and Jerry\u2019s is better than nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop saying I\u2019m crazy about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Bolton starts another fight tonight\u201d\u2014Wes\u2019s angry voice pierced the space between the studio\u2019s main floor and the loft\u2014\u201cI\u2019m quitting this fucking movie, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Rubi stiffened. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But Jax told me MacKenzie wants him to watch Bolton again tonight.\u201d</p><p>A ribbon of unease followed the lacing down Rubi\u2019s spine. \u201cNot a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this sucks,\u201d Jax said from below. \u201cBut MacKenzie had a long talk with him today. He\u2019s promised to be on his best behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he doesn\u2019t need a fucking chaperone.\u201d Wes tossed back.</p><p>Rubi stepped up to the railing.</p><p>\u201cAt least come with me, dude,\u201d Wes said. \u201cGo change and grab Lexi and get a night out. Then you can save him when I\u2019ve got my hands around his neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi\u2019s doing the fitting with Rubi, and I\u2019ve got to work up this bid by eight a.m.\u201d</p><p>A slight hesitation, then, \u201cRubi\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Rubi closed her eyes and hung her head.</p><p>She\u2019d been with him half the day. She\u2019d called it quits when the fight scenes had moved outdoors and he\u2019d practiced the moves with Keaton shirtless\u2014beneath the blazing late-summer sun with sweat slicking his tanned skin. The thought made every cell in her torso ache. She needed some freaking space and had been looking forward to a night of relief from the heat he stirred inside her.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Wes asked, the anger draining from his voice. \u201cUpstairs?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t go up there, dude,\u201d Jax said. But by the way he raised his voice, Rubi knew Wes was already headed her way.</p><p>\u201cWes, stay out.\u201d Lexi swung toward the stairs. \u201cWe\u2019re not decent up here.\u201d</p><p>He stopped on the top step, still head and shoulders above Lexi. He was grinning as he gripped her upper arms and set her aside so he could pass. \u201cThat\u2019s just how I like Rubi best\u2014indecent.\u201d</p><p>Rubi huffed a laugh and leaned against the railing. \u201cDon\u2019t bother, Lex. He seems to do whatever he pleases nowadays.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze darted toward her voice, and he froze. One hand gripped the side rail, the other landed flat against the wall. His shocked gaze slid over her from shoulders to toes and heated Rubi everywhere. The shock quickly shifted to pure lust, and his gaze returned to hers.</p><p>\u201cIf that were true, baby,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d have done you by now.\u201d</p><p>Rubi laughed. That comment probably crossed the friends line\u2014even though they\u2019d flirted like this before anything changed, but the man never failed to make her smile.</p><p>\u201cYou are such an asshole.\u201d Jax appeared behind Wes, averting his gaze from Rubi\u2014although she was wearing far more than she did on the beach in her bikini. \u201cYou\u2019re about to get an attitude adjustment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that later.\u201d Lexi fought a smile and pushed past Wes, taking Jax\u2019s arm and pulling him behind her. \u201cCome downstairs with me.\u201d</p> <p>Jax\u2019s and Lexi\u2019s voices faded and a door downstairs clicked closed. Wes still hadn\u2019t moved. His gaze hadn\u2019t stopped inventorying every inch of her body. And his gaze wasn\u2019t the only thing heating her from the inside out.</p><p>He looked spectacular. He wore black suit pants, a black suit jacket, and white dress shirt, every piece hanging perfectly on his muscled frame. His hair looked damp and was combed off his face, but he hadn\u2019t shaved, and the day\u2019s golden stubble dirtied his jaw.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t you look\u201d\u2014Rubi caught herself before she said edible and replaced it with\u2014\u201camazing?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never looked sexier and Rubi had urges she\u2019d never had before. Urges that included more than simply fucking him. She wanted to undress him slowly, not rip his clothes off. Wanted to explore his body, not just use it. Wanted to laugh and tease and please him in bed, not just get it done so she could move on.</p><p>Every thought terrified her more than the last.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding when you said you didn\u2019t follow rules,\u201d she said.</p> <p>His mouth kicked up in that sexy way that made her stomach float, and his fiery gaze wandered downward again with a look of longing both sweet and sultry.</p><p>\u201cAre you just going to stand there and stare?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda...rude.\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted up and met hers. Those deep-gray eyes were heavy-lidded and on fire. \u201cWould it be less rude to throw you down on the table and fuck you?\u201d His rough words shot fire between her legs. Then he reached down with one hand and adjusted that amazing package. The sight sent her blood into a boil. \u201c\u2019Cause, I\u2019m fully equipped and extremely capable.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s grin spread. \u201cYou definitely have no self-esteem problems, do you?\u201d</p><p>He pushed up the final stair, eased his suit jacket back and planted his hands on his hips. \u201cGive me a few hours alone with you, and I\u2019ll let you tell me if I should develop some.\u201d</p><p>He started toward her with a predatory look that pinched her belly with lust. Rubi held her ground but gripped the railing so tight her fingers tingled from the blood loss. When he was within five feet, his scent drifted to her. Clean, spicy, sexy. It curled around her, along with his body heat, and made her dizzy.</p><p>He closed his hand on the railing an inch from hers. \u201cI don\u2019t think I told you how adorable you looked on set today.\u201d</p><p>Humor tickled Rubi\u2019s gut. \u201cJeans and a T-shirt? That\u2019s adorable?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTight little jeans that hugged your awesome ass. That diamond in your belly button teasing me. And a T-shirt that clung to every last perfect curve. Then there were those pretty toes of yours. I might be pushing that friend boundary a little here, but what I\u2019ve got planned for those sensitive toes has given me a hard-on I\u2019ve been living with all damn day. \u201cNow I\u2019m really crossing the line...because we\u2019re alone...and because I really want sex...\u201d He took her wrist, covered her hand with his, and pressed her palm to the front of his slacks, then curved her fingers over his package. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping you do, too.\u201d</p><p>Rubi gasped and pulled back, but Wes\u2019s heavy hand covered hers and guided it along his length. His entire length. Which kept going. And going. She thought she\u2019d gotten a good feel for him at the club while he\u2019d been grinding against her ass, but...no. She was getting a literal firsthand take of the thickness, length, hardness, and heat of his cock.</p><p>A wickedly urgent need closed her throat. Oh, yeah, she wanted sex.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he said, his voice soft. \u201cAre you drooling?\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s mind righted from its sideways slide, and she found herself feeling him through his pants, no help from Wes necessary, although his hand still covered hers. Christ, he felt...delicious. A heavy weight lay at the bottom of her belly, casting heat between her legs.</p><p>\u201cI...um...\u201d She lifted her gaze. His expression was tight with desire. \u201cMight be...\u201d</p><p>Wes laughed, the sound rolling into a groan as he pulled her hand away. \u201cJust one of your many benefits.\u201d He threaded their fingers and brought her hand to his mouth for a kiss. \u201cTo do with as you please.\u201d</p><p>A laugh curled in her throat. He might be acting sweet now, but she\u2019d seen his many sides, and she\u2019d bet he could be a very intense lover. She\u2019d never thought any man would be too much for her to handle, but something about all his facets made her wonder.</p><p>His free hand lifted, and he skimmed the back of one finger along the curve of her breast at the corset\u2019s edge. The featherlight touch sent gooseflesh across her chest. Her nipples puckered, and the crimson leather showed every last curve of the hard nub. He watched the reaction with a hunger she felt all the way through her.</p><p>\u201cYou are so sensitive,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIf I dropped to my knees, would you take pity on me?\u201d</p><p>Want swept through her in a fierce wave. Her eyes fell closed as she whispered, \u201cThere would be no pity involved.\u201d</p><p>Air whooshed over her skin, and she opened her eyes. Wes was on one knee in front of her, one hand still gripping the railing, his other sliding around her waist. Rubi gasped at his touch. Every inch of her skin tightened in a ripple of pleasure.</p><p>His body remained perfectly still, his hand adding the slightest pressure to her lower back and drawing her belly toward his mouth. His warm breath touched her like fingertips, and she watched as he tipped his head, lowered those golden lashes, and opened his mouth against the strip of skin exposed beneath the edge of the corset.</p><p>Something tender and impossibly warm squeezed her heart so hard her chest ached. Something that definitely didn\u2019t fall into the friend or sex category. Then the sensation of his mouth on her skin registered, and white-hot lust slid low, pooling between her legs.</p><p>\u201cOh hell,\u201d drifted from her mouth in a desire-filled exhale.</p><p>A door downstairs opened, and Jax\u2019s and Lexi\u2019s voices touched Rubi\u2019s ears, dragging her back from the blissful place Wes had taken her. Somewhere she desperately wanted to stay. But all her doubts from the past washed in, cooling her heat.</p><p>She combed a hand through his hair, slid her fingers under his chin, and lifted his mouth from her belly. With regret thickening her throat, she ran her thumb over his rough cheek.</p><p>\u201cFind a girl tonight, Wes,\u201d she told him, serious, resolute. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t do this. Nothing\u2019s going to happen between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. I know you can.\u201d Wes released the railing and rose. His voice was soft and understanding as he drew her close and kissed her lips with a murmured, \u201cPlenty has already happened between us. And it\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes, get down here,\u201d Jax said from the bottom of the stairs. \u201cLexi and Rubi need to work. And you need to get your ass to Lure before Bolton does something stupid.\u201d</p><p>He turned and started for the stairs. With his foot on the top stair, he glanced back over his shoulder, but his gaze didn\u2019t slide down her body as she expected. \u201cCome keep me company when you\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need some space.\u201d</p><p>He held her gaze, and she swore she could see the reality of their situation solidify in his eyes. He glanced toward the floor and gave one nod before turning away and trotting down the stairs.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s entire chest swirled with confusion, frustration, and loss.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear the words Wes and Jax exchanged, but she flinched when the door to the shop shut, signaling Wes\u2019s departure.</p><p>Lexi climbed the stairs, picked up another style of lingerie, and wandered over to Rubi. \u201cI\u2019ve always stayed out of your sex life, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze tore from the location she\u2019d last seen Wes and jumped to Lexi. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never told you what I think you should or shouldn\u2019t do. Never nagged you about sticking with one guy. Never even whined about never getting to meet any.\u201d She offered the lingerie to Rubi. \u201cBut this time, Rubi, this time, I really think you\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d Rubi scowled at her friend and took the lace from her hand. \u201cWe both know what would happen. I\u2019d screw him once...okay, maybe twice, because he\u2019d just be that damn good, and then I\u2019d walk away. He\u2019d be pissed and hurt. And how do you think he\u2019d feel about hanging with me then? It would ruin what we have, Lexi\u2014this comfortable, fun foursome. And imagine when he finds another girl and wants her to hang with us. God, what a mess.\u201d</p><p>She strode into the bathroom and stripped the corset from her body. Her heart was beating too fast. Her breathing too shaky.</p><p>In the other room, Lexi said, \u201cAnd what if the sky falls tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She wiggled into the translucent bra bordered in leather. Damn, Lexi made the most beautiful creations. \u201cThe chances of the sky falling are about one zillion to one. The chances of things going bad with Wes are 100 percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is another side to those what-ifs,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cLike, what if...you screwed him once...okay, definitely twice, because he would be that damn good, and you didn\u2019t walk away? What if...you stayed long enough to figure out if he\u2019s everything you want and need in a man? What if...now I\u2019m going out on a limb here...you actually admitted to yourself that you\u2019re already half in love with the man and could easily finish falling if you even just tried on this friends-with-benefits deal?\u201d</p><p>Rubi stepped out of the bathroom with what felt like a boulder in her chest. She could barely breathe. Both her fight and her flight reflexes were now amped to full power, gushing adrenaline into her chest. \u201cYou just told me you didn\u2019t think it would work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot long-term, no. But I think it would give you the safety net you think you need to try with Wes.\u201d</p><p>She was starting to sweat. Her heart beat even harder. \u201cYou\u2019re delusional. Love has infected your brain. Just because you\u2019re head over heels with Jax does not mean the rest of the world has changed. I have definitely not changed. I\u2019ve never been a forever type of woman. Hell, I\u2019ve never even been a more-than-a-month type of woman. And for the last five years I haven\u2019t even been a more-than-one-night type of woman.\u201d</p><p>Fear eclipsed her thought process. She had to work hard to think in a straight line. Extra hard to keep her arguments together. Because now that Lexi had gone and voiced those what-ifs that Rubi had suppressed in her subconscious, she couldn\u2019t ignore them.</p><p>\u201cGoing around and around about this is just confusing you,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cYou\u2019re living off a script you put in your head a long time ago, one that doesn\u2019t apply to who you are now.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi lowered to her knees again. Rubi knew she was blowing a chance with someone special, and that hurt. But she could handle being hurt if that meant Wes wasn\u2019t. She could\u2014she had to\u2014let a chance with Wes pass if that meant he didn\u2019t get damaged by her issues. As long as she was blowing it for herself and not for Wes, she could handle it.</p><p>Rubi turned according to Lexi\u2019s gestures. As her friend pinned an area in the back of the bra, Rubi pressed a hand to her stomach. She didn\u2019t like this. She didn\u2019t want this. She just wanted to stay in her safety zone and keep Wes in his own safety zone.</p><p>\u201cJust in case you were wondering,\u201d Lexi said, \u201cthe reason you\u2019re all jittery and sweaty and can\u2019t think straight is because you\u2019re crazy about him. Because you care. Because he matters. None of the others did. That alone should tell you everything you need to know.\u201d</p><p>That was information Rubi didn\u2019t need. And bringing it out in the open like this only complicated all her current struggles.</p><p>Yeah, she definitely needed some space.</p> <p>Eight</p><p>Wes stopped the truck along the curb in front of Lexi\u2019s studio, and the sight in his left eye blurred. Hard to believe he\u2019d been in perfect health when he\u2019d left here just four hours ago. No broken bones, no bruises, no blood\u2014all of which he had now, after a few hours with Bolton.</p><p>He was relieved to see a light still on at almost one in the morning and pulled his phone out to text Jax.</p><p>WES: Are you and Lexi up?</p><p>JAX: The woman never sleeps, which means neither do I. Where are you?</p><p>WES: Outside.</p> <p>JAX: Come in.</p><p>Wes pocketed his phone. The movement shot pain through his shoulder. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Rage kicked into a boil again. He was livid. In fact, he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d been so angry.</p><p>He put all his focus into moving without splitting his head open. The whole left side of his head and face throbbed with each pulse of blood.</p><p>Jax came to the studio\u2019s entrance in gym shorts and a T-shirt and jerked the door open. \u201cDo you need to go to the ER?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His disgust came out in that one word. \u201cI need ice and painkillers.\u201d</p><p>Jax turned away and started through the downstairs studio toward an employee break room. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fucker Bolton happened.\u201d</p> <p>Wes passed through the decadently appointed main salon where ornate wedding dresses lined racks on the walls and dressed mannequins. Everything in the studio was shiny marble and plush carpeting, upscale carpentry and thickly padded seating arrangements. This was, after all, a millionaire\u2019s mecca for the most elite, haute couture, and couture wedding fashions.</p><p>A full-length mirror caught his image, and Wes stopped. \u201cAh, shit.\u201d</p><p>He brushed at the blood on the front of his white shirt and cursed the producer of the film. Again. Wes had often played unofficial bodyguard to a star he was doubling. Personal protection was one of the professional hazards of a stuntman. Men who defied death and dismemberment daily were typically smooth mediators and confident fighters, which kept unruly fans away. Or, in Bolton\u2019s case, kept the actor reined in. But Wes had never doubled a star this messed up. Bolton seemed bent on beating every man he came into contact with and talking dirty to every woman within earshot\u2014all after just three drinks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m adding a new shirt to the bodyguard bill. MacKenzie now owes me over three grand in payoffs, and this is a fifty-dollar shirt. Oh, and by the way,\u201d Wes added as he eased to the corner of a desk chair and laid his forehead on folded arms, grimacing against the pain, \u201cI quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not quitting.\u201d</p><p>Wes lifted his head as Jax returned with ice in a plastic bag. \u201cWhy the hell not? You\u2019re not the only game in town, Chamberlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit up and stop whining.\u201d Jax laid the ice pack over his swelling eye, and Wes swore. \u201cHold it there, and I\u2019ll get some meds.\u201d</p><p>Jax turned toward the main salon and the stairs to the loft, but Lexi appeared with a bottle of Advil in one hand, a bottle of water in the other. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>The sight of her brought back Wes\u2019s other biggest frustration. \u201cWhat did you tell Rubi, Lex? She\u2019s trying to put the brakes on us again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jax barked at Wes. \u201cWatch your tone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d She looked at Wes. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything negative to Rubi. I said just the opposite. She has a tendency to turn things upside down when she\u2019s stressed.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed the Advil and drank half the bottle of water, now even more pissed he had no direction for his anger. Setting down the bottle, he muttered, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bolton?\u201d Jax asked. \u201cAnd what the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBolton\u2019s in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jax planted his hands on his hips. \u201cYou were supposed to prevent that.\u201d</p><p>Wes already felt bad enough. He slammed the ice on the desk and glared at Jax through his right eye. Lexi gasped in horror at the sight of his face. \u201cI could have if he hadn\u2019t had a fucking dime of coke in his pocket. Or if the woman he groped would have taken my money instead of pressing charges. Some things are out of my control. Besides, the fucker deserves to spend the night with lowlifes for starting the goddamned brawl that landed me this eye. And I\u2019m warning you now, if he tries to take credit for giving it to me, I\u2019m going to leave him looking twice as bad.\u201d</p><p>Lexi stepped between them. She wore white sweatpants that hit her midcalf with the word PINK curved over the ass in\u2014of course\u2014pink, and a matching pink tank. Her hair was up in a messy bun, her face pristinely clean of makeup. She looked every bit the sun-kissed Kentucky farm girl of her roots.</p><p>\u201cRelax, both of you,\u201d she said. \u201cJax, why don\u2019t you make whatever calls you need to make and I\u2019ll clean Wes up.\u201d</p><p>Jax ran both hands through his hair. \u201cThis is insane. I\u2019ll find a way to shoot every one of his scenes without his face in it if I have to. That\u2019s why you\u2019re not quitting, Lawson. Once Craig and MacKenzie get wind of Bolton\u2019s shit, they\u2019re gonna want to make you into the next fucking Hollywood star.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his phone from his pocket and stalked into a quieter area of Lexi\u2019s studio.</p><p>Wes yelled after him, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the next fucking Hollywood star. I just want to do my goddamned stunts without an asshole causing trouble.\u201d He fisted the ice bag and gestured toward Jax\u2019s back. \u201cCoke, dude. He was carrying a bag of fucking cocaine. Do you realize the mess that could have gotten us all into if he had it on the set? Or if he used before a fucking stunt?\u201d His blood boiled with the ramifications. \u201cSomeone could die.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he stopped yelling, the pressure in his head subsided, leaving a residual throb he felt all the way to his teeth. He groaned, closed his eyes, and let his head fall into his hands.</p><p>\u201cShh, Wes.\u201d Lexi\u2019s hushed voice instantly cut his tension. She put a hand on his shoulder and tilted his face up toward hers with two fingers. \u201cHe understands. He\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Wes let his anger ebb, closed his eyes, and blew out a breath through his teeth. \u201cSorry I got mad at you.\u201d He opened his eyes and winced. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to pin my mouth closed, are you? I don\u2019t think I could take it.\u201d</p><p>Lexi burst into laughter, her blue eyes sparkling. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that translate into forgiveness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive. I\u2019m going to get the tackle box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Wes groaned as she disappeared into the break room. \u201cNot the tackle box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Ted,\u201d Jax\u2019s voice, heavy with turmoil, came distantly from the other room, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s shoulders sank\u2014Jax hadn\u2019t called the director, MacKenzie, he\u2019d gone straight to the top and called the producer, Ted Rimer.</p><p>Wes put the ice on the desk and laid the left side of his face on the bag. Pain shot through his eye, his temple, his brain. \u201cThat fucker better stay in jail.\u201d</p><p>Lexi set the tackle box on the desk in his line of sight. \u201cQuite the little temper you\u2019ve got there, Mr. Lawson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupidity and laziness chap my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>She opened the huge box and pulled out all sorts of shit. Wes just let his gaze blur. Lexi had created the first aid kit shortly after she\u2019d started dating Jax and realized that every injured or troubled Renegade ended up on Jax\u2019s doorstep at all times of the day and night.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the fucking best thing to ever happen to that man,\u201d he mumbled. His cheek and tongue were starting to swell, and he sounded drunk. He wished he were. This would all hurt a hell of a lot less. \u201cActually, you\u2019re the best thing to happen to Renegades, period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me too. And I guess you Renegades are okay, even if you do keep trailing blood through my studio. Bring your head up.\u201d</p><p>Grimacing at the ache in his neck, Wes obeyed. Now that his adrenaline had receded, all the tweaks and pains were blaring like bright lights.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to become the best thing that ever happened to Rubi?\u201d</p><p>She paused her inspection and met his eyes, her gaze thoughtful. \u201cI...don\u2019t really know how to answer that. As much as I think I know what she needs, she has to be the one to accept things and people into her life. Jax is only good for me because I let him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot encouraging,\u201d Wes grumbled.</p><p>She soaked a cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide and wiped at blood on his nose. The skin beneath Wes\u2019s eye flinched at the sting. \u201cI don\u2019t think your nose is broken. It\u2019s pretty straight, and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s bleeding, but you\u2019ve got a nice cut across the bridge. Rubi will probably think that\u2019s all kinds of sexy.\u201d</p><p>Wes laughed. The movement sent pain shooting through his face, and he groaned. \u201cOh hell, don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d But there was humor in her voice. \u201cLet\u2019s see the eye.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Wes lifted the ice, she sucked a breath through her teeth.</p><p>\u201cThis I\u2019m not so sure about,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could have a broken something in there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t quit your day job, Lex.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a grin. But it melted away quickly, and her gaze went distant and worried as she continued to clean his wounds. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Rubi\u2019s father wasn\u2019t much of a father. And you know she never had a mother\u2014at least not one she remembers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut neither did you, from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that I didn\u2019t have a father and my mother was an alcoholic, but the kind of neglect I suffered was different from Rubi\u2019s. I had a little brother to take care of, and I had to mother my own mom when she was drunk. I was responsible for my family, which made me grow up very fast. Rubi grew up fast in an entirely different way. She didn\u2019t have anyone who cared about her and no one to care for. I was rarely alone, where Rubi was always alone. And, honestly, we both have similar issues when it comes to commitment.\u201d</p><p>Neglect.</p><p>That term hit Wes square in the forehead, confusing him. When Rubi spoke of her childhood it was in wild stories of how she\u2019d abused the freedom every kid wishes they had, not of being alone. And she\u2019d certainly had every material desire. Not the standard someone thought of as neglect.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and Jax are always together unless you\u2019re working. He\u2019s never been happier. What kind of commitment issues could there be?\u201d</p> <p>She lifted her brows with a smirk. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been bitching about the house situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you two just hadn\u2019t found the right fit yet.\u201d</p><p>Lexi mopped up more blood. \u201cHe\u2019s a prince. Finding the right fit isn\u2019t really the problem. I am.\u201d She sat back appraising his face, then going back to work on his temple. \u201cPart of my issues stem from growing up poor. So poor, some days we didn\u2019t eat. When we did, I saved most of my food for my brother. My childhood was spent in survival mode. I lived from one crisis to the next. That life was imbedded into me for sixteen long years before I left. Then I was on my own\u2014too young.</p><p>\u201cThat all makes me incredibly...miserly. My bank account may tell me I can afford an apartment, but my subconscious says no way.\u201d She waved toward the loft above the main salon where she\u2019d lived for years before Jax. \u201cMy subconscious says this is all I can afford because I never know where the next meal is coming from. Or the next rent payment. Or the next client. Every financial decision I make is excruciating. And no matter how much therapy I get, no matter how much my life has changed or how many zeros show behind the number in my bank account, there will always be a part of that kid inside me subconsciously living in a constant state of lack.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s chest had grown tight. His mind flashed between images of this beautiful, sweet, accomplished version of Lexi and a frightened little girl taking care of a drunk mother and young brother.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen Jax keeps taking me to these million-dollar homes...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt freaks you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something someone who\u2019s had a normal upbringing would understand. Even those of us who suffer from the fears don\u2019t always understand. A lot of the time, there is a constant inner struggle going on\u2014our minds telling us one thing, but our feelings telling us another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you and Jax...you two are solid, right?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was soft. \u201cWe are. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can just erase all my ingrained fears. I\u2019m still struggling with them, and Jax is doing a damned good impression of a saint, helping me with them too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how does this work for Rubi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe grew up with her father leaving her at the drop of a hat. And often without telling her. He just wouldn\u2019t come home. She lost nanny after nanny because her father is a bastard and a womanizer, so she never got close to any. He never showed up to a school event. Never showed up to any graduation, not even for the bachelors and masters he paid for. He never once remembered her birthday. As you can imagine, her early relationships with men didn\u2019t go well, because she\u2019d never been shown how a decent relationship worked. But all that has scarred her. The fact that she\u2019s pushing you away tells me just how important you are to her. Maybe too important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I be too important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to screw around with people you don\u2019t care about. There\u2019s nothing at stake. But playing that game with someone who fills a special place in your life? Someone who could leave a hole in your heart if he vanished? That\u2019s a huge risk. Even more so to a woman who is extremely sensitive.</p> <p>\u201cTake my relationship with Jax, for example. I still love Rubi the same, still love being with her, but now I\u2019m either working or with Jax. That doesn\u2019t give me much time with Rubi. She loves Jax and wants us together, but she\u2019s still struggling with a sense of abandonment. Where I used to be available to her anywhere, anytime, now I\u2019m not. On a subconscious level, she\u2019s reliving the experience of having the main person in her life, one who is supposed to love and nurture her, pulling away. So the threat of giving a relationship with you a try coupled with the threat of having it not work out and losing your friendship in the process...is pretty terrifying.\u201d</p><p>Wes laid his head back down on the desk, more confused and discouraged by the moment. \u201cWhat a clusterfuck.\u201d</p><p>Lexi ran the medicated cotton over the skin at his jaw, where some anonymous drunk fucker who had no business getting involved had slammed his knuckles. Wes grimaced and reflexively turned away.</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to trust after a lifetime of extremes. Rubi\u2019s either been ignored to the point where she felt invisible or showered with fake, suffocating attention. You\u2019re the first guy who really sees her. Sees the woman beneath her looks and attitude, and appreciates her uniqueness. I think that\u2019s both what draws her to you and what scares the shit out of her.\u201d</p><p>Wes sighed and closed his eyes, exhausted. All he wanted to do was lie down with Rubi curled in his arms and fall asleep with his face buried in her hair. The mere thought pulled the stress from his muscles. Christ, that sounded like bliss.</p><p>He wondered if that would fall into the friend category.</p><p>Jax returned from the other room, a pensive look on his face as he inspected Wes. Then he glanced at Lexi and ran a hand over her back. \u201cHow does he look?\u201d</p><p>She smirked and leaned into him. \u201cLooks like he got into a fight. I might be able to sew you guys back together, but I don\u2019t have X-ray vision.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his chin at Wes. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs good as I look. Why? What did Rimer say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says MacKenzie\u2019s told him you can act. Wants to know if I think I could coach you through the part.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cHoly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same pay as Bolton, but a hell of a lot more than I can pay you. If you wanted to act, dude\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. How many times do I have to turn down a role for people to know I don\u2019t want anything to do with acting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I understand,\u201d Jax said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be the one cheating you out of an opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how Harrison Ford got his start,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cFilling in for an actor when he was working on sets backstage. You could be the next\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d He turned his attention back to Jax. \u201cWhat\u2019s his plan B?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRimer\u2019s at as much of a loss as I am,\u201d Jax said. \u201cWe\u2019re halfway through filming, and I won\u2019t have the budget back in line for another few months. Recasting now would mean rerunning the scenes with the new guy, which would push us over budget again.\u201d Jax rubbed a hand over his face. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they\u2019d definitely be fucked. The realization of it showed on Lexi\u2019s worried expression. Jax had made a deal with Rimer when he\u2019d taken the job. Another stunt company had run the film twenty million over budget and been fired. Jax had accepted the job with the understanding that Renegades would get paid 10 percent of the money he saved the production company by bringing the budget back into line. Refilming meant Renegades would lose two million dollars.</p><p>Two million dollars that would allow Jax to hire more stuntmen. Allow Jax more time with Lexi. Allow the company to grow and give them all steady, well-paying jobs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it work.\u201d Wes pushed to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll beat the guy into submission if I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRimer\u2019s leaving him there for the night,\u201d Jax said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a guy\u2014part counselor, part ass-kicker\u2014to spend a day with him tomorrow. We\u2019ll have to switch up the filming schedule.\u201d He rubbed his hand along his jaw as he looked Wes up and down. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re going to be in any shape to pick up more action scenes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell you say.\u201d Wes puffed up his chest and fisted his hands at his sides.</p><p>Jax grinned. \u201cKnock it off. You\u2019re going to hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>Wes sagged and winced, rolling his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGo on home,\u201d Jax said. \u201cSleep in tomorrow. I\u2019ll be revamping the schedule all morning.\u201d</p><p>Wes nodded and started toward the door but knew sleep wouldn\u2019t come easily tonight.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Rubi sank deeper into her plush sofa and spooned another mouthful of limited-edition Triple Chocolate Swirl H\u00e4agen-Dazs past her lips. The rich, decadent flavor of dark chocolate coated her mouth, and her eyes rolled back in pleasure. Hardly a substitute for the taste and feel of Wes\u2019s mouth, but...</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen him or talked to him or texted him in almost twenty-four hours now. The longest they\u2019d been apart in two months. He was giving her the space she\u2019d told him she needed, but it didn\u2019t feel anywhere near as good as she\u2019d thought it would. Nor was it as easy as she\u2019d thought it would be. Especially not since Wes had moved into the bottom floor of Jax\u2019s house, just two miles down the beach. He was way too close. Way too accessible. And keeping her distance was...torturous.</p><p>She glanced down at the note he\u2019d left on her car that morning, one she\u2019d found in her pocket earlier.</p><p>WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES ALL I CAN SEE</p><p>IS YOU IN RED LEATHER.</p><p>On the sofa, at Rubi\u2019s side, her pup scooted closer and laid his adorable head on her thigh. A mix of lab, pit, and boxer, Rodie had a brindle-and-white face, big golden eyes, and lopsided ears that instantly lifted Rubi\u2019s mood, no matter what issues plagued her.</p><p>\u201cSorry, baby,\u201d she said. \u201cAm I ignoring you?\u201d</p><p>She laid her spoon against the carton\u2019s lid on the side table and ran her hand over Rodie\u2019s smooth head. Her gaze traveled over the still images of Wes\u2019s fight practice with Keaton from the day before where she\u2019d storyboarded them on a corkboard across the living room.</p><p>Wes\u2019s intense expression absorbed her attention. So focused. So fierce. It sent tingles of heat low in her belly. Her gaze drifted over his body, his stance strong, one hand fisted near his face, the other arm outstretched in a strike. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sighed, and doubt over any decision she\u2019d made or might make in the future nagged. Damned if she did, damned if she didn\u2019t.</p><p>She let out a long, disgusted-with-herself sigh. Rodie imitated her, drawing her gaze to his. Leaning forward, she kissed Rodie\u2019s muzzle. His slim tail wagged, and his tongue swept across her chin.</p><p>\u201cYour turn.\u201d Rubi set her carton on the side table and picked up his doggie dessert. Rodie licked his muzzle in anticipation.</p><p>She fed him a spoonful over the towel covering her leg, grinning at the way the strawberry-ice-cream-like treat coated his black whiskers until he got around to licking them clean.</p> <p>Love filled her heart, the feeling so sweet, so consuming, tears rose to her eyes.</p><p>She absently scooped another heap of the doggie dessert for Rodie, watching as he gave himself a pink mustache while licking it off the spoon. But her mind was mulling over Lexi\u2019s words from the night before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re living off a script you put in your head a long time ago, one that doesn\u2019t apply to who you\u2019ve become.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, but change that involved personal risk was no easy feat. Sure, Rubi would push her new Aston over a hundred and fifty miles an hour for an adrenaline rush, she\u2019d screw a new guy, a virtual stranger now and then, she\u2019d rather work for herself than for a secure company, but those were all relatively calculated risks\u2014and none, not one, involved her emotions. She didn\u2019t take risks with her emotions. And that was exactly what Wes wanted her to do. What Lexi pushed her toward. As if they both wanted her to continue her high-wire trapeze act after they\u2019d taken away the safety net.</p><p>She set the ice cream on the table beside the sofa. \u201cEnough thinking. Let\u2019s put this stuff away before we make ourselves sick.\u201d</p> <p>As soon as she uncurled her feet from beneath her, Rodie jumped off the sofa, trailing her into the kitchen.</p><p>She opened the freezer at the same time she realized she\u2019d forgotten the lids and spoons. As she turned toward the living room, a ping-ping sounded near the sliding glass doors leading to the deck and Malibu Beach beyond. The odd sound raised the hair on the back of her neck, and she immediately glanced at Rodie. He\u2019d heard it too. His head turned that direction, his lopsided ears perked, his sleek, seventy-pound body of muscle tense.</p><p>Her heart kicked, but she talked herself down under the pretense of soothing Rodie, while shoving the ice cream into the freezer. \u201cShh, baby, just the wind.\u201d</p><p>A storm had been brewing, and wind off the ocean often kicked sand against the house.</p><p>Still, without stepping from the safety of the refrigerator, Rubi reached for the lights over the sink, the only lights on in the kitchen, and shut them off.</p><p>Ping-ping-ping.</p> <p>A rolling growl started low in Rodie\u2019s throat, followed immediately by a vicious barking spurt. Rubi jumped. Fear skidded down her spine. Someone was out there. Rodie was never wrong. And he had his paws pressed against the glass now, his bark growing angrier.</p><p>Heart thumping, Rubi reached for her cell in her shorts pocket and realized she\u2019d already changed for bed.</p><p>Feeling like an idiot, sure it was nothing but some late-night beach walkers, Rubi bent to conceal herself behind the kitchen cabinets and scurried back into the living room. When she reached for her cell on the coffee table beside her laptop, it was already ringing.</p><p>She looked at the display: Wes.</p><p>\u201cJesus fucking Christ.\u201d Relief and frustration merged. She pressed Answer and said, \u201cIs that you giving my dog a heart attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d he said, the word filled with utter disbelief. \u201cYou have a dog?\u201d</p><p>It felt too damn good to hear his voice. \u201cA dog who\u2019s going to rip off your face when I let him out those doors. You scared us. What is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can have what\u2019s left of my face,\u201d he said, whatever the hell that meant. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t take you for a pet person. Maybe a cat, you know, some furry little princess, but a dog? Really?\u201d</p> <p>His total shock made a laugh bubble from her chest. \u201cYou asshole.\u201d</p><p>She disconnected and walked toward the glass doors, where Rodie was snarling and barking. She reached down and curled her fingers into his collar, glancing through the glass. The sight of Wes\u2019s face shocked an ugly sizzle of fear through her chest. She jerked the door open.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened? Are you okay?\u201d Rodie was still growling and dragged Rubi out onto the deck. \u201cRodie, no! Shit, Wes, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, baby.\u201d He sounded tired. Resigned. \u201cIt\u2019s old news. I thought Lexi would have told you about it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been busy all day fitting an entire wedding party, then went out to dinner with the family. What happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing important. Let Rodie go. He\u2019ll love me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a choice. Rodie pulled from her grip. \u201cRodie,\u201d she warned, \u201cbe nice.\u201d</p><p>She watched carefully, ready to grab him again as Rodie approached Wes in a partial crouch, the hair on his back prickled into a stripe from shoulders to tail.</p><p>\u201cHey, boy,\u201d Wes said, his hand extended through the deck railing, not the least bit unnerved. \u201cAren\u2019t you handsome?\u201d</p><p>Rodie growled low in his throat while cautiously sniffing Wes\u2019s hand. Wes was shirtless, wearing some kind of loose dark pants with a drawstring that hung entirely too low on that sculpted abdomen. And there was another bruise on his side.</p><p>\u201cMy God. I leave you alone for a day and look what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d Wes grinned up at her. \u201cThe only solution is to never leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>The thought that he might not have gotten into a brawl if she\u2019d met him at Lure instead of taking space made Rubi\u2019s stomach bunch. \u201cPlease tell me Bolton didn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was heavy with yeah-right attitude. \u201cIf he had, he\u2019d have gone to the ICU instead of jail.\u201d</p><p>That dark streak he flashed every now and then never failed to shoot hot lightning through her body. Yet, in the next second he was cooing to Rodie like he had a heart as soft as a cloud.</p><p>\u201cJail?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you use your bribing magic to keep him out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause security called the cops, and the cops found a bag of coke on him. No bribing him out of that. As soon as I saw uniforms, I stepped back and washed my hands of the fucker. I might be slow, but I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to filming?\u201d Rubi asked, immediately calculating the hit Renegades would take with a stall like this.</p><p>\u201cJax is working on it,\u201d he said while patiently letting Rodie smell him. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I probably look kinda scary right now, don\u2019t I? Are you keeping your mama safe? What a good boy.\u201d</p><p>His voice was smooth and light and calm. Within two minutes, Rodie\u2019s tail went from still as stone to a slight wag. Then his tongue lapped out against Wes\u2019s hand in a taste test. Rubi was about ready to do the same.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Wes asked, his grin growing. \u201cYour mama seems to like the taste of me.\u201d</p><p>Want fisted in her belly. Rubi clenched her teeth against the quickly climbing lust.</p><p>When Rodie licked Wes again, his laughter, light and joy filled, tightened her chest. Rodie\u2019s tail was now wagging ferociously, his tongue attacking Wes\u2019s face. \u201cHold on there, boy, my face isn\u2019t in any shape for that kind of attention.\u201d</p><p>While Rubi had been certain Rodie wouldn\u2019t bite Wes, she hadn\u2019t expected him to like the man. Rodie liked very few people other than Rubi. He was a rescue. A dog with a neglected puppyhood that made him protective and defensive, just like her. And, just like her, she realized with frustrated wonder, Rodie seemed immediately magnetized to Wes.</p><p>\u201cMan, you\u2019re cute.\u201d Wes scratched Rodie\u2019s neck. \u201cYou\u2019re all bark, aren\u2019t you?\u201d His gaze darted to Rubi again with that sexy, lopsided smile. \u201cLot like your mama, I think.\u201d</p><p>His gaze moved down her body, making her aware\u2014and embarrassed\u2014of her too-big, ugly T-shirt hanging to her midthighs and the crazy mess she\u2019d made of her hair when she\u2019d thrown it into a ponytail.</p><p>\u201cIf Bolton didn\u2019t give you that eye, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an angry drunk and started another damn brawl. Some other angry drunk got in a lucky shot while I was trying to stop the asshole\u2014Bolton in this case\u2014from yelling obscenities and making it worse.\u201d He pressed his thumb against his temple with a look of pain flashing over his face. \u201cI\u2019m sure as hell glad you didn\u2019t come over like I asked. I might have become homicidal if I was worried about you.\u201d</p><p>After a lifetime of fending for herself, it felt good to have someone care about her safety and well-being.</p><p>\u201cCome in, let me look at your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Lexi patched me up last night,\u201d he said without moving from his spot behind the railing, \u201cbut I\u2019d still like to come in, maybe get some Tylenol to layer on my Advil. This sonofabitch hurts more than it did last night.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cIf...I mean...I\u2019ve given you enough space.\u201d</p><p>Too much damn space. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down, then back to her face, unsure, and lifted the rig he\u2019d built for his brother from where he\u2019d been holding it down by his side. \u201cCan we...maybe...talk about this?\u201d</p><p>The tilt of his head, his open and hopeful expression, was the most adorable thing she\u2019d seen since Rodie was a pup. And all this desire welling inside her was probably really, really dangerous.</p><p>\u201cI knew I wouldn\u2019t sleep until this stopped throbbing\u201d\u2014he gestured to his face\u2014\u201cso I thought I\u2019d take the chance you were awake. I wasn\u2019t sure if this was your house or not. They all look so different from the beach. But when Rodie started barking, I was sure I had it wrong. I was afraid I might be spending the night in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d When she stepped aside to let him in, she saw shells strewn over the deck at her feet. \u201cYou threw shells at my window to get my attention? What are you, twelve? You didn\u2019t think to call first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He released Rodie and made his way to the bottom of the steps. His movements were slow and stiff. When he came around the banister, she saw he was barefoot, his pants rolled halfway up his shins and wet along the bottom. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d scare you. I\u2019m blaming it on the fight and a few rattled brains.\u201d</p><p>He paused, holding both sides of the railing as if giving her the chance to change her mind. But the sight of his swollen eye, the cut across his nose, that bruise along his ribs, turned her stomach inside out.</p><p>\u201cOh, Wes.\u201d She wanted to undress him, lay him on her featherbed, and kiss away every ache and pain. \u201cDid you go to the ER? You could have some breaks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. Really. In the scheme of things, this is minor. If anything\u2019s broken, it\u2019s not something they could fix or cast. I\u2019ve broken enough bones to know. But if my injuries make you go all soft, I\u2019ll take any pampering you want to give.\u201d He climbed the steps slowly, and Rodie went to meet him, tail wagging. \u201cTell me about this monster pup of yours.\u201d He reached down and scratched Rodie\u2019s head, the dog\u2019s lopsided ears waggling with the movement. \u201cThose ears kill me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know. Every time I look at him, I smile. I can\u2019t help myself. He\u2019s so damned adorable I can\u2019t imagine someone just locking him in a yard and leaving him.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s gaze fastened on her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy who owned him as a puppy before he was taken away. More of a fucking animal than Rodie ever was. He put Rodie in a cement yard surrounded by chain link and just left him. Threw him food and water once a day and that was it. Rodie was out there alone twenty-four hours a day for the first six months of his life. Just a baby. Every time I think about it, I want to hunt that man down and chain him to the train tracks. Don\u2019t I, buddy?\u201d</p><p>The pitch of her voice in the last sentence brought Rodie\u2019s head up, and Rubi leaned down to meet Rodie\u2019s kiss.</p> <p>\u201cA rescue,\u201d Wes said, a half grin of understanding on his face. \u201cSomehow, that makes perfect sense. Was his name Rodie when you got him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was never spoken to, so he didn\u2019t respond to anything. I renamed him Gerodi, Italian for hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHero,\u201d he laughed to Rodie. \u201cBut no pressure, buddy. What is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMutt, like me.\u201d</p><p>Wes crouched on the deck and scrubbed Rodie\u2019s body with both hands while Rodie panted, a look of bliss on his face. \u201cWell, he\u2019s a handsome mutt. And big. What, sixty-five, seventy pounds?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust under seventy when I took him to the vet last month. Are you a dog whisperer in your spare time? I\u2019ve never seen him take to anyone like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrew up on a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFarm,\u201d she finished for him, crossing her arms with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>The wind sprayed sprinkles across the deck, and Rubi turned inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to see your house,\u201d Wes said. \u201cIs it as amazing as Jax\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>He stepped into the kitchen, and Rubi called Rodie in, then closed the door behind him.</p> <p>A slow, low whistle slid through Wes\u2019s teeth. \u201cDamn, girl.\u201d</p><p>Rubi glanced over the awesome kitchen space. Working at home, she spent a lot of time looking at the black-and-gold granite counters, polished slate floors, and rich walnut cabinetry, and never got tired of it. She\u2019d lived in a lot of nice places, all around the world, but this\u2014this was the only one that had ever felt like home.</p><p>He ambled in, sliding one of those talented hands across the smooth granite island at the center of the kitchen. \u201cI knew you made bank with your apps and programs, but...not quite this much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not mine. I thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her as he neared the table in the breakfast area. \u201cFor as well as we know each other, it seems there\u2019s a lot left to learn. Whose is it? Do you rent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of Dolph\u2019s two dozen homes.\u201d Rodie wandered to Wes\u2019s side, and he absently leaned down to scratch his ears, creating that blissful look on Rodie\u2019s face. Wes had definitely passed the Rodie test\u2014one more reason for Rubi to fall for him. \u201cI moved in a year ago, when my condo building was converted into luxury town homes, which I didn\u2019t want to buy in to. He\u2019s never even stepped foot in this house since he bought it. It was vacant for years before I moved in. I don\u2019t even know why he keeps it. I never planned on staying, but...now I love it. I don\u2019t want to live anywhere else. I\u2019ve tried to buy it from him, but...\u201d She shrugged. She really didn\u2019t want to get into that now. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll let go of it someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could see how it would be hard to leave a place like this.\u201d Wes laid the rig on the table. \u201cIt still so weird to hear you call your father Dolph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a strange nickname for Rudolpho, but everything he does is strange. And honestly, I think he changed it because Rudy is too close to Rubi and he\u2019s always wanted as little to do with me as possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I mean... Never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I don\u2019t call him Dad?\u201d she asked. When Wes nodded, she said, \u201cWell, he\u2019s never been a father, let alone a dad. I\u2019d never call him either.\u201d</p><p>Reaching in the nearest cabinet, she pushed aside the Advil and pulled down a bottle of Tylenol, offering it to him. Then grabbed water from the fridge, returning to hand him the bottle.</p><p>With Rodie snuggling up to Wes like he was a long lost friend, Wes popped and downed the pills. She glanced at the rig, taken aback by its streamlined construction. \u201cLet me go change, and we can talk about this.\u201d</p><p>When she turned, Wes caught her arm and pulled her into his body. She tensed, her hands pressing against his warm chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing more than you were at the club. A hell of a lot more than that corset last night, which was mind-blowingly hot, by the way. Tell Lexi I\u2019ll be her first sale.\u201d</p><p>She slanted a saucy smile. \u201cYou\u2019d look amazing in red.\u201d</p><p>He snorted a laugh, turned her toward the table, and eased her in front of him, wrapping her in his arms and setting the water on the table. With his chin on her shoulder, both of them looking down at the rig, he pressed his face to the curve of her neck. \u201cI\u2019d buy it for you,\u201d he murmured against her skin. \u201cBut I\u2019ll wear red if it turns you on.\u201d</p><p>His mouth eased over her skin while Rodie tried to push in between them at their feet. She relaxed into Wes. Her eyes slid closed, head tilted back to rest on his shoulder. She felt enrobed in his heat, his strength. She felt safe and loved and appreciated\u2014things she\u2019d never felt in a man\u2019s arms before. She\u2019d felt sexy, desired, and needed\u2014physically\u2014with men in the past, but this was so different. So deliriously decadent.</p><p>And she was in deep, deep trouble. Because she wanted him more than she wanted to turn him away. His warm, hard chest pressed to the thin shirt on her back. He kept his hips against hers, his erection riding the low curve of her spine, and she wished there was nothing between them. Wished she could feel the length of him at her back, skin to skin.</p><p>\u201cGod you feel good. I feel like I haven\u2019t seen you in days,\u201d he said, his chin on her shoulder again. \u201cDid you get enough space?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d That little burn of panic started along her breastbone. \u201cI...don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I usually know exactly what I want. But I\u2019m so torn, and I\u2019m confused. It\u2019s not fair to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and kissed her, just a press of lips to shut her up. But the kiss turned instantly hungry, like that one taste had given them both reminders of what they\u2019d been missing. Wes\u2019s tongue searched her mouth, and Rubi didn\u2019t resist like she should have. She tilted her head back and opened to him, relishing the sound of need vibrating in his throat. Then he pulled away just as quickly as he\u2019d kissed her, leaving her lightheaded and lost.</p><p>\u201cOh, yum. You taste like chocolate.\u201d He pressed his face to her neck again, one hand deep in her hair, clenching, releasing, clenching, as if he were trying to get hold of himself. Then pulled back and looked into her eyes. \u201cBaby, try not to think too much, okay? Let\u2019s just enjoy being together for now.\u201d</p><p>She returned her attention to the table, but his body was still plastered to the length of hers. \u201cI can\u2019t think like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus, precious.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>Glancing over the rig again, Rubi was surprised by the addition of knee hinges. \u201cYou\u2019ve done some work on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I was giving you space,\u201d Wes said, his voice wry. \u201cI guess something positive came out of it.\u201d</p><p>A startled type of joy tingled in her chest\u2014he\u2019d taken her advice. She felt strangely...validated. Though hundreds of clients had paid her big bucks just to get her take on a project, the fact that Wes had done it warmed her in a way no paid project ever had.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think of the knee hinges?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re good.\u201d He reached around her and worked one of the hinges open, tilting the apparatus so they could look directly into the space. \u201cThis one is the spring design, because that\u2019s what I had on hand. But I added electromagnetic mechanisms to the ones at the hip to try them out. It\u2019s a supersimple unit I rigged from a car starter.\u201d</p><p>Rubi shook her head, a slow smile growing. \u201cIf I said your ingenuity was making me hot, that would be weird, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, if it makes you hot, and I\u2019m doing it, that\u2019s not weird.\u201d</p><p>He could make her smile so easily.</p><p>Inside the hinge, the space was small, maybe three inches in diameter, with two rings of metal layered on top of each other, springs hooked to the discs and something small and mechanical at the center.</p><p>She recognized the rings as the pivoting pieces. The springs as the leverage. But pointed at the center mechanical device. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA motor.\u201d</p><p>She glanced sideways and found his cheekbone less than an inch from her lips. \u201cI thought you had it in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. But I tried out your suggestion and added motors at each hinge to see if that would increase the strength of the pivot. It worked, but not nearly as much as I\u2019d hoped. The physical therapist said the best rig won\u2019t interfere with normal motion, so I\u2019m trying to keep it small. She also said it was important for the rig to keep from causing other physical problems.\u201d</p><p>Damn. She was getting all soft again. He\u2019d tried both her suggestions. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess if the rig makes Wyatt use other parts of his body in abnormal ways, he could develop problems with his hips, upper spine, shoulders, even his neck. So she said the rig should be as small and as close to the human form as possible. The back piece\u201d\u2014he pointed to the area that connected the two thigh pieces and settled at the base of the spine\u2014\u201chouses the battery, which has an AC connector for recharging. Before I tried the smaller motors, it also held one larger motor that controlled the hinges remotely.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the configuration of the apparatus with a kind of wonder. All the metal was machined to ultrasmooth planes. All the screws and connection plates were recessed. Every plastic cover to the hinges fit perfectly. The damn thing looked like it had been made at a production plant and just pulled from its shipping box.</p><p>\u201cWho helped you build this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s... Shit, Wes, this is way more sophisticated than I thought. This had to be machined, engineered, built...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy\u2019s dad has a machine shop and lets me use it in off hours, nights, weekends, that kind of thing. I engineered it. Have to get some use out of that expensive education, right? As far as building it, I kept it as simple as possible. A few screws, a weld here and there. I\u2019m a KISS kind of guy. It\u2019s sort of my life philosophy.\u201d</p><p>Wonder...no, awe...flooded her. She turned her head and found his lips right there, less than an inch away. So damn kissable. \u201cYour education? What kind of education?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEngineering.\u201d</p><p>She leaned sideways, trying to get a better look at him. \u201cYou have a degree in engineering? From where?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUniversity of Science and Technology in Missouri.\u201d He grinned down at her. \u201cNot USC, but I did okay.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I went to USC? And why aren\u2019t you an engineer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJax told me. And because it\u2019s boring as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you major in it?\u201d</p> <p>He grew thoughtful, his gaze turning back to the rig. \u201cMy dad thought I had a talent for it. Could fix everything on the farm, repair any kind of machinery from a bent shovel to a state-of-the-art tractor. And I loved to build things. Took welding, woodshop, and automotive all through high school.\u201d His voice was soft, contemplative. \u201cI\u2019m realizing I\u2019ve lived a lot of my life to please my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d she asked, thinking of how much of her life she\u2019d done the same\u2014and failed every damn time.</p><p>Wes laughed, but the sound was self-deprecating. \u201cRight up to the day I told them my plans in Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, turning back to the rig, \u201cbased on your rig design for Wyatt, I\u2019d have to agree with your father on the aptitude part. You\u2019ve got something really amazing here.\u201d She glanced at him again. \u201cDo you realize that?\u201d</p><p>The look he cast her was so deep, so genuine, and so...meaningful was the only way she could describe it, something twined around the pit of her stomach and squeezed. But the resulting sensation that oozed through her body was one of bondage, as if he were reaching inside her and tying off her lungs.</p> <p>The twist of panic was familiar, but in a distant way. She hadn\u2019t let anyone this close in so damn long she couldn\u2019t gauge its severity. Couldn\u2019t tell if it was the kind that would fade in an instant or the kind that hung on, seeped in, and choked her when she least expected it.</p><p>His arms tightened around her, and his mouth lowered to her shoulder again. \u201cI\u2019m well aware I\u2019ve got something amazing right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Wes.\u201d She covered his arms and had to fight not to pry them away with some lousy excuse to get room. \u201cI know craftsmanship when I see it, and this is really special. Have you thought of selling it?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never suggest he do business with her father, but her mind was already stirring up ways to at least use Dolph to gauge the market interest for the rig.</p><p>Wes pressed closer, and the way he fit so perfectly to her every curve and dip made her mind blur around the edges. His hands released her waist and slid toward her belly. Sizzles erupted lower and gathered between her legs.</p><p>His chuckle said the thought was ridiculous. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not interested in selling this thing. It\u2019s just another one of my crazy-ass inventions. All I want is something that\u2019s going to work for Wyatt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou two are close, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my big brother.\u201d His tone was soft, filled with meaning as if that statement should have said everything. \u201cI\u2019ve idolized him my whole life. My parents would never admit it, but I know they wished I\u2019d turned out more like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he must be something extra special, because it\u2019s impossible for me to imagine what more they could want in a kid.\u201d She ran her hands over his arms, turned her head, and kissed his cheek. His scruff was long enough to be soft beneath her lips. \u201cBecause you\u2019re a good man, Wes.\u201d</p><p>She deliberately extricated herself from his hold and sidestepped until they were three feet apart before she picked up the rig from the table and held it out to him. \u201cShow me how it fits to you again.\u201d</p><p>A grin slanted across his mouth as he took the rig from her, his gaze sliding over the shirt clinging to her curves. \u201cWill you get on your knees for me?\u201d He swung the rig behind him, settled the crossbar low on his spine and the metal arms down the outsides of his thighs. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to strap me in while I hold it in place.\u201d</p><p>She took the straps attached to the crossbar at his hips and pulled them to the center of his body, pressing the Velcro together. Heat wafted off his body along with the scent of pure Wes and the ocean. If she didn\u2019t lower to her knees to get the straps of the thighs secured, she\u2019d have to bend over, which would expose her bare breasts beneath the too-big T-shirt.</p><p>She chose the lesser of the two evils and lowered to her knees.</p><p>\u201cOh baby,\u201d Wes murmured, his voice low and tight. \u201cDo you have any idea what that does to me?\u201d</p> <p>The same thing it does to me.</p><p>She glanced at the thick, rigid line his erection created beneath his pants, remembered the feel of it in her hand. Against her ass. And grew wet. \u201cI...think I might.\u201d But changed the subject quickly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your next step with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork those pants a little lower in front of your cute little nose, and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>The will to keep him at arm\u2019s length\u2014okay, maybe finger\u2019s length at the moment\u2014was quickly fading. It took so much damn thought and effort. So much more than she had to give any other man.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re crazy about him. Because you care. Because he matters. None of the others did. That alone should tell you everything you need to know.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s words filled her head, and she suddenly forgot why\u2014exactly\u2014she was holding him away instead of grabbing this damn contraption and using it to haul his cock into her mouth.</p><p>The thought caused an unexpected bubble of laughter to roll from her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She lifted her gaze to his. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and skimmed the back of one finger over her cheek. \u201cGive me a peek into that wicked mind, precious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous.\u201d She was growing freaking sick and tired of thinking about why she couldn\u2019t allow herself to have this decadent man. \u201cSo where are you going with this contraption next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you could tell me. I\u2019ve taken it as far as I can on my own, and even implementing your suggestions, which were amazingly intuitive, by the way, it\u2019s still not what I envisioned, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be what Wyatt needs.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her lower lip through her teeth as she finished securing the remaining straps. She had her hands pressed to the inside of his thigh when she glanced up. His gaze looked more blue than gray tonight.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of untapped potential here,\u201d she said, slowing her hands to appreciate the hard muscle of his thigh beneath his pants. His thighs were rock hard and thickly muscled. Same with his calves. He had great legs\u2014all three of them.</p><p>\u201cTo make the hinges stronger and allow more control over their movement, I\u2019d suggest adding the computer chip I mentioned. You can use a software program to collect data from the muscle through electrical sensors on the skin. Then write another program to instruct the motors in the hinges to deliver two or four or a thousand times the energy the program collects and rotate the hinges.\u201d</p><p>Fastening the last strap, she inspected the rig, her mind unfolding connection ideas. A spark of excitement grew as she took a closer look at the canvas straps he\u2019d used. \u201cYou could use the same elastic belts they use in polar transmission to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Wes said. \u201cPolar transmission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the way those heart monitors work, the ones runners strap to their chest to determine heart rate?\u201d She waited for a nod, then said, \u201cThat\u2019s polar technology. It simply uses an elastic band to hold the imbedded chip that collects heart-rate data against the skin and transmits back to the main unit.\u201d</p><p>His gaze cleared, and a hot smile curved his mouth. \u201cIf I said your ingenuity was making me hot, that would be weird, right?\u201d</p><p>She laughed and sat back on her heels, imagining the setup. \u201cWow. Now that would be slick. If you imbedded the force sensors into the band, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about wires or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForce sensors?\u201d His eyes were wide, a little overwhelmed but intent.</p><p>\u201cForce sensors will give you more specific pressure measurements than regular ones, allowing for more complicated and precise programming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d he breathed. \u201cSay polar transmission and force sensors again. That fucking turns me on.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, pushed to her feet, and crossed her arms.</p><p>\u201cMove in it,\u201d she said, stepping to the side to watch the action of the uncovered hinge.</p><p>Wes crouched slowly, then straightened and bent at the waist.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said when the mechanism moved as she\u2019d expected. \u201cBut that\u2019s not how you\u2019re going to be using it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Melissa\u2019s given me a list of exercises he\u2019ll be doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis physical therapist. And for the first week or two, he\u2019ll only be walking when she does home visits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, walk into the living room, lie on the couch, and show me a couple of the exercises.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward the kitchen\u2019s exit. Rubi reached out and stopped him by the arm with a laugh. \u201cSlow down. Walk like he\u2019s going to walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPicky, picky,\u201d he teased, but slowed and shortened his step on the path to the living room. Rubi watched how the metal moved with Wes\u2019s body, watched how the straps interacted with his thighs and calves. So she didn\u2019t understand what Wes meant when he said, \u201cThis is an even more incredible view than Jax\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She looked up and followed Wes\u2019s gaze to the wall of windows that faced the ocean. Only one light shone in the living room, so the darkness outside wasn\u2019t completely masked by the internal glow. The ocean beyond and the developing white caps were fully visible through the dark windows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful location,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the ocean calms me in a way I\u2019ve never found with anything else. I love this house.\u201d She pointed to the sofa. \u201cLie down.\u201d</p><p>Wes turned a salacious grin toward her. \u201cI love the way you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I think I love it when you get bossy too.\u201d Wes glanced at the crimson velour and hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m sandy and wet... And just looking at that...makes me want to test this rig out in all kinds of unintended ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Wes stretched out, his long body swallowing the length. With a dramatic sigh, he clasped his fingers behind his head. The rig held tight to his pants, and they pulled lower on his hips, exposing that delicious area way below his flat belly button. Yes, definitely commando under there. Not a hint of boxer waistband anywhere.</p><p>\u201cLike what you see, precious?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, but it came out as a groan. \u201cThat body should be a registered weapon, Lawson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just made every five a.m. workout worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to work.\u201d</p><p>She forced her gaze to his legs as he pulled one knee at a time toward his chest. But the flex and release of his abs with the movements made her want to lick the dip and swell of every muscle on his body. Curl, release. Curl, release. She dragged her lower lip through her teeth. Lift, lower. Lift, lower. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She put up her hand in a stop gesture. \u201cFine. Enough. I have what I need. Just e-mail me a list of the exercises he\u2019ll be doing. I\u2019ll program the rest.\u201d</p><p>He rested his legs against the sofa. Kept his hands behind his head and stretched out. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Russo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d she said, voice heavy with sarcasm, and bent to take one last look into the open hinge. Wes reached out and grabbed her bicep so fast, she started at his touch. By the time she\u2019d enacted some resistance to his tug, it was way too late. Wes dragged her on top of him.</p><p>\u201cWes.\u201d Rubi dug her knees into the sofa, straddling his hips, and pressed both hands against his chest, trying to push off him, but Wes was too strong.</p> <p>\u201cRelax. Stretch out. It\u2019s been forty-eight long-ass hours since I felt that beautiful body against mine. Besides, my head is killing me. I\u2019m in no condition to maul you.\u201d All the humor had disappeared from his eyes. They were smoky gray and sensual, serious. \u201cBut a kiss would make me feel so much better.\u201d He eased her closer. \u201cJust...one...kiss...\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s mouth hovered within a breath of Wes\u2019s, his steel-blue eyes looking deep into hers. \u201cThis is really what you came over for,\u201d she said, \u201cisn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually no.\u201d He lifted a strand of hair off her forehead, then let his finger slide over her cheekbone, down her jaw. \u201cI came over to pick that amazing brain of yours, but baby, I think I\u2019ve just run out of strength to resist you.\u201d</p><p>A warm spot opened in her chest, and with it, a flutter of panic. She was thrown into that impossible catch-22 again\u2014wanting him, yet terrified of him.</p><p>And instead of continued coaxing, he simply lifted to meet her. His lips closed over hers in a possessive but gentle, kiss. And when his lips moved against hers, she couldn\u2019t fight the sensual feel of them. Or the craving that exploded at the feel of his tongue teasing her lips open. For a moment, Rubi forgot why she couldn\u2019t enjoy him. Forgot all about their differences, their challenges, all the reasons she needed to push him away. And her lips parted.</p> <p>His tongue slid into mouth like it belonged there, and he sighed into her mouth. An unfamiliar sensation washed through her body, one that softened her muscles and eased her mind. She released the lock on her elbows, sinking into the kiss. He had a beautiful mouth. A sensual way with that tongue. His hands came up and framed her face instead of feeling her up. He held her there while he lightened the kiss, pulling his mouth from hers to sip at each lip, then trail kisses over her jaw and behind her ear.</p><p>Tingles spread across her skin, and Rubi shivered. She shivered. She never shivered.</p><p>\u201cWes.\u201d She sounded breathless and dazed, because, well, she was. The panic had softened, overtaken by the soft intimacy between them.</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d he murmured as his lips started down her neck.</p><p>His teeth skimmed gently over her collarbone, and a sound ebbed from her throat, half sigh, half moan. Her sex ached, and she had to force herself not to lower her hips and press herself against the erection she knew was rock hard and waiting.</p><p>One hand moved down her back. She waited for him to grab her ass\u2014that would be what she needed to wake up. To do what she knew she needed to do. But his hand shaped and molded her waist, her hips, back up to her ribs, floated down her spine. Never going for the take. He turned his head and planted soft kisses to the opposite collarbone. Rubi forced her eyes open. She was dizzy with lust. With affection. That warm space inside her continued to grow, and with it, an intangible sense of dread.</p> <p>She needed to stop. He needed to stop. They needed to stop. Before this went somewhere it shouldn\u2019t and their friendship fell apart.</p><p>\u201cWes,\u201d she said again, searching for the strength in her arms to push back. \u201cWhat do you want from me? I need to know. Are we going to just fuck and be done, or are we going to stay best fr\u2014\u201d</p><p>He tipped his head back and kissed her mouth again. Hungrier this time. Fierce. Possessive. Despite the shot of need traveling down her spine, Rubi pushed back.</p><p>Wes\u2019s eyes eased open, heavy-lidded, and he gazed up at her through his light lashes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be either-or, baby. We can have both.\u201d</p><p>Rubi stared down at him a long moment while her mind struggled. \u201cYou can have both,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d A familiar steely determination settled into his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re damn wrong, Rubi. You know it, and that scares the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>Damn right she was scared. She couldn\u2019t think when he was close. He had a way of getting under her skin and making her believe. Making her hope. And belief and hope had always ended in pain.</p><p>Rubi needed to break this damn spell he cast over her every time they were close.</p> <p>She called in reinforcements. \u201cRodie,\u201d she said, still looking at Wes. \u201cKiss, kiss.\u201d</p><p>Rodie, who\u2019d been lying beside the sofa, jumped to his feet, tail swinging, and planted his paws on the cushion. He went for Wes first\u2014probably because Rubi was usually lying in that position when she set her computer aside and asked Rodie for kisses. His tongue rolled out and stroked Wes\u2019s cheek, his nose, his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh shit.\u201d Wes turned his head away, wiping his mouth with a grimace and laughing a groan as he released Rubi to fend off Rodie. \u201cNo. Down, Rodie. Stop!\u201d</p><p>As soon as Rubi climbed off Wes, Rodie jumped up, and Wes\u2019s laugh rolled from his chest as he tried to hold the seventy-pound dog away from his lower body.</p><p>With his arms wrapped around Rodie, and Rodie still licking his face in thrilled frenzy, he pinned Rubi with a hot gaze. \u201cYou coward, using your dog like that. You should be ashamed.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the hair that had fallen from her ponytail off her face. \u201cI like to think of it as smart, not cowardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPffft. Whatever.\u201d Wes pulled at the Velcro to take the rig off, while her gaze scanned that luscious body and she imagined him wrapped around her.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d His exclamation pulled her gaze up. He reached over and picked up the spoon off the ice cream carton\u2019s lid. \u201cThat\u2019s why you taste like chocolate. And eating straight from the carton, weren\u2019t you? Just admit it, Russo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you at least save some for me?\u201d</p><p>She waved toward the kitchen. \u201cGo ahead, take the rest home. You\u2019ll be saving me from myself.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, the sparkle back in his eyes. \u201cIf I can\u2019t have you, ice cream is the next best thing.\u201d</p><p>He jumped off the couch and disappeared into the kitchen, leaving Rubi shaking her head and smiling more than she had in months. She really had to get rid of him before she, he, they did what they both really wanted.</p><p>\u201cI should have known you\u2019d have some froufrou shit,\u201d he said from the kitchen around a mouthful. \u201cStill, ice cream is ice cream, right?\u201d</p><p>She rubbed both hands over her face before the comment registered, and she swung around on a gasp. \u201cWes, wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>She ran into the kitchen, took one look at Wes, and put her hand over her mouth. He had his back against the closed subzero stainless steel, a carton in one hand, a spoon in the other. He glanced up as she came in, licking the spoon, then dipping into the carton and pulling another pink mound from the container.</p><p>Rubi burst out laughing. She laughed so hard she doubled over, using the counter to hold herself up. She laughed so hard she couldn\u2019t breathe when he wanted to know what the hell was so fucking funny. She laughed so hard tears streamed down her face.</p><p>Wes chuckled at her with a perplexed look as he brought the spoon to his mouth again.</p><p>Rubi lunged, her hand reaching for him, laughing, \u201cNo!\u201d She couldn\u2019t reach him across the wide island, but his hand froze on the way to his mouth. \u201cStop,\u201d she said breathless. \u201cDon\u2019t eat...any more...\u201d</p><p>And she collapsed on the counter in hysterics. And because she still couldn\u2019t speak, made her way around the island to turn the carton in his hand so he could read the label.</p><p>\u201cDoggie...what?\u201d Wes slammed the carton on the counter with a, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be fucking kidding me,\u201d and turned to the sink.</p><p>With the tap running, he shoveled handfuls of water into his mouth and spit it out. He was grinning, a disgusted, ironic grin that was impossibly adorable and stretched Rubi\u2019s heart so wide it hurt. By the time he hit the water controls to turn them off, Rubi was panting, leaning against the refrigerator, arms crossed over her belly. She couldn\u2019t speak past burning abdomen muscles.</p><p>\u201cDog ice cream?\u201d Wes braced a forearm on the counter, one on the handle of the faucet. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know such a thing existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLactose makes...dogs sick, and Rodie...loves...ice cream.\u201d Her answer made him shoot her a you\u2019re-going-to-pay-for-that look. She held up a hand and started laughing again. \u201cYou\u2019re the one...who didn\u2019t read...\u201d</p><p>He spun toward her with hot eyes that burned through her body. With a hand planted against the fridge near her shoulder, he pulled the freezer door open and grabbed the other carton of ice cream. He read the front, closed the door, and wrapped an arm around Rubi\u2019s waist, sliding her body free of the refrigerator door and trapping her against him. He yanked the other door open with the same hand holding the chocolate carton.</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d He pulled something from the door, then slammed it closed. \u201cYou were seriously holding out on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand, holding both the uncapped ice cream carton and a can of whipped cream.</p><p>She grabbed for the can. \u201cHey, that\u2019s for my coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for my ice cream now. You owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe you. You\u2019re the one that ate the dog\u2014\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and kissed her. She made a surprised sound in her throat. His mouth was hard, his lips plush. He pushed his tongue deep, and as soon as it touched hers, Rubi went limp. This wasn\u2019t the sweet, slow kiss in the living room. This was forceful, breathless, toe-tingling.</p><p>He lifted her by the waist and set her ass on the cool granite countertop. Rubi gasped and grabbed his shoulders as the force of the kiss pushed her backward.</p><p>The pop of a top sounded, and he broke the kiss. Keeping a tight hold on her waist, he leaned away, tipped his head back, and sprayed whipped cream into his open mouth until it overflowed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. That\u2019s mine.\u201d She grabbed for the can, but he pulled it away. \u201cI can\u2019t drink my coffee\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grinned. The whipped cream expanded in his mouth, drifting through his teeth, covering his lips and dripping down his chin.</p><p>Rubi burst out laughing again. Her stomach muscles burned, and she sagged against him. \u201cYou look...like you\u2019re...foaming at the mouth.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to catch her breath. The aerosol squirt sounded again. Cold streaked down her neck, and Rubi jumped. Wes pulled her thighs apart and hauled her to the edge of the counter to meet his hips, then followed the trail of whipped cream with his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh...\u201d That was just... \u201cGod...\u201d</p><p>Wes growled and released her waist. Rubi caught herself with her hands on the counter behind her. Her heart beat fast and stole her breath. Wes jerked her shirt up, exposing her stomach and painted another line up the middle of her belly, navel to sternum. He pressed his mouth to her skin, warming the cold strip.</p><p>Excitement burned a path through the center of her body. She pried her eyes open to the sight of his blond head at her belly, licking and sucking the white foam from her skin, his eyes closed with a look of utter bliss. Heat pumped between her legs.</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d She groaned his name. \u201cJesus Christ...\u201d</p><p>He jerked her shirt all the way over her head and pulled it down behind her, trapping her arms.</p><p>Shocked, she struggled against the shirt caught between laughter and frustration. \u201cWes, what the fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d His gaze scoured her bare breasts. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He sprayed a circle of whipped cream around one breast. Her nipple tightened and the skin of her breast tugged toward the center, creating a delicious sensation. A moan rose from her throat. Her brain choked on the raw thrill.</p><p>\u201cWes, we shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He licked off a section of cream, and his tongue swept across her nipple. Her pussy surged with heat.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t what?\u201d he said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t be friends?\u201d He licked again, and Rubi fisted her hands against the granite. \u201cShouldn\u2019t enjoy the benefits of liking each other?\u201d And again. Her whimper echoed in the room. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck... Wes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite yet, baby. But we\u2019ll get to that.\u201d He licked a circle around her breast, then closed his mouth over her nipple and sucked.</p><p>\u201cShit...\u201d Her legs clamped around his hips and lifted into his erection. He groaned against her nipple and bit down gently. Lust stroked her pussy, and she suddenly, unequivocally needed him inside her. She didn\u2019t give a damn about consequences.</p><p>When she reached for him, her T-shirt restricted her arms. She wiggled, trying to free herself, but one of Wes\u2019s hands held the shirt at her shoulder blades, keeping her trapped.</p><p>He chuckled and doused Rubi\u2019s other breast with another ring of whipped cream. \u201cYou\u2019re as delicious as I imagined.\u201d</p><p>He dove in like a starving man, let his teeth graze her skin. Sensation burned through her, every millimeter of her skin on fire. She tried to find leverage to rub her hips against him, but had none. God, she couldn\u2019t take this anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou win. You win, Lawson. I want you.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head from her breast, a film of stickiness all around his mouth, his chin, his cheeks, and licked his lips. The whipped cream can hit the counter with a clink, but he didn\u2019t release her shirt.</p><p>He picked up the carton of ice cream and held it in her line of sight. \u201cDid you eat all this tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you want me and keep saying no?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders were beginning to ache. She repositioned her hands on the counter. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you wanted me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill want this?\u201d he waved the container.</p><p>\u201cNo. I want you. I just want you.\u201d She tried to lean forward to kiss him, but he held her in place. \u201cFuck me, Wes.\u201d</p><p>His body went loose. The cardboard ice-cream container hit the sink. Wes lowered his head and closed his eyes. \u201cYou have no fucking idea how long I\u2019ve waited to hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and met her gaze. His eyes were the color of storm clouds, deep charcoal gray. This skin over his cheekbones had gone tight, his lids heavy. He was the most beautiful man she\u2019d ever known. And nothing had ever felt so right as saying yes to him.</p><p>His hand lifted, his fingers sliding over her lips. They were cold, and she startled. Then tasted chocolate. She opened her eyes and found his fingers covered in ice cream. She closed her eyes again and pulled his index finger between her lips, savoring the taste of the melting dessert on his skin.</p><p>\u201cGod, what a mouth,\u201d he said, his voice raspy. \u201cLook at me when you do that.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and met his gaze as she pulled one finger from her mouth and sucked another in. His gaze was dazed, his nostrils flared as he watched. When she\u2019d licked them clean, she whispered, \u201cPut it on your cock.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved back to the carton but returned to her body, not his own. He pressed a handful of chocolate ice cream to the center of her chest and she gasped\u2014in both cold and shock. \u201cWes!\u201d</p><p>His mouth turned in an utterly wicked grin, and he slid his cold, slippery hand down her body. She half laughed, half moaned. When his hand pushed beneath her panties and between her legs, she screeched and wiggled away. \u201cWes, shit.\u201d</p><p>She clamped her thighs, but they were locked around his hips. His hand moved freely in the most bizarre, erotic sensation. The freezing ice cream, his warm hand, the slide, the way his fingers stroked her. \u201cOh my God. I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>He watched his hand disappear beneath her white panties with that sloppy, sticky mess. \u201cI\u2019ll never look at Triple Chocolate the same way again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Wes. Let go of the shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kinda like you helpless.\u201d</p><p>One side at a time, he dragged her panties off her hips and breathed a heavy moan when her pussy came into view. \u201cGod damn.\u201d</p><p>He yanked her panties off her legs and, with his gaze locked on her pussy, went for another handful of ice cream.</p><p>\u201cWes\u2014\u201d she said in warning, struggling to scoot back on the counter. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand pressed between her legs with a handful of cold chocolate. Rubi squealed, whimpered, pleaded. He ignored her. The touch of his hand was so deliberate, so confident, so perfect, the ice cream didn\u2019t even seem cold anymore. She was hot. Burning to have his cock sliding between her legs. She fell back on her elbows, and lifted her hips.</p><p>His fingers stroked, confident, sure, then he pushed deep inside. An electrifying cold streak mixed with the blissful pressure, and she gasped. It was like nothing she\u2019d ever felt before. And so strangely exciting.</p><p>He added another finger, and cold raced along her walls. His thumb caressed circles around her clit, freezing and stimulating at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWes, I can\u2019t...\u201d She rocked her hips, trying for more friction, and growled, \u201cGoddammit, Wes. Please.\u201d</p><p>A deep, hungry sound rolled from his chest. He released her shirt and gripped her hips with both hands, pushing her back on the counter. Her arm hit something near the cooktop, and it crashed to the floor. Nearby, Rodie barked, then whined. Wes spread her thighs with chocolate-smeared hands and bent, pressing his open, hot mouth to her pussy.</p><p>Heat pierced the cold tissues, shooting a thrill through her lower body. Tightening her nipples. The heat burned through her, sliding over her skin with a sizzling sensation. Her back arched in pleasure, and she slipped from her elbows, falling back on the granite.</p><p>Wes sucked all the chocolate he\u2019d smeared on her skin as if he were starved. His hums and growls and moans of pleasure filled the room, mixing with her own. His mouth was as amazing as his hands. He stroked her with his tongue, a slow, strong swirl around and a around her clit, just enough pressure and play to push her higher and higher, but not enough to give her release.</p><p>She lifted her head, and the sight of those strong shoulders holding her thighs apart speared a current of lust straight between her legs.</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d She lifted her hips, begging for more. Wanting, needing to come.</p><p>His eyes opened, dark and hot, and watched her as he opened his whole mouth over her with pressure and heat and the frantic, strong stroke of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Her eyes fell closed. Her back arched against the counter. \u201cYes. Yes.\u201d</p><p>Almost there, she was so close, just another few seconds of that tongue flicking and rolling her clit\u2014</p><p>His mouth disappeared from between her legs. Rubi was so high, she took a moment to come down and open her eyes. Wes\u2019s chocolate-slicked hands stroked her inner thighs, his thumbs rubbing the outer lips of her pussy. His dark eyes watching every move.</p><p>His handsome face was a chocolaty mess, but that didn\u2019t take any heat away from his fierce expression.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d His voice was rough, quiet, as if he were talking to himself.</p><p>\u201cWes, don\u2019t stop.\u201d She pulled an arm from her shirt and grabbed his wrist, the only part of him she could reach, and held it firm as she lifted her hips. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>He exhaled and his lids lowered in an expression of combined ecstasy and need. \u201cGod, I love hearing you say that.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stroked the chocolate over her pussy, then further, his fingers skimming her tight rear pucker. A joint jolt of cold and pleasure zinged across her nerves and made her gasp. Her muscles tightened.</p><p>\u201cMan, what a mess I made.\u201d His voice lowered to a greedy whisper. \u201cI\u2019d better clean this up.\u201d</p><p>And he lowered his head again. The sight alone lit off sparks in Rubi\u2019s belly, but then he slipped his arm under her thighs and hauled her to the edge of the counter. He levered her thighs over his shoulders, raising her ass off the granite.</p><p>Rubi flattened her hands on the counter for balance. \u201cWes\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then the heat of his mouth was on her again, along with his hands. Light exploded in Rubi\u2019s brain and she fell back, mouth open, throat closed. His fingers, his lips, his tongue, stroked and touched her\u2014everywhere. Teased her in the most sensitive, exhilarating places. Every fold of her pussy, the pucker he\u2019d toyed with at the club. His touch was wickedly decadent. And it all felt new. Wild. And naughty.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, yes.\u201d She used the leverage of his shoulders to lift into his mouth, into his touch.</p><p>His finger slipped back and forth over the area, slick with chocolate, while the fingers of his other hand worked gently, but deeply into her folds. His tongue tasted her everywhere, rough, gentle, teasing, working... But he ignored her clit.</p><p>\u201cWes, I can\u2019t...\u201d She lifted into his mouth and was rewarded with strong lips tug, tug, tugging at her clit. \u201cFuck, yes.\u201d</p><p>She reached forward and grabbed a handful of his hair, holding his head to her as she lifted. Sensation ripped through her pelvis and thickened at her spine. She cried out in pleasure, in need. He pulling against her hold.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t stop.\u201d She\u2019d never needed to come so badly in her life. \u201cPlease, Wes, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d His gaze watched her intently as his fingers slid up to flank her clit and pushed her folds fully open. The other pressed firmly against her pucker. The tight muscle opened with a flash of ecstasy through her body, then tightened down. \u201cRelax...\u201d</p><p>The soothing, almost coaching tone of his voice made an unfamiliar sensation twist in her chest. Something both uncomfortable and warm.</p><p>\u201cJust relax, baby, open to me, and ride my mouth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a tilt of his head, he pulled her clit between his lips and sucked. He eased his fingers deep inside her and pressed against that spot that made her back arch and pleasure spill through her body. Sensation bombarded her from every direction.</p><p>\u201cHoly...fuck...\u201d</p><p>Her fingers fisted his hair, her back arched off the granite and her hips pushed toward his mouth. Wes hummed in pleasure, his mouth and hands matching her thrusts, working her from every angle.</p><p>She cried out in mindless pleasure. Wes growled against her pussy. Tingling heat slid down her spine, coiling at the base, spreading through her hips.</p><p>\u201cAh, fuck... Wes...\u201d</p><p>The orgasm twisted through her body, cutting off her words. Her hand slid out of his hair and gripped the edge of the counter. She screamed on a shudder of ecstasy. Then floated on the high for moments that stretched and stretched.</p><p>Only when the very last tremor passed through her body and she\u2019d gone limp on the counter did Wes lift his mouth from her pussy. He kissed his way up her belly. And Rubi barely had the strength to lift her arm to run her hand through his hair. When he raised his mouth from her stomach, residual chocolate darkened his face, framing a gleaming grin.</p><p>She huffed a weak laugh, her body light and loose, her head floating. She brought both hands to his face and wiped at the sticky mess while he gathered her into his arms, wrapping her tight against his body, kissing her deep. He tasted of musk and chocolate.</p><p>\u201cI need to clean you up,\u201d he said, breathing hard, voice raspy. \u201cWhere\u2019s your closest shower?\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>With Rubi\u2019s sticky chest pressed to his, she kissed his neck as he carried her through the living room to a hallway, Rodie tagging along behind. \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThrough the bedroom. On the left.\u201d She licked a trail up his neck and pulled his earlobe between her teeth. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to feel you inside me.\u201d</p><p>Her dark whisper tickled his ear. Drained blood straight from his brain to his cock. She was the most exciting, most erotic, most exquisite woman he\u2019d ever known. \u201cGod, Rubi... What the hell took us so long to figure this out?\u201d</p><p>She hummed, the soft sound sated and sweet as she pressed her cheek to his shoulder. \u201cFear of regretting it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d He turned his head and kissed her temple, reassuring them both. \u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He passed through a massive bedroom with a four-poster bed. Rodie jumped into the center and curled into a ball. Wes turned left at the first doorway and found the master bath. The room stretched on forever with whirlpool tub, double vanities, marble floors. And a separate shower, an open design of colorful slate and glass with a million showerheads and a bench.</p><p>He set her on her feet and held her waist as he reached in to turn on the water. She was warm and lazy against him, pressing kisses to his arm, chest, neck, anywhere she could reach. So damn sweet it made him smile and ache at the same time. Her hand slid down his chest, belly, and pushed at his pants until his cock came free. Her fingers curved around him with a long, hungry moan.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d slipped out of his mouth. Bright lights lit off behind his eyes. Lust streaked up his spine. \u201cBaby...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have condoms?\u201d she asked against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t think when you\u2019re touching me.\u201d Wes pulled her hand from his pants and pushed the cotton past his hips, letting them fall to the floor. \u201cJesus, okay, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019ve got a body on you, Lawson,\u201d she said. \u201cCondoms.\u201d</p><p>His mind chugged, chugged, failed. \u201cAren\u2019t you on birth control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d</p> <p>He tested the water with his hand and stepped in, pulling her with him. Water hit him from every direction, and Wes put his face directly beneath a stream until his head\u2014and the chocolate\u2014cleared. Then he wiped the water from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI have some,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m clean,\u201d he said, curving an arm around her waist and pulling her back. \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex in three months and came back clear two months ago.\u201d</p><p>She turned her face up to his, those beautiful eyes hazed and heavy lidded. Christ, she was painfully beautiful. He couldn\u2019t believe this was happening.</p><p>\u201cThree months?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands over her small waist, the flare of her hips, around her ass. Smooth. Firm. Warm. Beautiful.</p><p>Heaven. Fucking heaven.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only woman I\u2019ve wanted.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her. She was soft, so giving, so fucking hot she blurred his brain. He needed to be inside her. Needed...</p><p>\u201cRubi,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>\u201cLet me get\u2014\u201d</p><p>He caught her arm, twirled her back, and took her face in both hands. Her hair was damp and midnight black, her eyes bright ocean green. \u201cBaby, do we need them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... No, I guess... I mean, I\u2019m clean too. I\u2019ve just always used a condom. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulled her mouth to his, kissing her with all the hunger he\u2019d built up over the months. While their tongues danced, he wrapped her in his arms, lifted, turned, and pressed her against the smooth rock wall. She opened her legs to him, wrapped his hips, and pulled him close with her feet at his back. The feel of her wanting him made his chest so tight, he ached.</p><p>\u201cI want to be different, Rubi,\u201d he said between kisses. \u201cI want to feel you. Every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>Reaching between them, Wes stroked the head of his cock over her opening, seated himself, then, unable to do anything else, he thrust. A sound bubbled from her throat, one echoing the delicious pleasure riding his own nerves. She gripped him with her heat, and his mind blanked out. His legs shook.</p><p>\u201cFucking. Perfect,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cGod...\u201d Her head tilted back against the wall. Plump pink lips parted. Eyes closed. So much pleasure tightening her face, need yanked at his limited control.</p><p>He retreated slightly, bent his knees, and thrust deeper. All her softness and heat parted for him. Then surrounded him. Clung to him. Squeezed him.</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d Her throaty approval corresponded with the pinch of her nails in his skin and jolted lust through his lower body. He pulled out to thrust again. And, fuck, had sex ever been this perfect before? Had he ever needed to come so fast?</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d she cried.</p><p>His body overrode his mind, and he thrust again.</p><p>\u201cDeeper. Harder,\u201d she demanded. \u201cFuck, Wes, more.\u201d</p><p>No, he needed to slow down. Needed to make this more than just a fuck. The same fuck she could get from any guy. Bringing a woman pleasure had never been so important to him. \u201cRubi...\u201d</p><p>She growled, tilted her pelvis so her hips pulled away. His length dragged against her supple walls, bathed in heat. Another fireworks display lit off behind his eyes. This time they extended down his spine, and he didn\u2019t have a chance to gather any control before she dropped both hands to his ass, dug her nails in, and pulled while thrusting her own hips forward. He sank deep, deep, deep into her lushness.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker.\u201d His voice shook along with his control. This was bliss. Sheer fucking bliss. Elation that filled him until he needed to explode with it.</p><p>She pushed into him again. And again. And again.</p><p>Her pussy a strong, wet, hot...deliriously perfect fucking grip around his cock. Her perfect breasts jiggling with each move. Need, lust, desire, they coiled and sang down his spine. Fire embedded in his groin. Tension grew across his hips.</p><p>\u201cRubi...baby...slow down...\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d found a rhythm. A perfect, hypnotic rhythm, stroking him long and deep. But a rhythm that would take him to the peak way too soon.</p><p>\u201cYou feel...\u201d She leaned in and kissed him. \u201cSo good.\u201d</p><p>Another zing pushed him closer to climax. He huffed a thick, dry laugh. He\u2019d never make it as long as he\u2019d hoped. \u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth sank into his shoulder. The pinch brought him back from the edge. To her nails digging into the skin of his ass. To the little sounds of growing pleasure. To the way her hips moved faster, harder.</p><p>\u201cRubi, wait...\u201d God, if she didn\u2019t stop... \u201cRubi, baby\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her legs tightened around his hips as she pressed her face into his neck. Her high-pitched sound of pleasure rocketed through Wes, speared his cock, and he was gone. He let go of the restraint with a deep growl, grabbed her ass and drove into her. He used every muscle in his thighs, his ass, his abdomen to gather strength for each thrust. Driving, driving, driving...driving so fucking deep.</p><p>\u201cWes... God... Please...\u201d She didn\u2019t make any sense, but he understood perfectly.</p><p>He clenched his teeth to hold out for her second orgasm. And, Christ, it was harder than the first. Her walls fisted around him with such perfect softness, he exploded. Spilled into her.</p><p>So base. So primal. So fucking hot.</p><p>His orgasm wrung through every muscle in his body, lasting for what felt like forever. The pleasure rampage trailed into deep, exquisite bliss...and a muscle in his ass cramped. Pain shot through his cheek and into his hip. He grimaced, shifted his weight, and huffed a laugh.</p><p>Rubi had gone limp. Her head tipped back, resting against the wall, eyes closed, arms hanging loose at her sides, muscles of her thighs soft around his hips. And her chest rocked with a chaotic mix of quick breaths and a hammering heart.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Lawson...\u201d she breathed, \u201cI knew it would...be like this...\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d expected a thrill, but...no, not that... God, how did he describe it? Animalistic, wickedly erotic, consuming... He might be a few brain cells short at the moment, but he knew without any doubt it had never been that good.</p><p>He held her up with his weight and what little strength he had left. Forced his eyes to stay open enough to watch her float back to earth. His smile stemmed from happiness spiraling through his chest and a deep, deep satisfaction\u2014physical and emotional. She\u2019d opened up to him. Trusted him. Taken a chance.</p><p>He wanted to spend the rest of the night rewarding her. Proving she\u2019d made the right choice. But he wouldn\u2019t press that issue. He knew it would be the quickest way to lose her. He could only hope she wasn\u2019t done with him now.</p><p>Wes reached up and angled one of the water streams between their bodies. Staying inside her\u2014where he damn well belonged, he\u2019d decided\u2014he poured soap into his hand and leisurely stroked it over Rubi\u2019s breasts and down her flat belly, making him remember the ice cream. Where the hell that wild compulsion had come from, he had no idea. He\u2019d never done anything so spontaneous. So ridiculously...decadent. So carelessly...playful. He couldn\u2019t imagine any woman he\u2019d been with in the past open to something so frivolous, so messy, so...fucking fun.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got an awfully cocky grin on your face, Lawson.\u201d Her soft voice brought his gaze up. Her eyes were open, but so heavy her black lashes concealed all but the sparkle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckled, lifted his brow, and shook his head. There were no words to describe their first encounter. \u201cThat\u2019s happy, not cocky. I\u2019m...truly speechless.\u201d When she didn\u2019t comment, just remained relaxed, a light, happy grin on her face, a little pinch of fear sparked deep inside him. He snuffed it, leaned in, and kissed her gently. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>Her hand came up to his face, the touch sweet as she curled her fingers and ran her knuckles across his jaw. Her eyes slid closed, and she kissed him back, slow, sweet, her tongue lazily making blood pool at the base of his cock again.</p><p>He knew he needed to be the one to leave before she suggested it. He needed to leave her while she still wanted him. Which, by the way her hand was tightening in his hair, would be now.</p><p>Damn, this had to be one of the hardest things he\u2019d ever done.</p> <p>He broke the kiss and pulled out of her grip when she tried to pull him back to her mouth. Leaning away, he let the warm water wash the soap off her skin. \u201cI\u2019d better tuck you in and get home so we can both get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>The disappointment that flashed over her face shot a hot stream of panic down his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>He lifted her by the waist while bending his knees to pull out of her. Sensation streamed over his cock, spread deep into his hips, and Wes groaned with the pleasure of it. \u201cDo you usually have guys sleep over?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to the side and looked up at him with the same alluring glance she\u2019d used the other night at the club. \u201cI never have guys sleep over. I\u2019ve never even brought a guy here.\u201d</p><p>His chest tightened, and Wes\u2019s breath left his lungs in a slow sweep. His mind warred\u2014one side telling him he should stay and cinch that third link in a chain of firsts for her. Another voice whispered that leaving like this made their sex just sex, when he knew he wanted more. Yet another told him that if he wanted this to be different for her, different than her previous encounters with other men, she had to be the one wanting him again. He needed to maintain control\u2014because she was the one who held it with every other man.</p> <p>That didn\u2019t calm his fear of leaving her alone to rationalize why they should never do this again. Or the sizzle of panic working its way over every nerve, urging him to stay.</p><p>He cupped her face and lifted her gaze to his. \u201cWhat do you want, Rubi?\u201d</p><p>Her hand stroked his shoulder, his bicep, her fingers curling around his forearm. Her face was flushed, her lids heavy, lips swollen. And he was growing hard again. Those beautiful eyes searched his. Then a furrow appeared between them, and she shook her head, her gaze dropping away. \u201cI...don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped. But it didn\u2019t break. This was a minor setback. No big deal.</p><p>At least that was what he told himself.</p><p>He turned off the water, sidestepped her, and pushed the door to the glass enclosure open. Reaching for a cabinet, he found towels and pulled one out. Wrapping the fluffy terry around her shoulders, he used the ends to dry her body, kissing his way down until he was on his knees in front of her. Her belly was flat, that diamond stud sparkling in her dark skin. Her waist curved in, then flared gently at her hips. A tiny triangle of dark, cropped hair decorated her pussy. He couldn\u2019t begin to put her physical beauty or sexual attractiveness into words. He only knew he could look at her forever.</p> <p>Fuck. Walking out that door was going to kill him.</p><p>But he settled the towel around her shoulders and pulled another from the cabinet for himself. After drying off quickly, he pulled on his pants, tucking his new erection away with a wince.</p><p>Rubi chuckled. She had her towel tight around her body now, her arms crossed, the nail of one thumb between her teeth. And the kittenish grin she shot over his body almost took him back to his knees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got that ugly early call tomorrow,\u201d he forced himself to say. \u201cAnd sweetheart, you wrung me out. I\u2019m going to head home.\u201d</p><p>He swung his arm around her shoulders and walked her out of the bathroom. As soon as they entered the bedroom, Rodie uncurled from his spot on Rubi\u2019s bed and jumped down to follow. Wes put his hand down to pet his sleek head.</p><p>\u201cI miss having a dog,\u201d he said, trying to ignore how amazing he felt. How satisfied, how comfortable, how...high. He felt like Rubi was in his bloodstream.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you pushing to stay?\u201d she asked, her voice matter-of-fact. \u201cThe wild-child type isn\u2019t as exceptional as you thought?\u201d</p><p>He paused in the living room by the sofa and took her arms, turning her to face him. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze darted away, and she shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret that I\u2019m not your type. Who knows what those sweet girls give you that I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her show of insecurity was a sweet blow to his chest. \u201cRubi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends, right?\u201d She laid her warm palms against his belly and lifted her eyes to his again. A thin shell veiling her expression. \u201cNo hard feelings if you...if this...isn\u2019t what you want.\u201d</p><p>Isn\u2019t what he wanted? Wes\u2019s brain tilted. What the...?</p><p>Then he searched her eyes again, and he saw it\u2014vulnerability. Such deep vulnerability, Lexi\u2019s words about Rubi\u2019s childhood flooded back.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that she\u2019s pushing you away tells me just how important you are to her. Maybe too important.\u201d</p><p>His chest constricted again, so strong it choked off his air. Still holding her arms, he dropped his head to get himself together. He wanted to jerk her against him and smother her with all the affection and attention she missed growing up. Yet, he was sure that would be the very quickest path to losing her.</p><p>When he met her eyes again, he could clearly see the brave front she\u2019d pulled up, one thinly veiling hurt beneath. Her lips parted, and Wes knew what she was going to say. Knew what she was going to do. She was going to push him away out of fear.</p><p>He pressed his fingers to her lips. Took a deep breath. \u201cYou are more woman than all my others put together. Your sexual confidence is the ultimate turn-on. And it lets me feel just as secure, just as free. More open than I have with anyone. Ever.\u201d He grinned to lighten it up. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly never considered smearing ice cream all over a woman.\u201d</p><p>The fear softened, and she smiled before lowering her gaze. \u201cThat was definitely...different.\u201d Her tone hinted that it had been different in a thrilling way.</p><p>Yes. This was what he wanted. He wanted to be different to her. Unique. Not someone she could replace with anyone she randomly picked up at the club. She couldn\u2019t just turn her back on him now and pretend things hadn\u2019t changed between them. Or even inside herself. A good start.</p><p>Now he just had to figure out how to hold on to this connection.</p><p>\u201cBut I get the feeling you might pull back into yourself if you have to cuddle with me all night\u2014\u2019cause, yeah, I\u2019m a snuggler.\u201d</p><p>That made her laugh, which pleased him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know it\u2019s going to be hard to believe\u201d\u2014he put his hands up in a stop gesture\u2014\u201cbut I\u2019m not this beautiful in the morning. This\u201d\u2014he gestured to the bruise around his eye\u2014\u201ctakes a lot of work to maintain.\u201d</p><p>Still laughing, she leaned into him and pressed her face to his pec with a kiss.</p><p>He ran a hand down her hair, closed his eyes, and kissed her head. \u201cI\u2019m loving what we\u2019ve got going here, baby,\u201d he said, softly, seriously. \u201cI don\u2019t want to push you too hard, too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said, muffled against his skin, nodding. Then she pulled away, crossed her arms, and pulled herself up. \u201cThanks for the triple orgasm.\u201d She waved toward the kitchen. \u201cNow get your sexy ass out of here.\u201d</p><p>Wes burst out laughing and pulled her close again. Joy pumped his ego. He just needed to be patient, give her room, and let her believe falling for him was all her idea.</p><p>He took her hand and glanced at the storyboard. \u201cHow\u2019s the app coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I gave the crash app to Jax for some tests. I just started on the fight app, but I\u2019m falling behind on that NSA project, so I might have to put a hold on that for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Guilt tripped in as he reached for the rig on the sofa. \u201cYou know I\u2019m going to pay you for your help with the rig, right? And if you don\u2019t have time, then...you don\u2019t. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth quirked. \u201cI can always squeeze in a little programming for a friend. I\u2019ll charge you the same thing I charge Jax.\u201d</p><p>Nice comparison to yank him right back to earth. Friends.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He nodded and started toward the kitchen sliders. \u201cAnd on that note...\u201d</p><p>Wes unlocked the door and stepped into the night. The heat built up in his body made the cool wind feel heavenly. Rubi leaned down, grabbing Rodie\u2019s collar to keep him from following Wes.</p><p>\u201cSorry, baby,\u201d Rubi said, petting him. \u201cI know he\u2019s cool, but you\u2019re all mine.\u201d</p><p>The simple act of standing outside her house kicked up nerves in his belly. He forced them into the background. \u201cSee you at the set tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll try. I\u2019m pretty backed up with work.\u201d</p><p>His gut tightened. He felt her slipping away. Started to wonder if this was it. If she\u2019d had her one time with him and he\u2019d never get another chance. But he nodded. Give her space, asshole. She leaned her head against the edge of the door, planted the toes of one bare foot on the top of the other. Her lids were growing heavy.</p><p>God, he wanted to grab her, slide under the covers with her, and tangle his body with hers as she fell asleep. He had to fight himself not to ask her to come to the set for lunch. Not to ask her out for tomorrow night.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said instead. \u201cBut Troy\u2019s going to light me on fire. If you don\u2019t come by, you\u2019ll miss me acting like a human torch.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cNow there\u2019s incentive.\u201d Lifting her head from the door, she stepped back. \u201cLater, dude.\u201d</p><p>Wes forced a chuckle at the purposeful get-lost-before-you-do-something-you\u2019ll-regret message in those words and said, \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Within half a mile of her house, all his doubts crept in. All the excitement and connection they\u2019d experienced faded. And his hopes for starting here and developing something more started a downward slide.</p><p>By the time he\u2019d reached Jax\u2019s house, the complex knot tightening his chest made him realize everyone else might just be right.</p><p>He might not be cut out for this kind of relationship.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Rubi stepped into the grand house overlooking the canyons of the Hollywood Hills\u2014the ninth house Jax and Lexi had looked at buying over the last two weeks. Jax and Lexi were either alone in the house or one of them had brought the Realtor because only Jax\u2019s truck and Lexi\u2019s BMW\u2014the one Jax had recently bought for her\u2014sat in the driveway. But the house was quiet, as if it were empty.</p><p>She glanced around the foyer and the open living room beyond. Jax sure knew how to pick \u2019em. This was a showplace with marble floors, soaring ceilings, thick cream carpet, and French doors lining the walls, leading out onto a deck looking out over all of Hollywood and Los Angeles beyond. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slid her hand over an ornate iron railing. Instead of vertical bars, the railing was a series of scrolls and curls. Truly magnificent set against all the light\u2014cream carpet, light marble, white walls. The iron circled a huge hole in the floor with a peaked skylight above, and guided a spiraling staircase down to...one, two, three...lower floors. And centered on the floor at the bottom of the stairway, a gorgeous terrazzo tile design.</p><p>Rubi whistled softly between her teeth. \u201cDefinitely makes a statement.\u201d</p><p>The sheer beauty of the house smoothed some of Rubi\u2019s rough edges this morning. She was having that dreaded buyer\u2019s remorse over sex with Wes, even though, logically, she knew the emotions were ridiculous. Even though she knew if she could go back in time and make different decisions, she wouldn\u2019t. She would do exactly what she\u2019d done with him last night all over again.</p><p>Her mouth tipped up when she remembered the note on her windshield this morning:</p> <p>I CAN DIE HAPPY NOW.</p><p>But mixed emotions tumbled through her head and heart.</p><p>She let the stunning home distract her from the irrational thoughts that would tear her in half if she allowed.</p><p>This place was so fabulous, it tempted her toward the idea of buying a home of her own. And a familiar frustration closed in when she thought of her current home. She wouldn\u2019t give up that house even for something as spectacular as this one. She\u2019d discovered she really needed to live near the water. It centered her. Grounded her. Calmed her. Soothed her in some intangible, indescribable way.</p><p>Rubi leaned over the railing and listened but heard nothing, so she started down a wide hallway. She passed an open library, a half bath, a huge guest suite...and heard Jax\u2019s voice.</p> <p>She wandered that way, admiring all the gorgeous detail in the house. The place felt like Lexi\u2014elegant but simple. Extravagant but understated. Classy.</p><p>Following Jax\u2019s voice, Rubi strolled through a truly magnificent office. Through the French doors at the end, she saw Lexi and Jax standing out on the terrace, Lexi in one of the sophisticated dresses she always wore at work\u2014her own designs, of course\u2014and pumps, her hair coiled into a sleek twist. Jax was in his worn jeans, biker boots, and leather jacket. The sight made Rubi grin. It also made her go a little gooey inside. As much as she missed Lexi, as much as not seeing her every day, not being her confidante anymore, left part of Rubi lonely, she wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. Jax was so good to her. He loved her so much. They were so perfect together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loving what we\u2019ve got going here, baby.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s words shot an extra jolt of emotion through her chest. That had been the most amazing sex she\u2019d had in...a really, really long time. But it wasn\u2019t just the sex that kept him on her mind constantly. It was him.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to push it out of her mind, and ran her hand along the decorative molding covering the edge of the floor-to-ceiling bookcases. She glanced at the huge wraparound desk, the plush desk chair similar to the chairs Lexi had in her studio for customers.</p><p>Outside, Lexi had her hands wrapped around the top of an iron railing remarkably similar to the stunner in the foyer and Jax stood behind her, his hands flanking hers as they looked out at the view.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only seven miles from your studio,\u201d Jax said, his deep voice rising with hope. \u201cTwenty minutes at the most, even in traffic.\u201d</p><p>That was a huge improvement over the drive Lexi had been making to Malibu\u2014forty-five minutes even with no traffic. And they did live in Los Angeles, after all. There was always traffic. Rubi knew the time Lexi wasted in the car had hurt her productivity at work, and it was really stressing her out. More stress on top of trying to manage a new line of lingerie and hiring new employees.</p><p>\u201cYou like this one the best out of everything we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Jax said, resting his chin on the top of her head. \u201cI can tell. You can see the Los Angeles skyline from the deck off the main living room. And I\u2019ve already gotten an estimate on what it would cost to make the pool into an infinite edge. We can look out over that view day or night from the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is...\u201d Lexi started, then paused. \u201cInsane, Jax. Six million dollars? I can\u2019t even fathom\u2014\u201d Anxiety bubbled in her voice. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this, and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s such a great time to buy. With what\u2019s happening on the set, if Bolton falls through and they have to hire another actor, reshoot the first half of the movie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, that\u2019s money for Renegades, not me personally, not us,\u201d Jax reassured her. \u201cThis place is worth nearly twice what they\u2019re asking. If it weren\u2019t in foreclosure, it would go for ten million. In a few more years, it will be worth fifteen. We don\u2019t have to stay here forever. Look at it as an investment I\u2019d miss out on if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d</p><p>Okay, seriously, Rubi couldn\u2019t love that man for Lexi any more than she already did. Which was why she kept her distance and gave them room to grow.</p><p>Jax released the railing and slid his arms around Lexi\u2019s waist. \u201cI know this must feel overwhelming coming from a lunch bag...\u201d</p><p>Lexi laughed and elbowed him at the same time, making Rubi smile. \u201cMy loft may be the size\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd shape,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201c\u2014of a lunch bag, but it\u2019s an affordable lunch bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAffordability is relative. This house is very affordable for me. You\u2019d feel better if you\u2019d let me tell you about my finances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lexi shook her head. \u201cNo, no, no. This is hard enough without knowing all the details of that filthy gold you\u2019re hoarding in some vault.\u201d</p><p>God that girl was as stubborn as Rubi when it came to their little psychoses or neuroses or whatever they were called.</p><p>Jax chuckled. \u201cBet the thought just makes your skin crawl, doesn\u2019t it? Bet it just makes you want to shed those clothes and do me in front of all of Hollywood, right here on the balcony.\u201d Lexi burst out laughing as Jax kissed her neck. \u201cDon\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p><p>Okay...time to break this up.</p><p>Rubi walked to the open door. \u201cNo christening the new house until you own it.\u201d</p><p>When Jax and Lexi turned toward Rubi\u2019s voice, she cast a careless gesture with one finger toward the back of the house that looked out over the canyon. \u201cDid I hear you\u2019re going to make that pool an infinity edge, Chamberlin? Because as is, it so won\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a diva,\u201d he said, \u201cand yes, we will... If we buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice move, Jaxy-boy.\u201d Rubi sauntered to their side with a soft click of her heels on stone. She stood next to Lexi and leaned on the railing. \u201cI approve.\u201d</p><p>A melodramatic whoosh of air exited his lungs, and he pressed a hand to his chest. \u201cOh, thank God. I can breathe now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might need to go back to acting if you keep collecting these multimillion-dollar mansions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get Lexi all stirred up again.\u201d He moved between them and draped his arms over their shoulders. \u201cI was just telling her what a great investment this would be.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her sunglasses back over her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s one way to look at it. And I have to say, this is the nicest place you\u2019ve seen so far. Really the only one I could see Lexi being comfortable in\u2014if that\u2019s even possible.\u201d She glanced at Lexi. \u201cThough I still hate the idea of you not being down the beach from me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Lexi sighed and squinted back toward the view. She exhaled heavily. \u201cBaby, I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Rubi,\u201d Jax muttered, \u201cshe was almost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for you not to move, Lex,\u201d Rubi said. \u201cI just meant I\u2019ll miss having you close more often. But I can still drag you out of the Malibu house for weekend runs, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jax said for her.</p><p>Lexi turned toward him and pressed her hands to his chest. \u201cJax...\u201d She cut herself off and bit her lip.</p><p>Rubi knew that sign. She was freaking out.</p><p>But Jax saw it and reacted before Rubi even had a chance. \u201cShh, it\u2019s okay.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll just keep looking. We\u2019ll find one that says \u2018home\u2019 to you, baby. Don\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>Lexi closed her eyes and pressed her lips together. With a quick shake of her head, she said, \u201cNo. I like this one.\u201d</p><p>He tilted her face up to his. \u201cI don\u2019t want to push you.\u201d</p><p>Jax\u2019s words echoed Wes\u2019s the night before. \u201cI don\u2019t want to push you too hard, too fast.\u201d</p><p>Lexi smiled. When it faltered, she forced it high again. \u201cSometimes pushing is a good thing. And honestly...\u201d She breathed in slow...breathed out slow... \u201cI need you to push me past these fears, because I don\u2019t want to lose you over them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby.\u201d Jax pulled her hard against him, wrapped her tight. \u201cYou will not lose me, Lex. Sure as shit never over something like this.\u201d</p><p>Rubi had to blink fast behind her sunglasses to clear the sting of tears from her eyes. God, this was just too much emotion from too many directions. She hadn\u2019t believed anyone could love Lexi as much as she did. They were best friends, after all. Family to each other. But Jax really did. And that made Rubi both ridiculously happy and horribly lonely.</p><p>Lexi smiled as Jax lowered his head to kiss her.</p><p>Rubi cleared her throat. \u201cHello, you\u2019re not alone out here. And if you two start shedding clothing, I might have to take some photos for the local rag.\u201d</p><p>Jax pulled out of the kiss and shot Rubi one of his pathetically unmenacing looks, then gazed down into Lexi\u2019s eyes. \u201cI have to get back to the set. Take your time. The Realtor said he\u2019d leave it open two hours for us and come back to lock up. We\u2019ll talk tonight.\u201d He pressed his lips to hers again, then murmured, \u201cI love you, baby. No matter what you decide.\u201d</p><p>He released her and started toward the house. But in Rubi\u2019s mind, she still saw the way Jax looked at Lexi. Still heard the tone of his voice. And couldn\u2019t help but remember the way Wes had looked at her last night. The tone of Wes\u2019s voice when he\u2019d spoken to her.</p><p>And Lexi\u2019s words now\u2014\u201cI need you to push me past these fears, because I don\u2019t want to lose you over them\u201d\u2014tightened a slow knot in Rubi\u2019s chest.</p><p>Jax passed Rubi with one glance head to toe. \u201cDon\u2019t come to the set like this.\u201d</p><p>She held her arms wide and glanced down at her sweater and shorts. \u201cWhat? The guys on set don\u2019t wear shorts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t wear shorts that short, and they don\u2019t look like that in them. Wes was already worthless on set all morning. He doesn\u2019t need any help.\u201d At the door, he paused and turned. \u201cBut you can wear what you want to dinner. Wes is grilling for us tonight. Come over about seven.\u201d</p><p>Rubi flipped back into her sassy cover, slid her sunglasses down her nose, and grinned at Jax over her shoulder. \u201cYou had me at Wes.\u201d</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t even wait until Jax\u2019s car started before she asked, \u201cAre things better with Wes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rubi\u2019s unease whipped up again, flooding her body with anxiety. She turned toward her friend and leaned one elbow on the railing. \u201cSo are you going to do it? Are you going to plunge in feetfirst and move into this six-million-dollar mansion with your beau?\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s enthusiastic smile fell. \u201cDon\u2019t try to change the subject.\u201d</p><p>She gazed past Lexi toward the opposite end of the canyon. \u201cYou should have some decent privacy here. Even if some jealous father of a rival designer hired a photographer again, he\u2019d have to have one hell of a lens or a death wish to get photos of you and Jax up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You know you\u2019re not getting out of here without telling me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk and talk,\u201d Rubi said. \u201cShow me this palatial new home of yours, little orphan girl from the white-trash slums of Kentucky.\u201d</p><p>Lexi turned with a sigh and linked her arm with Rubi\u2019s as they walked back into the office. \u201cIt\u2019s not mine. It\u2019s Jax\u2019s. Which is why I don\u2019t like the fact that he needs my approval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you interview those students from Parsons?\u201d</p><p>Rubi strolled down the marble hallway with Lexi\u2019s chatter about her new interns floating around the edges of her brain. They paused in the foyer by the grand spiral staircase.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m setting up a small shop in another building nearby where the seamstresses will work,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cThat way I can hop over there between fittings and client meetings if I need to. It sure would be nice to have somewhere close to come home to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean somewhere close that houses Jax to come home to.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, and the whole line of her body softened. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Lexi wore her typical light touch of makeup, coloring her lashes, perfecting her already perfect skin, brightening her cheeks. But that wasn\u2019t what turned the woman from stunningly beautiful to truly radiant.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever told you how much I hate the way Jax makes you glow?\u201d</p><p>Lexi laughed and returned her attention to Rubi. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want this house for the staircase, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, giving Lexi a sly grin. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell Jax.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi bit her lip against a grin and glanced over the railing, her hand sliding over the iron. \u201cI swear I could stare at it all day. It\u2019s like a piece of artwork.\u201d</p><p>She and Rubi burst out laughing at the same time. Rubi wandered away, through the massive living area. \u201cDamn.\u201d She squinted through the glass of one French door and placed a flat hand at her brow, teasing, \u201cIs that the ocean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that would be the Los Angeles smog layer,\u201d Lexi said, her voice thick with yeah-right attitude.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. Smog.\u201d Rubi moved through a wide archway to a smaller sitting room\u2014though small was all relative here. \u201cOooh, I like the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Dolph on your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Nada. Sixth offer unacknowledged.\u201d Rubi forced her voice light, like she always did, even though she knew Lexi could see right through her. She thought about the call she\u2019d made to Dolph\u2019s voice mail last night and pitched the rig\u2019s concept. That was before she\u2019d even seen the real thing\u2014which was ten times more advanced than she\u2019d expected. Maybe that would garner a phone call, during which she could broach the topic of buying the house\u2014again.</p><p>She ran her hand over the tall, velour-covered chairbacks and glanced up at the six wide-screen monitors mounted high on the wall. \u201cThis will be where the Renegades sit when they come over. But you\u2019ll have to get a few more chairs. Hell, you might have to turn this into a man cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man cave downstairs. Complete with another bar, bigger televisions, and a pool table.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh well,\u201d Rubi huffed. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>They moved out onto the deep stone terrace running the length of the house. \u201cMy God,\u201d Rubi said. \u201cYou could have one hell of a party out here. Maybe even...a wedding.\u201d</p><p>Lexi groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t mention marriage around Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know he\u2019s smart enough to plan for a future with you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi wrapped her fingers around the iron until they turned white. A tortured sound rolled in her throat. \u201cWhy is this so hard? I love him. I love everything about him. Why does jumping terrify me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re asking the wrong woman.\u201d</p><p>Lexi faced her, mirroring Rubi\u2019s stance. \u201cOkay. Spill. What\u2019s going on with you and Wes.\u201d</p><p>Wes. Rubi\u2019s insides took a major hit, a fiery-nuclear-bomb-type hit. Pleasure expanded deep in her belly. A warm, tingly, sexual thrill that crept steadily higher like a rising tide. But by the time it reached her chest, the silky excitement turned into searing, prickly tendrils and wound around her heart, her throat, until every vision from the night before vanished. The only thing filling her mind was the bottle of Xanax in her glove compartment.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to get back to the shop?\u201d Rubi asked...a little too hopefully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re way off your game. I made sure I had everything covered so we could talk when you got here. So talk.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s first instinct was to shut down. Shove the fanged monsters of fear back into the dark, slam the door on every muddy shadow from her past, and stand in front of her internal scars with her best I\u2019m-so-over-all-that-shit expression.</p><p>But for the first time in her life, an emotion other than fear weighted her heart. The identity of that emotion was still murky. Desire? Affection?</p><p>Love?</p><p>Her lips parted, and she drew a breath to say...something. But she found her chest too tight, her mind too mushy. And all that came out was an uneven, \u201cI think Wes and Jax are a lot alike. Determined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always envied your ability to be so free in your sex life,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cSo...open...to going for it. To getting what you want.\u201d</p><p>Rubi tensed. \u201cBut...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy, Rubi?\u201d Lexi\u2019s beautiful face, usually so open and light, now compressed with concern. True, heartfelt concern that made a new, sweet ache bloom around that damn knot. \u201cReally happy?\u201d</p><p>Rubi wanted to do what she always did\u2014laugh off her concern. Add an airy, careless wave of her hand and assure her friend that her life was perfect.</p><p>When she only squinted into the sunshine showering downtown LA, Lexi went on. \u201cThis last month is probably the happiest I\u2019ve ever seen you. Don\u2019t you feel how good it is, Rubi? Healthy. Happy. Just plain right?</p><p>She did. Which was what scared her into silence. The stakes were high for Rubi. Higher than they were for Wes. If things went south with Wes...</p><p>Rubi saw an edge disintegrating beneath her feet. A bad fallout between her and Wes would inevitably cause tension between Rubi and the other Renegades. Tension between Rubi and Jax. Tension between Jax and Lexi. And ultimately, tension between Rubi and Lexi.</p><p>Messing things up with Wes could very well mess up every relationship that mattered to Rubi. Leaving her alone. Completely alone.</p><p>Yet, she felt so strongly about Wes, the thought of backing away from him now laid a boulder on her heart.</p><p>She. Was. Fucked.</p><p>Lexi shifted on her feet. \u201cRubi.\u201d</p><p>She curled her fingers around the iron railing, her gaze fixed on her deep-red manicured nails as she flexed, tensed, flexed, tensed. Then she clenched her eyes shut. \u201cOkay. I...have a problem.\u201d</p><p>Her throat grew tight. She had to pause and push the burst of irrational panic down before she could go on.</p><p>\u201cWes and I...\u201d\u2014she wet her lips and scraped her upper lip between her teeth\u2014\u201chad sex.\u201d Voicing it made all her anxiety intensify. \u201cAnd...and...it was great. Beyond great. Better than I expected, and I expected phenomenal.\u201d</p><p>Rubi labored to gather air again. Her heart beat fast, adding pressure on her lungs. She opened her eyes but couldn\u2019t bear to look at Lexi. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d see, but part of her didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d...tell you that\u2019s awesome, because it totally is,\u201d Lexi started, her voice guarded. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing by how you\u2019re acting it\u2019s too awesome, right? So awesome you\u2019re going to have to fuck it up because you\u2019re terrified.\u201d</p><p>A world of emotion floated in Lexi\u2019s words. Understanding, disappointment, heartache...and that always-present unconditional love they\u2019d shared from the beginning of their friendship. Her tone made Rubi\u2019s fears seem both ominous and ridiculous at once.</p><p>\u201cI know. So stupid, right?\u201d She tried to laugh at herself, but it came out weak. \u201cI mean, seriously, I couldn\u2019t ask for a better guy. He even left after without me having to shove him out the door.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s hand closed around Rubi\u2019s arm. She didn\u2019t know why the touch startled her, but she flinched and turned to Lexi\u2019s surprised, questioning gaze. \u201cYou had sex at your house?\u201d</p><p>Splinters of heat and pressure scattered through her belly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Rubi had never brought a man to the house. Ever. She needed the control of being able to leave when she was ready. And the house was her personal space. Her and Rodie\u2019s sanctuary. She didn\u2019t want men showing up without an invitation, expecting her to give in to a bootie call.</p><p>Only, fuck, wasn\u2019t that just what she\u2019d allowed Wes to do last night?</p><p>Lexi\u2019s hand slid from Rubi\u2019s arm, dragging her\u2014feeling a little drunk, and not in a good way\u2014from the realization.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s...interesting.\u201d Lexi drew out the word.</p><p>Rubi crossed her arms so tight over her chest, a tug of pain shot through the girls. \u201cYou sound like my goddamned psychotherapist.\u201d</p><p>A suspicious, sly look narrowed Lexi\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat other boundaries are you letting Wes trample on?\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s mind immediately veered to the night before.</p><p>\u201cI want to be different, Rubi. I want to feel you. Every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>That drunk sensation deepened until Rubi\u2019s stomach twinged the way it did when she\u2019d had one too many.</p><p>\u201cWe...didn\u2019t use a condom.\u201d Rubi lifted her hand to her forehead and found it damp. \u201cIsn\u2019t it hot out here? Let\u2019s go inside.\u201d She turned and took giant strides toward the living room\u2019s French doors, craving a cool sweep of air-conditioning.</p><p>\u201cRubi.\u201d</p><p>She ignored Lexi\u2019s confused call, stepped through the doors, and closed her eyes, absorbing the settling sensation of refrigerated air on her damp skin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on birth control,\u201d Lexi asked. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The words came in an irritated, lightheaded rush. \u201cThat\u2019s not the problem.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s frown turned suspicious again. \u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Now that Lexi had voiced the more severe consequences of Rubi\u2019s condom-challenged sexual encounter, she found herself, once again, feeling like an emotional hypochondriac.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...this thing I have. I\u2019ve always used a condom. Ever since I started having sex. Always.\u201d Rubi dropped into a sofa. \u201cIt\u2019s... I don\u2019t know...a layer of protection, you know, in a different way. Like...a psychological way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lexi\u2019s posture softened, and her gaze widened with understanding. \u201cOooooh. Got it.\u201d</p><p>Christ she was sick. Beyond sick, now she was scared. Before now, without Lexi shining a spotlight on every little thing Rubi had done with Wes, she had been able to push them into the background. Now she worried over the message she\u2019d sent Wes by letting the issue slide when she could have reached out of the shower and simply grabbed one from a drawer. Two seconds. Max.</p><p>\u201cI want to be different, Rubi.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been different from the fucking start.</p> <p>\u201cScary,\u201d Lexi said, her voice soft with their shared fears. She lifted her hands to indicate the house. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the difference\u2014you move through it. You live it. I put up walls, create detours. It\u2019s like my feet are stuck in concrete. Wes terrifies me, Lex. He\u2019s... God.\u201d She turned her gaze back out over the city. A knife twisted in Rubi\u2019s chest. Emotions rose and swirled in her head. Anxiety crawled over her skin. Terror closed in. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I just can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJump?\u201d Lexi drew in a breath that raised her shoulders, then slowly blew it out as she gazed out over LA. \u201cWhat if we jump together?\u201d</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t wait for Rubi to answer. She pulled her phone from her pocket with one hand and covered Rubi\u2019s hand on the railing with the other. Tapping one number on her phone, she dialed, then touched the Speaker icon.</p><p>\u201cYou miss me already, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jax\u2019s rich, sexy voice came over the line. \u201cChange your mind about the terrace? I\u2019ll turn around right now.\u201d</p> <p>The grin that lit up Lexi\u2019s face made Rubi\u2019s heart swell. That was happiness. And seeing Lexi happy thrilled Rubi. She knew Lexi wanted to see Rubi just as happy. She just didn\u2019t think a man was the ticket.</p><p>\u201cYes, I miss you already,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cAnd yes, I\u2019ve changed my mind about the terrace. But Rubi\u2019s right, we can\u2019t christen it until you own it.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s grip tightened on Rubi\u2019s. Her eyes slid closed, and she sank her teeth into her bottom lip. The expression of hope and fear on Lexi\u2019s face mirrored so much of what Rubi felt over Wes.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Jax said, his voice now tight. After a second, he continued. \u201cI had to pull over. I didn\u2019t want to hyperventilate on the freeway. I thought I just heard you say you wanted to buy that house and live in it with me.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s brow furrowed, and a look of terrified pain came over her face. She released Rubi\u2019s hand and pressed her own to her stomach. \u201cThat\u2019s because...\u201d</p><p>Rubi laughed and covered her mouth to hold it back. Her eyes swelled with tears.</p> <p>\u201cI did,\u201d she finally said. \u201cMake an offer, Jax. I love this house. I love you. I want both.\u201d</p><p>Lexi opened her eyes and pinned Rubi with a sharp, what-the-fuck-did-I-just-do look. Rubi still had her hand over her mouth, her chest bursting with happiness. Lexi pressed the phone to her body and whispered, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to puke.\u201d</p><p>Rubi couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. Laughter rolled out of her. Lexi\u2019s laughter echoed Rubi\u2019s.</p><p>Lexi disconnected with an ecstatic Jax, and they finished touring the house. But Rubi couldn\u2019t get Lexi\u2019s earlier words to Jax out of her head: \u201cI need you to push me past these fears, because I don\u2019t want to lose you over them.\u201d</p><p>Her own fears could easily ruin something with Wes that she knew in her heart had the potential to be really good.</p><p>In the driveway, Rubi hugged Lexi good-bye. When Lexi pulled away, she held Rubi\u2019s arms firmly, her eyes direct. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to jump. Don\u2019t leave me hanging out here by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I ever left you hanging?\u201d</p><p>The smile that beamed across Lexi\u2019s face was filled with giddy excitement. \u201cKeep me posted.\u201d She stepped back, pointed purposefully at Rubi while walking backward toward her car repeating words Rubi had once said to Lexi, not that long ago. \u201cAnd I want details, girl. Details.\u201d</p> <p>Rubi didn\u2019t follow Lexi down the hill. Instead, she took out her phone and tapped a message to Wes.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Wes crouched in front of the second of four identical Ducatis he was working with on this series of scenes. The first bike, the one he\u2019d crashed a few days ago, lay alongside the others\u2014a burned-out corpse he would part-out to keep the other three running. Keaton wiped a rag over the handlebars and scrubbed the body until the red paint shone.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s insane,\u201d Keaton said. He\u2019d been droning on about some girl he\u2019d been banging. \u201cShe lives alone, but she\u2019s got a two-bedroom apartment, and the extra room\u2019s filled with sex-toy shit. Like...serious...sex-toy shit. I don\u2019t know, man. I mean, I\u2019m up for just about anything, but honestly, this chick kind of freaks me out.\u201d</p><p>With the clutch cover removed, Wes listened with one ear and sprayed compressed air over the metal to clear residual dust. The bike groaned every time Wes switched gears, pissing off the audio gurus. And while Wes could pull apart any motorcycle and put it back together drunk, standing on his head, he was having a hard time focusing on a simple clutch clean today. And Keaton\u2019s chatter wasn\u2019t the problem.</p><p>His gaze blurred over the machine, and his mind drifted toward Rubi. Toward the sight of her spread out on the kitchen counter. Her wickedly sinful, drool-inducing body smeared with chocolate ice cream. His cock hitched against his jeans, and Wes clenched his teeth.</p><p>Ping. Clank.</p><p>The can of compressed air hit the concrete, and Wes startled.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Keaton laughed the word. \u201cI about dropped the lube bottle just like that.\u201d</p><p>Wes had no fucking idea what Keaton was talking about, but right now, he didn\u2019t want to know. He was having enough trouble dealing with all the heat tumbling through his body and emotion expanding his heart.</p><p>His phone buzzed in his pocket, and his mind jumped to Wyatt. He\u2019d already talked to his mother today, but...</p><p>He pushed to his feet and pulled out his phone, thinking a hundred different things. Shock sizzled low in his belly when he saw the text was from Rubi. Her contacting him today...or any day in the next week...was the opposite of what he\u2019d expected.</p><p>Don\u2019t get your hopes up, dude.</p><p>RUBI: Hey, handsome. Do you have your rig with you or is it at your place?</p><p>His mind tried to read ten different meanings into the text. It took him a minute to realize she was talking about the rig for Wyatt. But the fact she\u2019d reached out to him at all had to be a good sign, right?</p><p>WES: Baby, I carry my rig everywhere.</p><p>\u201cIs that Rubi?\u201d Keaton asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s kinda out of your league, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Wes looked up only long enough to shoot the other Renegade a glare.</p><p>\u201cJust sayin\u2019.\u201d Keaton held up his hands, palms out. \u201cI can totally see why you went for her, but...not your usual type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only heard that half a dozen times already.\u201d His phone buzzed again, and he glanced down.</p><p>RUBI: Did you find someone to relay that beautiful rig of yours?</p><p>His lips twitched up into a cautious grin. Not a \u201cLast night was so hot I can\u2019t wait to have you again,\u201d but Wes would take what he could get.</p><p>WES: That\u2019s all you, baby. I don\u2019t want anyone else touching my rig.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going over to Tommy\u2019s Burgers for lunch,\u201d Keaton said. \u201cWanna come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda early for lunch, dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been up since four. Starting a new workout. I go to this CrossFit gym near my place. Man, those bitches work me into butter. I\u2019m burning so many calories and building so much muscle, I can\u2019t keep weight on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d At least not for anything but Rubi. \u201cYou go on.\u201d</p><p>Keaton tossed down his rag and straightened, stretched. His groan was one of those damn-I\u2019m-sore groans. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll bring you back a burger.\u201d</p><p>Wes nodded absently just as Rubi\u2019s message came through.</p><p>RUBI: You\u2019re on, but I need that baby in my hands to program it properly.</p><p>Wes\u2019s face broke out into a full grin as Keaton turned for the trailer. Current sizzled through his body at Rubi\u2019s flirty innuendo. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn\u2019t have made much out of the comment. But after last night, the fact that she was still flirting with him was another great sign.</p><p>WES: Holy shit. My rig\u2019s circuit just blew. You know I can\u2019t work when it\u2019s jacked. Come and fix me up, baby.</p><p>RUBI: Do you have time now?</p><p>A breathy laugh exited his chest, and Wes swore his heart beat three times in the normal span of one. His cock had already been half-hard just from the memories of the night before. Now it was rubbing his jeans again.</p><p>WES: For you? Hell yes.</p><p>Wes glanced up, surveying the movement on set. Based on the sketchbook open amid a group including Jax, Duke, Troy, MacKenzie, and three camera guys, and the speed of Jax\u2019s hand moving a pencil over the page, Wes knew they wouldn\u2019t be running the fire scene for at least an hour. His phone buzzed, and he looked back down.</p><p>RUBI: Already headed straight for you...and your kick-ass rig.</p><p>He drew a slow breath through pursed lips, creating a low whistle. A flutter irritated his belly. He told himself not to get his hopes up. She\u2019d been as clear as glass when she\u2019d told him she fucked guys once and only once. She hadn\u2019t agreed to the friends-with-benefits proposal, and even after the best sex of his life\u2014hopefully hers too\u2014she still hadn\u2019t been sure what she wanted. He wasn\u2019t stupid enough to think she\u2019d change her MO for him. Or after so long. Yet something whispered hope in his ear. Told him what they had was already more than she\u2019d given any other man. And that fact spiraled through his chest, making him both high and horny.</p><p>\u201cWes.\u201d Jax\u2019s irritated voice pulled Wes\u2019s gaze. Even his boss\u2019s bark couldn\u2019t kill his smile. \u201cAre you fucking that phone, or can you give us a minute of your attention here?\u201d</p><p>Wes pocketed his phone. He couldn\u2019t say what exactly he\u2019d expected from Rubi after last night, but it wouldn\u2019t have surprised him if she\u2019d tried the whole nothing-happened or even the cold-shoulder routine. He knew he shouldn\u2019t get excited about a few flirty texts, but hell if he could control this inner tornado.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked, wandering toward the men. By the stern looks on their faces, whatever they were talking about couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>Jax waited until everyone but MacKenzie had stepped away from the group and Wes was standing in their small circle. \u201cRimer\u2019s guru working with Bolton says he\u2019s fucked up.\u201d Jax\u2019s voice lowered. \u201cHe\u2019s starting a two-week crash rehab program Monday. It\u2019s not a solution but a temporary fix to get Bolton through the movie. We\u2019re going to have to revamp the filming schedule.\u201d</p><p>The implications of that unraveled in Wes\u2019s mind, and anger heated his gut. \u201cDude, that\u2019s going to leave me sitting on my hands. It\u2019s going to mess up my break to go see Wyatt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And going home to Missouri now could very well mess up what was happening\u2014or what he hoped was happening\u2014with Rubi.</p><p>MacKenzie stepped back, his expression as pissed-off as Wes felt. \u201cI\u2019ll let you guys handle the details.\u201d</p><p>Wes glared at the man\u2019s back as he disappeared into the production trailer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already reworked the next couple of days since we knew Bolton would be out,\u201d Jax said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you finish up those scenes and head home?\u201d</p> <p>Because, fuck, he didn\u2019t want to leave Rubi right now.</p><p>And... \u201cI don\u2019t have the rig ready.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t all that thrilled about facing his entire family without it. While he knew he could go home to see Wyatt without the rig, the thought of facing all twelve-thousand extended relatives who\u2019d be coming in and out of town to see Wyatt and their parents made his gut tighten. He could hear the derogatory comments from the spattering of uncles, grandparents, and holier-than-thou cousins already.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re almost thirty, Wes. When are you going to grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWesley, when are you going to stop fooling around and come home where you belong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just made partner. Pulling down seven figures. What\u2019s new with you, Wes?\u201d</p><p>On one level, Wes was secure and fulfilled enough with his life to tell them all to go fuck themselves. But on another, he yearned to make his parents proud. They\u2019d always defended him in the family, despite their reservations with his decisions after college. And then there was Wyatt\u2019s physical therapist\u2014Melissa. The woman who\u2019d left Wes after six years together and dissolved their marriage plans because he\u2019d refused to spend his life in a cubicle at her father\u2019s engineering firm.</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned how much I fucking hate Bolton?\u201d Wes asked.</p><p>Jax rolled his eyes. \u201cI recall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have I mentioned that I\u2019ll never fucking double that bastard again?\u201d</p><p>The growl of an engine drew their attention. Rubi pulled the Aston into a nearby lot, and Wes\u2019s emotions twisted in a whole different direction. Damn, now he was in a pissy mood. Even her hopping out of the car in short jean cutoffs, loose lacy sweater exposing her belly, and spike-heeled boots barely lifted the new shadow. His body, however, responded like a champ. He would have reached down to reposition his \u201crig,\u201d now standing at attention, but wanted to avoid another \u201ckeep your focus\u201d lecture from Jax. As if Jax didn\u2019t lose his own every time Lexi stepped on set.</p> <p>Wes forced ease into his stance and turned his mouth in a smile. The last thing he wanted to do was ruin Rubi\u2019s feisty mood. But halfway across the distance, Rubi\u2019s expression grew serious, and by the time she reached them, she was frowning. It was difficult to get his mind around what might have caused that transition, because the simple act of watching Rubi walk rerouted his brain and sent those electric currents zinging through his cock.</p><p>Those long, lithe legs\u2014legs that had been clamped around his waist just hours ago\u2014flexed with each step. Her perfect breasts\u2014breasts that had been in his hands and beneath his tongue\u2014jiggled playfully in the V-neck opening of her sweater. The bounce of her long, dark, shiny waves\u2014hair that had been fisted in his hands as he\u2019d tasted her\u2014spilled over her slender, shoulders.</p><p>An insane and urgent need consumed him, gnawing at him from the inside out. But the light, happy expression she\u2019d come with was gone.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Rubi,\u201d Jax said. \u201cI just told you not to come on set dressed like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not staying.\u201d Her gaze darted between Jax and Wes, then those gorgeous eyes held on Wes\u2019s face. He might just be letting his imagination create what he so desperately wanted, but he swore there was something more intimate between them now. Some kind of intangible connection that jumbled Wes\u2019s insides with a warm thrill. She reached out to lay her hand on his bicep with true worry in her expression. \u201cWhat happened? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some scheduling stuff,\u201d Jax said. \u201cHey, would you mind stopping your work on the apps and funneling all the attention you can toward Wes\u2019s rig?\u201d</p><p>A flash of surprise eased her expression, then unmistakable humor. Humor she tried to hide by pressing her lips together. She released Wes\u2019s arm and crossed hers, did a damn good impression of serious consideration</p><p>Finally, she lifted one shoulder as she met Wes\u2019s eyes with a stern gaze. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you asking me to divert all my focus to your rig, Lawson? Do you want me to work on your precious toy or not?\u201d</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t hold the grin back, but he did manage to quash the, Fuck yeah, I want you working on my rig.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to make it worth my while,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, the rig is fun, a challenge and all, but a girl has priorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Jax said. If he noticed the sexual electricity arcing between Wes and Rubi, he didn\u2019t show it. \u201cSorry about the changes, bud. But this might end up working out for you. And thanks, Rubi. For helping Wes out and for whatever you said to Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Jax turned and started toward the production trailer where MacKenzie had disappeared. Rubi\u2019s gaze never left Wes\u2019s, but her expression softened and heated and turned seductive.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about Lexi?\u201d Wes asked.</p><p>\u201cShe said yes to this house.\u201d</p><p>Wes grinned. \u201cHot damn. That will make the boss happy.\u201d</p><p>Rubi returned his smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s this urgent need to polish that rig of yours, Lawson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpillover from last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been feeling that all morning. But I get the distinct impression Jax was having a parallel discussion to ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell,\u201d Wes stuffed his hands in his pockets to keep himself from reaching for her. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I came to get my hands on that rig,\u201d she said, sliding her gaze down his body and pausing on the crotch of his jeans. \u201cLet\u2019s get down to the details. Where shall we take\u2014I mean...where is that sexy monster?\u201d</p><p>Wes glanced toward the Renegades trailer, then back to Rubi, angst fighting excitement for space in his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t tell which mode we\u2019re in\u2014friends or sex.\u201d</p><p>She linked her arm with his and leaned close. \u201cSomeone told me recently that it\u2019s not an either-or situation. That we could have both. Now...I don\u2019t know about that, but I\u2019m...interested in looking into it a little more. So what do you say, you lead me to your rig, and we can figure it out from there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...yes?\u201d Was she saying what he thought she was saying? \u201cWalk ahead of me to the trailer, and my personal rig will be fully engaged by the time we reach the door.\u201d</p><p>Rubi released his arm and made a slow turn on her heels, much like those he\u2019d seen her make when modeling one of Lexi\u2019s dresses in the studio. She cast one of those sizzling come-and-get-it looks over her shoulder. \u201cIt already appears fully engaged. But if a rear view helps...\u201d</p><p>She sauntered toward the trailer, the smooth length of her thighs making saliva pool in his mouth, the sway of her ass making him think of all kinds of other ways he\u2019d like it swaying for him.</p><p>She turned her head, her lashes downcast, reminding Wes of the way she\u2019d looked at him that night at Stilettos. \u201cIs this working for you, Mr. Lawson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d They reached the steps, and Wes jumped a few to meet her at the top. He pressed his hand to the door before she could open it and bent his head to her ear. \u201cBut...bent over, feet spread would be even better.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, met his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered there\u2019s nothing sexier than a sweet country boy turned naughty.\u201d</p><p>She leaned in, eyes open, and ran her tongue along his bottom lip. Fire engulfed his belly, his hips, his thighs. His cock jerked hard against his jeans. Before he could respond, Rubi turned the knob, and the door opened in. Without the support, Wes fell forward, catching himself with a hand on the doorframe. When he looked up, Rubi faced him, one hand on the door, the other on her cocked hip, the line of her body lazy and sexy and filling the doorway.</p><p>\u201cGet your sweet rig in here. I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>Wes straightened and stepped through the door. He cast a glance toward Rachel\u2019s desk and found her gone. The rest of the trailer was empty as well.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>He rested his hands at his hips and turned to face Rubi just as she pressed her finger to the doorknob, locking it.</p><p>Wes lifted his hands in a stop gesture. \u201cMs. Russo,\u201d he teased, darting a glance toward the desk in the corner. \u201cThe rig in question is over there.\u201d</p><p>She stepped toward him and took fistfuls of his T-shirt, using them to swing him around and push him against the door. A shocked grunt exited his chest, a hot thrill taking its place. Rubi slid her hands down his chest as she lowered to her knees, a familiar move, but one that took on a whole different meaning without that contraption within reach.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some work I need to do with this exceptional rig before I take a look at the other.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers worked smoothly, quickly on his button and zipper. Her small hands easily moved fabric aside to free his erection. Wes sucked in a breath of shocked pleasure at her touch. Electric jolts shorted out his brain and sang through his groin. His knees loosened, and he grabbed the door handle to hold himself up.</p><p>\u201cFuck... Rubi...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. With my mouth. Now.\u201d She gazed up at him and slowly licked the tip of his cock. The warm, wet, smooth streak shot another dose of pleasure into his blood. His cock twitched in her hands, making her grin. Her tongue darted out again. Wes\u2019s fingers went white on the handle. Every muscle in his body tightened. All his blood rushed south. She tipped her head as her hands continued to stroke. \u201cIf, that is, you\u2019re ready to let me focus all my attention on your personal rig, like Jax suggested.\u201d</p><p>No witty reply came to him. His brain was swamped with the sight of her on her knees, his rigid cock held reverently in her hands, her striking eyes gazing up at him with lust.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been starving for the taste of you.\u201d Her expression slid into something intense, her voice deep and needy. \u201cI\u2019ve needed to feel you all morning.\u201d She circled the ridge of his erection with a fingertip, tantalizing him to the edge of ecstasy. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say this was one of my benefits?\u201d</p><p>His dry mouth managed a, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her attention lowered to his cock again. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking hungry for you.\u201d</p><p>And she closed her lips over his head.</p><p>Soft, wet heat surrounded the sensitive tip, and his cock surged with fire. Her eyes slid closed on a delicious hum. His knees gave again and he gripped the top of a bookshelf with his free hand. Completely against his will, his eyes closed and his head dropped back. A growl rolled from his throat, releasing a sliver of pent-up lust.</p><p>He forced his eyes open, his head down. He didn\u2019t want to miss a second of this. Not only was it a white-hot sight that thickened his , one he\u2019d never forget, but extra thrilling because Rubi had initiated it all. This was so much more than he\u2019d expected and he heart expanded with hope and affection, which made the physical pleasure even more intense. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gaze cleared just as Rubi slid his length deep into her mouth. And, Christ, the sight was so perfectly erotic, so wickedly naughty, so dangerously titillating, Wes\u2019s chest constricted with explosive desire. He pushed his hips forward, needing to be fully sheathed. The head of his cock touched her throat as he\u2019d known it would. He was too long. Too thick. There had always been too much of him for any woman to fully take into her mouth.</p><p>He needed to pump, to thrust. He needed friction to cut this sudden, nasty craving, but he didn\u2019t need to scare her off, so he eased his hips back for a slow slide out. Rubi groaned in complaint, and her mouth clamped down, sucking hard.</p><p>His teeth clenched against the burst of pleasure shooting through his cock and sinking deep into his balls. \u201cAh, fuck, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fisted in his jeans, pulling his hips toward her as she eased forward. The result was a mind-bending slide of her mouth nearly to his base and he groaned through grinding teeth.</p><p>He pulled his hand from the bookshelf and fisted her hair. Had to force himself not to pull her in to finish off that last couple of inches.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby.\u201d Christ, that dark, lust-filled voice could not be his own. \u201cDon\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her throat opened around the head of his cock, taking him in.</p><p>Wes sank into her on a guttural, \u201cSonofabitch...\u201d</p><p>A fireball burst low in his body, burning through his hips, his balls, his cock. A delirious moment of ecstasy blanked his mind, and when his head cleared, he had both his hands deep in Rubi\u2019s hair, the door holding him up.</p><p>She eased back, sucking him all the way out with her eyes open and on his, dizzying lust turning them as dark as the ocean.. When her mouth finally pulled free, leaving his entire length glimmering wet, he found himself mindless...and speechless.</p><p>\u201cBaby...\u201d was all he found anywhere in his mind.</p><p>Her hand closed around his length, slowly pumping the slick skin. Wes\u2019s muscles went taut again. His throat closed. Pleasure climbed.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She paused, tipped her head with a kittenish smile. \u201cDid you want something?.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mouth.\u201d He pushed the words forward, desperate. \u201cI want your mouth.\u201d</p><p>With her gaze holding his, she traced the tip of her tongue around his ridge again. A delicious shiver tightened his skin and made his whole body shake. She licked the drop of moisture from his tip, drew it into her mouth, and savored it with a hum of pleasure.</p><p>Wes\u2019s mind slid into its very own sideways suicide. No woman had ever blown him like this\u2014in daylight, pushed against a door, wanting it. No woman had ever savored him. Past girlfriends had done it to please him, and they had. But he couldn\u2019t say any of them had ever enjoyed doing it. He had the impression, from that sparkle in Rubi\u2019s eyes, that had all changed.</p><p>\u201cCome and get it, naughty boy,\u201d she teased, sliding one hand between his legs and stroking the sensitive skin behind his balls. \u201cTake what you want.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth just millimeters from the head of his cock but didn\u2019t take him in. With those lips parted, her lids heavy, eyes begging...promising, she simply taunted. He urged his hips forward and the head of his cock slid into her mouth. Her lips closed, her mouth sucked, but nothing more. And, fuck, he needed more.</p><p>With the hands fisted in her hair, he pulled her in, impaling her mouth with his cock. Slowly. So very slowly, preparing to stop at the first sign of resistance He eased himself deeper, deeper... Her throat opened around him. Her eyes closed on an expression of bliss. Wes held there, trying to refasten his grip on control, but it was as slippery as her mouth. The sight, the feel, tangled Wes\u2019s mind into a knot of raw need.</p><p>Something squeezed the head of Wes\u2019s cock. A warm, rolling pressure that made him siphon air and tilt toward climax. Swallowing. Rubi was swallowing, her strong throat massaging his tip, her taut mouth sucking his length.</p><p>\u201cFucking A, Rubi...\u201d He was incoherent. Couldn\u2019t form a sentence. His weakening legs trembled, making him slide down the door another inch. Rubi took advantage of the room from his parted knees and stroked deeper, palming his balls. Wes was absolutely drowning in sensation. \u201cSo goddamned good...\u201d</p><p>The knob underneath his hand rolled. The movement didn\u2019t even faze him, until it happened twice more. Then the lock popped open, and the door pressed inward against his back. Wes reacted automatically, shoving it closed. By the time his mind sharpened, Rubi had pulled him from her mouth but didn\u2019t move to hide or even stand. She still held his cock in her hands, her lips blushed deep from her work.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d A female voice muttered beyond the door. \u201cWho\u2019s in there?\u201d</p> <p>Rachel. Fuck, it was Rachel.</p><p>No. No, no, no. He needed this. Needed it. Stopping now was inhumane.</p><p>\u201cThink on your feet, Lawson,\u201d Rubi murmured. \u201cI\u2019m not done ravishing your rig.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t realize how hard he was breathing until he had to catch his breath to speak. \u201cUh... Sorry Rach, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cWes?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. \u201cYeah. I...uh...I\u2019m just having a meeting.\u201d He cringed at the lousy excuse. \u201cCan you take ten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty,\u201d Rubi whispered, a nasty smile on her face.</p><p>Wes shook his head. He wasn\u2019t going to last twenty. No. Fucking. Way.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d Rachel said, clearly suspicious. \u201cSure...I guess?\u201d</p><p>When her feet sounded on the stairs and her voice picked up in conversation with someone outside, then faded, Wes let out a breath of relief and glanced down at Rubi. This had to be a fucking fantasy.</p><p>Goddamned fucking lucky bastard.</p><p>\u201cBaby...\u201d he said, panting. \u201cWe should probably\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish.\u201d</p><p>Wes was going to say stop, even though it was the last thing he wanted to do. \u201cOh hell. I like your idea so much better.\u201d</p><p>Rubi laughed, then her lids grew heavy and she licked her lips. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to taste you.\u201d</p><p>Once she slid his cock between her lips again, all teasing, all playtime, was over. She was on a mission to make him shatter. Her tongue did things he\u2019d never felt before. The slide of her lips, the texture of her mouth, the pleasured sounds vibrating over his length was way beyond his experience. This was a woman who loved to suck cock. And the difference from a woman who did it as a favor or a chore was indescribable.</p><p>Wes sank his hands deep into her silky hair again, rested his head against the door, and set his eyes on the erotic sight of Rubi fucking him\u2014wantonly, like she couldn\u2019t get enough\u2014with her mouth.</p><p>Once he let go of the resistance to come, the orgasm was there, pounding on the door, demanding release. The heat, the pressure, the spiraling lust slamming against his senses, over and over like waves in a storm.</p><p>\u201cRubi...\u201d He growled through clenched teeth.</p><p>She looked up at him as she pulled his length from her mouth, oh, so innocently. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish what, Wes? Say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck me off.\u201d The words were a harsh demand. To say he was on edge wouldn\u2019t begin to cover this rampage of lust.</p><p>A slow, fiery smile slid over her face. \u201cDo you have any idea how wet that makes me? Say it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit.\u201d If Rachel came back and he hadn\u2019t come, he\u2019d go insane. \u201cSuck me, Rubi. Now.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips and pulled him into her mouth again. Whatever she did then had been reserved for this moment, because he hadn\u2019t felt that combination of pull, suck, and slide until now.</p><p>A sound of surprise rolled up his throat. A sound that quickly turned into a growl of such intense need, Wes\u2019s mind whited out. \u201cBaby...baby...\u201d He panted between words. \u201cI\u2019m gonna... I can\u2019t...fuck...\u201d</p><p>The orgasm exploded at the center of his hips, raced up his spine and flashed through his chest. His balls squeezed, his cock surged, his ass clenched, driving him forward, and Wes gushed into the hot, dark, soft, succulent, tight recesses of her mouth.</p><p>Pleasure--rich, thrilling, decadent--slammed through him in wave after wave of heat. \u201cFuck, fuck, fuck.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t keep his voice down. Couldn\u2019t control the sounds he made. His brain was gone, and Wes struggled to get a sliver of it back, but it kept slipping away, and in the end, he gave himself over to the ravage of his orgasm. One that lasted longer and reached deeper, than the one in the shower the night before.</p><p>He didn\u2019t remember the moment his knees gave, but he slid to the floor, pulling from Rubi\u2019s mouth at the same time. He landed on his ass, panting. \u201cHoly... Shit...\u201d He dropped his head against the door, his eyes falling closed. He couldn\u2019t do more than grope for Rubi\u2019s hand and curl his fingers around it. \u201cRubi...Christ...\u201d</p><p>His body felt as if it had been infused with champagne, every cell fizzing.</p><p>He cracked his lids, glanced over her satisfied grin. Her tongue lazed over her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cYou taste as good as I imagined,\u201d she said, reaching forward to run her fingers through his sweat-dampened hair. \u201cAnd you\u2019re so fucking sexy coming in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say that.\u201d He forced his other hand up and ran the back of his finger against her cheek. \u201cEven without it, that would have been the best I\u2019ve ever had. With, it was...un-fucking-believable.\u201d</p><p>She closed her hand around his and pulled it low on her body. \u201cWant to feel how much I love sucking you?\u201d</p><p>Her hand pushed his beneath the waistband of her shorts and between her legs. She stroked his fingers against her panties.</p><p>She was drenched, right through the silk. His mind stirred back to life and he eased the band of her panties aside to touch deeper. Her body licked his fingertips, opened to take them in, then closed snuggly around them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...wicked,\u201d Wes managed to whisper. \u201cAnd I love it.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s lids went heavy, and her hand tightened over his. \u201cMake me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He shifted with the intent of pushing her to her back and taking all that deliciousness in his mouth. \u201cFuck yeah.\u201d</p><p>Before he could even get her button undone, footsteps sounded on the steps again, followed by a purposeful knock, and Rachel\u2019s annoyed voice. \u201cAll right you two. I know you\u2019re in there. I have witnesses. Pull up your pants and let me in. Some of us have work to do.\u201d</p><p>Wes groaned in disappointment. He reluctantly pulled his hand from between her legs. Rubi leaned forward and kissed him, whispering, \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>His heart flipped. His chest tightened. Later was promising.</p><p>Another knock.</p><p>\u201cHold the fuck on, Rachel,\u201d Wes said. \u201cMy zipper\u2019s stuck.\u201d</p><p>Rubi and Rachel burst out laughing at the same time. Wes tucked himself away, fastened up, and pushed to his feet. Blood rushed to his head, and he swayed, grabbing the doorknob for balance. Rubi\u2019s laugh rose in pitch, more like a giggle. Something he\u2019d never imagined coming out of her.</p><p>She moved to the refrigerator and pulled out two bottles of water as Wes opened the door. Little sweet Rachel barged past him, stopped in the middle of the room, and took a deep breath. \u201cGod, I love the smell of sex. Probably because I don\u2019t get any.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A laugh rolled out of Wes. She was just messing with them.</p><p>She waved dismissively to him. \u201cDirty deed is done, go away now.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s face heated, and he rubbed it with both hands, groaning. \u201cRachel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell Jax.\u201d She glanced at him over the rim of her glasses. \u201cThis time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFies-tay,\u201d Rubi intoned playfully, handing Wes one of the bottles and uncapping her own to take a deep drink, reminding him of what she\u2019d just done to him. Those after-awesome-sex sizzles kicked up again. \u201cThat\u2019s our Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot, evidently, as feisty as you,\u201d she said, shooting a look at Rubi. \u201cIf I were, I might get laid once in a while.\u201d</p><p>Rubi laughed easily, as if getting caught didn\u2019t bother her in the least...but then he realized who he was applying that social taboo to and mentally rolled his eyes at himself. She strolled to Rachel\u2019s desk, reached over, and pulled the clip from the other girl\u2019s hair. A mass of chestnut waves fell around her pixie face, transforming Rachel from cute to...double-take pretty.</p><p>\u201cRubi!\u201d Rachel half laughed, half cried, grabbing for the clip.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s my little grasshopper.\u201d Rubi stood back, grinning. \u201cLeave all that gorgeous hair down a little more often around here, and I bet you lunch, you get asked out twice as often. Might even get some.\u201d</p> <p>Wes only half listened to them. Relief and pleasure streamed through his body. He wanted a nap. Curled up with Rubi.</p><p>She turned, picked up the rig from the other desk, and faced him. \u201cNow...let\u2019s discuss your other awesome rig.\u201d</p><p>His elation slowly drained. He watched Rubi pick up the rig from the corner desk, stuffed his hands into his pockets, and stopped beside her.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the urgency?\u201d she asked, her gaze appraising the rig with keen interest.</p><p>His gut tensed. He wasn\u2019t worried about her being upset that he was leaving, but he did worry her newfound interest in taking that next step in their relationship could evaporate in his absence.</p><p>He cleared his throat and explained Bolton\u2019s problems and the problems that created for Renegades and filming.</p> <p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to have time on my hands until Bolton gets out of rehab.\u201d A fist curled around his gut. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to see Wyatt and bring him the rig, I\u2019m going to have to go in the next couple of days.\u201d</p><p>Rubi lowered the rig so fast, it hit the desk with a crack. Her head turned sharply toward Wes, and the look in her eyes made that fist in his gut turn to ice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d Her voice wavered between surprise and frustration. But it was the edge of vulnerability that sliced through him. \u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe grew up with her father leaving her at the drop of a hat.\u201d Lexi\u2019s words from the other night filled his head, and his chest vibrated with guilt.</p><p>He darted a look at Rachel and saw that she was on the phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby,\u201d he told Rubi softly. \u201cI just found out in the last ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>She returned her gaze to the rig, all the openness and lightness in her expression now tight and dark. \u201cWell then...\u201d She turned, rig in hand, and started toward the door. \u201cI\u2019d better get going on this.\u201d</p><p>Fourteen</p> <p>Rubi paced her living room, arms crossed, the long skirt matching her bikini brushing her calves. The conference call with NSA droned in her ear through the headset, but her mind was on the rig lying on her coffee table. A cord snaked between her computer and the motherboard she\u2019d added to the unit.</p><p>Restless, she wandered around the back of the sofa and glanced at the screen. Still downloading. Once all the data she\u2019d collected loaded, she could test the program.</p><p>She\u2019d been angsty since Wes told her the filming schedule with Renegades had changed and that he was going to head home now instead of in a few weeks. He was leaving tomorrow. Tomorrow. And, damn, didn\u2019t that just put a chink in her plans to try to build something with him? The fact that he was up and leaving after she\u2019d taken that jump just...really tweaked her psyche.</p><p>Her fears weren\u2019t rational, she knew. He traveled all the time. Or at least he had before they\u2019d nailed this Bond contract. But that wouldn\u2019t last forever. If she wanted to be with him, she was going to have to get used to him traveling, schedule changes, upheavals in schedules. She knew it happened with Jax. Even with the Bond film, the Renegades jumped between jobs all over the freaking globe. The only reason Wes was grounded in LA right now was because of the scenes he was working with Bolton.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even realized it would be a problem until he\u2019d sprung it on her this morning, and a familiar dark current of fear coursed through her chest. The same one she\u2019d had too often throughout her childhood.</p><p>Double-checking the call\u2014and the exhilarating project-budget discussion\u2014was on mute, she reminded herself, \u201cThis isn\u2019t the same. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>But the jumping in her chest wasn\u2019t helping her convince herself of that. Deeply buried fears she hadn\u2019t fully learned to manage urged her to pull back. Warned her to shield herself from the hurt of having him walk out of her life, never sure when he\u2019d come back. Or if he\u2019d come back.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your father.\u201d She repeated the words, but they weren\u2019t sinking in. Probably because they didn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cGoddammit, get your shit together, Rubi.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been realigning her brain all damn day, and like a rubber band, it just kept snapping back to old patterns of fear.</p><p>Glancing toward the kitchen, she could just make out Rodie\u2019s tail peeking out from behind the island, where he lay on the floor at the glass sliding doors. Another pinch of worry tightened her chest. He\u2019d been there all day, head on his paws, staring out the door, instead of curled on the sofa beside her. If this malaise lasted until morning, she\u2019d have to take him to the vet.</p><p>Her cell, sitting on the coffee table next to the rig, vibrated. She picked it up, tapped out of the call screen\u2014wishing she could tap out of the call altogether\u2014and found a text from Wes.</p><p>WES: I\u2019ve got a big, tasty piece of meat grilling for you.</p><p>A small laugh popped out of her throat. Big and tasty was right. She would not let this sudden trip ruffle her. I will not.</p><p>RUBI: I could go for leftovers. Brunch was a-maz-ing.</p><p>WES: Girl, you\u2019re making me hard again.</p><p>RUBI: Just the way I like you. I\u2019m stuck on an NSA conference call.</p><p>She glanced at the clock on her computer screen. It was way too freaking late for business. Damned overseas contractors.</p><p>She told herself that was where her annoyance stemmed from, but she was irritated by several things aside from the circling, repetitive statements in her ear. She had knots in her neck from working on the rig\u2019s programming for eight straight freaking hours. She\u2019d spent a sleepless night reliving her encounter with Wes, her thoughts flipping between \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong.\u201d And now this trip...</p><p>WES: I didn\u2019t know our government actually worked.</p><p>RUBI: They don\u2019t. They spend all their time talking about working.</p><p>WES: You\u2019re bringing Rodie, right? I picked up a Frisbee for him today.</p><p>Her mouth quirked.</p><p>RUBI: Nice. Thank you. But, no, I\u2019m not bringing him. He doesn\u2019t play well with other people. Never warmed up to Lexi or Jax.</p><p>WES: He\u2019s just got to get out more, interact. He\u2019s as sweet as his mama.</p><p>Rubi sighed and closed her eyes. A gooey sensation spread through her chest, followed quickly by a flash of uncomfortable heat.</p><p>\u201cLearned behavior,\u201d she told herself. \u201cYou can break this pattern.\u201d</p><p>She wandered into the kitchen to stand by Rodie and stare out at the ocean. The repetitive roll of waves layered her stress with a blanket of relief. Consistent. Ever present. Powerful. Protective. The ocean seemed to wrap her in a certainty of forever, helping with her jumpy nerves.</p><p>She glanced down at Rodie for the hundredth time today. His eyes were open, scanning every movement on the beach. She crouched beside him and stroked him, head to tail. \u201cHow are you doing, baby?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head, wagged his tail, and licked her face. But then immediately resumed his sad position. This just wasn\u2019t like him. He was an impossibly happy dog. Maybe she should call the vet. Then she thought of Wes and his experience with animals.</p><p>RUBI: I\u2019m worried he might be sick. Do you know how to tell?</p><p>WES: I\u2019m already halfway to your place, coming to check up on you. I\u2019ll take a look at him.</p><p>Her heart tripped at the news that he was close. An immediate bite of irritation followed. She didn\u2019t want these unsettling feelings. These little unexpected zings of electricity every time she thought of him were beyond annoying.</p><p>She smoothed her hand over Rodie\u2019s head. \u201cWes is coming to see you, baby.\u201d</p><p>At Wes\u2019s name, Rodie\u2019s head came off the floor. He pushed into a sitting position and his ears tilted forward. His eyes sparked with an alertness Rubi hadn\u2019t seen all day.</p><p>\u201cRubi, how\u2019s it going on your end?\u201d The voice in her ear redirected her attention.</p><p>She pressed her Mute button and replied to the woman overseeing the project. \u201cGreat,\u201d she lied. She\u2019d been skimming time from the NSA project to program the apps for Renegades\u2014because the apps were fun and the NSA project was mind-numbingly boring. After forgoing them both to work on Wes\u2019s project, she was going to be sleeping very little over the next week. \u201cEverything\u2019s on target.\u201d</p><p>Rodie pushed to his feet, tail wagging fiercely, ears perked. His whines picked up volume and pitch. Frowning, Rubi peered out the door. A figure jogged their direction. She narrowed her eyes on her dog\u2014the animal who loved no one but Rubi. The animal that growled and threatened everyone who came within half a mile of the house.</p><p>She crossed her arms and glared down at Rodie. He was acting completely normal. His lighthearted, happy self. Rubi shook her head and muttered, \u201cYou little traitor.\u201d</p><p>His paws were up against the glass before Wes was within half a mile, wearing nothing but swim trunks.</p><p>She rubbed the back of her neck and slid open the door, then the screen. Rodie let out a bark and took off toward Wes, ignoring a pair of Labradors walking with a man the other direction.</p><p>\u201cHey there, buddy,\u201d Wes called to Rodie as the dog approached, then dropped to his knees in the sand. Rodie jumped on him, paws on Wes\u2019s shoulders, licking his face. Wes\u2019s head tilted back, and laughter rolled from his throat, the deep, rich sound tingling through Rubi\u2019s body. \u201cSeems like you\u2019re feeling pretty good.\u201d</p><p>Rubi shook her head and touched the Mute button to sign off the call with the others. She was pulling the earpiece off when he looked up and spotted her standing in the doorway. Even several yards away now, she could see the joy in his smile.</p><p>Her stomach took a tumble, then squeezed, spurting adrenaline through her upper body. And this time when she tuned in to the emotions, there were far more what-ifs? than \u201cno ways.\u201d</p><p>He stood, flung the Frisbee toward Rubi\u2019s house, and Rodie took off after it. Wes followed. Rubi left the door open for him and returned to the living room to check on the program. Rodie trotted into the house first, a red Frisbee clutched in his mouth, his deep brown eyes sparkling and a bounce in his step. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wes appeared a moment later, his swim trunks covered in big red Hawaiian flowers on a white background contrasting with his tanned skin\u2014all that tanned skin wrapping his muscles.</p><p>He crouched in front of Rodie again, taking his face in both hands. \u201cHe looks good. Is he eating okay? Drinking water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, shooting him a lightly disgusted look. \u201cLittle faker perked right up when your name was mentioned.\u201d</p><p>The concern vanished from his expression, replaced by a wide grin and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. \u201cTold you he\u2019d love me.\u201d</p> <p>Rubi returned her gaze to the screen with a smirk.</p><p>He rounded the sofa to stand behind her and pressed his hands to her shoulders. With her upper body clad in only a bikini top, his palms were hot and slightly rough. The sensation flashed her back in time, to the feel of his fingers inside her. God, he\u2019d known just where, just how to touch her. Warmth spread low in her body.</p><p>His fingers flared over the back of her neck, exposed with her hair in a loose, messy twist. She closed her eyes and let out a long breath of relief.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re all knotted up.\u201d His voice registered guilt. \u201cHave you been working on this all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to. We need time to test it. And, honestly, Wes, this is a total experiment. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s such a great idea to use it on someone who just had surgery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything in the world starts as an experiment.\u201d He rubbed her shoulders. \u201cThe physical therapist knows all about the rig, and she\u2019s consulted with Wyatt\u2019s surgeon. But I didn\u2019t realize it was going to be so time-consuming for you. I know when someone needs a break, and someone recently taught me all about getting rid of this tension.\u201d</p><p>His thumbs made small circles, spreading relief down her neck. She let out a breathy moan and sank back on the sofa. Wes pressed a thumb to the knot. Rubi\u2019s moan transitioned to a whimper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tense against me.\u201d He repeated the words she\u2019d said to him when she\u2019d massaged the knots from his neck, but added a thick layer of suggestion. \u201cLet go,\u201d he murmured, leaning close to kiss the back of her neck. \u201cLet your body respond to me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and let more tension out of her muscles. Within seconds, the knot melted beneath his thumb. Rubi groaned with relief. \u201cOh my God. You\u2019re a quick learner.\u201d</p><p>Her computer pinged, signaling the completed transfer. \u201cDone. Shall we give it a try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incredible.\u201d He came around the sofa and took the rig she handed to him. As he swung it around his hips, Rubi lowered to her knees and reached for the straps.</p> <p>\u201cI added a few variations in the program with the exercises you sent me.\u201d She pointed to the e-mail he\u2019d sent earlier that day. \u201cGo in order. But don\u2019t expect much. It\u2019s on the lowest power setting.\u201d</p><p>She shifted to sit on the coffee table while Wes stretched out on the sofa. He pulled his knees to his chest. Did a few leg lifts. A few stretches. \u201cI can barely feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. He\u2019ll use this setting later in his recovery, when his muscles are strong and he doesn\u2019t need as much help. Roll to your side, and I\u2019ll put in the strongest program. He\u2019ll use this one first.\u201d</p><p>Wes rolled away from Rubi. She opened the compartment near his spine where she\u2019d had a friend insert a special relay and port for the micro discs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little worried about this one,\u201d she said as he lay back again. \u201cMove very slow and don\u2019t put much effort into your muscles.\u201d</p><p>He laced his fingers behind his head and watched his right knee as he pulled it into his body. With barely more effort than the tension of his muscle, the rig responded. The motor revved, hinge turned, straps lifted his leg.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d His eyes widened, and he grinned.</p><p>\u201cIs that a good whoa or a bad whoa?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s...powerful.\u201d He tested out more movements. \u201cIt\u2019s like...man, like I\u2019m not using any muscle at all. Like the rig is doing all the work.\u201d</p><p>A flash of excitement made Rubi squeal. She clapped her hands. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the way it\u2019s supposed to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, you\u2019re adorable.\u201d Wes sat up, reaching for her.</p><p>Rubi gasped and put a hand to his shoulder. \u201cNo, Wes\u2014\u201d</p><p>The rig reacted to the use of his muscles, the sensors reading his effort and multiplying it according to the program. The rig took over, jerking his legs. His knees bent and knocked him back on the sofa hard.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Rubi lunged toward him, reached behind his back, and hit the Power button. Her shock ebbed into fear, and her heart hammered. All the tension drained from the rig, and Wes\u2019s legs relaxed onto the sofa. She ran her hands over his thighs where his muscles spasmed beneath her fingers. \u201cAre you okay? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...okay. But, shit.\u201d He laughed the word but immediately grew serious. \u201cGood thing we tried this out. I can\u2019t have that happening to Wyatt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, massaging the flinching muscles. \u201cIt was just reacting to your sudden movement. I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019d move like that, but...\u201d Concern seeped in. \u201cMaybe I should program in some safety levels. Or create some noise filters, to guard against the rig responding to muscle spasms.\u201d Her eyes searched out his. \u201cWes, you\u2019re going to have to be with him when he uses this. It\u2019s not like anything on the market. The physical therapist won\u2019t know how to use it or control it. Christ, I don\u2019t want this to hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>He reached up and cupped her face. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with him whenever he uses it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should keep it with you. I wouldn\u2019t want someone else to try it....\u201d Suddenly this was sounding problematic. \u201cGod, Wes, I don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>He ran his thumb over her cheek, his eyes warm and reassuring. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it with me. No one else will use it with him until I train them. And I\u2019ll train Wyatt. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Still, panic fluttered in her chest. \u201cMaybe...maybe this isn\u2019t such a good idea... I mean, it\u2019s a great concept and an awesome rig, it\u2019s got a hell of a lot of potential, but, maybe it\u2019s not ready for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Wes pressed his thumb against her lips. \u201cRubi, it\u2019s going to be fine. It\u2019s going to be amazing.\u201d He paused, and thought drifted through his eyes. \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you come with me?\u201d</p><p>The words didn\u2019t immediately sink in. When they did, the panic in her chest ignited in flame. She pulled back. \u201cWhat? No\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows how this works better than you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could supervise. You could work with the therapist\u2014\u201d He stopped suddenly, his gaze clouding over. But it cleared a second later, refocusing on her. \u201cOr just me and Wyatt after I talk to the therapist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go, I\u2019m working\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can work anywhere, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a deadline, Wes, and your family...\u201d Oh God, yeah\u2014there was a red flag. His family. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, steadfast. \u201cThank you for offering, but no. You can handle it.\u201d</p><p>She unstrapped the rig from his thighs, once again tense and uncomfortable. Pulling the disc from the unit, she slid it into a baggie with the others. \u201cThey\u2019re labeled according to which he should start with. He needs to start with the strongest power and work backward, which is not intuitive. So, please, Wes, if you don\u2019t remember that or explain it to others\u2014\u201d</p><p>He rested his hands on her shoulders. She couldn\u2019t read his eyes now, as if he\u2019d closed off. \u201cI get it, Rubi. I\u2019m not stupid or careless.\u201d</p><p>Pain zinged across her ribs. \u201cI never... I don\u2019t mean... I know you\u2019re not. I\u2019m just...worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you should come with me. We don\u2019t have to stay with my parents. We\u2019ll get a hotel nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with your\u2014 What are you thinking? I can\u2019t even manage a decent relationship with my only relative. You can\u2019t expect me to jump into your family as if I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d She held up her hands, palms out. \u201cLook, I trust you with the rig. You can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine.\u201d He released her, but frustration filled his voice and disappointment tightened his expression. \u201cRelax.\u201d</p><p>She sat on the edge of the sofa, closed her laptop, and rested her head in her hand, rubbing her temple. \u201cSorry. The whole family thing just... I don\u2019t understand it, and I\u2019m not... I just don\u2019t do family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d he said, curving an arm around her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sorry too. I\u2019m not thrilled with this change of plans, and I\u2019m going to miss you. Come on. We should get over to Jax\u2019s before he calls looking for us.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Wes stood still while Rubi unsnapped the rig\u2019s straps\u2014again.</p><p>After that bizarre shock to his thigh muscles, she\u2019d insisted on bringing the computer and rig to Lexi and Jax\u2019s so she could add some safety measures to the program.</p><p>He was zero for two with Rubi today. He\u2019d really stepped in it when he\u2019d sprung his schedule change on her earlier. The look on her face when he\u2019d told her he\u2019d be leaving in a day instead of a week or more had shot an icy cold streak through him. The dismay and hurt had lasted only an instant before she\u2019d expertly shut off her emotions like a light. But that moment had given him a glimpse of what she must have looked like as a kid, receiving word her father had left town again without notice. She\u2019d denied caring when he\u2019d tried to explain the schedule change, but he could tell she was still out of sorts. Then he\u2019d gone and done it again when he\u2019d asked her to go to Missouri with him.</p><p>He hated knowing he\u2019d upset her. But what really bugged him was that both incidents were minor, everyday, normal events\u2014a schedule change and an invite to meet the parents. But for Rubi...obviously trigger points. On the other hand, she could climax on a crowded dance floor without pause, get caught giving him a blowjob and grin.</p><p>He was trying to understand\u2014he was\u2014but he just didn\u2019t get it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something someone who\u2019s had a normal upbringing would understand.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s words drilled into him, making him even more frustrated. How did he cope with something\u2014or help Rubi cope with something\u2014he couldn\u2019t understand?</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Rubi\u2019s concern drew him out of his daze. She had that one vertical line of worry between her brows as she looked up at him, her hands unhooking the bands from his thighs.</p><p>He ran a hand over her hair and nodded.</p><p>She pulled the rig off his hips and swung it clear of his body, pushing to her feet. Without heels, the top of her head just cleared his chin, and as he looked down at her now, she seemed so much smaller, somehow more fragile than he\u2019d ever thought of her before.</p><p>Her hand lifted and cupped his jaw. \u201cHey,\u201d she said, voice soft, so much real emotion in her eyes it made his stomach clench. \u201cReally. Are you okay? You\u2019ve been...I don\u2019t know... distracted since we got here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He covered her hand with his, turned his head, and kissed her palm. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about me, while I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are my issues, Wes, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo play with Rodie.\u201d She stepped back. \u201cYou two seem to make each other happy.\u201d</p> <p>Rubi walked back to the table where Jax and Lexi talked about the new house as they cleared dishes from the table. She connected the rig to her computer with a cable, sat, and propped her feet up on another chair. Her fingers started flying over the keyboard. How her mind worked that fast, he couldn\u2019t fathom.</p><p>He approached the table and picked up the Frisbee. Rodie danced on his hind legs beside him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have time for that, Lex,\u201d Jax was saying. \u201cI\u2019ll hire an interior designer. They\u2019ll make it just the way you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it going to be the way I want it?\u201d Lexi asked. \u201cIt\u2019s your house.\u201d</p><p>Jax wrapped his free arm around her shoulders, pulled her against him, and kissed her hard. \u201cOur house,\u201d he said as she smiled up at him. \u201cLet\u2019s practice. Repeat after me. Our. House.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi stretched up on her toes, her hands filled with plates. \u201cI kinda want to practice something else.\u201d</p><p>And she kissed him again. Jax groaned. He set the dishes in his hand down without breaking the kiss and gripped Lexi\u2019s face, pulling her in and kissing her hard. Wes didn\u2019t know how he knew, but he just knew\u2014those two were going to last the distance. He was both thrilled for them and envious of them at the same time.</p><p>Rodie let out one impatient bark, dragging Wes\u2019s gaze down to his brindle-and-white face. He took one look at those lopsided ears and smiled. He was one really freaking great dog, which, he knew from a lifetime of raising animals, said a lot about his owner. He glanced at Rubi once more and found her fingers still, hovering over the keys. When his gaze lifted to her face, she was staring, puzzled. The Are you really okay? look in her eyes propelled him toward the beach with the Frisbee.</p><p>The phone in his back pocket buzzed. He flung the Frisbee for Rodie, then pulled his phone out. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, stranger.\u201d His sister\u2019s bouncy voice instantly quelled his unease. The tension slipped from his shoulders and his jaw loosened with a smile. Somehow, the simple sound of her voice brought balance back to his topsy-turvy world. His family had always grounded him.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself. What\u2019s new?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Whitney quipped in a way that made him smile. \u201cMom and Dad\u2019s clothes drier caught on fire this morning while Tori was at the hospital with Wyatt and Abby and Emma and their new puppy were at Mom and Dad\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuppy?\u201d He watched Rodie jump the waves and grab the Frisbee. Wes had just talked with Tori, Wyatt\u2019s wife, two days ago, and she certainly hadn\u2019t said anything about a puppy. \u201cWhere the hell did the puppy come from?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer before he moved on to an even bigger question. \u201cAnd what the hell are they doing getting a puppy when Wyatt\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTori thought the girls needed a distraction. Said the girls were stressed and depressed with everything going on with Wyatt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d He was suddenly reminded of the constant chaos that seemed to reign around his childhood home\u2014family, friends, neighbors, pets, church groups, his mother\u2019s bunko club...and during harvest, complete mayhem for weeks. That brought up thoughts of his niece, Emma. \u201cHow\u2019s Emma dealing with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know Emma,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cDepends on the day.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he did know. Her autism made it difficult for her to tolerate such chaos. \u201cYou didn\u2019t suggest that slice of insanity, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite your tongue.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head at just another one of his sister-in-law\u2019s bizarre whims. Kinda like deciding to get pregnant without discussing it with Wyatt, and before they\u2019d decided to get married. Although, Wes had to smile when he thought of his oldest niece, the little result of that whim. \u201cThat girl... Shit, you know I love her, but sometimes...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBelieve me, I know. I live here.\u201d</p><p>Wes chuckled. \u201cLots of room out here in California, not to mention a shitload of messed-up heads for you to shrink. You\u2019d be a millionaire in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, California...\u201d she said wistfully, then, \u201cSpeaking of, Mom tells me you\u2019re flying in tomorrow. I drew the short straw, so I\u2019m stuck on airport duty. You\u2019ll have to take me out for drinks to make it up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d Wes said. \u201cHow\u2019s Wyatt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle better every day. Depressed, which is to be expected. Tori\u2019s...well, Tori. Up, down, sideways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has got to be hell on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Whitney\u2019s voice turned sad. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much hell on everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe physical therapy rig I\u2019m making is really coming along. I\u2019ve got a friend helping me with it. She\u2019s programmed it to respond to muscle stimuli. She\u2019s just adding some safety features as we speak. The whole thing is pretty slick. But don\u2019t tell anyone yet. I don\u2019t want Wyatt to get his hopes up until I have it in my hands, ready to go. I really think this is going to work great, Whit. Get him on his feet faster and stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope so. It\u2019s an amazing concept, and you could build a spaceship out of a trash can. So how are things with you?\u201d</p><p>He reached down to take the Frisbee from Rodie\u2019s mouth, and the pup shook out his wet fur, spraying Wes with cool seawater. He glanced over his shoulder toward Rubi and found her watching him, a soft smile on her face. \u201cAnother day in paradise.\u201d</p><p>Whitney laughed, and the sound made Wes smile. He did miss his family. He missed the support and sounding board they\u2019d always provided.</p><p>Which prompted Wes to say, \u201cHey, Whit?\u201d before he\u2019d fully thought out what he was going to say, then stumbling through, \u201cDo you know much about...neglect?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cWhat kind of neglect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn kids. You know, when parents aren\u2019t around or don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, drawing the word out with an uncertain tone. \u201cBut that\u2019s a broad topic. What\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a friend I\u2019m trying to understand better. She had a shitty father, no mother. The way we were raised...it\u2019s hard to relate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend...or a girlfriend?\u201d Whitney asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re...kinda trying to figure that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her voice dropped with dread.</p><p>Wes shifted on his feet. \u201cOh, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...how much time do you have? It\u2019s not simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you just give me the Cliff\u2019s notes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you this,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cHow deep are you in with her?\u201d</p><p>Over his head\u2014that was how deep. \u201cLook,\u201d he backpedaled, suddenly feeling sick. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. Forget I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat deep, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorta, kinda, not...really...\u201d Yes. That fucking deep.</p><p>A moment of silence followed. Wes pulled in a breath to cut off the awkwardness, but Whitney spoke before he could.</p><p>\u201cThe first thing you need to know is that no two cases of childhood neglect are alike, just like no two people are alike, so the effects are as unique as a fingerprint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut like a fingerprint, there are some overall similarities, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. The most important of which\u2014for you\u2014would be the person\u2019s inability to form lasting relationships.\u201d</p><p>That statement felt like a punch to his gut. When she didn\u2019t go on, he said, \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeglect is just another form of abuse.\u201d So much compassion filled Whitney\u2019s tone, Wes cringed. He couldn\u2019t stand thinking of Rubi as an abused kid. \u201cWe can talk about this more when you\u2019re home, but when a child doesn\u2019t connect with some type of primary caregiver, they lack the ability to truly connect with people. They\u2019re often unable to trust, suffer poor self-esteem, and can\u2019t regulate or even understand their own emotions let alone others\u2019. The longest-lasting effect is the PTSD\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What? She wasn\u2019t physically abused...at least I don\u2019t think...\u201d Fuck, he didn\u2019t know. Every muscle in his body was tight.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have to be. PTSD is an emotional reaction. Because she can\u2019t process them correctly, whenever they come\u2014the fear, anger, sadness\u2014she\u2019s going to want to run, or fight back.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s mind was churning, remembering everything he\u2019d learned about Rubi over the last two months, everything that had transpired with her over the last week. He glanced back at the group, where Lexi continued clearing the table, laughing at something Rubi said. \u201cWhat if she has a really good friend? One she\u2019s had for a decade? Someone who\u2019s like a sister to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good sign that she can hold a relationship together. But it\u2019s a woman-to-woman relationship, different from the way a woman exposes herself to a man when she\u2019s in love. Romantic relationships are typically the perfect storm for these people, Wes. No smooth sailing.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s gut felt shredded now. \u201cAre they... I don\u2019t know... I know this isn\u2019t the right word, but curable? I mean...can someone be rewired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must really like her,\u201d Whitney said, her voice soft.</p><p>Wes didn\u2019t confirm or deny. He was feeling a little fragile himself at the moment.</p><p>\u201cOf course there\u2019s hope, Wes. I\u2019m a psychologist. If I didn\u2019t believe I was helping people every day after all I\u2019ve gone through to get here, I\u2019d throw myself off a bridge. That said...after years of treating patients with childhood trauma, my advice to you\u2014as my brother, whom I love and want to see happy\u2014would be to back out as quickly and quietly as possible.\u201d</p><p>Yeah...no. Too late for that.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, switching away from the uncomfortable topic, \u201cdo you need my flight info?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Mom gave it to me.\u201d Squealing echoed from the background. \u201cOh boy. Sounds like they\u2019re having more fun with the dog. I better go. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait,\u201d Wes said, half-serious, half-dreading. \u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the Frisbee one more time for Rodie as his sister\u2019s words lay heavily in his gut. But his optimistic side kept fighting on Rubi\u2019s behalf. He picked out all Rubi\u2019s awesome qualities, justified and rationalized backward, forward, sideways, and diagonally to give her the benefit of the doubt. To tell himself he could be the one who was different for her.</p><p>But his other side doubted. And dreaded. And second-guessed his decision to start this sexual affair. A sexual affair that had instantly turned into something far more for Wes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDessert,\u201d Lexi called from the porch.</p><p>Wes waited for Rodie to return with the Frisbee, then started up the beach toward the house.</p><p>As he approached, Rubi closed her computer and met his gaze. Her eyes sparkled. Her smile heated. She leaned on the table and rested her chin in her palm. \u201cWes likes ice cream.\u201d</p><p>He instantly flashed back to her spread out over the kitchen counter, her gorgeous skin contrasted against the light granite, chocolate ice cream smeared over her already luscious body.</p> <p>As he neared, Rubi\u2019s gaze remained on his, a combination of soft, sweet, and starving. Knowing she was remembering too blew the discomfort away like a breeze, and all the emotions that had broken through the dam just days ago flooded back in.</p><p>Oh yeah. He was tripping over this woman.</p><p>At the edge of the table, he pulled his phone from his pocket, then planted his hands and leaned down until his forehead touched hers. \u201cI love that look in your eyes,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>One corner of her mouth tilted. \u201cAbout you. In the shower. How incredibly handsome you looked with your hair wet and off your face. That wickedly intense expression in the moment.\u201d She lowered her voice and brought her mouth toward his ear. \u201cThe thought makes me wet.\u201d</p><p>His heart thumped so hard he didn\u2019t hear Lexi set down the bowl of strawberries at his elbow. He waited until she\u2019d turned away before he whispered, \u201cWant to stay with me tonight?\u201d</p> <p>She leaned back enough to meet his eyes.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, he added, \u201cRodie can stay, too. I\u2019ll even let him sleep on the bed. Just not between us.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze searched his a moment before she said, \u201cThat\u2019s...not really my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither is fucking a guy more than once,\u201d he said, keeping his voice private. \u201cOr sex with no condom. But you\u2019ve blown through those ideas with flying colors.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a hand to his cheek and turned her head to kiss his lips. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but her kissing him in front of Jax and Lexi sent his hopes skyrocketing. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>The smile on her mouth told Wes that was far more of a yes than a no, and his heart constricted with hope.</p> <p>\u201cYou two need a room?\u201d Jax asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty right behind you.\u201d</p><p>Wes pushed up from the table, his head light. To cover the intensity of his emotions, he went for melodrama\u2014and heat reduction\u2014by slapping his hand to his chest as if he were having a heart attack, stumbled backward, and fell flat on his back in the pool.</p><p>Cool water bathed his body, closed over his head, and a moment of dense silence encapsulated him. When he broke the surface, he laid his head back so the water pushed his hair off his face. Rubi and Lexi were laughing. Jax sat in a chair with a smirk on his face, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about now,\u201d Wes asked Rubi.</p><p>A slow nod tilted her head and she spoke around laughter. \u201cDefinitely leaning toward an affirmative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Wes pumped a dripping fist in the air and enjoyed another round of her laughter as he pushed out of the pool. God, he loved making her laugh. Making her happy. It had become his primary daily focus. And the thought of holding her all night, his body tangled with hers, sounded like absolute ecstasy.</p><p>Grabbing a towel from one of the patio chairs, he watched Rubi fix an empty plate with pound cake, strawberries, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream, then slide it toward the spot next to her before putting a few strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream on a plate for herself. He had no idea what it was about watching her fix a plate for him that made him go all funky inside, but it did.</p><p>As soon as he sat down, a phone rang. Everyone looked down and checked pockets.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine,\u201d Rubi said, pulling her iPhone from her purse at her feet and frowning at the screen.</p><p>She tapped a button and put it to her ear. \u201cRubi Russo.\u201d</p><p>She put a strawberry in her mouth as she listened, and Wes cut into the shortcake she\u2019d made for him with the side of his own fork. A vertical crease appeared between her eyes. \u201cExcuse...me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, mouth tightened, body stiffened. Wes swore the air around her crackled with burgeoning anger.</p><p>His stomach fell. He could just about bet whoever was on the other line had just ruined his chance to sleep with her tonight.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Rubi searched her mind to make sense of this, but nothing congealed. And even though she was sure she\u2019d heard the man on the other end of the call correctly the first time, she asked him, \u201cCan you repeat that, please?\u201d</p><p>The man gave a heavy, irritable huff. \u201cMy name is Richard Klein,\u201d he said in a tone someone would use with a bratty five-year-old. \u201cI\u2019m a real estate broker with Exceptional Properties in Los Angeles, and I\u2019m standing in front of your house with a prospective buyer, but the key in the lock box isn\u2019t opening the door.\u201d</p><p>A dark, heavy sensation grew in the pit of her stomach. \u201cThat would be because the house isn\u2019t up for sale. Your office obviously made a mistake. Maybe you have the wrong Rubi Russo. Where did you get this number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was listed as belonging to the resident.\u201d His growing frustration oozed from his voice. \u201cDo you live at 961 Wildflower Terrace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is the owner of the house Mr. Rudolpho Russo?\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Her stomach sank.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</p><p>Anger roiled beneath the shock.</p><p>That bastard.</p><p>\u201cMs. Russo?\u201d Klein prodded.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she bit out. \u201cBut the house is not on the market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you miss the gigantic lock box on the front door?\u201d Klein\u2019s voice denounced Rubi\u2019s ignorance and rose incrementally with each question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t use the front door, Mr. Klein, I use the kitchen door. And last time I checked, I couldn\u2019t read minds. Since I was not informed, that would make you and your clients SOL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he huffed the word, \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with you. I\u2019d simply like to show the house. Can you please open the front door or tell me how to get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...no.\u201d She hoped her own you fucking idiot tone came through loud and clear, then reminded herself not to shoot the messenger-even if he was a pompous ass. \u201cUntil someone of authority tells me directly the house is on the market, the door remains locked.\u201d</p><p>Rubi disconnected the call and stared at the phone. Billows and billows of anger pluming inside her body, raising her temperature, quickening her heart. Everyone at the table must have recognized her fury, because no one said anything for a heavy, extended moment.</p><p>\u201cThat thoughtless, selfish, greedy bastard.\u201d She ground out the barely audible words from between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a mistake,\u201d Lexi offered, but her unsettled voice gave her away.</p><p>Lexi knew what a fucker Dolph was. She\u2019d warned Rubi about living in the house. And knew how often Dolph sliced Rubi every time she held out a reconciling hand-even though she had nothing to reconcile for-other than being born.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t deserve Rubi\u2019s ire, but the emotions were slipping out of her control. \u201cYou damn well know this is not a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s\u201d-Wes\u2019s tentative voice tugged at her-\u201cgoing on?\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s eyes slid closed, humiliation layering fury...and betrayal...and self-denigration. Her solid world fell away from beneath her feet as if Dolph had opened a trapdoor. Again. Her emotions were hot. Black. Ugly.</p><p>She dialed her father\u2019s office, her jaw clenching so hard her teeth hurt. No one at the table said anything as the phone rang in her ear. She could feel three sets of concerned and confused eyes on her, which only infused shame.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She stood, trying not to register the worry. \u201cGo ahead and eat.\u201d</p><p>Wandering toward the edge of the pool deck, she waited, her mind pinging and spinning.</p><p>\u201cRusso Industries, Dolph Russo\u2019s office,\u201d his secretary answered. A new secretary by the unfamiliar sound of her voice, and the fact that she was still there at nearly ten o\u2019clock at night. Dolph went through secretaries like water. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Rubi Russo, Dolph\u2019s unfortunate offspring. Put him on the line, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ms. Russo, he\u2019s on a conference call. I can-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d she said, squeezing her eyes shut to hold her temper and the burgeoning hurt, \u201ctell the self-centered bastard to put the conference call on hold and talk to his daughter. This is an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...please hold, Ms. Russo.\u201d</p><p>The deeper the news sank, the angrier she grew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ms. Russo,\u201d the secretary came back on the line. \u201cHe isn\u2019t able to speak with you right now.\u201d</p><p>That fucker. \u201cDid you tell him it was an emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019m in the hospital, dying.\u201d Rubi was done. So fucking done with this man. She didn\u2019t need this shit in her life. \u201cGo on. Tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...hold on, please.\u201d</p><p>She wished she was holding a regular phone. One she could slam down to disconnect. That was one major drawback to cell phones.</p><p>The line picked up again with a hesitant, \u201cMs. Russo? I\u2019m so sorry. Is there something I can do for you? Your father can\u2019t come to the phone.\u201d</p><p>Her anger intensified until she couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cMs. Russo?\u201d</p><p>She scraped in air. \u201cYes,\u201d she rasped. \u201cYou can quit before he ruins your existence.\u201d</p><p>Rubi stabbed the End button and stood there, one hand gripping the railing, one her phone. And for the millionth time in her life, a sense of complete, primal betrayal filled her.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Wes\u2019s soft voice behind her made her squeeze her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d She turned but couldn\u2019t meet his eyes. Instead she focused on the supple muscle of his pecs. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to straighten this out with Dolph.\u201d She started past Wes toward the table. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again to everyone. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to ruin dinner.\u201d</p><p>Rubi picked up her purse. \u201cCome on, Rodie.\u201d</p><p>Rodie climbed to his feet where he lay beside Wes\u2019s chair and trotted to her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Lexi asked.</p><p>\u201cHis office. He can\u2019t ignore me if I yank that phone from his hand and brain him with it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll drive you.\u201d Wes grabbed his T-shirt off the table.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d No no no. He\u2019d already witnessed enough of her bad side. A bad side he now knew was multifaceted. \u201cThank you, but no. That kind of exposure would tarnish all your shine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not driving this angry.\u201d Wes\u2019s statement was final, forceful. The demand rankled, and she shot him a glare. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you,\u201d he repeated with a look so serious she knew she\u2019d have a battle on her hands to get out of there alone. And she just didn\u2019t have the energy. She needed to save it all for Dolph. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTake my car,\u201d Lexi told Wes. \u201cKeys are on the kitchen counter. And grab something of mine from the dresser in the bedroom. Leave Rodie. He\u2019ll be fine here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I appreciate you guys, but this is my mess-\u201d</p><p>Wes grabbed her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She grumbled a, \u201cFine,\u201d and changed into a pair of Lexi\u2019s jeans and a long-sleeved V-necked shirt while Wes waited downstairs. When she met him at the front door, he\u2019d pulled on jeans as well.</p> <p>He stayed silent through the first ten minutes of the drive, which gave her time to get herself together after the jolt. Wes was either as patient as a saint or scared to ask her anything lest she bite off his head. But the longer Rubi had to think about Dolph\u2019s latest betrayal, the further into her shell she curled. The more she second-guessed having men in her life at all. And after witnessing the mess she and Dolph called a relationship, Wes\u2019s interest in her might just flatline, eliminating the problem of their developing relationship all together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you angry.\u201d Wes\u2019s voice finally pierced the hum of road noise in a thoughtful, relaxed tone.</p><p>\u201cNot pretty, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re always pretty. Just not exactly...your style. I mean, you\u2019ve always been composed to the point of self-possession. Self-confident but flippant and easygoing. Which\u201d-his voice dropped-\u201cis one reason I think I enjoy watching you come apart with me.\u201d</p><p>His sexual reference flooded her pelvis with heat, temporarily distracting her.</p> <p>\u201cSure you\u2019re not overreacting?\u201d he asked.</p><p>A barb of annoyance prickled inside her. She didn\u2019t need that pointed out. \u201cReally? A real estate agent appears at my door at nine o\u2019clock on a weekday night to show a house I didn\u2019t know was for sale? A house I\u2019ve offered to buy-from my father no less-and been ignored? I don\u2019t know, Wes, am I overreacting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d offered to buy it, but...maybe. A little.\u201d</p><p>Traffic on the 405 was light tonight, and Wes kept Lexi\u2019s car at the speed limit, probably to give Rubi a chance to change her mind. Wouldn\u2019t happen. She was calling that fucker on his blatant disregard. It might mean nothing to Dolph, but it meant something to Rubi. Confronting him was important for Rubi to do for herself.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should talk about it before we get there,\u201d Wes suggested in his even tone. \u201cYou know...decompress a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has been building for twenty-five years,\u201d Rubi said, simmering with something that had developed into complete disgust. Occasionally bordering pure hatred-like now. \u201cI won\u2019t decompress in ten minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. What about giving me a little background so I know what we\u2019re walking into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be better if you stayed in the car.\u201d She wasn\u2019t trying to be bitchy, but she really worked better on her own. All this \u201chelp\u201d only made her second-guess herself. Only made her more insecure.</p><p>\u201cAnd let you strangle him with your bare hands?\u201d he asked. \u201cSorry, baby, I wouldn\u2019t survive living without you for fifteen to life.\u201d</p><p>A huff of laughter escaped her throat, but no humor resided there. Only irony. And a twist of discomfort at his insinuation that he needed her. Or that they\u2019d be together for the long-term. She couldn\u2019t go there now. She was way too messed up to think about what she had going with Wes.</p><p>Rubi laid her head back on the seat and kept her gaze out the window. She hated admitting it, but she did feel better having Wes with her. Stronger. Safer. More grounded. More rational. Which was how she usually felt with Lexi\u2019s support. And the fact that Wes had become an influence similar to Lexi in just two months... That really tweaked her. She\u2019d never been good at depending on others. Had always felt safest operating under her own control. Depending on only herself.</p><p>Then when people left, she wasn\u2019t stranded-emotionally or physically.</p><p>So much betrayal lay between Rubi and Dolph, she couldn\u2019t even begin to describe the damage to their relationship. Or, she realized-maybe for the first time with any clarity-fix the damn thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve offered to buy the house,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s always brushed me off. And before you ask, yes, I offered him market price. I never expected any favors.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he sell it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything related to money is a game for him. He\u2019d never tell me why, just refused. Or ignored. He\u2019s excellent at pretending I don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me,\u201d Wes said, \u201cbut I\u2019m curious. What is market value?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I offered-about three months ago-fourteen million.\u201d</p><p>Wes whistled softly through his teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s some big cash. I knew you made good money, like really good money, but I didn\u2019t realize... I don\u2019t know if I can afford all the work you\u2019ve already done on the rig.\u201d He hummed, the sound worried and melodramatic. \u201cI may have to pay it back in favors.\u201d</p><p>That made a smile lift her mouth. She knew what kind of favors he had in mind. But she was too disjointed to banter with him. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m charging you Jax\u2019s rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we never discussed what Jax\u2019s rate is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never let Jax pay for anything.\u201d</p><p>She rested her elbow on the door handle and rubbed her forehead. The futility of going to Dolph\u2019s office was sinking in. She\u2019d never get a real answer from him. She\u2019d never be able to instill the concept of personal violation or common human decency he should have employed in this situation. She knew-knew-none of that worked with Dolph. Hadn\u2019t worked for decades. Yet, she needed to go. Needed, one more time, to see his in-your-face disinterest firsthand.</p><p>No matter how badly the little girl inside her wanted to believe that one day Dolph would wake up and realize his mistake of alienating his only child, the adult in her knew it wouldn\u2019t happen. Ever. She\u2019d been needing to let go of the irrational hope for years.</p><p>This was the last straw for Rubi. She loved that house. He knew it. And he couldn\u2019t have cared less.</p><p>Today was the day.</p><p>\u201cYou have to know that won\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Wes said. \u201cYou have to know I\u2019m going to pay you for your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes, please don\u2019t start that now. I\u2019m not going to argue over something so ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ridiculous. You\u2019ve put off other work to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Irritation burned across her nerves. \u201cFine, Wes, pay me. I\u2019m not going to argue with you.\u201d Bitterness saturated her words and guilt flooded her chest. She covered her face with her hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. God, I\u2019m not mad at you.\u201d</p><p>He parked in front of the building, turned off the engine, clicked his seat belt free, and reached across the console between them. Rubi planted a hand against his chest before he could pull her into his arms. \u201cDon\u2019t make me go all soft right before I have to be tough.\u201d</p><p>A slow grin turned his mouth, and one hand brushed hair off her face. \u201cI can make you go all soft? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop?\u201d She pushed him away. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m here anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jerking the door open, she stepped onto the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cBecause that dick made you waste a perfect strawberry shortcake, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>Wes fell into step beside her as she started toward the massive glass front doors. A security guard sat behind a desk in the lobby, the building\u2019s lights still burning down on him. Rubi recognized the man\u2019s long thin face beneath the brim of a navy baseball cap with the word SECURITY across the front.</p><p>Frank glanced up, his face weary-until he recognized her. Then he broke into a surprised smile that shot pleasure through her and stood quickly, his movements still fluid for his age.</p><p>\u201cWell, looky here.\u201d He came out from around the desk, arms open and immediately enveloped Rubi in a hug. That spark of pleasure expanded as she wrapped her arms around the older man\u2019s middle and pressed her cheek against his chest, eyes closed. This was how a father should react. This was how she should feel about a father. Yet this man was no more her blood than Wes.</p><p>\u201cRubi, darlin\u2019.\u201d His Southern accent was still thick. \u201cSo good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Frank.\u201d When she pulled back and smiled up at him, she suddenly felt tired. Like her soul had been bruised. \u201cHow are you? How\u2019s Lucy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. Lucy\u2019s better.\u201d He slid his hands down her arms. \u201cJust finished her second round of chemo and lives in the wigs you two picked out for her. She loves them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew she\u2019d pull through. She\u2019s a fighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike someone else I know.\u201d His light blue eyes had clouded over in the years since she\u2019d seen him, but they still flickered with humor and warmth.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s grin tipped into a grimace as she stepped away. \u201cSpeaking of fighting...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere to see Dolph, huh?\u201d He cast a glance toward Wes. \u201cHe looks like he could hold his own.\u201d</p><p>Rubi introduced the men, and Wes came forward to shake Frank\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cAny friend of Rubi\u2019s is welcome here,\u201d he said, then to Rubi, \u201cI have to tell him you\u2019re on your way up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s fine.\u201d Rubi reached out and squeezed his arms. He had worried over her so much in her younger years. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d He nodded resignedly and turned toward the desk again. He touched something on the control panel, and the elevators nearby dinged, the silver doors sliding open. He shot Rubi a grin and said, \u201cShields cloaked.\u201d</p><p>A laugh bubbled from her. \u201cRight. Thanks for the reminder.\u201d</p><p>Inside the elevator, Rubi pressed the top floor, then leaned against the wall opposite Wes.\u201cShields cloaked?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAn old joke between us. Once too often he had to watch me come out of this elevator crying. He pulled me aside and explained the whole Star Trek \u2018shields cloaked\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>Wes nodded slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s...ominous.\u201d</p><p>Rubi lifted one shoulder. \u201cMore...inevitable.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, pulled in a breath, and blew it out slowly through her lips. Her anger had ebbed into annoyed resignation, and she knew that had a lot to do with Wes.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to help this go smoother?\u201d he asked, voice soft, serious.</p><p>She opened her eyes, and the sincerity in his gaze, the pure affection, slammed Rubi\u2019s chest like a rocket. She twisted her mouth into a smirk. \u201cProbably by staying out of it.\u201d</p><p>He matched her lopsided grin. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>The doors opened, and Rubi stepped toward him. She patted his chest once. \u201cYour best is outstanding, Lawson.\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked directly into a seating area. Drawing herself up with a confidence she didn\u2019t feel, Rubi straightened her shoulders, lifted her chin, and pushed assurance into her step, telling herself she owned the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMs. Russo...\u201d The secretary\u2019s dark eyes were wide as she set the phone down-from Frank\u2019s call, Rubi knew. Then her gaze cut to Wes, where he stayed several feet behind her. \u201cI... I...\u201d</p><p>Rubi stopped in front of the desk and held out her hand. The young woman\u2019s gaze darted between Rubi\u2019s hand and her face before she reached out and curved her fingers around Rubi\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you,\u201d Rubi said.</p><p>She pivoted on her flip-flop and went straight to the floor-to-ceiling door in her father\u2019s office, flung it open, and walked in, with the shocked and panicked secretary stuttering behind her.</p> <p>\u201cMs. Russo... Ms. Russo, please don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>From the corner of Rubi\u2019s eye, she saw Wes cut into the woman\u2019s path. The secretary stopped short, her eyes wide as they climbed his chest to his face. Wes was a full foot taller. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safer if you don\u2019t get between those two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-but-\u201d</p><p>Wes stepped into the office and closed the door-quietly-in the woman\u2019s face.</p><p>He turned, keeping his body tall and taut, hands clasped, stance shoulder width. He met her gaze with a silent message of unwavering support and unquestioning belief. An irrational surge of emotion shot through Rubi-gratitude and affection and a sense of humility for his friendship. And she couldn\u2019t deny the decrease in anger toward Dolph when she had someone as good as Wes in her life.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to cut this short, Larry.\u201d Dolph\u2019s deep, commanding voice seemed to fill every crevice of the office. \u201cA problem\u2019s just come up.\u201d</p><p>Rubi met her father\u2019s annoyed glance. This was old, old history. Straight out of his worst-father-of-the-year playbook. The warmth Wes had infused now drained. Quickly. Leaving her cold. And empty.</p><p>\u201cAnd that problem would be me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to run a business here.\u201d Dolph stood in profile, looking out at the city lights from one of his many picture windows. He pulled a Bluetooth from his ear and tossed the headset on a stack of papers. His dark skin, at least three shades darker than Rubi\u2019s, pulled taut over his face in what looked like both fatigue and aggravation. \u201cYou still listen as well as you did when you used to stuff Q-tips in your ears at four.\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have come. She knew that now. The moment she\u2019d gotten the call from the Realtor, discovered Dolph had undercut her again, she should have walked out of that house and into a hotel. Stayed there until she\u2019d found another place to live. That would have cut her last tie to Dolph. This spontaneous visit had been an irrational codependent effort to keep the turmoil between them alive. A reflex. Because turmoil had always been better than nothing.</p><p>Only...it wasn\u2019t anymore.</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really know,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never talked to me when I was four. Or six. Or eight. Or eighteen.\u201d</p><p>With a condescending smirk, Dolph rounded his desk and sat on the edge. He cast a careless survey over Wes, then turned back to Rubi. \u201cAre you just here to add more aggravation to my day?\u201d</p><p>The simple act of looking at him, speaking to him, stirred years and years, layers upon layers of hurt and anger and soul-deep disappointment. She did her best to put it into perspective. This could be the last time she ever spoke with him if she chose. That helped her hold an even tone.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you put the house on the market without telling me?\u201d</p><p>He made a careless gesture with his hand as if dismissing her. \u201cThe Realtor was supposed to take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it too much to ask of my father to touch a button and dial his daughter to give her the information himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d He used his don\u2019t-push-it tone. Only, he couldn\u2019t send her to her room anymore. Couldn\u2019t punish her. Couldn\u2019t take anything away-he\u2019d already put the only thing she wanted from him on the market.</p><p>She wandered along the edge of his desk, glancing over the photos lining his credenza against one wall. Dolph flanked by Dodgers Matt Kemp and Clayton Kershaw. Dolph with Raiders\u2019 quarterback Terrelle Pryor. Dolph with the Lakers\u2019 Kobe Bryant. Then there was frame after frame of Dolph with politicians, Forbes 500 icons, celebrities, celebrities, and more celebrities.</p> <p>Not one image of Rubi. Not from her childhood. Not from her two college graduations. Not from her modeling career.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019re busy,\u201d she said, her tone light but her heart heavy. \u201cSo why not take this house off your plate altogether and accept one of the six offers I made you over the last year? Or even simply acknowledge them?\u201d</p><p>Wes remained perfectly silent. Perfectly still. Yet perfectly present.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he drew out the word, patience waning, \u201cthis is business. Putting property on the market creates competition-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriving up the price,\u201d she finished for him, a sinking, half-numb sensation dropping low in her belly. \u201cAnd the sales game is far more important to you than my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeelings have no place in business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about ethics?\u201d Rubi asked. \u201cWhat about kindness? What about human decency? Do those have any place in business?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled heavily, a look of utter exasperation on his face. He glanced at Wes again. Crossed his arms. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Wes approached. Rubi had seen Wes\u2019s size and unexpected intensity intimidate smaller men, but Dolph was too full of himself, too arrogant for intimidation.</p><p>\u201cWes Lawson,\u201d he said without offering his hand. His eyes looked stony in the dim light. \u201cA friend of your daughter\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Rubi appreciated his attempted relationship plug, though she knew it would go unheard.</p><p>\u201cWes Lawson.\u201d Dolph\u2019s eyes narrowed. He turned, taking a sudden interest in Wes. \u201cLawson...\u201d he drew out as if trying to remember where he\u2019d heard the name. Dolph\u2019s gaze darted back to Rubi. \u201cIs this the guy you called me about? Something about a physical therapy device?\u201d</p><p>Wes shot a stunned look at Rubi, and her stomach fell the rest of the way to her feet. Her phone call to Dolph about the rig had never entered her mind. Shit. She would have liked to have told Wes about that first. But...too late now.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She held up her hands, palms out. \u201cYou remember that, but you don\u2019t remember my six offers on your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave the message to one of my junior partners.\u201d Dolph spoke directly to Wes. Rubi had been completely dismissed. \u201cShe did some research into this rehabilitation unit and thinks it\u2019s viable. She tells me you\u2019re a very talented engineer. Graduated at the top of your class from Missouri S&amp;T, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI graduated top of my class from USC and Birmingham,\u201d Rubi said, \u201cbut you\u2019ve never even mentioned it. Didn\u2019t show for graduation. Didn\u2019t even pick up the fucking phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d He spared her a disapproving, don\u2019t-interrupt parental glance. \u201cI\u2019m talking.\u201d Then refocused on Wes. \u201cTell me about this device you\u2019ve created.\u201d</p><p>The look on Wes\u2019s face was a cross between disgust and fury. \u201cI\u2019m here because Rubi is interested in buying the house she\u2019s living in. Not to talk about the rig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you hit up other developers?\u201d Dolph asked with a fresh glint in his eyes as if he smelled money. \u201cHave you had any offers on the device yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral.\u201d Rubi stepped up beside Wes. This was over. She was swamped in a flood of pain and anger that stretched deep below the surface, and she had to get out of here. Hopefully save Wes in the process. \u201cMultimillion-dollar offers from major corporations.\u201d</p><p>Wes gripped her forearm. \u201cI think we\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re interested,\u201d Rubi laid out her last card on Wes\u2019s behalf, \u201cyou\u2019d better come up with a better deal than he\u2019s already got.\u201d</p><p>Wes pulled her around toward the door. She didn\u2019t resist or argue.</p><p>\u201cWes.\u201d Dolph called at his back, approaching with a business card in his hand. \u201cCall my chief of development. She\u2019s young and sharp. And very excited about your invention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubi\u2019s also young and sharp and very interested in your house.\u201d Wes took the card and met Dolph\u2019s gaze purposefully. \u201cIt seems like a good time for consideration all around.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Wes jammed the elevator\u2019s down button with a knuckle. It took everything he had not to walk back into that room and slam his fist into Dolph\u2019s face. He was so damned average\u2014average height, average build, average appearance. All the looks in the family had to have come from Rubi\u2019s mother. How a man so average could spew such hurtful words, Wes couldn\u2019t quite get his mind around.</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d Rubi twisted her arm in his grip. When he looked down, her brow was pulled in a grimace.</p><p>He eased the pressure on her hand as the elevator dinged and the doors slid open. Teeth clenching, he stepped in and didn\u2019t release Rubi until the doors had closed. He didn\u2019t expect her to go back into her father\u2019s office; he just...needed to have a hold of her, as if that would somehow protect her.</p><p>But even after the doors closed, he couldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Wes.\u201d</p><p>He forced his hand open, then crossed his arms and pressed his back to one wall.</p><p>\u201cLet me explain,\u201d she said, her face a mix of misery and fear. \u201cYou have every right to be pissed. I overstepped. I shouldn\u2019t have talked to my father about the rig. And I didn\u2019t, really... I mean I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d He hadn\u2019t been this mad since...oh, yeah, a few nights ago, when some stranger had plowed his fist into his eye because of that fucker Bolton. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about the rig. How could you let him talk to you like that?\u201d</p><p>She stared, that confused vertical crease between her eyes, lips parted. Christ, she was so beautiful. Inside and out. And so much he hadn\u2019t understood about her made sense now. After being raised by a pig like that, it was no wonder she wasn\u2019t interested in a relationship. Not a fucking surprise she didn\u2019t believe love could last. If Wes had been taught that love was bad, ugly, painful, he wouldn\u2019t have believed it either.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t...let him talk to me like that, he just...does. Which is why I don\u2019t see him. Why I hate him. Why...I\u2019m never going to speak to him again after tonight.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s skin was on fire. His brain a twist of fury. He wiped a palm across his forehead. Before he knew it, the rage overtook him, and he slammed his hand into the mirrored wall with a feral growl. The reflective surface splintered, and pain shot through his hand. A strangled scream curdled in Rubi\u2019s throat. In the cracked reflection, she jumped and tented her hands over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She sucked an audible breath. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Goddammit. He instantly regretted the show of insane frustration.</p><p>She pushed her hands through her hair, her gaze on the floor. \u201cI knew I should have come alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wes dropped his arm and shook out his hand. His fingers were dripping blood on the tan patterned carpet. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t need anyone, right?\u201d</p><p>His voice came out bitter. He was so angry\u2014at Dolph for being such a bastard, at himself for letting Rubi convince him to stay out of it, at Rubi for... God he didn\u2019t even know. Maybe for hanging on to this fucker as long as she had.</p><p>The thought made him lunge for her. He gripped her arms and gave her a little shake. \u201cAre you living off his money? Is that why he\u2019s still in your life? Because I have money. I have a million of racing money sitting around collecting interest. You can have it if you just get the fuck away from\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She lifted her hands and pressed them to his chest, her voice sure and steady, as if compensating for his imbalance. \u201cNo, Wes. My money is my own, and I have plenty. I told you the truth earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen...why? Why have any contact with him when he treats you like that?\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened, and Rubi\u2019s expression closed up. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this outside.\u201d</p><p>She turned away, stepping out of the elevator.</p><p>Wes looked down at his hand. Blood everywhere. \u201cFucking fantastic.\u201d</p><p>He fisted the mess behind his back and exited the elevator. Rubi was already in quiet conversation with Frank. He nodded, drew her into a hug, and saluted Wes over Rubi\u2019s shoulder. She took Wes\u2019s arm, leading him toward the main doors and down the front walkway toward the car. \u201cGive me the keys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not driving this angry.\u201d She repeated his own earlier words deliberately. \u201cGive me the keys.\u201d</p><p>Wes shoved them into her open hand feeling defeated and strode to the passenger\u2019s door. \u201cYou should be just as angry.\u201d</p><p>When the car chirped, he yanked open the door and slid into the seat, every muscle taut. He flattened his injured hand over his knee and stared down at the blood. He had a couple of good cuts over his knuckles. One he was pretty sure needed stitches. God, what a fucking dumb shit. His emotions had been strung out since he\u2019d first kissed Rubi. He\u2019d ignored them. Convinced himself he could deal. That he could handle her, handle himself, handle something between them. Now look at him.</p><p>Rubi shut her door but didn\u2019t start the engine. \u201cListen for a minute.\u201d She took a deep breath and closed her eyes. \u201cWhen I saw how amazing the rig\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about the rig\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut. Up.\u201d She turned blazing green eyes on him. \u201cPlease, Wes. I need to tell you this.\u201d</p><p>He pushed pent-up air out of his mouth, clenched his teeth, and stared through the windshield.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get a sense of how marketable it would be. I knew the quality was there, but I don\u2019t know the rehabilitation market. All Dolph\u2019s businesses started with one\u2014selling inventions. And that continues to be the basis of his empire. All his other companies\u2014consulting, manufacturing, sales, shipping\u2014have stemmed from that one, which continues to feed the rest. Knowing the value of an invention is Dolph\u2019s specialty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck does this have to do with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished,\u201d she said, her voice steely. \u201cAnd if you want to walk home, interrupt me one more time.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the door handle.</p><p>She grabbed his arm. \u201cGoddammit, Wes. I\u2019m trying to tell you something important.\u201d</p><p>The catch in her voice stopped him.</p> <p>\u201cI have several contacts of my own,\u201d she continued, \u201cwho could take your rig and run with it. But before I approached you with the idea, I wanted to know just how viable this would be on the market. It\u2019s a long road from idea to production. Most of which you\u2019ve already covered on your own. But things can go bad along the way. I\u2019ve seen many dreams crushed, and with it their creators\u2019 hearts. I didn\u2019t want to get your hopes up and then end up disappointing you.\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not hearing me. I\u2019ve never thought of selling it. I don\u2019t give a fuck about doing anything with it but helping Wyatt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not hearing me. I\u2019m not talking thousands, Wes. I\u2019m talking millions. Millions and millions. I\u2019m talking about you being able to buy houses like Jax\u2019s any time you wanted. I\u2019m talking about never worrying about money for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s gut went cold. He dropped his head back, and his gaze slid up the glass monolith her father owned. \u201cYou\u2019d let me do business with that fucker? Just for the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re dense.\u201d Rubi sounded as twisted as Wes felt. \u201cI\u2019m telling you I was using him as a gauge before I suggested you go with someone else. I\u2019d never suggest you do business with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I said the money doesn\u2019t interest me? That I\u2019d rather have you than any amount of money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say one doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the other.\u201d She paused, then turned the engine over, but when she spoke, her voice was softer, filled with complex emotions Wes couldn\u2019t pull apart. \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re too idealistic and too shortsighted for an almost-thirty-year-old living in Los Angeles, working in the movie industry. I\u2019d tell you to open your eyes and look down the road. I\u2019d remind you that, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, you\u2019re in a dangerous line of work, with no backup. I\u2019d point out how quickly that million will go if you\u2019re hurt and out of work for any length of time. So I\u2019d say you might want to pull your shortsighted, romantic head out of your ass, stop paying so much attention to today, and start focusing on tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d pass on some important advice I got when I was at the top of my modeling career.\u201d She cast a flat glance toward him. \u201cYou won\u2019t always be young, healthy, and beautiful. Use your best years wisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho gave you that advice?\u201d he asked dully.</p><p>\u201cLexi.\u201d</p><p>The thirty-five-floor, smoky-mirror-lined building in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, a building worth hundreds of millions of dollars, slipped out of his view. The dark sky filled his vision, but for some bizarre reason, his parents\u2019 ranch-style home on a farm in Podunk Missouri filled his mind\u2019s eye. And in a sudden flash of dread, Wes saw himself and Rubi as mismatched as the buildings.</p><p>His body released its tension, and he sank into the cradle of the luxury sedan\u2019s molded leather seats. A car Jax had bought for Lexi. Yeah, he had some money packed away in low-risk investments, but Rubi was right\u2014a million dollars wasn\u2019t all that much money nowadays. Wes sure as hell couldn\u2019t begin to fathom the ability to purchase a home like Jax\u2019s or Rubi\u2019s fathers\u2019. His mind backpedaled and replayed Rubi\u2019s monologue on his finances. His future. And he recognized a new gut-level discomfort. One stemming not only from the cultural variance existing between him and Rubi, but divergent classes as well. None of which mattered in the moment, he knew. But with the realization of his deepening feelings for her...might end up mattering in the long-term. Something that obviously mattered significantly to Rubi. He had the uncomfortable sensation of walls closing in on him. Of being trapped by someone else\u2019s expectations. Of taking a direction he didn\u2019t want because someone he loved wanted him to take that path.</p><p>Wes trudged back to the present, feeling strangely distant, a dull fire burning in the pit of his stomach, one that created an ache instead of a burn.</p><p>They drove back to Malibu, a fifty-minute trip, without speaking. Without music. Both lost in their own thoughts. Still, Wes couldn\u2019t say it had been an uncomfortable ride. Just...quiet. Settling. And by the time Rubi pulled into Jax\u2019s driveway, he ached from the stress. His heart felt bruised. His chest empty. And all he wanted to do was refuel by sliding into bed with Rubi. By falling asleep, his body tangled with hers.</p><p>She pulled into the garage, tapped the door closed, and turned off the engine. \u201cWe\u2019ll have Lexi look at your hand. If you don\u2019t need the ER, I\u2019ll take Rodie home.\u201d</p><p>He was halfway out of the car when he froze. \u201cI told you Rodie could stay here.\u201d Which was when he realized her meaning, and a fresh surge of disquiet slid in. \u201cYou said you\u2019d stay with me.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a truly mystified expression. \u201cWhy would you want me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a stupid question.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a glare. \u201cThat\u2019s an inappropriate answer, but considering the night, I\u2019m giving you a pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have... I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Just drop it.\u201d</p><p>Fuck-ing A. He just kept screwing up.</p><p>The door between the house and the garage opened. Lexi stood there in jeans and a black tank, her long blonde hair in some kind of messy knot on the back of her head. She took one look at Wes, her gaze sliding toward his hand as if she had injury radar. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding? Again?\u201d She stepped back to let Rubi pass, then Wes. \u201cI hope that was at least for Dolph\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo such luck,\u201d he muttered on his way to the kitchen.</p><p>Rodie broke away from Rubi, where she was hugging him in the living area, and ran to Wes, jumping on his hind legs in excitement. Wes lifted his bad hand out of the way and petted Rodie with the other. \u201cHey, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLex,\u201d Rubi said, \u201cCan you check his hand, see if he needs to go to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>Jax strolled in and pressed his forearms to the kitchen granite. He frowned at Wes\u2019s hand. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look too bad. Can you still drive that stunt tomorrow before your plane leaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rubi said.</p><p>At the same time Wes returned, \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>And they scowled at each other.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a ride to the airport?\u201d Jax asked.</p><p>Wes glanced at Rubi. She\u2019d said she would take him, but now...</p><p>\u201cContestants to your corners,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cWes, this way.\u201d</p><p>Wes moved down the length of the expansive granite counter and rich cherry cabinets. Lexi pulled a cardboard box from an upper cabinet and rummaged through the medical contents on the counter. \u201cRinse your hand off. What did you hit?\u201d</p><p>He lifted the handle on the tap, waited until the water was warm, and gritted his teeth before he stuck his hand under the stream. \u201cA mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time, save that for the stunts,\u201d Jax said, \u201cwhere mirrors aren\u2019t mirrors.\u201d</p><p>Once the blood cleared from his skin, he found at least two deep cuts along his knuckles. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Lexi came up beside him. Inspected his hand. \u201cUp to you. I\u2019ve got skin glue and Steri strips. I can patch you up in ten minutes, or you can go spend four hours in the ER.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlue and tape, please.\u201d</p><p>Rubi pushed to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to head home, then.\u201d</p><p>Wes covered Lexi\u2019s hands. \u201cJust leave this junk out. I\u2019ll do it when I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to walk me home,\u201d Rubi said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue.\u201d Wes dried his hand on a paper towel, leaving blood splotches on the crisp white surface. \u201cMy mother would bean me if I didn\u2019t walk my girl home.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to bitch about the \u201cmy girl\u201d slip, but she just rolled her eyes and started for the door leading to the upper deck and the stairs to the beach. Wes caught up with her as soon as she touched the patio and rested a hand on her shoulder. He pulled her into him and wrapped her close. Sighing, he lowered his mouth to her neck and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cIn my world,\u201d he said, his voice low and soft, \u201can argument doesn\u2019t end anything. An argument is just that, an argument. We\u2019ve had them before. We\u2019ll have them again.\u201d She didn\u2019t respond, but she didn\u2019t pull away either. \u201cStay, Rubi. Let me hold you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d Her head relaxed against his shoulder, and her body softened. \u201cI don\u2019t understand me with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive it time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you understand us?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, tightened his hold, and absorbed the feel of her against him. Yes, his body understood. Yes, his heart understood. But his mind...and all that had happened tonight\u2014seeing the interaction between her and a father she\u2019d grown up hating, hearing her beliefs about money, about how Wes should view money\u2014he ended up offering, \u201cI understand this.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out of his grasp on a sigh of disappointment and started toward the beach. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I need time to work it all out.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the sound of that. That sounded a lot like the old We need some time apart.</p> <p>\u201cI think we need time to work it out together.\u201d They walked down to the wet sand, and Wes tossed the Frisbee ahead of them for Rodie. More than ever, he wanted her to see how a real family worked. How people could argue and still love each other. How people who loved each other acted. And he asked again, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to Missouri with me?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the sound a mixture of what-the-fuck and no-way-in-hell. \u201cNot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you. I\u2019m behind on my NSA deadline. And I have Rodie. And now I have to find another goddamned place to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRodie can come with us. My family loves animals. And you\u2019re not going to get any peace with buyers coming in and out of your house at all hours. It would be good for you to get away from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting I stuff Rodie in the cargo hold? Not going to happen. And I need to work, Wes. I can\u2019t write programming code without quiet.\u201d</p> <p>He fell into step with her as she started walking again. \u201cExactly. Your house is on the market. You won\u2019t have any peace. At least with me you could have a cozy room in some bed-and-breakfast. Then you\u2019ll be there when I need updates to the rig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make them from here. On my server. All you have to do is make sure the rig is within range of any Wi-Fi, and it will sync up and update.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cWhen did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI programmed it that way.\u201d</p><p>Her intelligence boggled him. \u201cYou should be the one looking to sell this thing. All I created was the frame. You\u2019re giving it all the brains. Don\u2019t you want to see how your programming makes a difference firsthand? Don\u2019t you want control over the fine points of how we use it?\u201d</p><p>They were at the steps to her house now. Rodie ran back to Wes and sat at his feet, the Frisbee in his mouth.</p><p>Rubi turned to Wes, the night lit by moonlight and the distant glow from her porch. \u201cNo, Wes. Thank you for asking, but no. And let me make this very clear\u2014that rig is 100 percent yours. I don\u2019t own any part of it. I don\u2019t want to own any part of it. What you do with it is your choice. I did you a favor, just like I\u2019ve done favors for Lexi and Jax and a couple of dozen other people. It\u2019s good karma. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, whatever.\u201d</p> <p>She squeezed his forearm. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby...\u201d He took her arm and stepped close again, discomfort ratcheting up in his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave like this. I don\u2019t want to be a four-hour flight away with us at odds.\u201d</p><p>She searched his eyes, all those beautiful features softer in the moonlight. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy? Worried I might end up at Stilettos?\u201d</p><p>There was a challenging edge in her voice. One he recognized as the old Rubi. One he realized she hadn\u2019t used with him for over a week.</p><p>Until that moment, no, he hadn\u2019t considered Stilettos. Now it terrified him. \u201cRubi\u2014\u201d</p><p>She jogged toward her slider. Rodie glanced between them, his ears pulled back in distress.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Wes said to the dog.</p><p>Rodie followed Rubi and stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up for your flight at the set,\u201d Rubi said. \u201cTen o\u2019clock.\u201d And she shut the door.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Rubi pulled into the designated parking area just as she had early that week\u2014only so much had changed between then and now. Rubi had hoped for things she\u2019d never believed she would. Her relationship with Wes had undergone a transformation she\u2019d never believed possible. She\u2019d finally cut the dysfunctional cord with her father. And her dream of buying the house she loved had been shot into the fiery pits of hell.</p><p>She shut down the car and picked up the note she\u2019d found on her car that morning in Wes\u2019s neat, all-cap, architect-type scrawl.</p><p>I MISS YOU ALREADY.</p><p>To say she was a little off-balance would be an understatement. Her inner landscape had turned into the aftermath of a hurricane.</p><p>She tucked the note into the ashtray with all the others and stood from the car, watching Wes half a mile away. He wore the neoprene, shucked off his shoulders and hanging at his hips again. A big part of her was deeply disappointed she\u2019d refused to sleep with him last night. He might have believed they\u2019d really sleep, but if she\u2019d been in proximity to that body, sleeping would have been the last thing on her mind. And they were already treading tumultuous waters without adding more sex into the picture.</p><p>He was pacing between two muscle cars and one Ducati, arms crossed over his broad, tanned chest. His head was down as Jax talked to Wes, Keaton, and Troy.</p><p>Rubi climbed the stairs of the trailer, entered, and found Rachel at her desk. She had that gorgeous hair of hers up in a tight bun again, her tortoiseshell glasses perched on her tiny nose. \u201cHey, Rubi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you didn\u2019t take my advice about the hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I leave it down, it\u2019s always in the way.\u201d She pulled off her glasses and rubbed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Maybe you can diffuse the mood around this place. These guys can get so intense. And when they\u2019re stressed, I\u2019m stressed.\u201d</p><p>Rubi wandered to a window and opened the blinds so she could look out on the scene. \u201cSpeaking of intense, what\u2019s going on out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly sure, but something that pissed Wes off-not exactly easy to do. Something about explosives and blowing up a bridge and... Hell, I never know what these guys are going to do from one day to the next. I\u2019ve got to make this phone call before they come back in.\u201d</p><p>While Rubi watched the men pacing and gesturing as they spoke, Rachel put the phone on speaker and punched in a number. Rubi turned away from the window just as someone picked up on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The abrupt, challenging male voice made Rachel\u2019s gaze dart to Rubi\u2019s, her lips parted in alarmed surprise. A moment of silence hung before Rachel said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for a Mr. Ryker-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do mister anything. Just Ryker.\u201d</p><p>His voice was deep, rough and...it had a vaguely, but intensely, sensual glide. Rubi lifted her brows at Rachel, who shrugged back at Rubi.</p><p>\u201cAll right just Ryker,\u201d Rachel said in that sassy tone that made Rubi grin, \u201cI\u2019m calling from Renegades Stunt Company in Los Angeles-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want whatever you\u2019re selling.\u201d</p><p>Rachel dropped her hands to her desk with an audible slap and glared at the phone. \u201cAre you always this rude or did I just catch you on a bad day?\u201d</p><p>Rubi curved her lips inward, holding back laughter.</p><p>A moment of tense silence followed when Rubi would have sworn the two were having a stare-down if they hadn\u2019t been speaking over a phone line.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ryker finally said. \u201cI like spunk. You\u2019ve got two minutes.\u201d</p><p>Rachel gave Rubi a the-fuck-with-this look and flipped off the phone. A snort of laughter escaped Rubi.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Rachel said, \u201cI was calling to make you an offer, but you\u2019ve kinda dinged my mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffer?\u201d His tone turned lighter, more interested. \u201cI hope it\u2019s an offer of phone sex. You\u2019ve got a hot voice, and I could use some decent incentive to give myself another hand job. God, those get so old.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s mouth dropped open, her expression part outrage, part humor, part shock. \u201cWhat in the-?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoke. Thought you might have a sense of humor, but I guess not. Though your voice is hot. What did you say your name was? Rachel? That\u2019s way too cute for the hot voice. What are you wearing, Rachel with the hot voice?\u201d</p><p>She dropped her forehead into her hand. \u201cI should have expected this from a friend of Troy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, Rubi stepped up to the desk and pulled that damn clip from Rachel\u2019s hair. When the other woman gasped and looked up, Rubi pointed to the phone, then fanned her chest with a luscious eye roll.</p><p>Rachel lifted her mouth in a half-grin.</p><p>\u201cTroy\u2019s been talking shit about me again?\u201d Ryker asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s that fucker up to now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got his mouth too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d His voice lowered with suggestion. \u201cBaby, my mouth is way better than Troy\u2019s, all the women say so.\u201d</p><p>Rubi clasped her hand over her mouth and bent at the waist in an effort to hold back her laughter.</p><p>But Rachel didn\u2019t even try. Her laugh was low and suggestive. \u201cReally. Now you\u2019ve got my full attention. Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t called to give you a free round of phone sex. I\u2019ve called because Renegades is looking for an explosives expert and Troy gave me your name and number.\u201d</p><p>Hesitation fell over the line. Then, \u201cHow...disappointing.\u201d Another hesitation. \u201cIf I said I\u2019d consider blowing something up for Troy, could we renegotiate the phone sex? Cause, really, your voice already has my jeans a little tight.\u201d</p><p>Rachel shook her head, looking at the phone as if it had turned fluorescent orange. With a sigh, she dropped her chin into her hand and met Rubi\u2019s gaze with a silly what-the-hell grin.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she said, her voice low and husky and purely sexual, \u201cyou\u2019re wearing nothing else but those sexy, tight jeans, Just Ryker.\u201d</p><p>Rubi barely held the laughter back. God, she loved this chick.</p><p>Ryker\u2019s laugh matched Rachel\u2019s voice. \u201cNow we\u2019re talking.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Movement out the window caught Rubi\u2019s eye. She made small circles with her hand, a wrap-it-up motion, and pointed to the window to signal the guys were coming.</p><p>\u201cThis has been fun,\u201d Rachel said, her voice suddenly professional and curt again, \u201cbut I\u2019ll have to call you back with details.\u201d</p><p>And she disconnected the call. \u201cOh, my God. If he\u2019s only half as hot as his voice, he\u2019s a fifteen on a scale of one to ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight need to refocus,\u201d Rubi said, her humor gone. \u201cThey\u2019re all coming in. And none of them looks any happier than Wes.\u201d</p> <p>She groaned and glanced at her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s too early for lunch, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She propped her elbows on the desk and ran her hands through her hair, holding it back. \u201cI need an office. Really, I do. Just a small one...\u201d</p><p>The guys filed in, all looking like someone stole their favorite Penthouse edition. She crossed her arms and leaned against the extra desk.</p><p>Jax entered first, but Wes\u2019s voice was the one Rubi heard. \u201cThat\u2019s only going to mess up the schedule more. Whether you go through the city to find a bridge they\u2019ll allow you to destroy or you build a replica, that will take weeks. Maybe months.\u201d He came through the door, still with his head down. \u201cHave I mentioned how much I hate Bolton lately?\u201d</p><p>Keaton entered behind him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t stopped talking about how much you hate Bolton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I, for one, am sick of it,\u201d Troy said, coming in last but spotting Rubi first. \u201cTell your boyfriend to shut his trap, will you?\u201d</p> <p>Wes\u2019s head swung toward Troy, a what-the-fuck look on his face. Then he followed Troy\u2019s gaze, and his eyes paused on Rubi. His entire face lit up, and a smile spread his mouth. That one look pulled the lining from Rubi\u2019s stomach and turned it inside out. Then quick flashes of thought lit off behind his eyes, each taking his grin down a notch with guilt or unease or disappointment.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said and glanced at his wrist but found no watch. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a few minutes,\u201d she said.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s own happiness ticked down in tandem with Wes\u2019s. She hadn\u2019t slept at all. She\u2019d spent the night rolling around everything he\u2019d said and done the night before. Then tossing around her own issues, searching for ways to overcome them. Had tried to rationalize going to Missouri with him until she\u2019d been pacing the living room. But doing the whole family meet-and-greet after just experiencing so much turmoil with her own \u201cfamily\u201d was as black an idea as being without him.</p><p>Still... She wanted him. She cared about him. And, yes, Lexi had been right when she\u2019d suspected Rubi had already been half in love with him when this had all started.</p><p>Which was just...way too much for her to handle.</p> <p>\u201cLet me worry about finding the bridge,\u201d Jax said.</p><p>\u201cI have a lead on one.\u201d Rachel leaned back in her chair. \u201cAnd I have a call in to the City. But we still have the explosives-expert problem. I\u2019ve called all seven firms specializing in controlled explosive work between here and San Diego, and they\u2019re all booked on jobs through February. And,\u201d she added with a wince, \u201cnone of them are cheap.\u201d She darted a look at Rubi, then to Troy. \u201cI was just going to try your friend, Ryker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking for an explosives expert?\u201d Rubi asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to change.\u201d Wes passed her, sliding a hand down her back. He kissed her temple with a whispered, \u201cI was lonely last night.\u201d Then disappeared into the bathroom.</p><p>Rubi was still tingling, still enjoying Wes\u2019s musky, spicy scent when Jax said, \u201cBolton\u2019s going to be out a month. Maybe six weeks. He\u2019s got drug problems on top of alcohol problems. We\u2019ve got a look-alike lined up for a lot of the filming, but no one can deliver his lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d Rubi said, her mind playing with the financial bottom line.</p><p>\u201cIf we blow up an old bridge-for real-instead of using CGI,\u201d he said, referring to the computer graphic interface used to render many Hollywood special effects, \u201cwe could recoup the loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Jax said. \u201cCGI is freaking expensive. You damn computer geeks rape us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet what you pay for,\u201d Rubi teased.</p><p>\u201cThen that crash app should be worth shit, since it was free,\u201d Jax said, \u201cand it\u2019s amazing. We tried it out this morning. Really good stuff.\u201d</p><p>A thrill of accomplishment sizzled through her chest. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s awesome?\u201d Wes\u2019s voice drew her gaze toward the bathroom. He emerged, hair damp, dressed in jeans, a long-sleeved Billabong tee the color of his eyes, and smelling like something out of the men\u2019s cologne department.</p><p>Sexy bastard.</p><p>\u201cRubi\u2019s crash app,\u201d Keaton said, shooting a handsome grin toward her. \u201cHer new ride\u2019s not bad either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Wes said. \u201cThey\u2019re both proving helpful this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet Rachel talk to my buddy, Ryker,\u201d Troy said to Jax. \u201cHe\u2019s home on leave from Afghanistan. A bomb expert. Blows up all kinds of shit for the army.\u201d</p><p>Rachel met Rubi\u2019s gaze and lifted her brows in interest.</p><p>Jax frowned. \u201cHe has to be licensed and bonded and-\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been doing this shit for a decade, and he hasn\u2019t blown himself up,\u201d Troy said. \u201cProbably a good sign. If he can\u2019t do it, he can probably point us in the right direction. Rachel can make initial contact, then pass him off to you if he\u2019s interested and available.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s interest dimmed and she rolled her eyes. \u201cAdding another guy to this team? Just what we need, more testosterone. And this time, explosive testosterone.\u201d As laughter passed through the space, she lifted a pleading look toward Jax. \u201cJust a really small room...with a door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rach.\u201d Troy sauntered over to her desk, sat on the edge, and leaned toward her, those sexy dark eyes teasingly flirtatious. \u201cYou know you love every last one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, \u201cbut none of you ever let me get anything done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy,\u201d Wes said. \u201cLay off. She\u2019s doing all the shit I used to have to do. If you scare her off while I\u2019m gone, you\u2019ll be doing risk assessment, supply inventory, and ordering.\u201d</p><p>Troy winced and eased away from Rachel. \u201cOooo, ouch.\u201d</p><p>Wes hefted a duffle over his shoulder and knocked fists with Jax, Troy, and Keaton, then lifted a hand to Rachel. \u201cCall me if they misbehave.\u201d To the men, he offered, \u201cNo major injuries.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand across Rubi\u2019s shoulders and pulled her close, leading her out the door.</p><p>\u201cRubi,\u201d Troy called, \u201cif you get lonely while he\u2019s gone-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you like those perfect teeth, dude,\u201d Wes cut him off.</p><p>\u201cI need a few crowns anyway,\u201d Keaton said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my number, Rubi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t play with sex-toy shit when you\u2019re dead,\u201d Wes said without looking back.</p><p>Rubi smiled down at the asphalt as they walked. Tried to absorb the feel of him next to her, as if they belonged together. Tried to settle her nerves when she wondered if they did belong together.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d she asked, glancing at the bandages around the hand carrying his duffle.</p><p>\u201cSore.\u201d The top was down on her Aston, and Wes tossed his duffle in the back as Rubi rounded the hood. He leaned both hands on the doorframe. \u201cBaby?\u201d</p><p>She paused before getting into the car and met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI was so out of line last night...\u201d He lowered his head and shook it, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to hold her gaze anymore. \u201cI just... Your father... And I so don\u2019t want to go home without you...\u201d He glanced up with a look so sheepishly hopeful, it almost knocked her over. \u201cWe could leave the Aston here for Jax to take home. Drive my truck to the airport and put it in long-term parking. I\u2019ll buy your ticket-\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d If he only knew how close she was to tipping, he\u2019d never give up.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d He shook his head and slid into the passenger\u2019s seat. \u201cStupid idea.\u201d</p><p>It was a stupid idea. Rubi continued to remind herself of that as she dropped behind the wheel and steered onto the 405.</p><p>\u201cLast week,\u201d he started, his hair ruffling in the wind, mirrored sunglasses hiding his beautiful eyes, \u201cI was dying to get a break from these long days. Give my body some time to heal and refuel. Now, I\u2019d rather spend sixteen hours in hand-to-hand, let a semi run over me, and have Troy push me off a Huey than be without you for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Rubi drew a breath, her throat suddenly tight. He rolled his head toward her. And grinned that Hollywood grin. \u201cDid you go soft? Even for a second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ass.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but the sound was far from his usual buoyancy. He propped his elbow on the armrest and rubbed his fingers over his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re going to hate this...but...\u201d He hesitated as if trying to decide how or what to say. \u201cI...need to know where we stand, Rubi.\u201d With his forehead propped on two fingers, he tilted his gaze toward her. She couldn\u2019t see his eyes through the mirrored lenses, but his mouth was tight, and she could easily imagine his serious dark gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t want to walk around for two weeks-or more-not knowing. It will eat at me.\u201d</p><p>Rubi licked her lips. Anxiety bubbled up in her belly and imaginary walls pressed in on her. \u201cI...don\u2019t know how to answer that. Do we really need a label? After only a week?\u201d</p><p>He waited, as if hoping more would come. When it didn\u2019t, he turned his gaze back to his lap. \u201cFuck,\u201d he murmured, barely audible in the wind from the open top. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d</p><p>Panic streaked beneath her breastbone. Her mind filled with the jumbled thoughts from the night before-all her desires, all her fears. She took the off-ramp to LAX as if on autopilot and continued toward the departing flights.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she asked hesitantly. She was pretty sure she didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>He looked out the windshield with a shake of his head. \u201cI just... You were right last night when you said I don\u2019t look ahead. I didn\u2019t think it through when I started this with you. I just...wanted you. Had been wanting you for months. In a way, I\u2019d been wanting you even longer and didn\u2019t realize it until I found you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI just thought...you know, it would all work out.\u201d</p><p>Had wanted her longer? She swung to the curb in front of the United terminal and put the car in park, confused.</p><p>\u201cCan you at least tell me where we stand before I get on a plane?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her stomach knotted. \u201cReally, Wes, do we have to do this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been on a fucking roller coaster for the last week.\u201d Frustration played in his voice. \u201cIt would be nice to know whether or not I\u2019m going to come home to the up, the down, or the end of the ride.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask me what you really want to know?\u201d Her stomach burned, even while knowing he had every right to ask. To know. To suspect. \u201cWill I fuck someone else when you\u2019re not around, right?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. Nostrils flared. \u201cYou know right now whether you will or won\u2019t. It\u2019s already in your heart, Rubi. Is it really unreasonable for me to ask which it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>And she did know in her heart. But the fact that he needed to ask made the question too complicated to answer-especially in the airport drop-off line.</p> <p>A traffic guard strolled by. \u201cKeep it moving, people.\u201d</p><p>Wes nodded affirmation toward the man, but when he turned back to her, a desperate, disillusioned look lay heavy in his eyes. He leaned over and pressed a soft kiss to her lips, lingering as if delaying the inevitable. She met the kiss, wrapping her hand around his head. And found herself hoping, praying, this wouldn\u2019t be their last.</p><p>When he finally broke the kiss, he closed his eyes and rested his forehead against hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crazy about you.\u201d He murmured the words so softly she was sure she\u2019d imagined them, as if the feelings between them had lifted into the air. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else.\u201d Wes\u2019s long, blond lashes trembled as he squeezed his eyes shut, a painful expression tight across his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby. It\u2019s just who I am. I love everything you hide and everything you don\u2019t. I just...love you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned away, gaze averted. But she saw the wetness clinging to his lashes. And her heart lunged to her throat.</p> <p>\u201cWes-\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what you need to do, Rubi,\u201d he said, his voice rough. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth-to say what, she couldn\u2019t fathom. But she didn\u2019t get a chance. He gave her one more hard kiss and exited the car, disappearing into the airport chaos before her head had even stopped spinning.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Wes blinked his eyes open to the bing, bing, bing of the plane\u2019s intercom.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen.\u201d The pilot\u2019s smooth, calm voice filled the cabin. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning our descent into St. Louis. Right now we\u2019ve got partly cloudy skies and a temperature of fifty-seven degrees, humidity at sixty-four percent. Relax, and we\u2019ll have you on the ground in about fifteen minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Wes pushed himself up from the slouch he\u2019d fallen into while dozing and rubbed his face. He winced when he tried to straighten the fingers of his right hand, and again when he touched a sensitive spot on his injured eye. But it couldn\u2019t compete with the discomfort burning in his gut.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t meant to tell Rubi he loved her. Hadn\u2019t even really known it was coming until it was so high in his throat he couldn\u2019t keep it from falling out. And he still felt weird about it. Not wrong, just...weird. He\u2019d only said it to one other woman in his life, so it wasn\u2019t like he went around professing his undying love. But by the panic shining in her eyes when he\u2019d walked away, he knew it had been an ill-timed epiphany. Though he couldn\u2019t imagine a time a declaration like that wouldn\u2019t have been ill-timed for Rubi.</p><p>Rubi. Out of all the women he could have fallen in love with, he\u2019d gone and fallen for Rubi Russo? Seriously?</p><p>He glanced out the window, staring blankly at the thick treetops outlining farming fields. The muddy Missouri River snaking through the green terrain. A sliver of ease crept in. This was home. It would always be home, even if the career he loved took him elsewhere.</p><p>He glanced at his watch, his first thought of Rubi and what she might be doing now.</p><p>Which was moot. Whatever chance he\u2019d had of making something work with her, he\u2019d killed by spilling the L-word.</p><p>Fortunately, landing and exiting the plane diverted his attention from yet another fuckup. He walked up the gate ramp, phone in hand, scrolling through messages searching for something from Whitney to tell him where she was picking him up. But his gaze paused on a text from Rubi.</p><p>RUBI: I can\u2019t believe you sprang that on me and then walked away. What the fuck is wrong with you?</p> <p>He shook his head. He wasn\u2019t sure what the fuck was wrong with him, but he suspected being crazy in love with her while knowing emotion scared the crap out of her might have something to do with it. He would have texted that to her, but he was pretty sure it might make her board a plane to Australia, never to return.</p><p>He walked through the terminal and passed the security lines for passengers boarding a flight.</p><p>\u201cUncle Wes! Uncle Wes!\u201d</p><p>The joint scream sounded off to the side in a restaurant seating area. His nieces\u2019 squeals swept over him like a cool breeze. A smile split his face, and his spirits soared. They were jumping on their toes, their little blonde heads bobbing, their excited, open faces exposing missing teeth. His sister, Whitney, her wheat-colored braid pulled forward over her shoulder, stood behind them.</p><p>His whole world righted. And for a moment, the pain faded.</p><p>\u201cHey there.\u201d Wes broke from the stream of pedestrians and dropped to his knees in front of the girls. He didn\u2019t get his duffle off his shoulder before they jumped on him, Abby clinging to his neck, Emma attached to one arm. He wrapped them both close\u2014Christ they were so tiny\u2014and pressed kisses to their blonde heads. \u201cLook at you two. You\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back and looked down at Abby. Her crystal blue eyes sparkled up at him with so much innocent joy it squeezed his heart. \u201cWhere\u2019d all your teeth go? How do you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost \u2019em. Look.\u201d She opened her mouth, sticking a little finger in to point out every gap.</p><p>\u201cMan, you must be rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at Emma, always more reserved. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got a couple coming in.\u201d</p><p>She grinned without meeting his gaze\u2014eye contact was difficult for her\u2014showing her beautiful new teeth.</p><p>He soaked in the sight of them, and his heart loosened. His troubles dimmed. He ran a hand over each of their feather-soft heads again, pulled them close to kiss their foreheads one more time, and stood.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He stepped in to hug Whitney tight. \u201cThanks for bringing them. I needed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey needed it too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll take your bag. You take them. They need some surrogate-daddy time.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s mind shifted to Wyatt, and his joy dimmed. He let Whitney take the duffle from his shoulder and pointed at Emma. \u201cShoulders to baggage claim.\u201d He pivoted his finger toward Abby. \u201cShoulders to the car.\u201d</p><p>Wes swept Emma up and onto his shoulders. Abby reached toward him, and Wes tugged her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhit,\u201d Wes said, \u201cgrab my phone from my pocket and get a picture of us, would you?\u201d</p><p>She lowered one brow at him but did as he asked. \u201cWhen did you become a shutterbug?\u201d</p><p>Wes was saved from answering by the high-pitched stereo, \u201cCheeeeeeeeese\u201d streaking from the girls as soon as they saw the phone pointed at them. Whit slid it back into Wes\u2019s pocket, and they started toward the exit.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring us presents?\u201d Abby asked, her light eyes so round and bright.</p><p>\u201cWould I ever come without bringing you presents?\u201d</p><p>Whitney slid her arm into the crook of his and squeezed. \u201cSo good to see you.\u201d</p><p>Wes leaned toward her and kissed her head. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>She stepped away, readjusted his duffle on her shoulder. \u201cHow was your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t beat first class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you raking in the big bucks, or did Jax buy it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that guy.\u201d Whitney\u2019s grin was light and easy. \u201cMom\u2019s going to love the black eye. Do you have a suitable story made up, or do you need my help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always did come up with the best stories.\u201d He sent her a conspiratorial grin. \u201cYou tell her yours first. If it doesn\u2019t fly, I\u2019ll try mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are things at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowded. Crazy. The usual,\u201d she said. \u201cI forget how many relatives we have until they besiege us. They exhaust me. I don\u2019t know how Mom does it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a new puppy, Uncle Wes,\u201d Emma said from above him, her little hands curved around his face to hold on.</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d He cut a glance at Whitney, who rolled her eyes. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to see Daddy now,\u201d Abby added.</p><p>They stepped onto the escalator toward baggage claim and parking, and Wes turned to Whitney. \u201cWe are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if Uncle Wes isn\u2019t too tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever too tired to see Wyatt.\u201d When the girls\u2019 cheers faded, he asked Whitney, \u201cIs Grams moving in with Mom and Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s deteriorating. Don\u2019t be surprised if she introduces herself to you. She is completely, physically capable. A real help to Mom most days. She does laundry, cooks, even pitches in at harvest, but her mind is really slipping. We can\u2019t leave her alone anymore. Mom hired a home care nurse who comes when she needs extra help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Wyatt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaggage claim!\u201d Abby yelled. \u201cBaggage claim!\u201d</p><p>They stepped off the escalator, and Wes traded the girls\u2019 positions.</p><p>\u201cWyatt\u2019s about the same,\u201d Whit said as they headed toward the garage. As soon as they walked through the doors, a familiar, soothing humidity hit Wes. The air felt heavier, smelled richer. And told him he was home. \u201cA bit of a plateau he\u2019s frustrated with. What do you think about the rig?\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s mind took a sharp turn and slammed into Rubi. His heart clenched.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really something.\u201d He followed Whit to her Tahoe, pulled open the rear passenger door, and eased Emma to the seat first, then whipped Abby from his shoulders and tossed her in the air just to hear her giggle before sliding her in beside her sister and buckling her seat belt. When he was in the passenger seat, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no telling, but Melissa is optimistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Whitney drew out the word as she backed out and steered toward the exit with a discreet but suspicious glance his way. \u201cI\u2019ve heard. What\u2019s happening there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Wes held up a stop hand just to reinforce. \u201cWe\u2019ve e-mailed a few times about the rig. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>When Whit went suspiciously quiet, he pushed out a frustrated breath. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She lifted a shoulder. \u201cShe asks about you every time she sees me. Specifically whether or not you\u2019re seeing anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014? She\u2019s engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Old, old, old emotions gnawed at Wes\u2019s gut. Anger, loss, disillusionment. Feelings that felt centuries old...but still had bite. \u201cWhat happened there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t really know. I\u2019ve only heard through the rumor mill and confirmed when the ring was gone from her finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me because...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeads-up, that\u2019s all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He scraped his fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m not going there again. I\u2019m not even interested in going there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, relax,\u201d Whit said. \u201cI get it. So what\u2019s going on with little Miss Neglected?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a disapproving glare.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s who the picture\u2019s for, right?\u201d Whit\u2019s reminder had Wes drawing his phone from his pocket and shooting the image to Rubi. \u201cTell me about her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s the opposite of Melissa. Complete opposite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fucking finally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuntie Whit,\u201d Abby reprimanded, making Wes laugh.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, glancing in the rearview mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s Uncle Wes\u2019s fault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPffft.\u201d Wes said.</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019ve spent way too long trying to put that ghost behind you.\u201d</p><p>His stomach took an uncomfortable tilt. \u201cSpeak English, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you two broke up, you spent years dating women just like her. Women close to their families. Sweet, people-pleasing women. Pretty women who stayed well within societal standards. It\u2019s about time you figured out those women don\u2019t fill your less-than-conventional spirit. Don\u2019t challenge you. Don\u2019t thrill you. And as a result, don\u2019t keep you interested.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s insides seemed to shift, then fall into place, though he couldn\u2019t say it was a comfortable place. \u201cA few days ago, you told me to walk away from Rubi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubi? That\u2019s her name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that because from what you\u2019ve told me, I\u2019m making an educated guess that Rubi has deep emotional issues that could damage your chances at long-term happiness. But like I said, every case is as individual as the person. It would help if I could meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked her to come, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe idea of family freaks her out,\u201d Whitney said, her voice confident.</p><p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p><p>She slid a glance his way. \u201cThe fact that she refused to come meet your family is important. In a solid, balanced relationship\u2014even early on\u2014a significant other doesn\u2019t usually refuse that kind of invitation without a legitimate reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a legitimate reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDysfunction does not count as legitimate,\u201d Whit said.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s working against a short work deadline, she has a dog she can\u2019t just walk away from, and her father is selling her house out from under her, so she has to find another place to live. So, I guess she has a few legitimate reasons besides the fact that she doesn\u2019t do family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf those legitimate reasons were gone, do you think she\u2019d have come?\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s stomach dropped. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>On the freeway, Wes drank in the utterly green, lush landscape of the St. Louis suburbs, its distant rolling hills, quiet three-lane freeways void of suicidal drivers. He already felt his blood pressure dipping. Wes fought to mesh his happiness at being home with his disappointment with Rubi\u2019s reluctance to come.</p><p>His phone buzzed, and he looked down.</p><p>RUBI: Cute. They look like you. And you look happy.</p><p>WES: I\u2019d be happier if you weren\u2019t still mad at me.</p><p>RUBI: Me too.</p><p>WES: What are you doing?</p><p>RUBI: I\u2019m the early bird at Stilettos. What do you think I\u2019m doing? I have a deadline...unlike some other people.</p><p>A wry smile twisted his mouth. She had every right to be angry. \u201cI love you\u201d carried responsibility\u2014even if the receiving party didn\u2019t reciprocate. He knew that firsthand. He hadn\u2019t been able to return the sentiment to anyone since Melissa. But he\u2019d felt the weight of responsibility toward every woman who\u2019d offered those words to him.</p><p>WES: You\u2019re pissy.</p><p>RUBI: Someone emotionally ambushed me earlier. Call me crazy, but I don\u2019t like it.</p><p>WES: You\u2019re right, I did. I shouldn\u2019t have. I didn\u2019t plan it, but I couldn\u2019t help it either.</p><p>RUBI: Hardly compensation. Some things, once said, can\u2019t be taken back.</p><p>Heaviness layered his shoulders. She was right. And his impulsiveness could very well turn her cold. Wes knew exactly how those words said too soon could kill what existed between two people.</p><p>WES: The fact that it upsets you should tell you something. If you didn\u2019t care, you would just brush me off.</p><p>RUBI: No Lexi-speak allowed. I\u2019m sick of you both. Leave me alone so I don\u2019t totally fuck up this deadline.</p><p>\u201cAre you writing a damn novel?\u201d Whit asked.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoooo, Uncle Wes,\u201d Emma said from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He pocketed his phone with a sense of failure and loss creeping in.</p><p>\u201cSo what does she do?\u201d Whit asked.</p><p>\u201cComputer programmer. She\u2019s the one who helped me with Wyatt\u2019s rig.\u201d</p><p>Whitney lifted a brow. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s as exciting as a CPA. Hardly any different from Melissa and physical therapy. Or a waitress. Or an art student. Or an insurance broker. Or \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Wes didn\u2019t need her cataloguing every profession of his previous girlfriends. \u201cWhat, exactly, were you expecting? A pole dancer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe an actress, considering your profession. Director. Producer. Musician. Hell, a Harley dealer or a tattoo artist would be more your speed. Someone, I don\u2019t know, different. Outside the box. A rebel, like you.\u201d</p><p>That made Wes laugh. \u201cHardly a rebel\u2014at least not in Hollywood terms. And believe me, Rubi\u2019s plenty different. You know it the second you meet her. And, damn, she\u2019s so freaking smart she blows me away. She made this rig for Wyatt really special. She upgraded my design with relays and a custom program. Made it wireless. Connected it to a server where she can make adjustments on the fly. Really freaking brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe challenges you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn every imaginable way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely novel as far as a girlfriend goes. Is that what\u2019s got you hooked?\u201d</p><p>Wes shook his head and exhaled heavily. The suburbs gave way to farmland, bordered by thick, lush trees. He could feel the LA grime melting away. \u201cThere\u2019s so many things about her that have me hooked, I couldn\u2019t name them all. She\u2019s strong, independent, feisty. She\u2019s ridiculously generous with both time and money. And she\u2019s got a really thick sweet streak she only shows to those closest to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich, I\u2019m guessing, isn\u2019t many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight again. Lots of acquaintances, very few close friends.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work out. I know she wants to jump, but wanting and doing... There\u2019s a big-ass gap in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was her neglect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the product of a quick affair. Her mother died when she was young, just two or three. And she was deposited on her rich father\u2019s doorstep. And I mean filthy rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she grew up with nannies, an absent father, and a ton of cash at her disposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s smart and strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd gorgeous. Did I forget to mention that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured.\u201d She shot him a look. \u201cYou do have standards, after all. So, smart, strong, gorgeous, rich, and unsupervised\u2014in Los Angeles. Talk about a recipe for disaster. Poor thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think of her as a poor thing if you met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefenses. She put them in place early. And, it sounds like, she\u2019s still holding on to them pretty hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, give me the secret passage into her heart, oh great psychotherapist.\u201d</p><p>Whitney chuckled, the sound heavy and resigned. \u201cIf I had that answer, bro, I would have had the money to send a limo to the airport to pick you up.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Rodie inched closer to Rubi on the sofa, his front paws just grazing her thighs beneath the hem of her running shorts, and whined.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay...\u201d She scrolled through the last section of code she\u2019d written looking for that damn bug that had been plaguing her for hours. Sitting back with a disgusted sigh, she whipped her hair into a ponytail with the band around her wrist. \u201cDamn it. I\u2019m so close.\u201d</p><p>So close to being done with this program. Or at least the initial version. But she wanted it off her to-do list and into NSA\u2019s testing phase. She knew there would be tweaking and fixes, but she could at least get a break. Tightening her ponytail high on her head, she thought about Wes, Wyatt, and the rig. Earlier today, Wes had checked in for a small tweak of his own. Ruby also added three more programs with different settings according to the physical therapist\u2019s suggestions, sort of like a treadmill\u2019s preprogramming.</p><p>Wes\u2019s low \u201cAre you still mad at me?\u201d continued to roll through her head, confusing her. Then his \u201cDo you miss me yet?\u201d making her yearn. She missed him far too much to be normal. Or healthy. Or reasonable, given the short span of their intimacy. But the physical was the least of what left this hole at the center of her body.</p><p>The loneliness was sharper now that she had nothing to fill the void. Lexi and Jax were together in every spare moment, Wes was gone, and Rubi couldn\u2019t find any interest in hanging at Stilettos only to get hit on by men she didn\u2019t want. The empty, two-dimensional quality of her life glared.</p><p>Rodie\u2019s head popped up, and a feral growl rolled from his throat. Followed almost immediately by a round of vicious barks so loud Rubi jumped, winced, and covered her ears. Her heart squeezed and thudded so hard her ribs vibrated. Or maybe that was the sensation of Rodie\u2019s bark rippling through her.</p><p>By the time she muttered a curse and uncovered her ears, the front door bell rang. Rodie already stood at the front door, snarling and barking against the sidelight, paws scraping at the window.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s patience split. \u201cGoddammit. Hasn\u2019t anyone ever heard of a telephone?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed Rodie\u2019s collar and flung the door wide. The three people standing outside, two men and a woman, jumped and scrambled back away from the entry. Rubi recognized the Realtor in a crisp suit, the buyers in Friday designer casual.</p><p>\u201cThere is this thing called common courtesy,\u201d she said slowly, deliberately. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ve heard of it. Looks a lot like a phone. You know, one of those things where you punch a few buttons and then talk into it. They\u2019re used for things like...appointments. Sharing information. Leaving messages. Just a helpful piece of advice; next time, you might want to use one. Unless, of course, you\u2019d like his freshly cleaned choppers in your leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I...\u201d the Realtor stammered, his gaze darting between a still-snarling, lunging Rodie and an irate, sick-of-this-shit Rubi. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am. We... I... The listing didn\u2019t mention the need to contact the resident prior to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I guess you missed the three signs I posted on your walk to the door.\u201d</p><p>The man glanced nervously over his shoulder with a bewildered \u201cOh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait five minutes,\u201d Rubi said. \u201cWe\u2019re going for a run. That will give you forty-five minutes inside. If you\u2019re here when we get back, no guarantees.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shut the door in his stunned face and released Rodie. Rubi grabbed his leash, glanced at the clock, and tightened the laces on her running shoes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late meeting Desiree,\u201d she told Rodie as she slipped on her sunglasses. \u201cRodie, come.\u201d</p><p>He trotted away from the front door toward the sliders, and Rubi closed them behind Rodie.</p><p>He whined and pranced beside her as she trudged through the dry sand to the water line. \u201cAll right, go on.\u201d</p><p>She gestured, and Rodie took off, sprinting after a flock of black-tailed plovers. The birds scattered, some into the air, some into the sea, and Rodie lost interest, sniffing along the shore as Rubi found her stride and caught up.</p> <p>She pulled her phone from the neoprene holster around her bicep and called Desiree, who was meeting her at a house three miles up the beach. Rubi got her voice mail and left a message.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be about ten minutes late. Other Realtors don\u2019t seem to think calling ahead to show a house is important, and I got waylaid. On my way now via a run on the beach.\u201dShe shoved the phone back into her armband and shook out her arms, trying to relax. Trying to put the day behind her. At least a dozen unannounced showings of the house. Twelve solid hours of coding the NSA\u2019s clandestine tracking program. A banana, cup of yogurt, and granola later, she needed a break. And some adult human companionship. But Lexi was working late, then taking Jax to dinner with a client. So Rubi was alone. Like she\u2019d been alone the night before.</p><p>Wes\u2019s sudden absence made her realize just how much she\u2019d come to depend on him\u2014for companionship, comfort, camaraderie, and, yes, entertainment. She hadn\u2019t laughed since he\u2019d left. It hadn\u2019t even been a full forty-eight hours since Wes had been gone, and she was lost.</p><p>\u201cI really need some friends,\u201d she told the empty stretch of pristine shoreline alight in sunset colors of yellow and orange. \u201cThe kind I can hang with outside of sex clubs. Maybe I should get a life while I\u2019m at it. And a hobby. And ice cream.\u201d</p><p>She continued down the shoreline, her feet striking the wet sand in a steady pace she knew by feel would pump out an eight-minute mile. She was in the mood for about eighteen eight-minute miles tonight. Or eight Sexy Bitches. Or eight Valium. Because she couldn\u2019t get that terror-inducing, \u201cI just...love you,\u201d out of her damn head.</p> <p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Her body had been in a constant state of flight since then, her adrenaline ebbing and flowing, dragging her up and down like an angry ocean.</p><p>Rubi picked up her pace, deliberately forcing her mind to focus on her body\u2014and only her body\u2014for three miles, until her phone beeped. Slowing her pace, Rubi scanned the cliffs on this stretch of the beach, and the homes beyond as she glanced at her screen. The map program had alerted her to the home for sale, which, according to her phone, lay at the top of those three-hundred rickety wooden stairs traversing the cliff face.</p><p>She breathed quickly, trying to catch her breath as she double-checked her map. The house was listed for a little under eight million, so she hadn\u2019t expected a supreme on-the-sand property, but... \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>Evidently, her map had no sense of humor.</p><p>\u201cRubi,\u201d a voice called from above. She glanced up and spotted her Realtor, Desiree Boyd, waving down at her from a deck on the cliff. \u201cCome on up.\u201d</p> <p>Rubi squinted at the stairs, at Desiree, at Rodie, and back. \u201cThis week just keeps getting better.\u201d</p><p>Out of curiosity, Rubi counted the stairs as she followed Rodie up, holding her arms at his sides to make sure he didn\u2019t veer and fall off. Only a hundred and twenty-six stairs. She was always overestimating\u2014the way she was overestimating this issue with Wes. Surely, she was.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Desiree held up a hand to Rubi, her pretty Asian face holding a smile filled with promise. \u201cI know it\u2019s not on the sand, but...\u201d She opened her arms to the ocean at Rubi\u2019s back. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely got the view.\u201d</p><p>Rubi turned, hands on hips and out of breath from the stairs. Yes, a view of the ocean. An endless, flat expanse of blue. Other than the color, there was nothing interesting. No sand, no people, no waves against the beach.</p><p>Her stomach slid lower. She\u2019d seen two other houses earlier in the day, one way, way, way over her price range at twenty-three million and another priced at nine million. She\u2019d liked those about as much as she liked this. But she didn\u2019t want to be an unappreciative downer, so she said, \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a look inside,\u201d Desiree suggested, already starting that direction.</p><p>Rubi brushed off Rodie\u2019s paws before he walked in, and they strolled around the four-thousand-square-foot home. \u201cThis is straight out of the Brady Bunch era.\u201d</p><p>Desiree\u2019s heels paused in their click across the pitted, dark wooden floors. Ancient wooden floors. \u201cYou\u2019re not old enough to know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither are you,\u201d she said, turning in a slow circle. \u201cI watched a lot of TV reruns when I was a kid. Okay, I\u2019ve seen enough. Call me when you find something different.\u201d</p><p>She trotted down the steps again with Desiree calling, \u201cRubi, there\u2019s not a lot on the market in your price range right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, but this isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d At the bottom of the steps, she paused and glanced up at Desiree. Offering on her father\u2019s house again was on the tip of her tongue, but her hurt, her anger, and her spite kept it in. \u201cThanks, D.\u201d</p><p>Rubi picked up her run toward home. Against her arm, her phone buzzed. She glanced down and found a text from Wes. Rubi ignored it and focused on the waves. On the scenery. On the sunset. On her dog playing in the water.</p><p>She named everything she was grateful for, one of the earliest habits she\u2019d developed for self-soothing. She\u2019d been doing it as far back as her memory stretched. And some days, many more days as a child, her greatest gratitude was for the day\u2019s end.</p><p>\u201cI love the beach. I love working for myself. I love making my own schedule,\u201d she said between breaths as she ran. \u201cI love Rodie. I love Lexi. I love Jax. I love...\u201d Wes. \u201cI love Renegades. I love programming apps. I love this weather. I love...\u201d Wes.</p><p>She did love Wes; that wasn\u2019t new. She\u2019d shared her gratefulness for him in her life since she\u2019d met him nearly two months before. But now\u2014I love Wes as a friend, the same way I love Jax\u2014felt different. It felt like more. And she just didn\u2019t know what to do with that. She\u2019d never loved a man. Hugely believed she wasn\u2019t capable of loving a man.</p><p>And here Wes was, imbedded in her chest. Her mind. He\u2019d somehow slipped in when she hadn\u2019t noticed, and now her feelings for him were growing like a seed planted in fertile earth. A streak of terror heated her belly. But her phone pulled her focus off the discomfort with a reminder chirp for the unread message.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d She slowed to a walk, pulled the phone from its case on her bicep, and tapped the message. \u201cHe pokes at me even when he\u2019s thousands of miles away.\u201d</p><p>WES: Something to feel good about. Meet Wyatt.</p><p>Breathing quickly, stomach tight, she tapped the attachment, and a video played. The setting was a generic hospital room. A man lay in the center of a single bed\u2014strapped into the rig. Rubi immediately recognized the metal strip down the sides of his leg, the black straps around both. Something hitched in Rubi\u2019s chest\u2014surprise, awe, excitement\u2014something unfamiliar but good. Laughter and chatter sounded in the background as if the room was filled with people, though she couldn\u2019t see anyone but the man who had to be Wyatt.</p><p>As the camera changed position and drew closer, she recognized the resemblance between Wyatt and Wes. Wyatt had the same broad build as Wes. Both had a square jaw, slim nose, strong cheekbones. Wyatt\u2019s hair was a medium brown, cut military short. His eyes were darker than Wes\u2019s, but she couldn\u2019t tell what color. He lay on top of the covers, wearing gym shorts and a T-shirt, hair mussed, unshaven.</p><p>\u201cThis is Wyatt.\u201d Wes\u2019s familiar, sexy voice came over the speaker and made Rubi\u2019s heart skip. Made emotion rush her chest. God, she was ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cHey, Miss Rubi,\u201d Wyatt said to the camera with a wave, a grin, and a deep Southern drawl that she hadn\u2019t expected. \u201cWish you were here...\u201d He spoke with the kind of warmth reserved for deep friendship and delivered with as much sincerity as if she were standing in the room, not an absent, anonymous stranger on the other end of a video clip. He added, with a mischievous grin so much like Wes\u2019s, her heart squeezed, \u201cSo I could kick your ass. This is some hard-ass work, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought the Marines were tough,\u201d Wes quipped, making everyone laugh, including Rubi.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d a little voice squeezed in, filled with reprimand. \u201cAss is a bad word.\u201d</p><p>More laughter, with adult female voices in the mix.</p><p>Wes tilted the camera down, and the two girls in the photo he\u2019d sent earlier\u2014towheaded, fair-skinned, and blue-eyed\u2014appeared on screen. \u201cSay hi to Rubi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Rubi.\u201d Their young voices vibrated over the speaker.</p><p>\u201cThese are my nieces,\u201d Wes said. \u201cIntroduce yourselves, girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Abby,\u201d the smaller one said with the enthusiasm of a child who was photographed often.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Emma.\u201d She was older, a little on the shy side, and didn\u2019t look at the camera.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Wes\u2019s voice came over the speaker again. \u201cGet to work, slacker. Let\u2019s show Rubi this rig in action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlave driver,\u201d Wyatt complained.</p><p>They didn\u2019t look so scary. She always associated terrifying, annoying, or pathetic people with the concept of family. But these people were all normal. Like Wes. Like Rubi. Not the \u201cfamily\u201d that had frightened her into rejecting Wes\u2019s invitation.</p><p>\u201cOnly one more lift,\u201d a female voice added. By the way it shifted, Rubi could tell she was moving. \u201cHe\u2019s already done too much today.\u201d She stepped into the picture as she rounded to the far side of Wyatt\u2019s bed. Her blonde hair spiraled down her back, Taylor Swift style. When she turned and reached out to support Wyatt\u2019s leg, Rubi saw there was more than just her hair that resembled the music mogul. This woman had a beautiful, pixie face and light eyes. A nice build too, slim but top-heavy in the breast department. Rubi would have guessed she was Wyatt\u2019s wife, but she was dressed in solid turquoise scrubs. Had to be the physical therapist. \u201cYou\u2019ll be sore tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Rubi glanced up, located Rodie digging in the sand, and returned her gaze to the video.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Whitney,\u201d the blonde said. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>Rubi had no idea who Whitney was but assigned the name to another anonymous female in the room. Silence descended for a moment, then the familiar sound of the rig\u2019s motors filled Rubi\u2019s ears, and anxiety ramped up in her chest.</p><p>Wyatt lay flat, took a breath, and bent his knee, drawing it toward his chest. The move was as simple as they came, but Wyatt\u2019s face scrunched with effort. The hand at his side fisted in the sheets beneath him, and as his knee drew closer to his chest, he growled between his teeth. Then he slowly released his leg, easing it back to the bed at an utterly ridiculously slow pace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He let out a relieved breath when it rested flat again, then grinned at the phone camera. \u201cCouldn\u2019t do that two days ago.\u201d He gave a thumbs-up. \u201cThanks, Rubi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s our show for today,\u201d Wes said, then added a soft, private, \u201cYou\u2019ve made a real difference here, beautiful,\u201d before the video cut out. \u201cThis rig would have been pathetic without your programming. You should be proud.\u201d</p><p>The video ended, leaving her screen with a still image of the first frame, a big circled arrow overlaying the center. The darkening sky seemed to float closer. The wind off the ocean chilled her skin and blew her hair. And emotions swirled in her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made a real difference here.\u201d</p> <p>The words lingered like an echo. And despite her initial urge to douse the pride that was indeed filling her chest, push it off, and give Wes credit\u2014well-deserved credit\u2014the meaning of this stuck. Yes, she made a difference with projects like the one she was struggling over with the NSA by aiding in national security. But it was so diluted, she didn\u2019t feel it. Never saw it. And when someone worked in an isolated setting as she did, motivation and morale drastically improved when she saw the direct correlation of her work\u2014like she did with Renegades. Like she just had with the rig.</p><p>And the light, open, promising sensation filling her chest made her realize some sort of crossroads for her life loomed close.</p><p>Rubi trusted her gut and dialed Lexi\u2019s cell.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lexi answered. \u201cI\u2019m glad you called. I\u2019m going to need to cancel dinner tomorrow tonight. I\u2019ve got a client who can\u2019t come in any other time, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal\u201d Rubi closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll forgive you for canceling dinner if you take me to the airport on your lunch break.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lexi said, surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d planned a trip. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Rubi drew in a deep, slow breath. Held it a second. And jumped. \u201cMissouri.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s fucking idea was this?\u201d</p><p>Rubi had the air-conditioning on, because the thickness of the Missouri air seemed to make breathing more difficult. And everything smelled...damp. She was exhausted. The nights without sleep, the stress, the long work hours\u2014it was all catching up to her. Great timing, seeing as she was on a two-lane country road in the middle of Nowhere, Missouri, alone, with no one to tell her where to go but the mysterious female GPS voice. But that was her own fault\u2014she\u2019d sworn Lexi to secrecy. Rubi wasn\u2019t ready to call Wes and tell him she was here. Wasn\u2019t even ready to admit she was here. Right about halfway through the flight, she\u2019d developed this thick knot of dread in her belly.</p><p>That was also about the time a little voice in her head said, Turn back.</p> <p>What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?</p><p>This isn\u2019t you.</p><p>You don\u2019t belong here.</p><p>More and more trees flew by, lining the grassy roadside. Rubi had never seen so many trees in her life. In all her combined years. Once she\u2019d turned off the main interstate, she\u2019d seen nothing but trees and trees and more trees. Occasionally, a break in the trees revealed a field. Then another. Then back to the trees. And while her headlights hinted toward their changing fall colors, it was too dark to appreciate. There were as many trees here as there were people in Los Angeles. Occasionally, another car would pass in the other direction, but otherwise, no traffic. And the longer she drove, coming up on an hour now, the tighter her stomach pinched and the louder the voice grew.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell am I doing?\u201d she muttered to herself, forehead resting in her hand.</p><p>\u201cIn five hundred feet,\u201d the GPS voice said, scaring Rubi\u2019s heart into her throat, \u201cturn right.\u201d</p><p>A sliver of relief eased her belly. She turned at the next street and continued along the narrow, two-lane road. But she was now moving at a slight upward grade. The GPS took her through another half dozen series of turns and deeper into the trees.</p><p>\u201cYour destination is one hundred feet on your right,\u201d Ms. GPS said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rubi asked, as if she\u2019d get an answer from the machine. There was nothing out here.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve arrived at your destination.\u201d</p><p>Rubi checked her mirrors and stopped on the deserted road. On her right, a gravel road extended through the trees and into nothing. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her head to her hand, feeling so utterly ridiculous, her body temperature rose five degrees. At least no one could see her acting so moronically. If she turned around and headed back to the airport now, she could catch the next flight home, grab a cab to her house, and tell Lexi she\u2019d changed her mind. Decided not to go after all. No one would be the wiser.</p><p>Rubi pulled onto the gravel drive to get off the road and stared down the lonely stretch with swamping disappointment and a wicked streak of failure. Christ, she didn\u2019t even know why she was here anymore. She was so tired. Maybe she\u2019d get a hotel back in St. Louis. Drink her dinner. And fall into bed.</p><p>On a groan of torment, she laid her head against the steering wheel and closed her eyes.</p><p>Three knocks on her window jerked her head up. Disoriented, terrorized, Rubi leaned away from the window, gripping the steering wheel with bloodless fingers. An old woman stared in at her, a perplexed look on her face.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s heart was still skittering around her chest when the woman asked, \u201cAre you all right, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>A dream? A hallucination? Had she fallen asleep?</p><p>\u201cHoney?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s concerned tone refocused Rubi. She darted glances through the windshield, the passenger\u2019s window, the rearview mirror.</p><p>Trees. Missouri.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>She must have fallen asleep. But a glance at the dashboard clock said it couldn\u2019t have been for long.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s fingers shook when she pressed the window control and rolled the glass down halfway. The thick, cool air swept into the car, dragging every scent of vegetation and earth in as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Rubi said. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m kind of...um...lost.\u201d</p><p>She was pretty for an old woman, her hair a silvery blonde, her eyes smoky blue, great bone structure...</p><p>\u201cWho are you lookin\u2019 for?\u201d Her accent was thick, and the twang reminded Rubi of the soft lilt she\u2019d heard in Wes\u2019s voice on the video the night before. \u201cI know everyone round these parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...the Lawson family? Wes Lawson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWesley?\u201d Her face brightened instantly. \u201cYes, of course, my little rebel, Wesley. Come, come.\u201d She waved for Rubi to follow and started down the gravel road.</p><p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d Rubi stared after her in confusion. Should she get out and walk? One look around and the answer was a big, fat no. She called after the woman, \u201cDo you want me to drive you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said, still hurrying down the road. \u201cCome, come.\u201d</p><p>Rubi let her foot off the brake and eased the car in the old woman\u2019s wake, sure she was going to end up in some crazy man\u2019s basement, never to be heard from again. And... \u201cWesley?\u201d she murmured, trying to remember if that was his full name or if this woman was just plain-ass crazy.</p><p>But Rubi turned a bend in the road, and the trees parted like the red sea, exposing a beautiful two-story, farm-style home surrounded by expanses of grass. \u201cOh...\u201d</p><p>The woman rushed up the porch and wrung her hands as she waited for Rubi. She parked the car and got out but hesitated, not sure if she should follow.</p><p>\u201cBirdie?\u201d someone called from inside the house. \u201cBirdie, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my...\u201d The old woman turned toward the voice and opened the front door. \u201cI\u2019m right here, Claudia. Missy is here to take some of my Special K bars to Wesley.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Rubi\u2019s reality warped, like she\u2019d been dragged into a parallel universe. She was prying her hands from the driver\u2019s doorframe to get back in the car when a middle-aged black woman appeared on the porch. She gripped the older woman\u2019s arms, bending to look directly in the shorter woman\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cBirdie, Lord. Where were you? You can\u2019t just go walking around the property alone. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t alone. Missy\u2019s here.\u201d Birdie gestured toward Rubi, and the other woman, Claudia, Rubi supposed, glanced that direction, then did a double-take on Rubi. \u201cNow let me be. I have to wrap up some of Wesley\u2019s favorite treat.\u201d</p><p>Birdie squirmed from Claudia\u2019s grip, calling to Rubi, \u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute.\u201d Then to Claudia, \u201cBring the girl in for some pop, Claudia. Where are your manners?\u201d</p><p>Claudia came to the edge of the front steps and leaned on the banister. \u201cYou\u2019re a friend of Wes\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Relief sagged Rubi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWes Lawson. Is he here?\u201d</p><p>Please, please, please be here.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Claudia said. \u201cHe\u2019s at the hospital with his brother.\u201d</p><p>She was in the right place. But, God, she didn\u2019t want to get back in that car. \u201cOh. Okay. Is that...um...nearby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s in St. Louis.\u201d</p><p>Holy. Shit.</p><p>Her shoulders sagged again, but this time not in relief. \u201cDo you know when he\u2019ll be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sorry again. I\u2019m just not much help at all, am I?\u201d Her head tilted. \u201cIs your name...Missy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s Rubi. I\u2019m not sure why she\u2019s calling me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaudia,\u201d Birdie appeared behind the other woman and squeezed past. \u201cDon\u2019t talk Missy\u2019s ear off. She\u2019s got to get back to Wesley and Wyatt.\u201d Birdie hustled forward with a brown paper bag and a smile that lit up her face but which struck Rubi as...a little odd. She patted Rubi\u2019s shoulder and offered the bag. \u201cAll right, there\u2019s enough in there for all of you. You\u2019d better get back to Wesley now, dear. You know how he worries. Oh...\u201d She lowered her voice into a conspiratorial tone. \u201cI love the color you dyed your hair. Very pretty. Wesley\u2019s always preferred blondes, but you look so beautiful as a brunette, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, now, Birdie.\u201d Claudia ushered Birdie into the house and closed the door after her, remaining on the porch. She turned to Rubi again with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. Birdie is...sometimes in a different place and time.\u201d</p><p>Rubi nodded, not sure what to say. Completely disoriented.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to call Wes for you? See when he\u2019ll be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Panic bloomed deep in her body. \u201cNo. No, thank you. I\u2019ll go see him. Which hospital did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe VA Medical Center in St. Louis,\u201d Claudia said. \u201cIt really would be best to make sure he\u2019s not already on his way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...wanted my visit to be a surprise.\u201d That wasn\u2019t a lie. The why was really the lie. And the escape route she\u2019d wanted to keep open was looking more and more viable by the moment. Only now, Wes would know she\u2019d been here. Backing out would be messy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claudia smiled. \u201cYou came all the way from California, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cI should have recognized your accent, not to mention your car, your clothes, that movie-star look about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...\u201d she laughed softly, \u201cnot in the movie industry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on in. Let me call him.\u201d</p><p>She held the door open and waved Rubi forward. \u201cWould you like a can of pop or some sweet tea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Rubi parted her lips to tell them she couldn\u2019t come in, but hell, she was tired and she didn\u2019t know where she was going. So she climbed the stairs, wondering if Wes had grown up here. Then found herself wondering all about his childhood.</p><p>The interior of the home was spacious and open, with big rooms flowing together and vaulted ceilings. The kitchen was as modern as Rubi\u2019s\u2014correction, Dolph\u2019s\u2014with granite counters, stainless steel appliances and light wooden, glass-fronted cabinets. The dining and family rooms, all open to the kitchen, were painted different jewel tones, offset by white ceilings and lots of light through the windows. The floors were wide-planked, light wood. The overall effect was sophisticated yet homey.</p><p>Birdie stirred something on the stove, and the scent of spices filled the air. \u201cCan you stay for supper, Missy? I know how you love my corned beef. Wesley\u2019s favorite.\u201d</p><p>Wes liked corned beef?</p><p>Rubi rubbed her forehead. \u201cThank you, but I\u2019m just going to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Claudia held up a finger to her lips, then into the phone said, \u201cHey, Wes, it\u2019s Claudia.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Wes so close made Rubi\u2019s stomach jump and burn. Made her yearn to fall into his arms. The longing itself made Rubi uncomfortable. She was completely twisted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, everything\u2019s fine. Listen, your mama and daddy are still in Kansas City. They\u2019re getting a late start back. Grams is fixing up corned beef. Do y\u2019all think you\u2019ll make it back for supper?\u201d She was quiet a moment. \u201cAll right, then. No fuss. Take care now.\u201d</p><p>She hung up the portable phone on the kitchen counter. \u201cHe\u2019s still at the hospital. Said he wouldn\u2019t be heading back for another hour or two. So you should have just enough time to catch him.\u201d</p><p>Armed with Grams\u2019s Special K bars\u2014whatever the hell those were\u2014and a can of \u201cpop\u201d in the form of Coke, Rubi followed Ms. GPS\u2019s directions back to St. Louis and the VA Medical center with a shitload of misgivings. And even by the time she slid her rental\u2014a crisp, white BMW sports coupe\u2014past the front of the hospital\u2019s spinal injury center, she still hadn\u2019t decided whether or not to call him.</p><p>But fate decided for her.</p> <p>As she pulled the car into a parking spot at the front left of the building, she spotted Wes strolling the path leading to the main entrance. And he wasn\u2019t alone. Whoever the woman was had long blonde hair and knew Wes well judging by the minimal distance between them.</p><p>Fine. Rubi turned off the car to wait. After Birdie, Rubi wasn\u2019t exactly up for meeting any more of Wes\u2019s family or friends at the moment.</p><p>With his hands in the front pockets of his jeans, staring down at the concrete beneath his feet, he looked ridiculously adorable. Rubi found herself wondering if he had baby pictures she could see. The thought made her smile. She soaked in the sight of him in his jeans and long-sleeved tee after not seeing him for three days. The first time they\u2019d been apart in two months. Crazy. Not at all a normal relationship. But then, Rubi didn\u2019t know anything about normal.</p><p>She shifted in her seat, restless to surprise him. Her smile widened as she realized how quickly her uncertainty morphed to excitement. All it took was his proximity and her fears seemed to melt.</p><p>\u201cCome on...\u201d she murmured, leaning her head sideways to get a better view. \u201cGo home already, blondie. I\u2019m exhausted. And I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on that man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWesley\u2019s always preferred blondes.\u201d</p><p>The comment scraped along Rubi\u2019s nerves. His grandmother was definitely a little off. But Rubi\u2019s mind drifted back to what she knew of his previous girlfriends. Jax and the other Renegades razzed each other about women often enough for Rubi to catch a few details. She knew Kayla had been blonde, but she couldn\u2019t remember if his other girlfriends had been too.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. Rubi was secure enough with herself to know a hair color didn\u2019t determine attraction. And she also knew if she had to choose a type, blond would not be her top choice, yet she was hot as hellfire for Wes Lawson.</p> <p>Wes and the blonde woman slowed their pace as they neared the parking lot and continued talking. He laughed at something she said, and she leaned into him.</p><p>A trickle of heat coursed down Rubi\u2019s neck. \u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d she barely whispered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pull away but neither did he take his hands from his pockets to touch her. They talked another moment, a span of time that seemed like an eternity to Rubi. Then the blonde made her move\u2014one Rubi had known was coming. That hadn\u2019t surprised her. She lifted her hands to Wes\u2019s shoulders, pushed up on her toes, and kissed him. Not just a peck either. She lingered there.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s stomach clenched. And as if she\u2019d been numbed, a dull ache filled her chest. \u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d she begged Wes in a whisper.</p><p>He lifted his head and said something, hands still in his pockets as if they\u2019d been glued there. The blonde responded by sliding her hand around his neck and pulling Wes\u2019s mouth down to hers.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s breath slid out in a slow exhale of wounded disappointment, but beneath lived that ever-present resignation. She wasn\u2019t right for Wes, and by coming here, she was only prolonging the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cOr...he\u2019s really just looking to hook up with you because you\u2019re hot, to tide him over until he finds another one of those sweet girls to settle with again.\u201d</p><p>The very reality of Lexi\u2019s words might mean whatever relationship Wes and Rubi had been flirting with was already over. And she\u2019d created this whole goddamned mess.</p><p>Tears crept up, blurring her vision. She certainly hadn\u2019t been prepared for this twist. At least not tonight.</p><p>Wes\u2019s hands finally pulled from his pockets, slid up the woman\u2019s arms. Still, he didn\u2019t push her away. A rock formed in Rubi\u2019s stomach\u2014not the pain of jealousy, but of loss. And damn but she felt foolish. So fucking foolish. The pain in her stomach spread to her chest and throbbed there.</p><p>Rubi closed her eyes and sank back into the seat, weighted like lead. \u201cI\u2019m such a fucking loser.\u201d</p><p>The whisper dissipated, and Rubi reached forward, turning the engine over. Without looking at Wes again, she pulled out of the parking spot and exited the lot for the freeway. And the airport.</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>Wes froze at the feel of Melissa\u2019s lips on his. The two of them had been getting along great the last two days, like the friends they\u2019d once been. Like no time had passed. He\u2019d settled into the comfort and camaraderie, proud of them both for being able to let the past go.</p><p>So this move was completely unexpected.</p><p>Time seemed to stand still. Memories flashed back\u2014their first kiss, their first I love yous, their first time making love in the back of his truck. But this kiss didn\u2019t bring back any of those old emotions. Not at all the way he\u2019d once believed it would if he\u2019d ever gotten the chance to kiss her again.</p><p>In fact, it felt wrong. All wrong.</p><p>Wes added pressure to Melissa\u2019s arms. As badly as he wanted her mouth off his, he didn\u2019t want to jerk her around. To dislodge her, he had to reach up and curl his fingers around hers, prying them loose. Then he was able to pull his head back and break the kiss.</p><p>\u201cMissy,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at all the kind of woman he wanted. Not now. And looking back, probably not then either. But she\u2019d fit the acceptable model for his family.</p><p>She turned her hand in his and threaded their fingers together. \u201cIt\u2019s called a kiss. We used to be very good at it.\u201d</p><p>She leaned closer, her breasts pressing his chest. Instead of desire, only anxiety and discomfort filled him. Beyond, in the parking lot, tires gave a curt squeal as someone popped a clutch too fast. Wes glanced that direction as a white BMW coupe turned onto the freeway.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try it again,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cSee if you remember this time.\u201d</p><p>She pushed up, but this time, with his hand trapped in hers, he pulled back. \u201cI\u2019m...seeing someone, Missy.\u201d</p><p>At least he hoped he was still seeing Rubi. She hadn\u2019t responded to any of his messages since midday yesterday. At least when she was angry, she was still talking. Wes\u2019s biggest fear was that the anger had grown old and she just stopped caring all together. With him gone and her not responding to his calls or texts or even videos, he knew that indifference would happen even faster.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Melissa eased back, a frown turning her lush mouth down. \u201cI...didn\u2019t realize... Wyatt and Whitney said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWyatt and Whitney don\u2019t know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she...special?\u201d Melissa asked, a little pouty.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d Wes said. He had to bite his tongue to keep from apologizing to Melissa. He was not sorry he was in love with Rubi.</p><p>She took a step back and released his hand. \u201cAll right, then.\u201d She smoothed her hands down the front of her scrub top. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll call this...an old-times\u2019 sake kiss and call it good.\u201d</p><p>Wes nodded. Forced a smile. \u201cSounds good. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Wes waited while she climbed into her car, a sensible blue Subaru four-wheel-drive, and backed out of her spot. Then he pulled out his phone and checked for messages from Rubi. Nothing. God, he needed to hear her voice.</p><p>He called her number and listened to it ring as he wandered toward his brother\u2019s truck\u2014Wes\u2019s ride for the time he was in town. Her voice mail picked up.</p><p>\u201cRubi Russo.\u201d Her smooth voice came over the line. \u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><p>Beep.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d Wes said. \u201cWould really love to hear your voice\u2014even if you\u2019re still pissed. This has been the longest three days of my life.\u201d He unlocked the truck and pulled the door open. \u201cWyatt\u2019s making amazing progress. He\u2019s working with the rig three times a day and gaining strength faster than he did during the recovery of his first surgery. Doctors are impressed. His surgeon wants to talk with you about your programming. They have a big spine center here, do a lot of surgery.\u201d</p><p>He laid a hand on the steering wheel and looked out into the growing darkness with a hole opening inside him. \u201cAnyway...\u201d He paused, not sure how much to say or not say. \u201cI miss you. Keep finding myself looking around to share something...\u201d He stopped himself from getting too sappy. \u201cOkay.\u201d He had to bite his tongue from signing off with I love you. \u201cTalk later.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected and climbed into the truck. After he\u2019d turned onto the highway toward home, he dialed the house.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, Grams, it\u2019s Wes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Wesley. How\u2019s the weather in California, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>A tired smile lifted his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not in California, Grams. I\u2019m on my way to Mom\u2019s house. I\u2019ll see you in about an hour. Do you or Claudia need anything from town while I\u2019m out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so. Did Missy bring you the Special K bars? I added melted chocolate on top, just the way you love them.\u201d</p> <p>Wes rubbed his eyes. When Whitney told him that Grams was deteriorating, she wasn\u2019t kidding. Within an hour of talking to his grandmother, Wes had learned the quickest and most painful way to avoid a long-drawn-out, frustrating conversation\u2014which she always won\u2014was to agree with her. \u201cYep. Sure did. Thanks, Grams. Can I talk to Claudia for a minute?\u201d</p><p>What a long freaking day, he thought, waiting for Claudia.</p><p>\u201cHey, Wes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. I\u2019m on my way back, just wanted to know if you need anything in town? Grams says no, but...\u201d</p><p>Claudia chuckled. \u201cThis time she\u2019s right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, then. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes?\u201d Claudia said as he pulled the phone from his ear.</p><p>\u201cYeah, still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Rubi find you?\u201d</p><p>A split second of utter confusion hit him. Claudia should not know Rubi\u2019s name. No one but Whitney should know Rubi\u2019s name. Then his heart took a hard punch and dropped to his stomach. He braked and pulled over to the side of the road. He was suddenly breathing hard. \u201cWhat do you mean find me? Did she call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she came by. It took me a minute to figure out how she knew you, but then I recognized her California accent, that flashy car, all dressed up. She\u2019s a beauty. Seems real nice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClaudia...\u201d Fuck he really couldn\u2019t breathe now. \u201cJust to be clear, you\u2019re saying that Rubi came to Mom\u2019s house looking for me. Like...in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how else could she come? But it doesn\u2019t sound like she found you. I sent her to the VA Medical Center. If you\u2019re just leaving town now, I can\u2019t imagine she missed you.\u201d</p><p>Wes shoved the truck into Park, leaned forward, and pressed his forehead on the steering wheel. With his eyes squeezed tight and a ball of fire in his stomach, he asked, \u201cWhat...kind of car was she driving?\u201d</p><p>Before he heard the answer, he knew.</p><p>\u201cFancy white sports car. A BMW.\u201d She pronounced the W as \u201cdouble-ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say where else she might go?\u201d Wes asked, his forehead suddenly damp.</p><p>\u201cNope. Thought for sure she would have found you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think...I think she did. Thanks, Claudia. I might be later than I thought.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, boy. No rush.\u201d</p><p>Wes said good-bye and disconnected. He raked his hand through his hair, forcing his mind to engage. She\u2019d flown all the way out here, driven herself from the airport, only to find him kissing Melissa.</p><p>\u201cGod can\u2019t be that cruel.\u201d He sat back and whipped the truck around, driving the direction her car had gone. \u201cHe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He called Rubi\u2019s cell three times in a row, disconnecting when her message came on. At a stoplight. he texted her.</p><p>WES: WHERE are you?</p><p>When he didn\u2019t get an answer, he dialed Lexi.</p><p>\u201cHi, Wes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cYou sound guilty already,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...I don\u2019t want to get in the middle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi, she flew all the way out here just to turn around and go home? Come on. You\u2019re her best friend. You know we\u2019re good together. That woman needs to get out of her own goddamned way. Now tell me where she is.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then a heavy exhale. \u201cThe airport.\u201d</p><p>Wes stomped on the gas. Hope flared. \u201cWhich airline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnited. Her plane leaves in forty-five minutes. Wes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...upset. She\u2019s trying to pretend she\u2019s not, but...she\u2019s fragile right now. And as much as I love you, if you break her heart, I\u2019ll break yours.\u201d</p><p>That made Wes smile. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he disconnected, his phone buzzed with a message.</p><p>RUBI: I\u2019m where I\u2019m supposed to be and you\u2019re where you\u2019re supposed to be. Everything\u2019s good.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he murmured to himself, sliding his phone into his pocket. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s going to be right where they should be real soon.\u201d</p><p>He reached the airport in ten minutes instead of the twenty it should have taken, parked illegally, and ran into the terminal. He purchased the cheapest ticket he could get\u2014a commuter hop from St. Louis to Des Moines\u2014just to get to the gate. Security was excruciating. But he spotted one of his childhood football buddies working TSA and got rushed through. He sprinted through the United terminal like one of those idiots late for their plane and pulled to a stop in front of a departure board. There were two flights leaving for LA.</p><p>\u201cNow boarding passengers for flight 5612 to Los Angeles.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice filled the terminal. \u201cWe invite disabled persons, military personnel in uniform, and Global Services to board now.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s chest burned with a punch of panic. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d</p><p>He swiveled on his heel, searched for gate numbers, and ran down the corridor. He slowed just before the gate, scanning the area. He was breathing hard, sweating. His heart pounded quickly in his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he whispered, his gaze darting from person to person at the crowded gate. People were already in line to board according to group number, blocking his view.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t find her. Fuck. His heart sank. Blood drained from his head, leaving him dizzy.</p><p>Wes pulled out his phone, hit the speed dial number for Rubi with his thumb, then watched the passengers and listened for the ring. But got nothing.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d Could she have anticipated Wes coming? Given Lexi the wrong airline?</p><p>He pushed a hand through his hair and walked past the gate, now searching for the restrooms. He turned in a circle, spotted them, and watched the women going in and out for a moment.</p><p>\u201cWe now invite group one to board.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice filled Wes\u2019s ear.</p><p>Group one included first class. That would be Rubi.</p><p>He turned again, scanned the line. Searched the gate seating area.</p><p>Rubi turned from looking out the windows facing the tarmac as if she\u2019d just appeared, but in reality, she\u2019d been standing in a corner behind the airline\u2019s customer service booth. Relief nearly took Wes to his knees. His air whooshed out of his chest, and he bent at the waist, pressing his hands to his thighs to stay upright.</p><p>He straightened and started toward her, suddenly blank on what he wanted, needed, to say. How he\u2019d missed her, he couldn\u2019t begin to understand. She wore a deep red dress with a large abstract pattern of chocolate and black spread over the arm and the opposite side of the skirt. The dress was long sleeved but low cut in the front, and the material clung to her every perfect inch. Her spiked heels were black. She wore her silver bangles, a long silver necklace, and several silver rings. Her hair was wound into a pretty knot at her neck, secured with a silver clip, and dark, wavy tendrils framed her gorgeous face.</p><p>She sat in a chair at the end of the row and pulled a piece of paper from her purse, then studied it. Wes approached, but Rubi didn\u2019t look up. He dropped both hands on the arms of the seat and used them to lower himself to his knees in front of her.</p><p>Rubi gasped and sat back. When her bright eyes met his, a frown of annoyance marred her face, but her eyes were red, puffy, her cheeks still damp with tears. The sight sucked the air from his chest.</p><p>\u201cBaby...\u201d was all he managed through the relief, the regret.</p><p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d she started, her frown vanishing. \u201cHow...?\u201d Her mouth closed, eyes narrowed. \u201cLexi. Damn her. She promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I didn\u2019t give her a choice. You know how impossible I can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d She sat back, putting room between them. \u201cLook, this was a whim, and coming was a mistake. I seem to be making a lot of them lately. Let\u2019s just forget this happened. Forget the last week happened. We\u2019ll go back to being friends. You go back to...whatever you were doing. But I have to go now.\u201d</p><p>She sat forward, but Wes didn\u2019t move. \u201cI know you saw me with Melissa, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. She\u2019s way more your type. I get it. It\u2019s fine. A relief, really. We\u2019re all good. Let me get on the plane, Wes. They\u2019re boarding\u2014\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and shut her up with his mouth.</p><p>Her lips were tight, unyielding. She pushed him back on the chest, eyes blazing. \u201cDon\u2019t even.\u201d She kept her voice to a whispered growl. \u201cI\u2019m not going to play games with you. I won\u2019t share, and I won\u2019t ever settle for being second in a man\u2019s life. I\u2019ve lived that way too long. And I know for a fact that I\u2019m better off alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow boarding group number two on United Airlines flight 5612 to Los Angeles. Group two.\u201d</p><p>She pushed to her feet, but Wes grabbed her arms and pulled her back down.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d she rasped. \u201cDon\u2019t make me throw a fit here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa and I dated for a long time back in high school and college.\u201d He let the words spill out. \u201cShe kissed me, I told her I was seeing someone, and she apologized. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all there was to it.\u201d</p><p>She considered a moment, the anger in her face draining. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I shouldn\u2019t have come. I realized this was a mistake the moment I hit thirty-thousand feet. But I had forward momentum, so I kept going. Seeing you and Melissa just confirmed this was wrong. You looked so right together. I just realized we shouldn\u2019t be trying to force something that isn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, natural. Meant to be. We just need to let it go, Wes.\u201d</p><p>Panic flared in his veins, and determination settled in. \u201cNo way.\u201d The sound came out more menacing than he\u2019d intended, but he felt her slipping, and he was holding on tight. \u201cYou made plane reservations. You found someone to take care of Rodie. You drove over an hour to the airport. Got on a plane. Rented a car. Drove all the fucking way to my parents\u2019 house in a place you\u2019ve never been before, then drove back to the VA. You are not making me believe this is a goddamned whim. If you want to go home, go. But you\u2019re going to admit I matter to you before you get on that fucking plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that friend bullshit.\u201d His vehemence made her wince, and she looked down at her hands in her lap.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem here?\u201d A female voice made them both look up. One of the United representatives from the desk towered above them, a stern look on her dark face. Her gaze travelled from Wes to Rubi. \u201cDo you want me to call security?\u201d</p><p>She offered a tight smile. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take it somewhere else,\u201d Wes finished for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Wes glanced up and around to figure out where they could have a private conversation, he found nearly everyone in the area looking at them.

He pushed to his feet, grabbed Rubi\u2019s suitcase with one hand and Rubi\u2019s hand with the other.</p><p>\u201cNow boarding group number three on United Airlines flight 5612 to Los Angeles,\u201d came over the intercom. \u201cGroup three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d She tugged against his hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss my flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to miss it if we don\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together but didn\u2019t argue as he created a path through the lines of passengers and veered toward a virtually empty seating area near another gate. He released her luggage and pulled her into his arms. The feel of her body stretched against him was so good, it hurt.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he breathed. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her face against his chest, slipped her fingers through his hair. And all he could think was heaven. This was the woman he wanted.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing forced about this. The fight is all in denying it.\u201d He released her, gripped her arms, and pushed her back. \u201cNow that you know I wasn\u2019t kicking it up with an old, dead flame, tell me why you can\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>Looking away again, Rubi dropped into a chair and slouched against the back. \u201cI didn\u2019t come for the right reasons.\u201d</p><p>He waited, but when she didn\u2019t go on, he demanded, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...complicated.\u201d Her expression grew concrete, resolute. She seemed to slide deeper into herself, away from Wes. \u201cI didn\u2019t come for you. I came for me.\u201d She met his gaze, her expression guilty. \u201cLexi has Jax. I\u2019ve outgrown Stilettos. I\u2019ve banished my father. Now my house has been invaded by real estate brokers who feel like they have more rights to it than I do. I didn\u2019t realize it until I was already here, maybe until after I saw you at the hospital and came back to the airport...but I wanted to feel like I fit somewhere. I wanted to be with someone who wanted me.\u201d</p><p>He sat beside her, basking in this openness. This vulnerability beneath that layer of Kevlar. \u201cYou came to the right place. No one wants you more than I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was selfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. That\u2019s like saying me having sex with you is selfish because I want to get laid. If it\u2019s what we both want, then we both win. And I want you here with me.\u201d He clasped his hands and leaned forward on his thighs, tilting his head to look into her downturned face. \u201cBut you have to want it too.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her lip between her teeth, and tears rolled down her cheeks, then dripped on the floor before she could lift her hand to wipe them away. The sight absolutely broke him. He hadn\u2019t even believed her capable of crying\u2014a preconceived idea he\u2019d only just now realized.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said, her voice shaky. \u201cWhen I saw you with Melissa...\u201d She sniffled. \u201cIt hurt to think of losing you.\u201d She lifted her gaze to his. They were filled to the brim with tears and the brightest green he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this, Wes. I haven\u2019t had a relationship since high school, and even then I was no good at it. I was never good at it. You have to accept that responsibility if you want to be with me\u2014knowing I could very well screw it all up and hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow boarding group number four on United Airlines flight 5612 to Los Angeles,\u201d came over the intercom. \u201cGroup four.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s own eyes grew hot. He lifted a hand to her face and turned her to look at him. \u201cThe last time I told a woman I loved her for the first time was back in high school. I think we\u2019ve both grown up a little since then. We both know you can do anything you put that wicked mind to.\u201d</p><p>She huffed a laugh, and tears squeezed out of her eyes when they closed. Wes lifted her face to his and kissed the trails over her cheeks, sipping the wetness from her skin. Then touched his lips to hers. Now they were warm and wet and salty.</p><p>When she kissed him back, a rush of urgency filled his body in a whoosh. He opened his mouth and stroked his tongue between her lips. She responded instantly, heatedly, pushing a hand into his hair and fisting it as she met his tongue on a long moan.</p><p>\u201cNow boarding group number five on United Airlines flight 5612 to Los Angeles,\u201d came over the intercom. \u201cLast boarding call for United Airlines flight 5612 to Los Angeles.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his mouth from hers. \u201cStay, Rubi. Just a few days. Meet Wyatt, see how the rig works. You don\u2019t have to stay with my family. There\u2019s a bed-and-breakfast a few miles away, a couple of hotels in Washington, just over the river\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d She said, a smile warming her face. Wes felt like the sun rose in his chest. \u201cJust for a few days. I\u2019m not sure what to do about where to stay.\u201d</p> <p>Christ, he was elated. Even his craziest stunt didn\u2019t work him up like this. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave it open for now. Let\u2019s go home, get some dinner, meet my family\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already met a few. I\u2019m guessing Melissa goes by Missy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe used to, in high school. How\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p><p>Rubi pushed to her feet and grabbed the handle of her luggage. \u201cEvidently, Birdie thinks I\u2019m Missy.\u201d</p><p>Wes straightened with a groan. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. But someone should tell Birdie you don\u2019t prefer blondes so much anymore.\u201d</p><p>He swung his arm around her shoulders and grinned down at her. \u201cShe said she gave you a batch of my favorite treat. You owe me some sugar.\u201d</p><p>Rubi lifted that gorgeous face to his, the shadows weren\u2019t completely gone from her eyes, but that didn\u2019t keep love from squeezing his heart.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just see how this goes,\u201d she said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll talk about sugar.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Two</p><p>Wes couldn\u2019t believe what a lucky bastard he was. He could have lost her if he\u2019d missed her at the airport. And he was sure that by the time she\u2019d reached LA, she would have convinced herself she was done with him. Now, she sat in the middle of the bench seat, squeezed to his side beneath his arm. Her mouth was on his neck, her hand on his thigh. Which kept inching higher.</p><p>Almost to the turn off the main highway, Wes had pulled the clip from her hair and now combed his fingers through the strands again. He could do it forever. So thick, so silky, it felt beautiful beneath his hand. Right now he was also enjoying the comfortable silence between them. They\u2019d spent the first half hour catching up\u2014on Wyatt and Wes\u2019s family, on Rubi\u2019s work, the stunt apps, Rodie, and the house. Rubi had just finished telling him about the Realtor who kept popping in on her without calling, and he was wishing he could have been there to show the man the way out. On his ass.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put an offer in on your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already tried that. Six times.\u201d Her smooth voice purred in his ear, shooting tingles over his neck. If he got any harder, his dick was going to break his zipper.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hurt to try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it could. I\u2019m done with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can still be done. Just look at it as a business transaction. One that allows you to own the house you love, free of him. You can\u2019t win the game if you don\u2019t play.\u201d</p><p>When he glanced at her, she lifted her head and kissed his lips. He tried kissing her while watching the road, and the truck veered into the other lane. Wes straightened with a jerk of the wheel. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>Rubi laughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t drive and kiss at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not.\u201d He signaled and took the exit for the two-lane road leading to his parents\u2019 house.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She ran a finger from his temple to his jaw. Then her hand slid beneath the hem of his T-shirt and stroked his belly, her fingers pausing on the button of his jeans. And popped it. \u201cWhat about with my mouth on a different part of your body?\u201d</p><p>She worked his zipper down, and Wes was caught in a tense battle between shock and excitement. \u201cRubi\u2014\u201d</p><p>He jerked at the feel of her palm cradling his cock. With a soft hum of pleasure, she lowered her head and closed her mouth over him. A brilliant burst of light blinded him. \u201cAh shit, Rubi...\u201d</p><p>She took him deeper, stroking the swollen shaft with a velvet tongue.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d His hand tightened in her hair. Excitement whipped up from his groin. His balls squeezed. His gut stung with pleasure. \u201cRubi...\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what he wanted to say\u2014other than her name. Or how impossibly good she felt. Or how badly he wanted her. But she wasn\u2019t listening anyway. And Wes couldn\u2019t think anymore. She suckled him deep, moaning with pleasure, dragging him out of her mouth slowly. So slowly.</p><p>She sat up and kissed his mouth again. \u201cI want you.\u201d She unfastened her seat belt. Her hands slipped beneath her skirt, reappearing as they dragged her panties down her legs\u2014all while those catlike eyes stayed on him. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>The woman was one ridiculous thrill after another. Wes divided his attention between the road and Rubi, favoring the latter enough to convince him he was going to end up in a ditch. She turned, pulled her feet beneath her, and knelt on the seat beside him. With a hand on his shoulder, she said, \u201cYou concentrate on staying on the pavement. I\u2019ll concentrate on staying on you.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, carefully, she stretched one long leg\u2014high heel still in place\u2014across his lap. He was momentarily distracted from the consequences of the act by the glorious sight of that toned thigh. Then the sweet scent of her arousal mixed with her perfume and\u2014wham\u2014lust hit him hard and square. His focus on the road wavered.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, hold on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a stunt driver,\u201d she asked, aligning her hips with his and leaning slightly to one side so he could see out the windshield over her shoulder, \u201cor not?\u201d</p><p>His head was definitely fogged. He couldn\u2019t even answer. Was he a stunt driver? What the fuck was his goddamned name? The woman wiped his mind of everything but her\u2014her scent, her feel, her taste. And yes, he wanted to be tasting her. But all his mind could do was spin and spin. Then she lowered herself until her soft pussy pressed along the length of his cock. And, holy mother of God, he lost his mind.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Rubi...\u201d He sounded like he was dying. One hand choked the steering wheel. His other fingers dug into the perfect curve of her bare hip beneath her skirt.</p><p>Come on, turnout. But there was nothing on the side of the road but narrow grassy patches lined with trees.</p><p>She rocked her hips, and her pussy wet his length. The stroke washed his lower body with electric need. \u201cGod,\u201d she breathed, \u201cyou feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God...\u201d he ground out from behind clenched teeth.</p><p>She pushed up on her knees, gripped his cock in her palm, and dragged him to her entrance.</p><p>Still no goddamned turnout. What the fuck was wrong with Missouri transit?</p><p>Her pussy closed over the tip of his cock, and another streak of lightning blinded him. When his sight returned, he was drifting toward the shoulder. He straightened, but... \u201cRubi...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A hot little breathy laugh came from her throat. One filled with decadent, wicked pleasure. One that amped his heart rate, temperature, and blood pressure until his skin felt too tight.</p><p>And then she lowered the rest of the way on his cock. Slowly. Slowly. So damn slowly.</p><p>The road swam in his vision. But a shadow on the right exposed a turnout. Wes braked, turned the wheel, and bumped over the turnout\u2019s rough gravel base. That rumble also made Rubi bounce on his lap, and he pushed so deep, he could have been in her throat again.</p><p>She was half laughing, half moaning when he shoved the truck into Park, fisted her hair with both hands, and jerked her head down to kiss her. Her curved lips instantly opened and molded to his, her tongue tasting.</p> <p>Wes groped for his seat belt, released it, and slid out from behind the wheel, carrying her with him. His hands moved down her back to her hips. With his feet braced on the floor, his hand on her ass, he had everything he needed to dig in. She was perfectly tight. Lusciously wet, and with all the need pent up over the last few days, all his frustration, all his desire, he tightened his ass and pushed with his thighs, driving into her. Over and over and over with frantic and sudden fiery need.</p><p>\u201cOh God...\u201d she said, her voice high-pitched and tight.</p><p>\u201cInsane.\u201d He needed more, so much more. And faster. And longer. But this was a quick, urgent surge of lust. The kind that snapped with the heat of an explosive. \u201cYou feel so good.\u201d</p><p>His orgasm came barreling at him, like a brick wall in a stunt crash, only this time he wouldn\u2019t bail before impact.</p><p>\u201cGod...\u201d</p> <p>Her teeth closed over his shoulder and a scream rumbled in her throat. Her pussy clenched around him, the muscles convulsing, squeezing his orgasm forward. He let his own scream of release come, filling the cab with the guttural sound of pleasure. Let himself feel the thrill roll through him in waves.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s forehead rested on his shoulder. Her hot breath streamed through the cotton of his T-shirt. Her heart beat quickly against his chest. And Wes felt the impact of that figurative brick wall, his head wobbly and dazed.</p><p>\u201cLawson,\u201d she said between breaths, \u201cyou rock my world.\u201d</p><p>That tickled something inside him, and laughter rolled up his throat. Then he had to catch his breath again before he said, \u201cYou fucking...floor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...we\u2019ve got that...going for us, right?\u201d</p><p>He dropped his head back on the seat and lifted a hand to push the hair from her eyes. They were heavy-lidded, smoky, and sated. Her full mouth a little more swollen from his assault. Christ, he\u2019d missed her so much, it hurt to look at her. He kissed her gently. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a hell of a lot more than that going for us, baby.\u201d</p> <p>So relaxed after that blockbuster quickie, Rubi almost fell asleep on Wes\u2019s shoulder. He was warm and quiet, his arm tight around her shoulders, his fingers sliding through her hair in a barely there caress that soothed her toward sleep.</p><p>Then the car slowed, turned, and gravel crunched under the tires.</p><p>She came awake quickly and with a fresh ball of unease in her gut. In the headlights, the house where she\u2019d met Birdie and Claudia stood illuminated. But now it didn\u2019t look at all tranquil. The quiet country home bustled with activity. Cars and trucks lined the drive. Golden light spilled from every window. People stood in the kitchen, sat in the family room, wandered the living room. Children streaked between the rooms, and their voices reached Rubi all the way out where Wes parked, a dozen yards or more from the house.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d She lifted her head from his shoulder as he turned off the engine. \u201cAre they having a party...or something?\u201d</p><p>Wes grinned, but it wasn\u2019t as wide or bright as his carefree smile. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d He unwrapped his arm from around her shoulders. \u201cMy parents are back\u2014they went to Kansas City today on business. Looks like Whitney is here, and, well, a few other relatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a big family that seems to congregate whenever there\u2019s a wedding, birth, death, holiday...or, in this case, surgery.\u201d</p><p>A flutter in her stomach carried the knot toward her throat. \u201cAh.\u201d</p> <p>Her mind was busy darting between skipping out\u2014she could think of a million excuses\u2014and staying. For Wes. She knew meeting his family was important to him, and she already felt bad over the realization that she\u2019d originally come for selfish motives.</p><p>Wes opened the door, slid out, and turned, reaching for her. He gripped her waist and pulled her into him, kissing her as he lowered her feet to the ground. His lips were gentle, the kiss slow and tender. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get you...\u201d\u2014he kissed her again\u2014\u201cin a bed...\u201d\u2014and again\u2014\u201cfor an entire night.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s nerves coiled. The idea sounded blissful in some ways, terrifying in others. And that streak of discomfort that kept popping up whenever she experienced a solid foundation of happiness annoyed the hell out of her. Even acknowledging the conditioned response for what it was didn\u2019t do anything to make it less terrifying.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Rubi turned her gaze from the house\u2014where she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d focused\u2014back to Wes.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to meet them tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a long day. Want me to find someplace to stay? We\u2019ll go there.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand the disappointment in his eyes. \u201cNo. It\u2019s fine. I just...\u201d</p><p>I just don\u2019t know how to socialize in normal situations. Put her in a bar, a club\u2014even a sex club, and she knew how to control the situation. Put her in a group of studly men, like the Renegades, and she could pull their strings like a puppeteer. Put her in a business meeting, and she could hold her own with the brightest minds in the industry. At a photo shoot, she owned the cameras. On the runway, she possessed the crowd.</p><p>But put her in a room full of relatives, people who had a myriad of invisible connections with each other, who loved each other, felt obligation and fondness and duty to each other, and she was a sailboat in a storm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just warning you,\u201d she said, sliding her hands over his biceps, \u201cI\u2019m not good at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do it with me and Lexi and Jax and the other guys all the time.\u201d He threaded their fingers as they made their way up the stairs. \u201cWe\u2019re like family. Just think of this as meeting extended family.\u201d</p><p>Easier said than done. Especially for someone who didn\u2019t understand the concept of family. But for Wes, she smiled and nodded.</p><p>Approaching the house, Rubi realized the scene inside was even more chaotic than she\u2019d first suspected. There weren\u2019t just people in the kitchen and living room, but milling deeper in the house as well. And there were more children, more than just Wes\u2019s two nieces.</p><p>Anxiety sang over her nerves. For a reason she couldn\u2019t begin to understand, she flashed back to her life as a kid and all the turmoil with her father. Their millions of fights. Her dozens of nannies\u2014only a few of whom were ever good to Rubi.</p><p>At the door, Wes leaned forward and gripped the handle. But he paused, settled those beautiful gray eyes on Rubi. \u201cI\u2019ve got your back, okay? Just be yourself, baby. I know my family, and if I love you, they\u2019ll love you.\u201d</p><p>One of the kids inside squealed\u2014the pitch so high, the sound so loud, Rubi winced. A houseful of laughter followed, but that didn\u2019t settle Rubi\u2019s nerves. Wes opened the door and pushed it wide, his other hand settled on her lower back, ushering her into the house.</p><p>Panic gripped Rubi. Stepping over the threshold felt a hell of a lot like stepping off an emotional cliff. And she had the most surreal sensation of time slowing as she stood there on the polished hardwood floors, just where she\u2019d been earlier today.</p><p>The house slowly went eerily quiet as conversations stopped and all attention turned on them. Correction\u2014on her. She swore every person in the room gave her a slow sweep with their eyes, from the very tip of Rubi\u2019s head to the pointed heels of her pumps. She calculated most of the gazes filled with shock. Not exactly a surprise she didn\u2019t fit in.</p><p>Most of the guests were dressed down in jeans, T-shirts, and boots, including the women. One older man wore overalls. Overalls. Rubi didn\u2019t even know they made those anymore. The women kept their hair mostly one length, their faces mostly clean of makeup, their bodies bare of jewelry but a simple wedding band here and there.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t felt awkward over fitting in before, she sure as shit did now.</p><p>\u201cHey, Uncle John.\u201d Wes\u2019s voice seemed to kick-start time again, jolting Rubi out of her funk, and the room churned back into real-time speed again. Guests\u2019 gazes, ones that had seemed frozen, strayed back to their conversations and sound filled the space. Rubi felt like she\u2019d just come off some mind-altering drug.</p><p>He closed the door at her back, and, keeping one hand on her shoulder, he offered the other to his uncle standing near the door. \u201cGreat to see you.\u201d</p><p>The older man, silver-haired and attractive with those familiar crystal blue eyes, grinned. Rubi wanted to like his family, she really did. And despite Birdie calling her Missy, Rubi had found the woman kind. But there was a familiar look in the man\u2019s eyes as he surveyed Rubi that told her he wasn\u2019t a guy she\u2019d like.</p><p>\u201cThis is my girlfriend, Rubi.\u201d Wes\u2019s introduction was as casual and noncommittal as they came, but the label \u201cgirlfriend\u201d made her restless, as if the simple thought of being assigned to one man gave her the urge to escape.</p><p>\u201cWell, Wes,\u201d John said, offering his hand to Rubi. \u201cYou always snag the beauties, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Rubi didn\u2019t like the inappropriate dig at Wes which mentioned other women in front of his \u201cgirlfriend,\u201d and she didn\u2019t like the insinuation that she was no different from the other women in Wes\u2019s life\u2014but she smiled politely anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d he asked with a derogatory note in his voice.</p><p>She pulled her hand back and smiled. The worst thing she could do was let him rattle her. \u201cSome days it feels like Venus, but I live in Los Angeles. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKansas City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d Wes told him. \u201cTook off a few pounds?\u201d He gripped the man\u2019s bicep beneath a crewneck sweater. \u201cBeefing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat heart scare last year did the trick. But it\u2019s tough for me to get to the gym.\u201d The man\u2019s gaze slid toward Rubi, his mouth curved in more of a smirk than a smile. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like I get to play games and set my own schedule at work like Wes does, right? Some of us have responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>John laughed at his own joke with way too much satisfaction. Rubi\u2019s temper flared and Wes tensed beside her. His hand tightened, signaling an intent to move on. But she wasn\u2019t done here.</p><p>\u201cOr priorities. I know Wes works some long-ass days, but he\u2019s always at the gym at five a.m.\u201d Rubi gave John a smile designed to make his circuits blow. \u201cSo what do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d John said, his tone carrying an edge of my-work-is-more-important-that\u2019s-why-I-don\u2019t-get-to-the-gym. \u201cI have my own family practice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNice,\u201d Rubi said, feigning impression, then wrinkled her nose. \u201cI bet you have to be on call a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not much.\u201d He\u2019d done just what Rubi had expected\u2014contradicted himself in an effort to appear important. \u201cOne of the perks of having my own practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, right,\u201d she said, her voice thick with appreciation, giving him one last stroke before she pulled out the knife. \u201cOh, but, now wait.\u201d She tilted her head and pushed a casual lightness into her tone. \u201cYou have your own practice, but you don\u2019t set your own schedule?\u201d She chuckled at her upcoming joke, much the way John had laughed at his own. \u201cMan, that secretary really has you by the balls, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s grin fell. Confused indignation filled his eyes. And Rubi reveled in popping the man\u2019s inflated ego.</p> <p>She turned to Wes. \u201cYou really do have it good. Work hard and play hard all at the same time, loving every minute of it. And all when it suits you. The killer money doesn\u2019t hurt either.\u201d She leaned into him, slid both hands around his arm and stared up at him like a starstruck groupie. \u201cAnd you have me.\u201d</p><p>He had an I-know-what-you\u2019re-up-to quirk to his mouth. \u201cNo doubt. I wake up every morning thinking what a lucky bastard I am.\u201d</p><p>Just because she was having so much fun, Rubi lifted to her toes and kissed him, eyes open\u2014as were his\u2014sharing a silent message of we\u2019re in this together.</p><p>When she lowered, he pulled his arm from her grip and circled Rubi\u2019s shoulders, tugging her toward the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m going to introduce Rubi around, Uncle John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me do that?\u201d Both Wes and Rubi turned toward the voice.</p> <p>A middle-aged woman stood beside John. Hair a mix of blonde and gray, Rubi guessed she was in her late fifties. Her eyes were blue, and Rubi could see a lot of Wes\u2019s handsome face in this equally handsome woman\u2014the high cheekbones, the beautifully shaped mouth, her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Susie Lawson,\u201d she said, her smile warm and genuine. \u201cWes\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>Great. She\u2019d just sniped family in front of Wes\u2019s mother. Just another episode in Rubi\u2019s version of how not to win friends and influence people. But she had to admit, poking John\u2019s ego had alleviated her immediate panic and placed her in a \u201csafe\u201d\u2014or at least safer\u2014emotional zone.</p><p>She held out her hand to Susie. \u201cRubi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you refreshing?\u201d The woman\u2019s smile deepened with the same mischievous sparkle Rubi had often seen in Wes\u2019s gaze as it darted to meet her son\u2019s. A silent communication passed between them, one Rubi couldn\u2019t read. She led Rubi toward the kitchen. \u201cLet\u2019s see who else we can set straight tonight.\u201d</p><p>Rubi bit her bottom lip, then glanced down at Wes\u2019s petite mother. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Wes has said, but you should know I\u2019m really not good with the whole family thing.\u201d</p> <p>Wes\u2019s mother\u2019s gaze was filled with flash and humor as she patted Rubi\u2019s arm. \u201cOh, sweetheart, I think you may be more of a natural than you realize.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>Wes watched Rubi stroll away with his mother. He smiled as something shifted inside him. Something deep and warm and un-freaking-bearably sweet.</p><p>He\u2019d just fallen in love with the woman. All over again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s certainly gorgeous.\u201d His sister\u2019s voice drew his gaze. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about forgetting that\u2014or reminding anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Wes refocused on Whitney with some crazy-ass fizzy brew messing with his stomach. \u201cBut the best thing is\u201d\u2014he took the beer Whitney held out to him and met her gaze with a smile of fresh confidence\u2014\u201cshe\u2019s even more beautiful on the inside.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hide a flash of suspicion. \u201cSure you\u2019re not just blinded by love, bro? You\u2019ve always been a closet romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell her that. Romance freaks her out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d you convince her to come? I thought she said no way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d Wes said. \u201cThen changed her mind and just showed up today while I was at the VA with Wyatt.\u201d He glanced at Whit and shook his head. \u201cWhat a cluster that almost turned out to be.\u201d</p><p>He relayed the story about Melissa and the kiss.</p><p>\u201cAnd you still convinced her to stay? You must have a serious way with words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Way with words?\u201d He lifted the backs of his fingers to her forehead as if testing her temperature.</p><p>Whitney batted his hand away. \u201cTrue. I forgot who I was talking to.\u201d With her gaze on Rubi and his mom again, a sly grin edged her mouth up, and Whitney cut her gaze toward Wes with a slight lift of her chin. \u201cThis ought to be entertaining. Let\u2019s see if she can slice a few inches of those two.\u201d</p><p>Wes hoped it was entertaining in a good way. He\u2019d always believed Rubi could handle herself in any situation, but this new vulnerability around family was more than a little unnerving.</p><p>He and Whitney both took a drink from their bottles, watching as his mother introduced Rubi to his cousin Martin\u2014the I-made-partner-last-month-what\u2019s-new-with-you CPA, and his cousin Sam\u2014the check-out-my-latest-Mercedes attorney. Both men, about five years older than Wes, turned from their conversation and focused directly on Rubi with a deer-in-the-headlights sort of shock.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re frothing at the mouth,\u201d Whit said, her voice droll with disgust. \u201cNot a surprising start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive her a minute,\u201d Wes said. \u201cShe likes to make them feel comfortable before she plunges the knife.\u201d</p><p>Martin and Sam chatted easily with Rubi for a few moments. Wes caught a word or a phrase, but nothing more. Whitney must have been just as diligently struggling to hear the conversation, because she wrapped her fingers around his wrist and pulled him toward a snack table closer to the group. Wes kept his back that direction, facing Whitney as he speared a piece of salami with a toothpick.</p><p>\u201cRusso Industries is owned by my father,\u201d Rubi was saying, \u201cand even though he and I aren\u2019t close at all, he is all over that rig Wes built for Wyatt. It is a truly cutting-edge design, let me tell you. Dolph cherry-picks every project, and when he believes in a product, you can bet he\u2019s going to send that inventor into the stratosphere as a rising star. But I\u2019m having a hard time convincing Wes to entertain the idea. He\u2019s so focused on getting Wyatt back on his feet, selling the rig is the furthest thing from his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d Martin said with all his manufactured sophistication. \u201cWhat would something like that go for? Hypothetically, of course.\u201d</p><p>Rubi laughed. \u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t even fathom. There would be an initial purchase, then typically royalties based on the number of units sold. We\u2019re talking multimillions.\u201d</p><p>Wes was imagining the look on his cousins\u2019 pompous faces when Whitney spewed beer across his shirt. He jumped back. \u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He caught himself before he roared Fuck across the house, brushing at his now wet shirt. Whitney choked on a laugh, one hand covering her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She put up a hand to the observers. \u201cSorry. Wes just made me squirt beer from my nose laughing. Nothing new.\u201d</p><p>Wes glanced over his shoulder and caught Rubi\u2019s eye. The sparkle there sent the message that she knew he was listening and she was having fun.</p><p>When she turned away, Wes glanced down at his shirt, then back at Whitney. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>She took a step closer, her eyes watery from holding back laughter. \u201cYou should have seen their faces when she said millions. They both went as white as fish bellies.\u201d She pulled herself together, wiping at her eyes, then sobered suddenly and pinned him with a gaze that had a way of being so intense. \u201cWait, is that true?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a shoulder, glanced down at his beer. \u201cShe knows better than I do, and she knows her father\u2019s business. But she\u2019s the brilliant one, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot crazy at all,\u201d Rubi was saying. \u201cWes doesn\u2019t need the work, the money, or the fame. He\u2019s already at the top of the stunt game, getting the best, highest-paying jobs in the industry, working with the top stars. I mean, he got that black eye while he was out with Jason Bolton last week. He works side by side with Jax Chamberlin every day. Tom Cruise, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis, Vin Diesel, you name a big star, Wes knows them all. He taught freaking Angelina Jolie how to fall off a building and not kill herself.</p><p>\u201cReally, how much higher could he go in his chosen field? I mean, he\u2019s working the latest Bond movie now. And we all know only the best of the best are chosen for a Bond film,\u201d she said with authority. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s been asked to act on several occasions\u2014by Daniel Craig himself\u2014but Wes loves the thrill of the stunt more. I really admire that.\u201d</p><p>Whitney\u2019s big blue eyes lifted to Wes. \u201cFuuuuuck,\u201d she whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s good. Did you coach her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. That is all Rubi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s taking some creative license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure as hell wouldn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to think she\u2019s a fucking savant.\u201d</p><p>Whitney took another sip of beer, watching their mother steer Rubi away from the cousins, who both looked distraught and pissed.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Whit said, \u201chere\u2019s a good test.\u201d</p><p>Wes sent a sideways glance toward Rubi as she and his mother approached his father. \u201cMan,\u201d he said, \u201cshe\u2019s not wasting any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom likes her,\u201d Whit said, \u201cand believes she can hold her own with Dad, or she wouldn\u2019t introduce them so soon.\u201d</p><p>Wes grew a little nervous. Shifted on his feet. \u201cI can\u2019t hear.\u201d</p><p>Rubi shook his father\u2019s hand. He didn\u2019t smile\u2014he was a stoic kind of guy\u2014and then crossed his arms. Within thirty seconds, Rubi had their man-of-few-words father talking. Even gesturing.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Whitney said, her voice soft and filled with awe. \u201cHe\u2019s stringing sentences together. I haven\u2019t seen Dad talk that much since...since...I don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>A single surprised laugh popped from Wes\u2019s throat. \u201cFucking A,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got him talking about the crops.\u201d</p><p>Whitney gave him a what-the-fuck look. \u201cYou sure she\u2019s a city girl?\u201d</p><p>God, the woman floored Wes. It was always something new with her. \u201cI mentioned on the drive here that he was pissed about a problem with those new sensors he put in. It\u2019s probably a programming glitch; otherwise, I can\u2019t imagine how she got him talking.\u201d</p><p>Rubi and his dad were speaking freely now, back and forth. Then she said something that made Dad crack a grin. Then, miracle upon miracles, he laughed. Whitney\u2019s jaw dropped the same time as Wes\u2019s.</p><p>Their mother turned her head just enough to catch Wes\u2019s gaze\u2014as if she\u2019d known he\u2019d been watching the whole time\u2014and winked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s in,\u201d Whitney said, awed disbelief in her voice. \u201cHoly shit, she\u2019s fucking in.\u201d Whitney gripped Wes\u2019s arm, drawing his gaze from the conversation to find Whitney\u2019s eyes intense on him. \u201cI want to know how she did that. I\u2019m giving that trick to my next boyfriend before he meets Dad.\u201d</p><p>That hit Wes funny, and he laughed loud and long. Christ, he felt good. So damn happy. So relaxed. So...complete. He turned and glanced at Rubi and found her\u2014and his parents\u2014smiling at him.</p><p>When she ended the conversation and started toward Wes, he opened his arm at his side to circle her shoulders. Rubi walked right into the embrace\u2014no hesitation, no veil on that beautiful face. She was open, happy, and calm\u2014at least as far as he could tell.</p><p>Wes kissed Rubi\u2019s hair, then lifted his bottle toward his sister. \u201cThis is my sister, Whitney.\u201d</p> <p>Whitney shook Rubi\u2019s hand. \u201cThat\u2019s a record,\u201d Whitney said, tilting her head toward her father. \u201cYou had him melting in five-point-two minutes.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Rubi asked, \u201cHow long does it usually take?\u201d</p><p>Wes and Whitney exchanged a glance, grinned, and said, \u201cYears,\u201d at the same time.</p><p>That brought a round of laughter. \u201cWelcome, Rubi. You\u2019ve had a long day, so I\u2019ll catch up with you tomorrow.\u201d She set the beer down on the closest table and slapped Wes\u2019s arm. \u201cGood instincts, bro.\u201d</p><p>She wandered toward the kitchen, slipped behind the counter, and started cleaning up.</p> <p>Wes turned and circled Rubi\u2019s waist. \u201cImpressive wouldn\u2019t come close to describing what you just pulled off within twenty minutes of walking in the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExhausting might work.\u201d Her gaze lifted from his chest to his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I feel like I\u2019m going to fall over. And I\u2019m dying to lick that beer off your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart...\u201d Wes\u2019s mother approached and laid her hand on his back. Rubi bit the inside of her lip but couldn\u2019t completely hide the sexy grin. \u201cRubi\u2019s got to be tired after her day. Settle her in the guest room on the second floor, would you?\u201d</p><p>His gaze searched Rubi\u2019s, but he couldn\u2019t read it. \u201cMama, I think Rubi might be more comfortable\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds blissful,\u201d Rubi said to his mother. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d His mother leaned in and gave Rubi an intimate hug. Then turned to Wes with a familiar I-mean-business glance. \u201cYou\u2019re in Wyatt\u2019s old room, son.\u201d</p> <p>Wes did the only thing he could. He nodded with a soft \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s sweet, reverent words kept playing in Rubi\u2019s head. And kept her smiling.</p><p>She lay in the comfy queen bed, surrounded by down pillows, down blankets, and colorful quilts, staring at the ceiling in the dim light cast from the private bathroom. She was overwhelmed by the complex day. She\u2019d gone from nonstop invasions of privacy in LA to a cocoon of safety in Missouri\u2014if not exactly tranquility. Downstairs, things had quieted. The kids had been the first to disappear, then slowly the multiple voices.</p><p>In the quiet, without the ocean waves to soothe her, thoughts overwhelmed her mind, emotions swamped her heart. She was truly exhausted but far too wound up to sleep.</p><p>She\u2019d had different ideas for unwinding tonight, and they hadn\u2019t included being alone in bed. That little quickie in the car hadn\u2019t been near enough to satisfy her. She was beginning to feel like a nymphomaniac. She\u2019d always walked away from other men satisfied with one fuck. But with Wes, the more she got, the more she wanted.</p><p>Rubi picked up her phone on the nightstand and texted Desiree.</p><p>RUBI: Can you put in another offer on Dolph\u2019s house?</p> <p>After a couple of minutes her phone vibrated:</p><p>DESIREE: Of course. Same amount as the last offer?</p><p>Rubi chewed on her thumbnail a moment.</p><p>RUBI: Up it half a million. But that taps me out.</p><p>DESIREE: Done.</p><p>She rolled to her side and cuddled a pillow close to the front of her body. Nothing would come of the offer, she was sure. But Wes was right; she couldn\u2019t win if she didn\u2019t play. Maybe Dolph would mix up the offers, and Rubi would get it by accident.</p><p>A click sounded, and Rubi glanced at the door. Wes slipped into the room\u2014all clandestine and half-naked. Rubi propped herself up on her elbow and took in every last inch of skin above the waistband of his cargo shorts. \u201cThere is a God.\u201d</p><p>Wes grinned at her with a finger to his mouth, silently shushing her. Took one more glance down the hall and closed the door quietly. He turned toward the bed. \u201cAll the relatives are finally gone,\u201d he said, his voice a whisper. \u201cKitchen\u2019s clean. Whitney took the girls home to Tori and was going to check to see how Wyatt is settling in.\u201d He lifted a knee to the bed, leaned forward, and braced his hands beside her, then bent his elbows to lower himself until his lips barely touched Rubi\u2019s in a tender, lingering kiss. \u201cAnd Mom and Dad went to bed\u2014right after issuing a stern \u2018Stay in your own room, Wesley.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Rubi laughed and lifted her hand to stroke his cheek. \u201cSounds like they expected you to buck the system. My very own rebel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be anything you want...as long as I\u2019m yours.\u201d Grinning, he slid onto the bed, lying on his side, mirroring Rubi. \u201cYou impressed the hell out of my entire family\u2014even the hard-to-impress. I have to know, what were you talking to my dad about? He\u2019s usually a pretty stoic guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to help him get his sensor software back online tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s gaze glittered with a strange mix of emotions that lifted Rubi to the ceiling. Maybe a little awe? A little pride? A little joy? \u201cCrap. You can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly boy.\u201d Rubi scraped her fingers into his hair and stretched her neck to kiss him again. \u201cI have all kinds of tricks up my sleeve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did sensors come up, of all things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom. She suggested that I might be able to help him with some problem in the fields. I told them that the extent of my agriculture knowledge was my weekly stroll down the produce aisle at the grocery store. But then he told me about the sensors he\u2019s installed that monitor the soil.</p><p>\u201cAfter he explained how they worked, I knew I could help. The software is open source, free, and written in C. Coding at this level is just a matter of copying and pasting existing code to create what he really needs. Tomorrow, he\u2019s going to watch me add pieces to monitor other things\u2014soil temperature, ammonia levels, moisture levels, and barometric pressure. Then if he wants to add something more later or change the sensors for each crop, he\u2019ll be able to do it himself. It will save him thousands of dollars every year in water and fertilizer and crop yield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Wes went all drama queen and fell back on the bed, staring at the ceiling, his voice one of the-world-as-we-know-it-is-over. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be his new favorite. That\u2019s so wrong. I\u2019ve been vying for that spot for almost thirty years, and you tango right in and steal it out from under me. Or, well, actually Wyatt.\u201d He turned his head and pointed at her. \u201cBut I was getting close to nudging him out.\u201d</p><p>She shifted closer, sliding one thigh over his, pressing one hand flat low on his belly and sliding upward, feeling all the supple muscle, indentations, and planes of his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s kinda cool. I\u2019ve never been anyone\u2019s favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you have.\u201d His gaze darted to hers as he grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re my favorite.\u201d</p><p>Wes gripped her waist and flipped her in bed. Rubi squealed and laughed. Wes covered her mouth and cut a glance toward the door. \u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>When he lifted his hand from her mouth, she sobered and curled her fingers into the waistband of his shorts. \u201cWhy am I your favorite?\u201d She tried to push back the insecurity brimming, but it overflowed into her voice. \u201cI mean, really, Wes. I get the impression you\u2019ve been choosing women like Melissa all your life. So...why me? Why now? A fling until you move on to your next good girl? If it is, it is,\u201d she said as if it wouldn\u2019t matter. As if it wouldn\u2019t jab a dagger in her heart. \u201cI\u2019m just kinda out on a limb here and would like to know what to be prepared for.\u201d</p><p>His expression sobered, and something came over his gaze\u2014something tender and deep and so very loving. He shifted off her body and lay next to her, head propped on his hand. His other hand slipped beneath the T-shirt she\u2019d put on for bed, and he spread his fingers wide over her belly. With his palm centered over her belly button, his fingertips brushed her rib cage.</p><p>\u201cThat night I saw you at the airport...something clicked for me,\u201d he said, voice soft with a hint of vulnerability. \u201cI didn\u2019t know exactly what, but I knew the relationship I was in with Kayla didn\u2019t have what I needed. She was...is...a beautiful person. A beautiful woman. I just needed something different and knew it would have been selfish for me to stay with her while I was trying to figure that out.\u201d</p><p>His gaze followed his hand as he caressed her stomach, then occasionally darted up to meet her eyes. \u201cYou had such a vibrancy about you that night. The Ferrari. Your flirty outgoing personality. Your friendship with Lexi. It just all kinda...I don\u2019t know...hit me. I didn\u2019t think it then, in that moment, but after I broke up with Kayla and gave it some thought, I knew that\u2019s what I wanted in a woman. What I\u2019d been missing in a woman.\u201d</p><p>Rubi lay quietly, listening. Every beat of her heart felt impossibly hard and deep. And a shiver of anxiety sizzled over her nerve endings. She\u2019d never been this intimate with a man. A strange thought considering how many she\u2019d given her body to. But this was different. So different. This was intimate in an emotionally risky way, and a coil of heat and cold mixed in her belly.</p><p>\u201cWhen Jax told me about Lexi, God, I thought he was out of his ever-loving mind.\u201d Wes\u2019s eye roll made Rubi laugh softly. It diffused some tension. \u201cThen I met her and...shit...she was everything Jax ever wanted all wrapped up in one woman. And for the first time in my life, I thought, why can\u2019t I have that too? You know, everything I\u2019ve ever fantasized about in one woman? And then...you were back. In my life every day. And I got to see what you were really made of. Honestly, I was blown away. I expected you to be just another beautiful Hollywood brat. I expected to tolerate you because you were Lexi\u2019s best friend.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand from her stomach, cupped her jaw, and turned her face toward his. \u201cAnd before I knew what happened, you\u2019d turned into my best friend. After a couple of weeks, I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere or do anything unless you were going to be there. For another couple of weeks, I spent every moment with you looking for some major problem, something to turn me off so I could get over what I thought was an infatuation and start looking for the right woman instead of focusing on someone who wasn\u2019t right for me at all.</p><p>\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t, because the fact is that you are to me what Lexi is to Jax\u2014everything I\u2019ve always hope for and dreamed of all in one mind-blowing package. And that\u2019s when I realized that I\u2019d been choosing the wrong type of women all my damned life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rubi tried to hold her emotions down, but her gut felt tight, like a growing fireball had lodged beneath her belly button. Her eyes watered and her throat thickened. She struggled to internalize the words\u2014not believing. Not trusting. No one had ever seen her this way. Many men had seen her as a toy, had looked at her with lust. But even Wes\u2019s most heated gaze always held deep affection\u2014which was what had kept her at arm\u2019s length so long.</p><p>The whirlwind of emotions embarrassed her until her face, neck, and chest felt as if they were on fire. She wanted to look into his eyes for the answer to her next question but couldn\u2019t stand the intensity of the connection and lowered her lashes as she glanced down at his chest. \u201cWomen like Melissa.\u201d</p><p>Wes didn\u2019t immediately answer. He reached up and stroked a hand over her hair. \u201cI grew up with strict, God-fearing parents in a small Southern town, Rubi. Every moment of every day, I was being molded into a socially acceptable Southern boy\u2014whether that was by my parents, my teacher, or the storekeeper on the corner. You can probably already see that I\u2019ve had a habit of either falling a little short of that standard or simply veering off on my own path. By Hollywood standards, I\u2019m as vanilla as they come. But by Missouri standards, I was trouble waiting for the wrong place at the wrong time.</p><p>\u201cBut I love my parents. I love my sister and my brother. And I\u2019m the middle child\u2014a peacemaker. So I found small ways to stay within the boundaries to make a portion of the population\u2014and more importantly, my parents\u2014happy. That involved choosing acceptable women to date.</p> <p>\u201cMelissa\u2019s father had been a bit of a rebel in his younger days as well and saw it as a benefit, not a curse. Melissa and I dated from our sophomore year in high school through my junior year of college. I\u2014obviously\u2014never quite broke out of that mindset for how I chose my girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>Rubi waited, a million questions swirling in her head, in her heart. She knew she wasn\u2019t up to either asking most of them or receiving the answers. But she really did need one answer now; otherwise, her mind would churn and churn and she\u2019d never get to sleep. \u201cAnd why did you two break up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted me to be someone I wasn\u2019t.\u201d His answer came so quickly, with such surety and conviction, Rubi tensed, trying to take in the information. \u201cAfter graduation, she and her father wanted me to join her father\u2019s engineering firm. Her father generously offered to put me on a track to make partner in several years. But the thought made me claustrophobic. I couldn\u2019t imagine living in a gray cubicle for the next thirty years.\u201d</p><p>Rubi winced. Wes in a cubicle? He\u2019d have been happier in prison.</p><p>\u201cWhen I declined,\u201d he said, \u201cMelissa broke off our engagement.\u201d</p> <p>Rubi gasped and glanced up. \u201cEngagement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were going to get married after we graduated. But I wasn\u2019t willing to fulfill her image of who I should be. And without that position with her father\u2019s firm, I didn\u2019t amount to someone she believed could support her financially. At least not the way she\u2019d been supported all her life.\u201d</p><p>Rubi read the darkness of his gaze, the hurt pulling his mouth. And their argument at Dolph\u2019s office echoed in her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking millions. Many millions. I\u2019m talking about you being able to buy houses like Jax\u2019s any time you wanted. I\u2019m talking about never worrying about money for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d But his voice still held some element of darkness. \u201cI\u2019m only telling you all this so you can understand\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d She lifted her gaze to his again, reached up, and covered his hand. \u201cWes, what I said about the rig, about selling it, that wasn\u2019t because I wanted you to be someone different. It was because I want you to always be able to do just what you\u2019re doing. To be able to be just as happy and complete as you are now. I\u2019m worried about you being able to do what you love if something unfortunate happened and you couldn\u2019t physically do the stunts. Selling the rig only gives you the money to ensure you\u2019ll have that opportunity.\u201d</p><p>He fingered back a piece of hair on her forehead, his gaze a little distant but soft. \u201cYou really don\u2019t care if I can buy houses like Jax\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed the word, but it was filled with pain and regret. \u201cIt makes absolutely no difference to me. I\u2019ve always had money, Wes, but I\u2019ve never had the more important things that money took from me. I\u2019d give up everything I had then, everything I have now for a childhood\u2014and a family\u2014like yours.\u201d</p><p>His lids closed, and he leaned his forehead against hers. \u201cI know it kinda freaks you out, but...fuck...I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Rubi winced at the sting of fear. But at the same time, her heart was doing somersaults. The clash felt excruciating. \u201cWes...\u201d</p><p>He exhaled loudly. \u201cI know. Dammit, I\u2019m sorry. I just...you just... Fuck it.\u201d He hooked his arm around her waist and pulled a pillow underneath his head. \u201cI\u2019d better go to sleep before I get myself in any more trouble.\u201d</p><p>Rubi slid her hand up his arm and over his shoulder. \u201cSleep isn\u2019t what I had in mind. Trouble was.\u201d</p><p>A smile curved his mouth, but he covered her hand with his and pulled it between them, then threaded her fingers. He laid his chin on the top of her head and pulled her close, until their chests and bellies pressed, until his thick, muscled legs were tangled with hers. \u201cClose your eyes, precious. I want to fall asleep with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head down for a quick kiss. \u201cTry it and see. And if you\u2019re a really good girl, I might wake you up sometime tonight in a very creative way.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>Rubi stretched awake without opening her eyes. She rolled under the covers and pulled a pillow to her chest, sighing with comfort. She felt cocooned. Warm and safe and happy. Her mind drifted toward her day ahead. She needed to check e-mail. Contact a couple of different clients to help her decide which project to start on next. She wanted to go for a run. Maybe she\u2019d do that first thing. The beach was always beautiful and quiet in the morning\u2014</p><p>Muffled laughter sounded somewhere nearby. A split second of alarm flashed through her before she opened her eyes\u2014and recognized nothing. Which then pumped a much longer, much stronger flash of panic through her. She pushed up in bed at the same instant her location and situation registered.</p><p>Wes. Missouri.</p><p>Panic seeped through her chest.</p><p>Rolling toward the nightstand, she picked up her phone. Checking her messages, she found two pictures of Rodie from the sitter and one text from Wes.</p><p>WES: Good morning, beautiful.</p><p>Rubi smiled. A sliver of her sudden panic ebbed. After all, she did have the hottest Renegade of them all under the same roof. And he had followed through on his promise of waking her in the middle of the night in a creative way. She warmed at the thought, and aches she hadn\u2019t been aware of upon waking snuck in.</p><p>She clicked into the other messages and looked at pictures of Rodie\u2014passed out in his dog bed, his favorite toy nearby. Playing tug-of-war with his buddy, Titan, a Golden Retriever.</p><p>Her heart tugged.</p><p>The door inched open, followed by Wes, holding a cup of coffee in one hand and what looked like a yogurt parfait in the other. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>He was barefoot, wearing jeans and a T-shirt. It was really a sin how good he looked in the simple clothes. And how amazing it was to have his handsome face greet her first thing in the morning. \u201cI was hoping you were awake.\u201d</p><p>Rubi sat up, set her phone aside, and ran both hands through her hair, pulling it off her face. She smiled and took the coffee he held out with a gratitude-filled \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip, closed her eyes and settled. It was just the way she liked it\u2014hazelnut creamer and plenty of sugar. She hummed in pleasure. And she was touched he would remember how she liked her coffee from the few times she\u2019d gone to the set early to watch crash stunts. \u201cYou\u2019re a god.\u201d</p><p>When she opened her eyes, he was grinning\u2014a soft smile filled with his \u201cI love you\u201d from the night before shining in those pretty eyes. \u201cChrist, you\u2019re even more beautiful in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking the same thing about you.\u201d As soon as she said it, she wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d meant matching that look in his eye or what a beautiful man he was\u2014even more so on the inside, which was saying a lot considering his outer wrapping was utterly sinful.</p><p>He offered her a clear plastic cup layered with colorful alternating stripes of yogurt and fruit. \u201cYour typical breakfast. Or we can go out. Or I can cook you what I cooked everyone else\u2014eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, taters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaters.\u201d She laughed at the word and reached for the parfait as she set her coffee down. \u201cYou cook too? My God, you might just be the perfect man, Lawson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I care about is being perfect for you.\u201d He sat on the bed facing her, one leg bent under him. \u201cOh my God.\u201d He clasped her jaw and turned her face toward him. His gaze scanned her face with an expression she couldn\u2019t quite read. \u201cYou have freckles?\u201d The tension seemed to leave his body, followed by a pained \u201cFuck, that is just too adorable.\u201d</p><p>Then his lips kissed a path from one cheek to the other across her nose.</p><p>A fist squeezed her heart, pumping unexpected emotions deep into her body. She\u2019d showered before she\u2019d fallen into bed the night before, and scrubbed her face clean. She\u2019d never been self-conscious in or out of makeup, but she realized this was the first time he\u2019d seen her without any. Heat expanded in her chest until she ached. She had the nearly uncontrollable need to lay her head on his shoulder and curl into his lap. None of which she understood.</p><p>She tilted her head and kissed his lips. It was sweet and slow and only intensified the unbearable pressure in her chest now pushing tears to her eyes. Sweet tears.</p><p>She pulled out of the kiss and looked down at her breakfast, blinking the sting away. \u201cMango?\u201d The cup was topped with a layer of granola beneath bright blueberries, strawberries, and mango pieces. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was your favorite. You always got the one with mangos from the breakfast cart on the set. You can take it off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is my favorite. I just...didn\u2019t know you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know.\u201d He pressed a kiss to her temple. \u201cAlong with your favorite coffee, your favorite appetizer, your favorite entr\u00e9e, and your favorite dessert. I thought I knew your favorite drink too, until that whole Sexy Bitch thing threw me for a loop. Hell, I even know your favorite color.\u201d</p><p>The sting in her eyes was back, and her throat felt thick. Trying to ignore the discomfort, she scooped up a spoonful of yogurt, fruit, and granola, her brows drawing together. \u201cMy favorite color? I don\u2019t even think I know my favorite color.\u201d She thought of the clothes hanging in her closet and frowned up at him with a confused smirk. \u201cBlack?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPurple.\u201d He tapped her nose. \u201cRemember it. I\u2019ll quiz you later.\u201d</p><p>She slipped a spoonful of yogurt and fruit in her mouth, her mind filled with Purple? Really? and the combinations of flavors burst\u2014sweet and refreshing, the perfect way to start a day.</p><p>\u201cOh man,\u201d she murmured, then swallowed before she said, \u201cVanilla yogurt too? You are a god.\u201d</p><p>He ran the back of his finger along the top of her thigh. \u201cI thought we\u2019d do something fun this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said around another mouthful, holding up her spoon to pause him while she finished her bite. \u201cI told your dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told my dad I get you first. He has to wait until this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips and smiled before dipping into her breakfast again. \u201cHow did that go over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went to the barn to pout.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHe was so excited about getting those sensors working.\u201d She turned the spoon over and licked yogurt from the curved surface with a slow stroke of her tongue while watching Wes. \u201cWhat are you interested in working on this morning, Mr. Lawson?\u201d</p> <p>With his hand on her thigh, he leaned in and kissed her lips, her cheek, her jaw, and continued down her neck.</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d she hummed. \u201cLet me smear some of this yogurt on you. Breakfast will become a double pleasure.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved against her skin. He planted one more kiss to her shoulder, pushed off the bed, and started for the door. \u201cNope. We\u2019ve got places to go. Change into jeans and tennis shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRusso fashion faux pas, Lawson. Not going to happ\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned back, brows raised in taunting invitation. \u201cBeautiful day for sightseeing from the back of a motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>Excitement sparked deep in her chest. She gasped, straightened, and set down her parfait. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready in ten minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThought that might perk you up,\u201d he said as he closed the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Rubi jumped out of bed, rummaged through her suitcase, and pulled out the only jeans she\u2019d brought\u2014the capris Wes had loved on her at the set last week. She added her running shoes, vowing to make him pay for forcing her to wear them together, and tugged on a workout tank\u2014the closest thing to a T-shirt she\u2019d brought.</p><p>She brushed her hair, wound it into a ponytail and rubbed sunscreen on her face. With her parfait in one hand and her coffee in the other, she skipped down the stairs but pulled up short in the kitchen where she found his mother, his sister, and his two nieces. Wes was at the sink...doing dishes?</p><p>Okay, reality check. This was bizarre.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you sleep, Rubi?\u201d Susie asked with a sunny smile.</p><p>\u201cWonderful, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome meet my granddaughters.\u201d</p><p>Ugh, really? But she went to the table where one of the girls tilted her face up until her bright blue eyes met Rubi\u2019s. The fork in her hand was stacked with pancake, the syrup dripping onto her plate. The other, the one who looked a little older, only stared at the table.</p> <p>\u201cThis is Abby,\u201d Susie said, gesturing to the smaller one, then to the other, \u201cand Emma. This is Rubi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Wes\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d Abby said before stuffing her mouth with pancake.</p><p>Rubi smiled. \u201cHi, Abby. Hi, Emma.\u201d</p><p>The older girl didn\u2019t look up or say anything but turned her head toward Rubi. They were cute, no doubt. And terrifying. Rubi\u2019s excitement over the ride turned into something more like desperation.</p><p>Wes turned off the faucet and sauntered over, wiping his hands on a kitchen towel. \u201cDon\u2019t push it, Abby. I know what you\u2019re up to little lady.\u201d</p><p>Abby grinned, showing a mischievous, gap-toothed little grin that made her blue eyes sparkle just like Wes\u2019s. And Christ, that did insanely uncomfortable things to Rubi\u2019s stomach. Like...nauseating things.</p><p>She smiled up at Wes. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you two going?\u201d Whitney asked. She was dressed in business casual, black pants, and a pretty camel-colored shell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking Rubi sightseeing.\u201d</p><p>Whitney snorted a laugh and set her coffee mug down. \u201cWhere? And in what? Wyatt\u2019s old truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, dork,\u201d Wes said, \u201cwhere do you think? And no, on Wyatt\u2019s underused bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think dork is a bad word,\u201d Abby said, then looked at Susie. \u201cIsn\u2019t dork a bad word, Grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cSo it\u2019s really more of an-excuse-to-ride type of sightseeing tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it what you want.\u201d</p><p>Whitney shot Rubi a poor-you smirk. \u201cHope you like vegetation, Rubi. You\u2019ll get some really up-close-and-personal glances at trees, soybean fields, vineyards, maybe even the muddy Missouri River.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no way to talk about your birthplace,\u201d Wes chided. \u201cBesides, everything is turning. We hit the fall colors perfectly. It couldn\u2019t get prettier out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve definitely been living in LA too long if you\u2019ve forgotten how much you hated fall when you had to rake all those \u2018pretty\u2019 leaves.\u201d Whitney rose from the table and carried her coffee mug to the sink. \u201cRubi, you\u2019re going to have a headache if you ride with your hair up.\u201d She walked toward her. \u201cTurn around, I\u2019ll French braid it for you.\u201d</p><p>Um... Rubi shot glances around the room, then turned her back to Whitney. She quickly pulled the elastic band from Rubi\u2019s hair and combed her fingers through it. \u201cOh my God, what a luxurious head of hair. I bet other women hate you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost women hate me for just about everything,\u201d Rubi said without thinking how the comment would be taken until it was already out.</p><p>Whitney laughed softly, a sound conveying more understanding than humor. \u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Okay, this was...strangely intimate. Like a high school best-friend kind of intimate. She didn\u2019t know the woman at all, yet Rubi felt close to her. She knew some relationships were like that\u2014they just clicked. Like she and Lexi had all those years ago. Like she and Wes had the night at the airport. But it was rare for Rubi, so it made her feel...awkward.</p><p>But by the time all that registered, Whitney was done, fastening the band at the tail of her braid between her shoulder blades. \u201cThere you go\u2014much more comfortable under a helmet.\u201d</p><p>Rubi ran a hand over the braid. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d She shot Rubi another grin and started for the front door. \u201cY\u2019all enjoy all those pretty trees, now.\u201d</p><p>Wes moved around the table and kissed Abby on the head, then Emma. \u201cHave fun with Grandma, girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, Uncle Wes.\u201d This came from Emma, soft and without ever meeting Wes\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, Emmie.\u201d He put a hand on Rubi\u2019s shoulder and led her the same direction Whitney had gone. \u201cBye, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cRubi can\u2019t ride in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give her my jacket,\u201d Wes said.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, Wes, it will swallow her.\u201d She pulled a black leather jacket off the back of her chair and walked it to Rubi with a smirk and a teasingly disgusted \u201cMen.\u201d</p><p>Rubi took the jacket. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d she said, standing at the door as they trotted down the steps and turned toward the garage. \u201cBe safe, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Wes called back.</p><p>The door to one of the bays in the three-car garage was already open, and Wes walked toward a sleek silver BMW.</p><p>\u201cYum,\u201d she said with enthusiasm.</p><p>Wes barked a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s a new one. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve ridden before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a really long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s grin widened. He took the jacket and held it open for her. Once she\u2019d zipped it up, he pulled two helmets from a shelf and handed her one. \u201cI tricked these helmets out with an intercom system\u2014the same one I use at work\u2014and stereo speakers. So you just talk, and I\u2019ll hear you.\u201d</p><p>She slipped the helmet on, and Wes made sure it was secure. He pulled a jacket from the wall, a snazzy short-waisted riding leather, much like the one Jax owned and Lexi had coveted on their first pseudo meeting. After pulling it on, he straddled the bike and patted the seat behind him.</p><p>Once she was settled, he pointed toward the rear wheel. \u201cThis is your footrest. Your arms go around me. Your body up against mine.\u201d He grinned. \u201cLike, real close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to make me hot, Lawson? \u2019Cause it\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked, and his eyes grew warm. \u201cRelax and let your body follow mine. Just like you did last night. That was perfection.\u201d</p><p>She slid her arms around his waist and squeezed. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>Rubi was in heaven.</p><p>She pressed her body against Wes\u2019s back as he expertly guided the bike along the curving back roads. The roads overlooked vineyard after gorgeous vineyard all alight in golds and reds. His deep, smooth voice filled her ears as he pointed out different areas that held significance\u2014every vineyard he\u2019d harvested as a kid, every home of a high school buddy, every tiny lake hidden among the trees.</p><p>The sun was warm, the air thick and cool, the bike comfortable and fast, the trees absolutely brilliant shades of gold, orange, red, and green. She felt incredibly free, all her worries tucked far away. All but one\u2014the realization that she was falling for Wes. Big-time.</p><p>She pushed the thought back into the shadows, just as she had for over a week now, and enjoyed the truly beautiful countryside. Wes took the tightest curves and corners with every ounce of his stunt-driving flare and Rubi enjoyed the fresh jolts of adrenaline. He\u2019d cued a mix of Rubi\u2019s favorite alternative rock\u2014Fall Out Boy, Nickelback, Three Doors Down, Theory of a Deadman\u2014and the invigorating music poured through the helmet, dimming only when she or Wes spoke into the intercom. Pretty damn slick.</p><p>She was beginning to realize that Wes Lawson was a freaking mechanical genius, and selling his rig for big bucks, setting him up financially for his future\u2014if not for the rest of his life\u2014had become increasingly important to Rubi. Good people deserved good things in life. She\u2019d seen far too many people like her father gather all the wealth.</p><p>\u201cThese colors make me wish I was a photographer,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe soil is so rich, everything grows here,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s silver maple, elm, mulberry, hickory, sumac, honey locust. The purple on your right are dogwoods and ash. There\u2019s more than I could even name.\u201d</p><p>They edged into thicker stands of trees, and the vineyards and farming fields slowly disappeared until only trees bordered the roadside.</p><p>Wes slowed and turned onto a gravel road that led into the colorful forest.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMy secret hideaway.\u201d His voice holding exaggerated mystery.</p><p>They wound in and around curves. The road turned to dirt and the elevation dropped once again as they started down the other side of a ridge. \u201cSecret\u2019s right. How\u2019d you ever find it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust like this, driving around for the fun of driving.\u201d</p><p>The trees finally opened, parting to expose a small body of water with a grassy shoreline. The big trees overhung the tranquil spot, shading the shore while sunlight shone directly on the pool. It was, quite simply, one of the most beautiful places she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Wes parked the bike, shut off the engine, and pulled off his helmet, then turned to help Rubi remove hers. She gazed out over the clear water fed by a creek, small rocks and bigger boulders worn away by time and creating mini waterfalls.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Wes.\u201d She didn\u2019t know why she was whispering. But after having Nickelback screaming in her ear, priming her for hot and dirty sex, this was not what she\u2019d been prepared for. \u201cThis is amazing.\u201d</p> <p>He gazed out over the sight for a long moment, seeming to take it all in. The absolute lack of man-made sound created a blissful tranquility of trees rustling, birds singing, creek gurgling. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his mouth turning slightly but his expression melancholy. \u201cI love this place.\u201d</p><p>Rubi swung her leg over the back and slid off the bike. Wes followed. He opened a side compartment and pulled out towels, a blanket, and a couple of Ziploc bags of food. She grinned. \u201cOkay, now I get it. You\u2019re fulfilling an outdoor-sex fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Wes set everything down in a smooth, grassy area. \u201cBaby, all sex with you is a fantasy come true\u2014indoors or out.\u201d</p><p>He spread out the blanket, dropped the towels, then turned toward the water and peeled off his jacket.</p><p>She wandered up beside him as he sat down and pulled off his boots. He patted the blanket beside him and lay back, hands behind his head. \u201cLie down. It\u2019s really cool to look up into the trees. If I do it long enough, I feel like I\u2019m floating.\u201d</p> <p>Rubi took off her jacket and lay down next to him, a towel for a pillow. Overhead, reds, oranges, and yellows burst from the trees like flame. All against a crisp blue sky. \u201cGod, that\u2019s...impossibly beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Wes said nothing, and silence stretched and deepened until Rubi imagined the quiet reached into her body, releasing all her tension. But she found the lack of tension, of stress, of worries...the sheer comfort, tranquility, and happiness swamping her so foreign, it created a stress of its own.</p><p>\u201cIs this where you brought your girlfriends to get lucky?\u201d she asked playfully. \u201cSomewhere you could go while you were living at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His answer was mellow, so completely calm. \u201cI\u2019ve never brought anyone here. Not even Wyatt or high school football buddies. My parents don\u2019t know this exists. Melissa doesn\u2019t know this exists. I always came alone. It\u2019s always been my very own. This is where I came to think problems through, to chill before a big race, to let my temper cool off after a fight.\u201d</p><p>Rubi rolled to her side and propped her head in her hand. Wes kept his gaze skyward. His eyes were more blue than gray, as if the sky was reflected in his irises. Outlined by thick gold lashes. Her chest squeezed hard.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be in love with him. The mere thought kicked off a panic attack. Yet another part of her couldn\u2019t deny the emotions twisting her inside out. Emotions that rushed in without warning and took over until everything she\u2019d ever known was upside down and backward.</p> <p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you bring me here?\u201d she asked, her voice barely a whisper.</p><p>He hesitated, a slight furrow appearing between his eyes. \u201cI wanted to share something with you that I\u2019ve never shared with anyone. I wanted you to have this piece of me I can give only you.\u201d</p><p>Her throat thickened, tightened until she had to force herself to swallow. \u201cThat\u2019s...\u201d How could she possibly explain how she felt when even she didn\u2019t understand? \u201cThat...\u201d</p><p>His head turned slowly, and his gaze locked on hers, intense and meaningful. \u201cScares you.\u201d</p><p>A breath of laughter escaped. Tense, shaky laughter. And with it, tears that rolled over her bottom lashes. Tears she hadn\u2019t realized were coming. Rubi closed her eyes and nodded, wiping at her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just...not wired right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Wes stretched out his arm, and she went to him with the same unabashed need as Rodie showed her. She laid her head on his chest, pressed her face into the warm muscle of his pec, and breathed him in. Burrowed closer. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to just have sex.\u201d</p><p>His laugh rolled through his chest, shaking Rubi, and laughter bubbled out of her too. He wrapped both arms around her, pulling her close. And then just held her.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t disappear, baby,\u201d he said after a long silence. \u201cI won\u2019t open that trapdoor and let you fall.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to believe, but she\u2019d believed so many times in the past. Her mother, her father, her nannies, her friends, her early boyfriends\u2014they\u2019d all left her. Some repeatedly, after she\u2019d allowed them back into her life. Lexi was the only person who\u2019d ever stayed. The only person who truly understood her and loved her anyway. But hadn\u2019t Wes seen her worst sides? Stilettos. Her hatred for her father. Her pathetically superficial life. Yet...</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t mean to,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I\u2019m just...hard to love, I guess.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never thought about it like that before. Of course, she knew all her flaws, even if she\u2019d failed to improve on them. But...was she really so hard to love?</p><p>Wes rolled toward her, easing her onto her back and hovering over her. He lifted a thumb to wipe away the dampness on her cheeks and met her eyes steadily, seriously. \u201cYou are not the least bit difficult to love. In fact, you\u2019re so easy to love, I\u2019ve been fighting against it. The only hard part about being with you is fighting those walls.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI know. I fight them too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what.\u201d He smiled, the expression so soft, so loving, it pushed more tears from her eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s fight them together. They\u2019ll never have a chance.\u201d</p><p>She was laughing when he lowered his mouth to hers.</p><p>Wes felt like he was flying as he sped down the back roads toward Wyatt\u2019s house with Rubi leaning into him, holding him tight, her giggle tickling his ear every time he surprised her by speeding over a rise or leaning heavily into a turn.</p><p>She loved him; he knew she did. Beyond that, she was in love with him. He just needed to let her get used to it. He could wait to hear the words. When he and Rubi were as connected as they were now, he didn\u2019t need the words. Not really. At least that was what he was telling himself for now.</p><p>One day at a time with Rubi Russo. One day at a time.</p><p>And with days like this, he was okay with that. Because every day with Rubi was ten times more exhilarating than one day with anyone else.</p><p>She was the one.</p><p>He\u2019d realized it lying there on the blanket while she\u2019d been feeding him grapes and kissing him between each one. Grapes his mom had packed up the minute Wes had told her he was taking Rubi on a ride. Then, as she\u2019d packed drinks and chocolates, she\u2019d drifted off on a tangent, suggesting he set up a really nice picnic for her by stringing lights in the trees. Whitney hadn\u2019t helped with her input that Wes should bring his iPod and speaker so they could dance in their private retreat. The fact that they\u2019d liked Rubi enough to insist he make such an effort pleased him. But he knew Rubi better. She needed just the right balance of romance and nonchalance to keep her comfortable. Wes hadn\u2019t quite figured out the ratio yet and didn\u2019t need anything tipping the slow progress they were making toward becoming a solid, committed couple.</p><p>He turned off the highway to Daughtry\u2019s \u201cOn the Inside,\u201d singing about running to escape but failing because \u201cit\u2019s still just you on the inside,\u201d and wondering if that was what Rubi had been doing all these years. When he turned down Wyatt\u2019s street, his thoughts hit a brick wall. Across the street from Wyatt\u2019s house, Melissa stood beside her car.</p><p>Shit. Wes had purposely called Tori this morning to ask when Melissa would be gone before he brought Rubi over.</p><p>But as Wes neared, his mind flipped in another direction. A man stood between Melissa and her car. Her ex, Dillon Stark, was a big guy, a head taller than Melissa. His body language was both angry and aggressive, sending an immediate sizzle of alarm across his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that Melissa?\u201d Rubi\u2019s voice sounded soft in his ear.</p><p>He reached up, shutting the music off, and parked several houses down. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on there?\u201d</p><p>She sounded sincerely concerned, which gave Wes one more thing to love about her. Every other girlfriend had been jealous of something in Wes\u2019s life\u2014actresses he\u2019d worked with, the travel and long days his job required, his friendship with the other Renegades. Melissa was a truly beautiful woman in that wholesome, country-girl-next-door way that every one of his previous girlfriends would have taken issue with.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d He shut off the bike. \u201cHe\u2019s her recent ex-fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>He pulled off his helmet at the same time Rubi did.</p><p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>Wes shot her a sidelong grin. They both returned to watching the argument, waiting for either escalation or diffusion.</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d she whispered, concern in her tone. \u201cDo you think\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s words cut off with a gasp as the guy made an aggressive grab for Melissa\u2019s arm and shook her.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to get in the middle of this, but what the hell else could he do? Wes climbed off the bike without taking his eyes off the pair and handed his helmet to Rubi. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>He started toward them at a slow, casual pace, unzipping his jacket for freedom of movement\u2014something he hoped he wouldn\u2019t need. \u201cHey, Missy.\u201d He waited until Dillon\u2014a guy he and Melissa had gone to school with\u2014looked at Wes, then said, \u201cDillon. Long time.\u201d</p><p>A few deep breaths passed before Dillon\u2019s furious gaze swung back to Melissa. \u201cIs that what this is about? Him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing between us has anything to do with Wes.\u201d Melissa clenched her fists at her sides. Her face was pink and wet from crying. \u201cGet in your car and leave, Dillon. If you don\u2019t stop this, I\u2019ll call the police.\u201d</p><p>Wes stopped ten feet away, far enough to stay out of the middle, close enough to act.</p><p>Dillon swung toward Wes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t fuck her enough when you lived here?\u201d he said, taking two menacing steps toward Wes. \u201cYou have to come all the way from California to fuck her now too?\u201d</p><p>Wes clenched his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m here to see my brother. There\u2019s nothing going on between Missy and me.\u201d</p><p>With one more giant step closer, Dillon\u2019s voice lowered. \u201cThen stay the fuck out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you leave, I\u2019ll stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>Wes saw the punch in Dillon\u2019s expression long before the man\u2019s body ever moved. When his fist finally came at him, Wes pulled back and stepped aside. Dillon\u2019s momentum turned him in a one-eighty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on, Dillon, I don\u2019t want to fight.\u201d But Dillon was already starting for him again. Wes put his hands up as he backed off. \u201cJust go hit a bar and cool off.\u201d</p><p>Dillon lunged toward him, one big hand shoving Wes\u2019s chest. He went with the movement, keeping his feet under him, watching for the next shove. When it came, Wes grabbed his hand, twisted into the attack and slammed his other arm across Dillon\u2019s. The move joint-locked Dillon\u2019s elbow. His own forward momentum helped Wes whip the man off his feet. He followed Dillon to the ground, controlling him with the hand Wes still held tight. Dillon hit the pavement hard on his back. Wes dropped to one knee, his forearm holding pressure across Dillon\u2019s chest.</p><p>While Dillon choked for air, Wes searched for Melissa. She stood several feet away, hands covering her mouth, blue eyes as big as eggs. \u201cGo,\u201d Wes said, irritated. \u201cGet out of here. Go file a fucking restraining order against this asshole, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Missy.\u201d Now he was pissed. \u201cI\u2019m gonna let him up. Do you want to be here when I do that?\u201d</p><p>She fumbled with her keys and hurried to her car.</p><p>\u201cYou motherfucker, Lawson.\u201d Dillon\u2019s shock was burning off, air scraping into his lungs, his hands digging into Wes\u2019s to get free.</p><p>Wes added a knee to his gut. \u201cGive me thirty more seconds, dude.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Melissa\u2019s car turned the corner and sped out of sight, Wes found his feet and took a quick glance to make sure Rubi was well out of reach. Then he released Dillon and sprang back. Way back. He did not want to be anywhere within reach when the guy finally got to his feet.</p><p>But Dillon\u2019s movements were far slower than Wes had expected, giving him time to catch his own breath and regroup with a secondary strategy if Dillon decided to continue this confrontation.</p><p>\u201cWant me to call?\u201d Rubi asked from behind Wes, her tone as calm as when she\u2019d been lying on the grass, feeding him grapes. \u201cOr wait?\u201d</p><p>He knew she meant call the cops. And, damn, he really didn\u2019t need that kind of trouble. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Dillon got to his feet and pointed a menacing finger at Wes. \u201cYou\u2019d better hope I don\u2019t see you again, fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do, bro,\u201d Wes said, backing up, hands raised, sincere in his assurance. \u201cI hope you never see me again.\u201d</p><p>Dillon limped to his Jeep Laredo parked on the street behind where Melissa\u2019s had been, fired it up, and took off. Wes let out a long exhale and turned toward Rubi. She was standing beside the bike, her ass resting against the seat, arms crossed, her phone in one hand, and she had that grin she often had after she\u2019d watched him run a stunt.</p><p>He walked to her side, swung an arm around her shoulders, and started toward Wyatt\u2019s house. \u201cDoes anything faze you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking if your heroism turns me on, the answer is yes. I\u2019m totally hot for you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s see to Wyatt\u2019s rig and get back to the house where I can experience just how totally hot you are.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>Rubi leaned against Wes on the ride home. Wyatt had been sleeping\u2014for the first time since he\u2019d come home from the hospital, according to Tori. So Rubi asked Tori some questions and planned to make adjustments to the rig when they got back to the house. She also needed to work on Wes\u2019s father\u2019s project. But Wes had other ideas.</p><p>He turned onto the drive and stopped in front of the house. \u201cHot damn,\u201d he said, his voice low and urgent. \u201cNo one\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>He pulled off his helmet, slid off the bike, and plucked her from the seat even as she was still taking her own helmet off. As soon as it cleared her mouth, he kissed her. An openmouthed, hungry kiss that floated on a long, equally hungry moan. His hands were everywhere, sliding up and down her body, cupping her head to pull her into another deep kiss. His tongue stroked hers as he walked her toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get you naked...\u201d He tilted his head and kissed her hard. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to taste every inch of your body...\u201d He added his tongue and tasted her as he backed her up the stairs. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to make love to you until you beg me to stop.\u201d</p> <p>The words sizzled through her lower body. She was already wet, aching for him. \u201cI\u2019m all over that, Lawson.\u201d</p><p>He turned the knob behind her, pushed her inside, then shut it and nudged her toward the stairs to her bedroom. He smelled like leather and motorcycle and fresh air and Wes. The combination made Rubi\u2019s head float.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d she asked, still backing up the stairs with Wes\u2019s mouth on her neck, her heart beating hard, her pussy clenched with need.</p><p>\u201cDad had to go into St. Louis to see a vendor. Mom dropped Grams at the hairdresser and took the girls to a painting class in Washington. Whitney\u2019s at work. And you are all fucking mine.\u201d</p><p>His growl of ownership shot a pulse of lust straight between her legs and a jolt of something different, something hot and sweet, into her heart. She\u2019d been wanted by many men. But they\u2019d only wanted her body. They\u2019d wanted sex. She\u2019d neither offered more, nor chosen men who\u2019d wanted more. Because she\u2019d never wanted more either.</p><p>But she did now. She wanted more than sex with Wes. She didn\u2019t understand what. Didn\u2019t understand the craving gnawing at the inside of her belly. She only knew, somehow, she needed more. And she needed to make that happen right now.</p><p>They\u2019d hit the landing. Wes\u2019s hands greedily slid under her tank and cupped her breasts. Tingling heat scoured her skin, pleasure sinking deeper. Rubi moaned and leaned her head against his. \u201cHow do you know where everyone is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexts.\u201d He unclasped the front of her bra and pushed the fabric out of the way. Then bent and closed his mouth over one nipple, sucking hungrily. The skin over her breast tightened and pulled. A thick knot of need pulsed between her legs. \u201cOh my God.\u201d Rubi sank both hands into his hair. She loved the feel of it\u2014soft and thick and curving all around her fingers. Need coiled hot and fast in her belly. Spread to her pussy. \u201cWes...\u201d</p><p>They passed through the door of the bedroom, and he kicked it closed, then reached back and pushed the lock. Rubi released his hair to grab at his shirt, tearing it over his head. Then she ran her hands down his chest, his belly, and jerked at the button on his jeans. \u201cYou make me crazy.\u201d</p><p>His mouth covered hers again, and she opened, taking his tongue in. He tore his mouth away, breathing hard, and whipped off her tank, pushed off her bra and started working on her pants.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Her voice came out thin and frantic. \u201cHow can I want you more every damn time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s that good.\u201d</p><p>He pushed and tugged her jeans down her legs and was down to her panties while she was still struggling with his jeans. He closed his hands on her waist, lifted her off the floor. And tossed her on the bed. Rubi bounced with a shriek. Then started laughing. But Wes\u2019s mouth closed over hers, drowning the humor in passion.</p><p>She shoved at his jeans, but he grabbed her hands, sandwiched them in one of his and pushed them over her head.</p><p>\u201cI need some quality time with this body.\u201d He other hand searched the front pocket of his jeans and pulled out a green cord. \u201cWithout interruption.\u201d</p><p>Still holding her wrists, he held out his other hand and a small bungee cord dangled from his fingers. \u201cThink you can let go of control for a little while?\u201d</p><p>His tone challenged her, and she hesitated. The thought both thrilled and terrified her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me pull out the chicken noises, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could really ruin the mood.\u201d</p><p>He stretched over her and started wrapping the bungee around her crossed wrists.</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss to her lips even as his hands continued to move. \u201cSay stop and I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>Her heart picked up speed and sound ebbed from her throat.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me, Rubi?\u201d</p><p>She did. In that instant she realized at least that barrier had been destroyed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A click signaled the hooks on the end of the bungee on the iron headboard. \u201cHold onto the metal, but don\u2019t pull against the cord.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at an elaborate design of twists allowing her hands to slide without hurting. \u201cWes...I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201c</p><p>He slid down her body and his mouth closed over one nipple.</p><p>Sensation tumbled through her body and she arched. Rubi\u2019s eyes closed on a moan. Then his hands were everywhere, as feverish as they\u2019d been on the way up the stairs and Rubi couldn\u2019t think.</p><p>She grabbed onto a curve in the iron headboard and rubbed her hips against Wes\u2019s. His erection bulged beneath his rough jeans, pressing into the heat between her legs. Then it was gone, way too soon, as he moved down her body, his hands sliding over her skin, his mouth kissing his way lower.</p><p>\u201cStop teasing me,\u201d she said, her voice thick. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her thighs apart and opened his mouth over her pussy, licking and sucking through her panties. Stars lit off behind her eyelids. Rubi\u2019s fingers grasped the metal harder and arched into the pressure and heat. She needed more. She needed him filling her. But her throat closed around her words. And the sounds that came from her mouth were more animal than human.</p><p>Wes never so much as paused his feast to drag her panties off, simply started licking her at one spot and slipped the silk down while licking her to the other. Then his mouth was on her skin. His fingers stroking and exploring. Demanding.</p><p>She managed to open her eyes for a glimpse of his golden head between her darker thighs, one big hand spread over her belly, the other working with his mouth. His eyes closed, those long, golden lashes brushing his cheeks, his expression so intensely blissful, it nearly shot her over the top all on its own.</p><p>If her hands weren\u2019t bound, her fingers would be twisted in his hair, pulling his mouth down harder while she lifted into him, riding his mouth to ecstasy. Instead she had to wait as he played and teased. Wile he suckled and licked and rubbed his face between her legs. But also wanted him inside her. Wanted to feel his full weight on her. Wanted to be consumed by him.</p><p>The intense pleasure rose fast. She couldn\u2019t control the sensations. But Wes could. And he patiently, deliberately drove her into a slowly rising tidal wave where sensations rose and rose and rose. Then rose again.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Wes...please...\u201d</p><p>With a growl of lust and a movement of his tongue, he pushed her over.</p><p>The orgasm crested with little sprinkles of pleasure like starlight in the dark. The first curl of intensity spiraled through her on a cry, then the wave crashed, flooding her body and closing her throat. Rubi\u2019s muscles clenched, lifting her against his mouth in a wild, sensual ride. Wes curled his fingers into the flesh at her hips and took it all, stayed for the very last shiver, his lips leaving her pussy only after she collapsed beneath him.</p><p>Her head spun. Her body floated. Her chest rose and fell with quick, shaky breaths. So depleted, she couldn\u2019t even open her eyes as Wes moved up her body, kissing her breasts, her neck. Then his hand slid between her legs, brushing her sex and making her quiver and laugh. But only until his fingers stroked her and he ground out a deep, \u201cYou taste so good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The feel of his thick cock pressed against her sex, made her instantly hungry again. She spread her legs wider, lifted into him, craving the feel of him filling her.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d His voice was soft but demanding, and Rubi obeyed. But she hadn\u2019t been prepared for the storm of emotions she found. Lust, yes, but so much more. Deep, burning affection. Acute awareness. Serious intention.</p><p>Only after she\u2019d read those emotions did he push inside her, holding her gaze. His cock burrowed into her with a slow, deliberate slide until Wes pushed all the way home, the head of his cock nudging her deepest barrier. A guttural sound of satisfaction echoed deep in his chest. He hovered above her, pressed up on his hands. The muscles of his shoulders, chest and arms rolled and flexed. Pleasure tightened the skin across his cheekbones. His jaw muscle twitched with restraint.</p><p>Without pulling out, he clenched his ass and thrust deeper. He leaned in and kissed her, his tongue circling hers as his hips pulsed. Slow. Maddeningly slow. She couldn\u2019t control any of the movement with the weight and pressure of his lower body securing hers in place. She could only taste him and squeeze the metal until it dug into her fingers and he drove her insane with pleasure.</p> <p>This orgasm took her by surprise, swift and sharp. Her muscles clenched quick and hard. Her mind blanked behind a spray of hot sparks.</p><p>The intensity lingered and Rubi drank in every last fizzle of pleasure. When she finally opened her eyes, Wes was watching her, fire in his eyes, sweat gleaming on his skin and dampening the edges of his hair.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThat is the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes...\u201d She drew out the word as the last sweeps of lingering pleasure fluttered down her legs and through her belly. \u201cWhat are you...\u201d she murmured between breaths, \u201c...doing to me?\u201d</p><p>He bent his elbows and lowered to kiss her in a push up. \u201cMaking love to you, baby. Way more intense than sex.\u201d He gazed down the length of their bodies and exhaled heavily with a little shake of his head. \u201cNever been this good. Never.\u201d</p> <p>No, it had never been this good for her either.</p><p>Was that the difference? Making love versus having sex?</p><p>\u201cWill you ride me, baby?\u201d He reached above her with one hand, released the bungee hooks and pulled her hands out. Then rubbed his fingers over a gentle sting she hadn\u2019t noticed before and brought her hands to his lips for gentle kisses over her wrists. Ride me so I can watch your body move? Nothing turns me on more.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a hand to his chest, easing him back while she sat forward. \u201cI have to warn you,\u201d she said, rolling with him so he stayed inside her until they\u2019d switched positions, \u201cI was a rodeo star in a former life.\u201d</p><p>His laugh was low and appreciative. He gripped her hips and rocked her deeper. \u201cUh-uh.\u201d She pulled his hands from her ass and pressed them over his head, curling his fingers around the headboard\u2019s iron scrolls. \u201cThis is my show. Hold on, handsome.\u201d</p><p>As she straightened, Rubi dragged her hands down his muscled arms, his damp chest, his ribbed belly. \u201cYou are one hunk of fine man, Mr. Lawson.\u201d</p> <p>Gripping his waist, she tossed her hair to one side and lowered her mouth to his chest, licking one flat, bronze nipple, then biting the other. He lifted his hips and pushing deeper. She used her knees to lift off him, letting him slide slowly along her wet walls. He ground his teeth, his hot gaze watching his length leave her body. She couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing so much desire in a man\u2019s eyes. Maybe she\u2019d simply never paid that much attention, but Wes\u2019s pleasure was all she could focus on now.</p><p>She shook her hair back, arched her spine, and lifted her hands, pulling her hair up and off her neck as she sank slowly back onto him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He drew out the low, rugged word. \u201cSo gorgeous.\u201d He lifted one hand from the bedframe and pressed it against her face in a sweet gesture somehow at odds with the intense sex. \u201cLove you, Rubi. Love you so much.\u201d</p><p>Heat washed Rubi\u2019s chest\u2014not exactly raw fear, but not anything she recognized as love either. But how would she recognize love when she didn\u2019t know the first thing about it? Pushing the discomfort to the back of her mind, Rubi rocked her hips, pumping his cock in rhythmic, wet strokes, her body undulating hips to shoulders. Hips to shoulders. This she knew. This she understood. This she could give him.</p><p>He grabbed for the headboard again, head bowing back on a sound of raw need. His fingers flexed and clenched around the iron bars.</p><p>She leaned back, braced her hands on his thick thighs, continuing her ride. His head came up, gaze dropped to her pussy, to the sight of him gliding in, drawing out.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Rubi...\u201d he rasped, his tone nearly painful. \u201cToo much.\u201d</p><p>His biceps rippled and his hips bucked, driving his cock deep. Rubi fell forward, catching herself on his chest. Wes took her face in his hands and held her there, staring into her eyes as his hips rocked, driving her higher and higher. He pulled her down until her mouth covered his and kissed her, mirroring the movement of his body.</p> <p>\u201cCome with me, Rubi.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid down her body, curved around her ass, and held her tight as he plunged and plunged and plunged. He filled her. Stretched her. Drove her. In a way, she didn\u2019t understand, he completed her. Rubi fell against his chest and held on tight as the orgasm ripped through her. As Wes continued to thrust, delivering extreme heights of pleasure. Their climaxes clashed, blended.</p><p>Wes called her name with such exquisite pleasure, Rubi\u2019s chest tightened. Emotion, thick and warm and overwhelming, rushed in, swamping her.</p><p>She went limp, melting on top of him. He was sweaty, warm, slick and hard, his body a slab of heaving, hard muscle. His hands swept gently up and down her back, then rested at her hips.</p><p>\u201cGod damn, Wes.\u201d She whispered the words against his chest, unable to catch her breath.</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d he agreed, his heart beating hard beneath her. \u201cWe are so fucking good together.\u201d</p><p>A small smile turned her mouth, all she could manage. The pleasure\u2019s intensity ebbed into sinfully sweet decadence and flowed through Rubi\u2019s veins like melted gold. \u201cWe sure are.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>Rubi lay against a bevy of pillows, knees up, laptop against her knees. She was almost done with the fixes and upgrades to Wes\u2019s father\u2019s sensor program. Wes snoozed beside her, coming awake to answer questions, kiss her, touch her, then fall back to sleep. His hand now curved over the top of her foot, warm and sure. He created a calm inside her similar to the one that came over her near the ocean. Well, sometimes. Other times he created more of a turbulent storm sensation\u2014some good storms, some not.</p><p>She was just writing the last section of code for a mini app she\u2019d created to monitor the sensors when the front door opened downstairs, followed by footsteps and voices. Susie was home with the kids. Rubi\u2019s blissful privacy with Wes was over, and disappointment closed in.</p><p>He rolled to his side, opened his eyes, and squeezed her foot. \u201cGuess we have to face the world again.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound thrilled with the prospect either. \u201cWhen we get back to LA, I want to take you away somewhere for the weekend. Just you and me for forty-eight, maybe even seventy-two hours straight.\u201d</p><p>Rubi smiled and combed her hand through his hair. That soft, relaxed, comfortable look in his eyes seemed to reach inside her and squeeze, infusing her with happiness. And like a conduit, that happiness immediately brought fear. Completely irrational but very real. She had to find a way to break that circuit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to ask you, is there something going on with Emma?\u201d Rubi lowered her knees. \u201cShe\u2019s a lot shyer than Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s borderline autistic,\u201d Wes said. \u201cOr at least that\u2019s the label they\u2019ve given her so she can get special help at school. But she\u2019s high-functioning, meaning she has fewer problems on the autistic spectrum, and she\u2019s absolutely brilliant. Does math at a high school level. Has a high capacity for anything structural. She just doesn\u2019t communicate well. But she\u2019s a real love once she warms up to you. Very affectionate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Rubi felt a pang of pity for the girl. This world was harsh\u2014at least in Rubi\u2019s experience\u2014especially for anyone outside mainstream society. \u201cShe\u2019s lucky she\u2019s got such a great family to back her, then.\u201d</p><p>Wes sat up and swung his legs off the bed. \u201cHow\u2019s the program coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost done. I added code to measure soil moisture, temperature, alkalinity, salinity, CO2, and nitrogen levels. If he wants to add something, he just needs to cut and paste the code with a few minor edits. And I\u2019ve almost got an app created he can use to monitor it all on his iPhone.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s gaze took on that hundred-yard stare. \u201cHow long was I asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff and on for a couple of hours, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did all that in a couple of hours?\u201d</p><p>A slow smile lifted her mouth. She glanced down over the T-shirt and jeans he\u2019d pulled back on before passing out\u2014just in case someone came home unexpectedly. \u201cAll that and more.\u201d</p><p>He reached out, cupped her neck, and pulled her in for a kiss. Soft and sweet and loving.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Rubi. Love you so much.\u201d</p><p>She must have grown accustomed to the confession, because while it still jolted her system when she thought about what it meant, the words no longer completely freaked her out. They only sort of freaked her out. What did still really freak her out was the thought of telling him the same. She\u2019d already half accepted the fact that she was experiencing the emotions associated with the words. But saying them meant committing to them. And not only was she unsure she could, she didn\u2019t fully understand what that entailed.</p><p>\u201cWait till my dad hears about this program,\u201d Wes said, pushing to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a lifelong invitation to Thanksgiving and Christmas at the Lawson homestead.\u201d He ran one hand over his head. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m really going to have to step up my game now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes?\u201d His mother\u2019s voice coincided with her footsteps up the stairs. And she didn\u2019t sound like her normal, happy self. She sounded tense with worry.</p><p>Wes must have registered the tone too, because his smile dropped and his body stiffened as he turned toward the door. \u201cYeah, Mama. In with Rubi.\u201d</p><p>Before he reached the door, his mother appeared, her face creased with stress.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Wes asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Wyatt. Tori called me at class, said when he woke, his lower legs were very swollen, twice the normal size.\u201d</p><p>Rubi didn\u2019t know what that meant, but it seemed like Wes did. \u201cHe needs to go back to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s still in St. Louis, and Wyatt isn\u2019t moving well enough for Tori to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle him,\u201d Wes said. \u201cI\u2019ll just put him in the truck and take him back.\u201d</p><p>His mother darted a glance at Rubi. \u201cHi, sweetheart. Did you enjoy the drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much.\u201d She swung her legs off the bed, feeling awkward and helpless. \u201cCan I...do anything?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She seemed to think about that for a moment, then returned her gaze to Wes. \u201cTori will want to go with him, but you know how she gets. It would be better if I were there to keep her together. But we have the girls, and Mom... I called Claudia to help, but she\u2019s in Kansas visiting her sister.\u201d</p><p>Rubi had to bite her lip not to volunteer. She really did like to help people, but little kids and crazy grandmothers were waaaaaay the hell out of her spectrum of knowledge.</p><p>Only, when Susie\u2019s gaze turned back to Rubi, she was pretty sure she was going to get a crash course in both. \u201cI hate to ask, Rubi.\u201d She paused with a tortured expression that conveyed the truth of her statement. \u201cBut, do you think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d What the hell else was she going to say to this lovely woman who\u2019d made her feel instantly at home? \u201cI can\u2019t promise to be good at any of it, but I can try.\u201d</p> <p>Susie stepped over to Rubi and hugged her. \u201cOh, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Rubi gazed over her shoulder at Wes. He had that God-I-love-you look in his eyes again, but all Rubi could do was make a dramatic face of what-the-fuck-did-I-just-get-myself-into terror at him before his mother pulled back.</p><p>Wes\u2019s grin spread across his face, and his shoulders shook with silent laughter.</p><p>A shriek drifted up the stairs, then a fight broke out between the girls somewhere in the house.</p><p>\u201cOh dear.\u201d Susie pulled away but kept her hands on Rubi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cEmma was very upset that I interrupted her painting to come home.\u201d She glanced at Wes. \u201cYou know how she is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou go get them settled, have a talk with Grams, and I\u2019ll give Rubi a few guidelines.\u201d</p><p>Susie kissed Rubi\u2019s cheek. \u201cThank you so much, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she left the room, she called, \u201cGirls, no fighting.\u201d</p><p>Rubi dropped her head into her hands on a groaned \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s laughter bubbled over as he sat down next to her on the bed. With an arm around her shoulders, he pulled her close to his side. \u201cHey, it\u2019s not that bad. Just put Abby in front of a Dora the Explorer marathon, set up Emma in a separate room with the shitload of Legos, and lock Grams in her room. Cake.\u201d</p><p>Rubi lifted her head with a horrified expression. \u201cLock her in her room? And what the hell is Dora the...whatever you said?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDora is a who. And I was kidding about locking Grams in her room, but I would suggest locking her in the house. She likes to wander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake. What did I just commit myself to?\u201d</p><p>He turned her face toward him, his grin soft. \u201cFamily, Rubi. You\u2019ve just committed yourself to taking care of family the way only another family member can. An intensely noble effort.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s suggestions worked\u2014but only for the first two hours. Then the relative calm turned to shit.</p><p>Actually, if she were truthful, she\u2019d have to say the trouble started fifteen minutes after Wes and his mother walked out of the house in the form of Birdie deciding she needed\u2014needed\u2014to make holiday pies. In October. Then the trouble escalated in increments made up of spilled cranberry juice on Susie\u2019s cream carpet, Abby\u2019s laughter instigating a screaming fit from Emma, and Birdie\u2019s cyclonic methods in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cRubi,\u201d Abby called from the family room for the twentieth time in two hours. \u201cDora\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Rubi looked up from the dustpan she maneuvered to sweep up the flour Birdie kept scattering all over the kitchen floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Birdie said. \u201cI\u2019ve run out of sugar.\u201d She untied her apron. \u201cI\u2019ll just go next door and borrow some from Mabel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, Birdie. It\u2019s dark outside. I\u2019ll go with you. Just let me put another video on for Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a sweet girl, Missy. Thank you, dear. I\u2019ll wait by the front door.\u201d</p><p>Rubi rolled her eyes at the Missy reference on her way into the family room. She blew her hair back and searched through the Dora DVDs. \u201cOh, this one sounds cute,\u201d she said, working for enthusiasm. \u201cDora saves the Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen that one,\u201d Abby said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen them all, sweetheart.\u201d Rubi fingered through the cases. \u201cTwenty-five times. Okay, here\u2019s a great one. The Chocolate Tree. Everyone loves chocolate, right?\u201d When Abby wrinkled her nose, Rubi turned over the case and read, \u201cDora and Boots seek the Chocolate Tree and a gift for Abuela.\u201d She added a Hispanic accent for a flourishing Abuela, making Abby giggle.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Rubi muttered under her breath and lowered to her knees to switch out the DVDs, but ended up struggling with the damn machine.</p><p>An ear-piercing screech rose in the next room. Her heart lurched to her throat, and she swung around. Abby was gone.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d she whispered and dropped her face into her hands.</p><p>Emma wailed again, so loud Rubi winced.</p><p>Then Abby started yelling over her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. I was just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>The headache Rubi had been holding back broke loose. Pain spread across her forehead and exploded behind her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGirls,\u201d she groaned as she pushed to her feet. \u201cNo need to scream.\u201d</p><p>When she stepped into the kitchen, Rubi remembered Birdie. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there, Birdie,\u201d she yelled over the chaos. But got no answer. \u201cBirdie?\u201d Rubi surveyed Emma\u2019s tower. It was in perfect condition. She glanced at Emma, who had tears streaming down her face, then at Abby, \u201cWhy is she screaming?\u201d</p><p>Abby pointed to the Lego piles Emma had separated into color. A few yellows had fallen into the blue pile. Rubi started to reach for them to straighten them out but pulled her hand back. \u201cEmma?\u201d The girl\u2019s screaming turned to gurgles. \u201cEmma? Do you want me to fix the colors for you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. But then collapsed in tears.</p><p>Abby, seemingly unfazed, skipped back into the living room. \u201cRubi, where\u2019s the Chocolate Tree?\u201d</p><p>Now Rubi wanted to break down into tears.</p><p>Her phone buzzed in her back pocket. Rubi pulled it out and peered through the hallway toward the front door.</p><p>WES: Still alive?</p><p>RUBI: Barely. Emma\u2019s on to something with the tear-filled tantrums. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s the way to go from now on. How\u2019s Wyatt?</p><p>\u201cBirdie?\u201d Rubi called.</p><p>WES: Not great. Blood clots caused the swelling to his legs. Traveled to his lungs. Really dangerous. He\u2019s just out of CAT scan. They\u2019re trying to find a room for him. Hospital\u2019s full.</p><p>RUBI: Is he going to be okay?</p><p>Then she had a really frightening thought.</p><p>RUBI: Did the rig cause them?</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d She closed her eyes, a sudden knot in her chest. \u201cPlease say no.\u201d</p><p>WES: No. Moving the legs prevents blood clots. He\u2019ll be fine now.</p><p>She exhaled, and the knot inside her unraveled. Until she thought about Birdie.</p><p>RUBI: Where is Mabel\u2019s house?</p><p>WES: Mabel who?</p><p>RUBI: Birdie wants to borrow sugar from Mabel. Where does she live?</p><p>Rubi slowly, carefully moved the yellow Legos back into the yellow pile, as if Emma were a lion and might pounce on her any second.</p><p>WES: Mabel\u2019s been dead for fifteen years.</p><p>She read the message twice, her head clearing now that Emma was sobbing quietly, curled into a ball in the kitchen chair. \u201cOh no.\u201d She turned and sprinted toward the front door. \u201cBirdie?\u201d</p><p>The door was open, cold air sweeping in.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d She stepped out on the porch, searching the darkness. \u201cBirdie!\u201d</p><p>Nothing. No voices, no footsteps, not even a rustle of leaves.</p><p>\u201cShe wanders.\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s words cut through Rubi, a knife of terror. \u201cBirdie!\u201d She ran down the steps, scouring the darkness, but saw nothing but those damned trees. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Now what?</p><p>\u201cRubi?\u201d Abby called from the porch.</p><p>\u201cStay inside, Abby. Birdie went for a walk, and I need to find her. Can you go inside for me and close the front door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t like being alone.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My. God. How the hell had she gotten into this?</p><p>Rubi started back up the steps and guided her inside. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone, honey. Emma\u2019s here, and you\u2019ve got to watch Dora find the chocolate bush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTree.\u201d Abby climbed onto the sofa and curled into the corner. \u201cChocolate tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m just taking a walk around the house, and I\u2019ll come right back in.\u201d</p><p>Abby laughed at something the monkey did\u2014Rubi never wanted to hear the name Swiper ever again...like ever\u2014and was instantly reabsorbed into the cartoon. Rubi took one more look at poor little Emma, wishing she had the first idea of how to soothe the girl.</p><p>\u201cEmma?\u201d She crouched in front of her. \u201cCan you help me find a flashlight?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head, pushed off the stool, and walked to a cabinet beneath the sink and pulled out a Maglite.</p><p>Rubi took it with a smile. \u201cWow. You are the smartest little girl I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Emma sniffled, still not meeting her eyes when she said, \u201cI like flashlights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever played shadow games with flashlights?\u201d</p><p>Her pretty blue eyes flicked to Rubi\u2019s for a split second, then darted toward the floor again. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost bedtime. After I find Birdie...\u201d\u2014please God let me find Birdie\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll teach you how before you go to sleep. They\u2019re really fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She turned and climbed back into her chair. With her chin propped in her hand, she stared at her color-coded piles of blocks.</p><p>Rubi\u2019s phone buzzed again as she quietly shut the front door behind her and flipped on the flashlight.</p><p>WES: Is everything okay?</p><p>RUBI: Multiple meltdowns, carpet stains, kitchen covered in flour, missing grandmother...everything is peach-perfect.</p><p>WES: Baby, I\u2019m sorry. Do you want me to come home?</p><p>RUBI: Yes, but don\u2019t. Take care of Wyatt. When Birdie wanders?</p><p>\u201cBirdie?\u201d she yelled as she waited for a response. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>WES: The barn or the berry patches along the creek.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck.\u201d She had to search the barn and the creek in the dark? When she didn\u2019t even know where either of them was?</p><p>RUBI: I\u2019ve gotta go.</p><p>She stuffed the phone back in her pocket and panned the flashlight across a grassy patch at the front of the house. Aimlessly, she wandered, starting where she\u2019d first encountered Birdie, on the gravel road. This might be a beautiful piece of property during the day, but it was just plain-ass freaky at night, and Rubi had every slasher movie floating through her head. With no sign of Birdie, no response to her repeated calls, Rubi\u2019s thoughts transitioned from the ridiculous nonexistent threat of danger to the very real possibility that Birdie was hurt or truly lost.</p><p>Panic for the woman\u2019s well-being coiled in her chest, tightening Rubi\u2019s throat. If Birdie was hurt on Rubi\u2019s watch, she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do. She couldn\u2019t deal with that. And, goddammit, she shouldn\u2019t have been left with this kind of responsibility. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She walked around the house, calling Birdie\u2019s name. Then around the detached garage. Then ventured farther down a dirt road that seemed to connect the house and a looming structure that could only be the barn. Her throat grew sore from yelling. She should have thrown on a jacket. Some shoes. She was freezing. But she hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d be searching as much as simply locating Birdie and coaxing her back into the house.</p><p>Fear wound its way into her chest and squeezed, pushing tears to her eyes. \u201cFuck, Birdie,\u201d she finally yelled in supreme frustration. \u201cGet your ass out here.\u201d</p><p>A door slammed somewhere ahead. The squeal of metal and a hollow crack.\u201cBirdie? Where are you?\u201d A strange thought popped into her mind, and she called, \u201cI found sugar in the pantry. You don\u2019t need any from Mabel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you tell me.\u201d The words were soft but frustrated and coming from a distance.</p> <p>Relief flooded her chest, creating a painful pressure. Her knees gave, and Rubi bent at the waist, bracing herself on her thighs to keep from going down. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Pushing up, she started toward the voice. \u201cCome on, Birdie, it\u2019s freezing out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that, little girl? I\u2019m caught.\u201d</p><p>This was the most perturbed Rubi had ever heard Birdie. Rubi had heard stories of Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia patients becoming belligerent\u2014though Wes had never named Birdie\u2019s condition\u2014but the way Rubi\u2019s night was going, it wouldn\u2019t surprise her at all if the old woman hauled off and decked her.</p><p>But Rubi rounded the barn until she found Birdie struggling. \u201cCotton-pickin\u2019 rundown old shed,\u201d she muttered, turning her body again and again. \u201cDaryl\u2019s gonna hear about this. I\u2019ll love that man until the day I die, but sometimes...\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cbarn\u201d was all metal and, from what she could see, brand-freaking-new, not a thing out of place. She panned the light across Birdie and found the arm of her sweater caught on a water faucet welded to the side of the barn. And blood stained the fabric.</p><p>\u201cBirdie, stop.\u201d Her stomach clenched, and she lunged forward to grab her arm. \u201cStop pulling.\u201d</p><p>Rubi dragged up Birdie\u2019s sleeve and shined the light on the cut to see how bad it was. But she couldn\u2019t tell with all the blood.</p><p>\u201cOh dear...\u201d Birdie tilted toward Rubi, and she caught the older woman before she hit the ground.</p><p>\u201cBirdie, Christ, don\u2019t you dare faint on me.\u201d Her voice cracked, exposing her own off-balance state of mind. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it. And don\u2019t even think about arguing with me.\u201d She pushed her anger forward to cover the fear, the weakness, the vulnerability. \u201cI\u2019ve had it. Susie put me in charge, and I\u2019m the boss, dammit. Now go.\u201d</p><p>Birdie was too woozy to argue. Rubi held her up with an arm around her waist and lighted their way back to the house.</p> <p>By the time Rubi had gotten Birdie bandaged and changed for bed, she was exhausted. Luckily, so was Birdie, and the older woman fell asleep as soon as Rubi tucked her in.</p><p>One down, two to go.</p><p>\u201cThis oughta be fun,\u201d she muttered as she closed the downstairs door to Birdie\u2019s room.</p><p>Before she approached the girls, Rubi fastened the special locks Wes had shown her before he\u2019d left\u2014locks Birdie couldn\u2019t reach. Rubi should have done that right after Wes walked out. This night wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as trying. But then she returned to the kitchen. To flour covering every surface. To berries scattered over the floor. To dishes piled in the sink. And her shoulders sagged.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did I get here?\u201d</p><p>Rubi intercepted three more potential disasters involving Abby and Emma while cleaning the kitchen. She\u2019d spent twenty minutes on the phone listening to Tori go through their bedtime routine and gleaned that Emma didn\u2019t like the feel of brushing her teeth, which caused nightly drama. Emma didn\u2019t like the feel of brushing her hair, which caused morning and nightly drama. Basically, the bottom line: Emma didn\u2019t like the feel of anything, because she had a sensory issue which made all those normal things we did every day hurt for Emma. So anything involving changes to the senses typically caused\u2014you guessed it\u2014drama.</p><p>And Rubi was dead on her feet by the time she finally led the girls upstairs for bed. To keep all that drama to a minimum, Rubi asked Emma everything before touching her. That seemed to work well. She let Emma sleep in the clothes she had on, since those weren\u2019t bothering her, and then settled them in her bed, under the covers.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Rubi said, sitting on the side of the bed. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing about flashlight shadows, Em. They don\u2019t work unless the lights are out.\u201d Tori had told Rubi that Emma slept with the lights on, which was fine by Rubi. She was so tired, she could have slept in a wind tunnel. \u201cI can leave the bathroom light on. But if we leave the big light on, we won\u2019t get the fun shadows. Want to give it a try?\u201d</p> <p>Emma was looking Rubi in the eye now, and God, but she was a beautiful girl. \u201cWill you stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019m going to be asleep before you are.\u201d</p><p>Emma\u2019s little mouth curved, and a warm knot tumbled to the bottom of Rubi\u2019s belly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to change for bed. You two get comfy.\u201d</p><p>Rubi spent her time in the bathroom bent over the sink, splashing water on her face. She was exhausted and edgy. Jumpy. Like she expected to hear Emma scream at any moment. Felt as if she\u2019d given everything she had to Birdie and the kids for the last five hours and felt wrung out, like her nerves were on fire. And now she had to play shadow games on the wall and hope the flashlight beam didn\u2019t hurt Emma\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just committed yourself to taking care of family the way only another family member can. An intensely noble effort.\u201d</p><p>Wes might rethink that when he got home and saw Birdie\u2019s cut and torn sweater. Susie might disagree when she saw the stain Rubi couldn\u2019t get completely out of her carpet.</p><p>Twin giggles came from the bedroom. Rubi turned off the water and changed.</p><p>\u201cYou braid your hair too?\u201d Emma asked\u2014the first time she\u2019d spoken to Rubi first, and a strange sense of accomplishment Rubi didn\u2019t understand spread through her chest.</p><p>\u201cEvery night. I don\u2019t like brushes much either.\u201d She walked over to the light and checked in with Emma. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cTurn on your flashlights first. Abby, make sure to keep the light out of Emma\u2019s eyes. Emma, don\u2019t look directly at the beam.\u201d</p><p>Once the light was off, their flashlight beams aimed at the far wall, and no one was screaming, Rubi exhaled in relief. She climbed into the spot they\u2019d left open for her between them and picked up her own flashlight. \u201cOkay, now the fun begins.\u201d</p><p>Wes eased himself into the chair alongside Rubi\u2019s bed, praying he didn\u2019t wake her or either of the girls. They were curled up like puppies on either side of Rubi, cuddled so close she couldn\u2019t have moved if she\u2019d wanted to. Though, by the way she had an arm around each one, her head tilted with her forehead pressed against Emma\u2019s blonde hair, Wes had to admit she didn\u2019t look like she wanted to go anywhere, but he wished the girls were in their own beds so Wes could strip down, climb in next to Rubi, and feel body the length of his.</p><p>Since no way on earth would that wish come true, he kicked his feet up on the ottoman and melted back into the cushy chair with a long exhale. What a freaking long, terrifying night. He glanced at his watch\u2014almost nine a.m. He closed his eyes and laid his head back, unable to keep the last twelve hours from spiraling behind his closed lids.</p><p>Wyatt had come too close to death too many times\u2014the first before he\u2019d even reached the VA, and Wyatt\u2019s doctor had rerouted them to St. Mary\u2019s first. The damn blood clot had shot to his lungs, and he\u2019d been gasping for air when Wes had thrown his brother over his shoulder and trotted him into the ER. When the nurses and doctors crowded around him and whisked him off to one of the rooms, both his mother and sister-in-law had been bawling. And Wes had been damn close. Luckily, his father had met them there, but he hadn\u2019t looked much better. Christ, that had been the longest couple of hours of Wes\u2019s life\u2014waiting to hear whether or not Wyatt could be stabilized.</p><p>Then he\u2019d been transferred by ambulance to the VA for more tests and further treatment during several bad episodes when they hadn\u2019t known whether Wyatt would live or die. But by morning, he\u2019d found even ground. After another few days in the hospital under careful watch, Wyatt would return home and continue his recovery. With anticoagulation therapy, this wouldn\u2019t...shouldn\u2019t...happen again.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t Wyatt\u2019s first death scare. Wes\u2019s brother had \u201cseen the light,\u201d as Wyatt called it, several times\u2014a few of those in Afghanistan before ever returning home. But this was the first one Wes had witnessed. And it had shaken him.</p><p>He opened his eyes to rid his mind of the memories, and the sight of Rubi and the girls released the pressure in his chest again. Seeing her curled up with two little kids gave Wes crazy-exciting glimpses into the future. Before this moment, he\u2019d never been able to envision Rubi with a family\u2014not that it had even been on his mind. But now... Yeah, it was on his mind. Not tomorrow. Not even next year. But someday.</p><p>And that someday had solidified into a real possibility with Rubi here. After seeing her with his family, watching her step up to the plate with his grandmother and nieces, her generosity toward Wyatt and his father... Yeah, he knew for sure\u2014Rubi was the one.</p><p>Rubi stirred, and her eyes opened. She glanced to either side of her, checking on the girls, then stretched.</p><p>He whispered, \u201cHey, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d she asked in an urgent whisper.</p><p>\u201cHe is now.\u201d</p><p>Abby woke first, sitting up and rubbing her eyes with her fists. \u201cUncle Wes, is Daddy home?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t begin to describe the relief that her daddy would be coming home. Wyatt\u2019s death would have devastated his family. \u201cNot yet, but he will be in a few days.\u201d</p><p>Emma covered her eyes, which meant she was letting her eyes adjust to the morning light. \u201cDaddy\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, baby. Your daddy\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mommy?\u201d Abby asked, sliding out of bed and skipping to Wes.</p><p>He pulled her into his lap. She was warm and soft, cuddling against him. Wes couldn\u2019t say he was eager to be a father. The grave responsibility of the role sometimes felt too heavy for him. But that perspective shifted when he thought of having a child with Rubi. \u201cMommy\u2019s downstairs. She\u2019s going to take you girls home, and you can go to the hospital later to see your dad.\u201d</p><p>Abby pushed from Wes\u2019s lap and ran out the door. \u201cMommy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown here, baby.\u201d Tori\u2019s voice drifted up the stairs.</p><p>Emma climbed from bed, slower than Abby. She reached up and ran a hand over her braid, then looked over her shoulder at Rubi. \u201cWill you take it out?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d Rubi gently removed the band at the bottom. \u201cDo you want to comb it out, or do you want me to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a brush or your fingers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFingers, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it.\u201d</p> <p>Rubi ever so gently unwound the braid and sifted her fingers through Emma\u2019s thick blonde strands. There was no screaming, no drama, and no tears involved. \u201cThere. You try it.\u201d</p><p>Emma repeated Rubi\u2019s motions, then asked, \u201cDoes it look okay? Not all messy like I slept on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little wavy because of the braid, but no, not messy. Very pretty, actually. Go look.\u201d She pointed toward the bathroom.</p><p>Still wearing her clothes from the day before, Emma went into the bathroom. Wes couldn\u2019t see her, but he watched Rubi\u2019s face as Rubi watched Emma. When Rubi\u2019s grin stretched over her beautiful face, Wes knew there had been success and was pleased. But when Rubi turned that smile on Wes to share the accomplishment with an excited thumbs-up, his heart folded and flipped.</p><p>Yes, she was definitely the one.</p> <p>Even exhausted, Wes cooked breakfast for everyone. Whitney had met them at the hospital sometime last night and now held Emma in her lap at the table while the girl sorted and re-sorted a small pile of Legos into colors. Rubi felt as worn out as Wes looked. She knew she couldn\u2019t be, although sleeping with a pair of clinging heaters couldn\u2019t actually be considered sleep. And even though she craved some time either alone or alone with Wes, Rubi spent the morning walking Wes\u2019s father through the program she\u2019d designed for him. His excitement and gratitude made the work worth every minute.</p><p>Birdie had no recollection of baking pies or how she received the cut on her arm\u2014for which Rubi was grateful. Susie claimed she couldn\u2019t find a cranberry juice stain anywhere, even after Rubi pointed it out. Susie also told Rubi of a story when Birdie had broken her arm on her own watch, and insisted a cut was nothing to be concerned about.</p><p>It was after noon when Wes finally swung his arm around Rubi\u2019s shoulders and told his parents, \u201cRubi and I are going to take a nap.\u201d</p><p>With no orders for them to nap in different rooms\u2014probably too tired to care\u2014Wes walked Rubi up the stairs, fell on the bed, and pulled her down on top of him. He was warm and solid, and Rubi felt her rough edges smooth.</p><p>\u201cThank you for stepping in last night,\u201d he said, his voice rough with fatigue. \u201cKnowing you were taking care of Grams and the girls really took a load off all our minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Lying half on him and half on the bed, Rubi slid one of her legs over his, wrapped one arm across his torso, and laid her head on his shoulder. And sighed.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFrazzled. Losing a little stuffing through my seams. But yeah, okay. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence passed, and the events of the night before replayed in Rubi\u2019s head. It all looked like chaos. \u201cThis family stuff could really kill a person.\u201d</p><p>Laughter jumped from Wes\u2019s throat, and he tightened his arm around her shoulders, kissing her forehead.</p><p>Rubi didn\u2019t remember falling asleep, only realized she had when her phone woke her. She pushed up, waking Wes.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing, go back to sleep.\u201d She rolled to the side of the bed and stood, moving toward the sound of her phone in the bathroom. Crap, she didn\u2019t remember even bringing it in there. But by the time she reached it, the phone had stopped ringing.</p> <p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Wes asked, his eyes already closed again, arm outstretched waiting for her to come back to him.</p><p>Rubi touched the Recent Calls button and saw: Desiree.</p><p>\u201cMy Realtor.\u201d And the thought brought back all the problems she still had to face at home. Brought back the decades of anger and pain and frustration surrounding her father.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you calling her back?\u201d Wes asked.</p><p>Rubi blew out a long breath. \u201cI\u2019m...not in a good place to hear bad news.\u201d</p><p>In fact, her insides shook just thinking about it. The same weights she\u2019d been dealing with just days ago seemed twice as heavy now. What would she do with Rodie? How far would she need to move from Wes? How long would she have to live somewhere temporary?</p><p>Minor problems, considering what Wes\u2019s family dealt with every day\u2014but still big problems to her. Upsetting problems.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s good news,\u201d Wes said.</p><p>Maybe she was just pessimistic, but she didn\u2019t have a good feeling. Nothing involving her father ever turned out well.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed and dialed. Her stress ratcheted up as the phone rang. And by the time Desiree answered, Rubi knew she was far too brittle to talk about this now.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rubi.\u201d The cautiously disappointed tone in Desiree\u2019s two words confirmed Rubi\u2019s greatest fears.</p><p>\u201cHey. If it\u2019s bad news, I\u2019m not sure I can handle it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Desiree hesitated. \u201cUm, okay.\u201d Another hesitation. \u201cDo you want me to call you later?\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s stomach free fell to her feet. She dropped her head into her hand and rubbed at stinging eyes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t take my offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, Rubi.\u201d Her sympathy was sincere, but Rubi didn\u2019t want sympathy. She just wanted a normal father.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she demanded rather than asked. \u201cWas it too low?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, it was higher than any of the others. Honestly, I don\u2019t know why. The buyer is paying cash, but Dolph\u2019s not in a hurry to sell, so I don\u2019t know what difference that would make. I can call him and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rubi said from behind clenched teeth. \u201cNo point. Thank you for calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubi?\u201d she said before Rubi pulled the phone from her ear. \u201cThere\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a quick turnaround. They\u2019re closing in a week. The new owner wants to move in immediately.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s vision hazed red. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me I have to be out in a week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got this information fifteen minutes ago. Give me a few to get to the bottom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste your time,\u201d Rubi said. \u201cI\u2019ll get to the bottom of it right now. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She hung up and stared at her phone\u2014seething mad. That fucking bastard. She dialed his office number.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wes asked, his voice guarded.</p><p>\u201cI may take a play from Emma\u2019s book here in a minute,\u201d she said without looking at him. \u201cYou might want to cover your ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRusso Industries,\u201d the chipper secretary answered. \u201cDolph Russo\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>Rubi closed her eyes, took a breath, and held her temper. \u201cThis is Rubi Russo. I don\u2019t care what my father is doing or who he\u2019s with. Put him on the phone. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease hold, Ms. Russo.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s eyes opened into narrow suspicion.</p><p>\u201cRubi.\u201d His voice shocked her. He\u2019d never answered one of her calls immediately. Ever. In her entire freaking life. Not even when she\u2019d been in the emergency room getting a cast and stitches after falling down some backstage stairs. When she remained stunned silent, he added an impatient, \u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know why you sold the house for less than what I offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness,\u201d he said, curt and cold. \u201cThey offered cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference does that make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quick. Clean. And it was my decision.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s stomach iced over around a fiery ball of hurt. \u201cWhat did I ever do to make you hate me so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic. I\u2019d have to care to hate you.\u201d</p><p>The words hit her like a wall, pain tingling through her skin, sinking into muscle, balling in her gut. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about the sweetness of the deal, Rubi. The cash was simply sweeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re giving me a week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the buyer\u2019s decision. If you\u2019d like to sweeten your offer, I\u2019d be willing to reconsider.\u201d</p><p>She stood and walked to the window, one arm crossed over her chest. Her mind spun, trying to uncover his angle, but she couldn\u2019t figure it out. Not unusual; she could rarely figure him out. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes has ignored my associate\u2019s phone calls,\u201d Dolph said. \u201cPersuade him to contract with us to sell that device he\u2019s invented, and I\u2019ll choose your offer for the house.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s mouth dropped open. The colors outside blurred. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious.\u201d She barely whispered the words, knowing he was, but unable to fathom his callousness. \u201cTell me you have just one shred of decency in you, Dolph. Just one. Tell me you did not mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about decency. This is about business. Those are my terms. If I don\u2019t hear back from you by the end of business, I\u2019m going forward with the deal I\u2019ve agreed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother waiting. Take it.\u201d She meant to lower the phone, to end the call. But one of those questions she\u2019d always harbored but had never been able to bring herself to ask tumbled out. \u201cJust tell me this. Why did you take me in? If you care so little about me, why take me and raise me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaternity test,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cCalifornia has laws. I was going to get stuck with you regardless. And it earned me points over the years. A lot of my clients and partners value family.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s throat swelled closed. Despite the ripping inside, no tears came. She felt cold and hard and hollow. Without a sound, she lowered her phone and ended the call. Then turned the phone off completely. And stared out the window.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking.\u201d Wes\u2019s voice made her start, and a sizzle of discomfort slid down her spine. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you and Rodie move in with me? I mean, I\u2019ll have to clear it with Jax first, but he and Lexi are going to move into a new house soon and want me to stay at the Malibu house so someone\u2019s there. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d mind. If it\u2019s a problem, we can find something else together, but that would at least give us more time.\u201d</p><p>A steel strap wrapped around her chest and cinched. Rubi clenched her teeth to keep from jumping down Wes\u2019s throat\u2014knowing it wasn\u2019t a rational reaction. The rational reaction was Thank you, but no. But his oversimplistic solution not only trapped her right back into that damned straitjacket, it trivialized the significance of this catastrophe in Rubi\u2019s life.</p><p>She turned toward him. Assessed his emotionless expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He sat forward. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of room, I love Rodie, you love living on the beach, and...it\u2019s the direction I want us to take.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, that didn\u2019t sit right with her. \u201cWhat do you mean, the direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean...permanent.\u201d</p><p>Permanent.</p><p>Rubi had to resist the urge to laugh hysterically at the absurdity. Rubi didn\u2019t know the meaning of the word permanent. Never had. Never would. There was nothing permanent about her universe. She\u2019d thought they might be able to work out a relationship, but her mind hadn\u2019t jumped anywhere beyond that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned back to the window and tightened her arms on a whispered \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not what you had planned,\u201d he said, his voice irritated. \u201cBut you could at least think about it a minute before you dismiss the idea.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to look at him, and the anger in his expression scraped exposed nerves. \u201cWait\u2014you\u2019re angry? With me? What the fuck did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing there pretending you don\u2019t love me.\u201d He rested his head in his hand. That trapdoor beneath her feet creaked. She could almost feel the tentative happiness they\u2019d found dropping out from under her. \u201cWhere is this coming from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMight have been the \u2018fuck\u2019 when I asked you to move in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWes, we\u2019re barely settled into what\u2019s happening now. Moving in together is... I just...\u201d Panic balled in her stomach and turned her spine to ice. \u201cWhy do you keep springing these things on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my feelings for you are so strong, they overflow. I love you. I want to be with you every minute we have. And dammit, Rubi, you\u2019re going to be homeless in a week with a seventy-pound dog.\u201d</p><p>The strap tightened until she felt like she was going to pop out of her skin. She wasn\u2019t handling this right, but that was one of her problems\u2014she didn\u2019t know how to handle this type of thing.</p><p>She inhaled slowly. Exhaled slowly.</p> <p>She could figure this out. She could.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lived with anyone before\u2014not even a roommate. I...don\u2019t know how to live with someone.\u201d All the problems that could arise glared in her mind. \u201cAnd to make that decision after we\u2019ve only been together for a week\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we\u2019ve been leading up to this for months. Don\u2019t use the short time we\u2019ve been having sex as the beginning of our\u2014\u201d</p><p>Wes\u2019s phone rang. He jerked it from his pocket with a concerned frown marring his forehead. After he looked at the display, he closed his eyes and rubbed them as he answered, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>The female voice on the other end of the line was high-pitched and frantic. Rubi\u2019s chest tightened, sure it was Tori reporting a problem with Wyatt.</p><p>\u201cIs that all he said?\u201d Wes asked. \u201cYes, I know he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The woman cut him off with more hysterics.</p><p>\u201cDid you call the police?\u201d he asked and paused for her answer. \u201cAre your doors locked? Did he say where he was?\u201d</p><p>Fuck, it wasn\u2019t Tori. It was Melissa, calling about her drama with the ex.</p><p>\u201cI know, Mis. Okay, okay. I\u2019m coming. Just keep the doors locked, and don\u2019t answer until I get there.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Rubi had heard the words \u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d all the rationality she\u2019d been clawing to hold on to evaporated. As soon as Wes disconnected, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDillon threatened her. She\u2019s terrified he\u2019s going to come over. I\u2019m just going to calm her down. I need to tell her about Wyatt anyway, and it will get her mind off Dillon.\u201d</p><p>He pushed to his feet.</p><p>A familiar sensation of being dismissed overcame her. \u201cHello. We\u2019re discussing something important here. Why can\u2019t she have the police calm her down?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe called them.\u201d He took that annoyed, cocky stance, leaning into one hip, head tilted. \u201cThey can\u2019t do anything about an alleged phone call. And you and I aren\u2019t talking as much as arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be because you keep bombing with emotional bombshells. What we\u2019re talking about is kind of a big deal and, goddammit, you should be more interested in straightening this out with me than in calming your ex-girlfriend down over something that hasn\u2019t even happened\u2014and doesn\u2019t even involve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does involve me, Rubi. We\u2019re friends.\u201d He gave her an irritated, condescending look. \u201cAnd this is what friends do for each other.\u201d</p><p>That hit deep. And low. As if she didn\u2019t know what friends did for each other. Because she didn\u2019t have many.</p><p>They were both tired. Both stressed. She knew. But that didn\u2019t give him the right to abandon her in the middle of something important.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m the woman you love,\u201d she said, drawing the line between a friend and a lover clearly. \u201cDon\u2019t walk out on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Rubi, I\u2019m not walking out on you.\u201d He gripped her upper arms and kissed her forehead, then turned for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in less than an hour.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s heart hardened over. She followed him out into the hall and gripped the banister as he skipped down the stairs. \u201cWes, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whitney stepped into the foyer, and Rubi bit back her words. His sister\u2019s gaze darted up to Rubi, then landed on Wes as he reached for the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa\u2019s having trouble with Dillon. I won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>He tugged the door open. Whitney grabbed it before it closed. \u201cWes\u2014\u201d</p><p>The roar of the motorcycle cut off Whitney\u2019s words, then faded into the distance.</p><p>Whitney stepped inside, closing the front door and meeting Rubi\u2019s eyes as she stared blankly down at the door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Rubi was transported back in time, to the countless times her father had left her standing at the door, watching his taillights disappear into the distance, a nanny standing nearby with soothing words. They felt as useless now as they had then.</p><p>Disappointment and pain and failure coiled into the hollow space of Rubi\u2019s heart. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>Wes pulled onto the gravel drive feeling as confused and hurt as he had when he\u2019d left\u2014three hours ago, not one as he\u2019d promised. And he was pretty sure that would make a resolution with Rubi even more difficult, because she hadn\u2019t responded to any of his texts and hadn\u2019t answered when he\u2019d called to tell her it was taking longer than he\u2019d expected.</p><p>He parked the bike and pulled off his helmet. The house was quiet, making Wes wonder if everyone had already gone back to the hospital. He hoped they had. It would give him and Rubi time and room to talk\u2014hopefully less on edge than this morning. He climbed the stairs knowing he\u2019d jumped that bridge toward living together too fast. And right after he\u2019d hit her with the whole I-love-you thing. He had to find a way to slow down, he just... She had a way of making him feel frantic, like he had to grab hold of her hard and fast or risk losing her.</p><p>Pausing on the landing, he scraped a hand through his damp hair. Lexi\u2019s words had been swamping his brain from the moment he\u2019d left the house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something someone who\u2019s had a normal upbringing would understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJax is doing a damned good impression of a saint.\u201d</p><p>Wes pushed the front door open, unsettled with a new light shed on an insecurity he\u2019d never had before. But he was far more a saint than Chamberlin ever was. And if Jax could handle Lexi\u2019s issues, Wes could sure as hell handle Rubi\u2019s.</p><p>The house was silent. Wes closed the door and peeled off his jacket, hanging it on the hall tree.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Whitney\u2019s voice turned him toward the formal living room where she sat on the pillows in a bay window, a mug in her hand.</p><p>\u201cHey. Where is everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom took Tori and the girls on a shopping diversion. Dad\u2019s in the barn playing with his new program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Rubi upstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Whitney drew out the word. \u201cShe\u2019s not.\u201d She patted the seat next to her. \u201cCome sit down.\u201d</p><p>Alarm brought him farther into the room, but he didn\u2019t sit. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Whitney looked down at her mug and scraped her lip between her teeth, then returned her gaze to Wes\u2019s. \u201cShe went home, Wes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHo-me?\u201d His voice cracked, but the surge of emotion in his chest overwhelmed his embarrassment. \u201cWhat do you...? She left?\u201d he said in disbelief and dread. \u201cShe went back to LA?\u201d</p><p>Whitney remained solemn. And nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Shock, anger, hurt, they all burst like fireworks at the center of his chest, twining to ignite his temper. He raked both hands through his hair and paced to the opposite side of the room. \u201cMotherfucking sonofabitch.\u201d</p><p>His mind pinged, never staying on one thought more than a second. He turned on his sister, planted his hands at his waist. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to give her credit,\u201d Whitney said, her voice sad. \u201cI thought she was going to walk out that door as soon as the sound of your bike faded, but she waited. She waited for an hour and a half, Wes.\u201d</p><p>His anger flashed into guilt, and it filled him until it swam in his vision like a green tide. \u201cBut I texted her. I told her I\u2019d be longer than I thought. I tried to call, but she didn\u2019t answer. I convinced the police Dillon was a bigger problem than they thought and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re missing the point.\u201d</p><p>Anger and pain made his temper flash. \u201cWhat point?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. He didn\u2019t blame her after that snap.</p><p>He made another restless trip around the living room. Go after her? Again? Let her go? \u201cHow did she get to the airport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe took Wyatt\u2019s truck. Said she\u2019d leave it in long-term parking. Keys will be on the inside of the front tire.\u201d</p><p>His stomach balled into a knot. \u201cWhen does her flight leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She paused. \u201cWes.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward Whitney, his anger and frustration melting into hurt. Soul-deep hurt\u2014she\u2019d left him. And fear. Hot, liquid fear\u2014he\u2019d lost her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really can\u2019t try to fix this until you understand why it happened. Or it will just keep happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>Whitney shook her head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d The unfamiliar sensation of helplessness clenched his hands. The equally unfamiliar pressure of tears pressed the backs of his eyes. \u201cWe were arguing. Melissa called and was in full meltdown mode. I just thought it would be good for Rubi and me to chill out. I was just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReasonable,\u201d Whitney said, \u201cfrom your perspective.\u201d</p><p>The way Whitney said it told Wes it probably wasn\u2019t reasonable from Rubi\u2019s perspective.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t walk out on me.\u201d</p><p>Wes sat down hard on the window seat and dropped his head into his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Whit. Maybe she\u2019s right. Maybe we really don\u2019t work together. I feel like she fits me better than anyone ever has. Like she really gets me. Like I can be who I should have been for years when I\u2019m with her. But maybe I\u2019m not right for her.\u201d He sat back with lead in his stomach. \u201cWe were all raised to do exactly what I did for Melissa today\u2014help out friends and family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were,\u201d she agreed softly.</p><p>\u201cMy job requires me to travel. My schedule changes all the time. My hours are long.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t always be there when she wants or needs me.

More silence.</p> <p>He crossed his arms, but it did little to create counterpressure to the pain inside him. \u201cIsn\u2019t this where you\u2019re supposed to say I told you so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is where I ask you if what you see as the problem is, in fact, the problem.\u201d She stared down into her mug. \u201cBecause Rubi doesn\u2019t strike me as clingy, needy, demanding, or even unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t any of those things, Wes agreed. \u201cSo why the hell are we hitting this wall?\u201d he asked himself more than Whitney.</p><p>His sister pushed to her feet. \u201cIt seems to me that she recognizes the importance of your family to you. She\u2019s gone out of her way to accommodate that, even though she\u2019s the first to admit\u2014as she did to Mom the moment they met\u2014that she\u2019s not good with family.\u201d</p><p>Whitney held her empty mug out to Wes, and he took it automatically, without even knowing why.</p> <p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re ready for serious therapy, which would include baring your darkest secrets to your sister\u201d\u2014she winced as if the thought caused her as much pain as it would him\u2014\u201cI\u2019d suggest thinking about what\u2019s really important to Rubi, and finding a way to convince her it\u2019s just as important to you.\u201d She leaned forward and kissed his forehead. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve got to go give some equally vague advice to clients who actually pay me for it.\u201d</p><p>Thirty</p><p>Rubi\u2019s phone rang while she had a glass of wine in one hand and a bottle of Xanax in the other. She lifted her gaze from the warning label on the prescription and glanced around the chaos she\u2019d created in her bedroom. Rodie, curled into a ball on the bed\u2019s only clear spot, glanced around just as Rubi did.</p><p>Where the hell was her phone? If she weren\u2019t so desperate to take a break from packing, get out of the house, and gain some human companionship, she would have let it ring. But she was hoping Lexi was calling to tell her a client had canceled their dinner plans.</p><p>She pushed to her feet, dodged the boxes scattered through the room, and dug beneath the hangers and hangers of clothes she\u2019d thrown on her bed. When she dug it out, she glanced at the display.</p><p>Her heart fell when she read: Desiree.</p> <p>But she answered, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found The One.\u201d Excitement bubbled through her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s nine million. A slight cliff, but you can still see the beach from the outdoor seating area, with two paths down to the beach\u2014a stairway going straight down and a ramp on the other end of the property. The landscaping is stunning, lots of room for Rodie. An infinity pool and twelve-person hot tub overlooking the yard and the ocean.\u201d</p><p>Desiree barely took a breath, and before Rubi could respond, continued. \u201cMillions of arched windows, matching doors, and room transitions. Light wood, plaster-white walls, cathedral ceilings. Four bedrooms, four baths, an office, four-thousand square feet\u2014not too big, and it\u2019s only a couple of years old. Really, Rubi, I know this is it.\u201d</p><p>Rubi downed the rest of her wine. \u201cThanks D, but I\u2019m...\u201d Royally fucked up? Yes, I am. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure what I want anymore.\u201d</p><p>Desiree hesitated, then proceeded with a slow, confused \u201cWhat...do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just...confused. And I\u2019m tired of looking and being disappointed. I just can\u2019t look at anything else right now. I\u2019ve got to get this junk into storage, and I haven\u2019t convinced any decent hotel to take Rodie yet. I\u2019m really inundated right now.\u201d She pressed a hand to the ache overtaking her forehead and closed her eyes. Tears pushed over her lashes and ran down her cheeks. But that happened so often now, they didn\u2019t even faze her. \u201cCan you give me a few days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubi, honey, I know you\u2019re stressed, but I promise you this one is magical. It just went on the market an hour ago. A girlfriend working in the Realtor\u2019s office knew I was looking for you and called to tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, D. I do. I\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d</p> <p>She disconnected with so much turmoil whipping through her, she pitched the phone across the room. It hit a mirror\u2014the only fucking mirror in the whole goddamned thousand-foot suite\u2014and shattered. The mirror and the phone.</p><p>Nothing in her life made sense anymore. She didn\u2019t know what she was doing or why. All she wanted was Wes. And she\u2019d screwed that to hell and back. Just as she\u2019d realized going to Missouri had been a mistake once the plane had reached thirty-thousand feet, she\u2019d known leaving had been an even bigger mistake at the same point on the flight home.</p><p>He\u2019d been home from his parents for over a week now and hadn\u2019t contacted her. And she didn\u2019t blame him. She\u2019d clearly demonstrated that she wasn\u2019t wired for forever. The concept short-circuited her synapses and made her do stupid, uncharacteristic things. Made her hurt Wes. And he didn\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>Rubi picked up the landline on the nightstand and dialed Lexi\u2019s cell.</p><p>On the third ring, Lexi picked up with a hushed \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she lied. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you never call me when I\u2019m with a client, even if I tell you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just checking to see if she canceled. You were so sure she would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Lexi\u2019s tone took on a disgusted edge. \u201cBut then the fianc\u00e9 found out that Jax Chamberlin, stuntman, and Bentley Chamberlin, movie star, were one and the same. Then insisted they keep the appointment. Believe me, this is not a business dinner. It\u2019s an I-love-Bentley dinner. Jax has been kicking me under the table for half an hour.\u201d</p><p>Rubi forced a chuckle at the secret sign Jax had developed for letting Lexi know it was time to leave one of the many dinners, cocktail parties, brunches, and business meetings they attended. \u201cAh well. You two have fun with that. I\u2019ll catch you tomorrow maybe.\u201d</p><p>She disconnected and set the old-fashioned phone in its cradle. Picked it up. Put it down. Picked it up.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d And slammed it down.</p><p>When she turned back to the boxes, anxiety gushed through her system. Overwhelmed. She was simply overwhelmed. Her mind overtaxed with stress and confusion. Her body overtaxed with pain and loneliness. All her own fault. Which only led her to her recent discovery that she hated who she was. Hated who she\u2019d let herself become.</p><p>She needed a release valve before she exploded.</p><p>Rubi poured another glass of wine but slammed the bottle on the nightstand. She didn\u2019t want any more wine. She wanted out. Out of her body. Out of her head. Out of her heart.</p><p>Rubi finished dressing and applying makeup by avoiding direct eye contact with herself in the mirror in the bathroom. Made it through the drive to the club by hammering the latest club mixes through the Aston\u2019s incredible speakers. Even managed to get from her car to Stilettos\u2019 front doors by responding to the friendly, even excited welcome from acquaintances outside the club.</p><p>But once she\u2019d slipped in the door, she was swallowed by the darkness, buffers and support gone. Rubi stepped aside and surveyed the space. Everything was the same. Exactly the same. The people, the dress, the music, the furniture, the bars. All the same. Yet the zing of adrenaline she\u2019d always experienced simply stepping in the door was absent. Her desire to mingle and chat, nonexistent. She searched for familiar faces, someone comfortable to ease her back into the scene, and spotted Rom\u00e9o working the bar.</p><p>Okay, that could work.</p><p>So why couldn\u2019t she move toward him? Why wouldn\u2019t her feet move from this spot? And why did she feel like she wanted to puke?</p><p>Rubi leaned her shoulder against a wall and crossed her arms. Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cRoar\u201d pounded through the club, but Rubi experienced no desire to move to the beat. No rush of anticipation for the night ahead. Friends waved her over from their seats at the bar, and Rom\u00e9o flashed her a grin and lifted the liquor bottle from which he\u2019d been pouring, toward her in greeting.</p><p>Still, she didn\u2019t move forward.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t where she wanted to be. Or who she wanted to be with.</p><p>This was all wrong.</p><p>Thirty-One</p><p>When Wes came out of the Renegades\u2019 bathroom after a quick shower, Courtney Marshall was already waiting for him. He\u2019d never seen her, only spoken with her on the phone, and she wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected. She was far younger than he\u2019d guessed from her voice, maybe early twenties. Blonde and pretty, and dressed down in jeans and a light sweater, both of which hugged well-proportioned curves.</p><p>She turned from all the attention the other Renegades were showering on her and smiled. \u201cYou must be Wes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d He ran one hand through his hair and reached to take her extended hand with the other. \u201cSorry, just cleaning up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk outside a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Troy said. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to introduce us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourtney, the guys,\u201d he said, glaring at Troy. \u201cGuys, Courtney. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know her name, dorkweed,\u201d Keaton threw in. \u201cHow about a relation? Friend? Date?\u201d He paused. \u201cGirlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Thank God she hadn\u2019t told them why she was here. \u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>She said her good-byes to the crew, and Wes held the door open for her but didn\u2019t miss the scowl Rachel leveled on him on the way out. He followed Courtney down the steps, calling himself all kinds of stupid for the nerves making him awkward.</p><p>With his hands stuffed in the front pockets of his jeans, he glanced around, making sure no one was nearby. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not real good at this. What\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>She grinned and flipped her sleek cut off her forehead. \u201cI take you to lunch, and we talk.\u201d She slipped her arm through his and tugged him toward the parking lot. \u201cWe\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at his jeans, frayed threadbare in too many places to be decent. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to call this morning, so I\u2019m not exactly prepared for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking casual,\u201d she said, perky, relaxed. \u201cHow does Casey\u2019s sound?\u201d</p><p>Rubi parked along the street in front of the Renegades set location for the day\u2014a steel scrapyard in an industrial area of the city. She spotted the Renegades trailer alongside a warehouse where film crews, cameras, and lights had been set up. She also spotted Wes\u2019s truck parked several cars up from hers.</p><p>Rubi pulled off her sunglasses and pressed a hand to the tight ache in her chest. She could do this. If he rejected her, he rejected her. She\u2019d know it wasn\u2019t meant to be. But she had to try.</p><p>She picked up the present in the passenger\u2019s seat and stood from her car, smoothing her skirt\u2014one of Wes\u2019s favorites. On a deep breath, she started up the sidewalk. A few wolf whistles sounded from the industrial buildings near the site still in use, but she ignored them. She glanced at Wes\u2019s truck as she passed, not sure what she was looking for, but found no real changes. No panties hanging from the rearview. A good sign, right? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Crossing her arms, Rubi continued toward the action and scoured the site, but found no sign of Wes. She heard laughter from the Renegades trailer before she was within a hundred feet. The sound hit her with a bittersweet sensation. She\u2019d missed the guys. Missed the flurry of energy and activity that hovered in and around the trailer like a beehive. But most of all, she missed Wes. Missed his laugh. Missed his humor. Missed his love.</p><p>\u201cI can do this.\u201d</p><p>She took the stairs and opened the door. Before she\u2019d stepped in, everyone went silent. Their shocked gazes held on her for an extra second, then darted to each other with concern.</p><p>\u201cGee, good to see you too, guys.\u201d</p> <p>Troy pushed out of the sofa and took one giant step, crossing the trailer. He pulled her off her feet in a bear hug. \u201cWhere the fuck you been, Russo? Just \u2019cause Lawson\u2019s a prick doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t come see the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy,\u201d she said, voice strained, \u201cyou\u2019re cutting off my air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWuss,\u201d he said, setting her down.</p><p>Someone\u2019s phone rang, and Jax, somewhere behind Troy, said, \u201cYeah? Be right there.\u201d He stood. \u201cReady on set.\u201d</p><p>Troy ruffled Rubi\u2019s hair like an annoying brother. She swatted at his hands. \u201cHey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s for staying gone so long.\u201d He kissed her head on the way out the door. \u201cDon\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>Duke gave her a high five on the way out. Keaton followed with \u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger. We like you more than Lawson.\u201d</p><p>Jax stopped in front of her, his eyes narrowed in concern. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d No. They all obviously knew her relationship with Wes was over. He obviously wasn\u2019t keeping it a secret. Evidently no second thoughts. Which pissed her off when that was all she\u2019d had since she left his parents\u2019 house. \u201cIs Wes around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...no.\u201d He cast a slow glance over his shoulder at Rachel. \u201cDid he say when he\u2019d be back?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together and shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Rubi waved away the obvious tension. \u201cI\u2019ll catch him later.\u201d</p><p>Jax nodded, offered a strained smile, then passed. On his way out the door, he turned back. \u201cLexi and I are home tonight. Come over for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>He smiled before turning away and closing the door behind him.</p><p>Rubi closed her eyes and exhaled. Opening her eyes on Rachel, she said, \u201cWhat the fuck just happened?\u201d</p><p>Rachel scrambled from behind her desk, crossed the trailer, and peeked out the blinds. Then turned a furious gaze on Rubi. \u201cWes just left for lunch with some chick.\u201d</p><p>That news stunned her silent. And dumb.</p><p>\u201cWhat...chick?\u201d she finally managed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. None of the guys knew her. Courtney Marshall?\u201d</p><p>Rubi shook her head, her stomach sinking. \u201cI don\u2019t know who that is. Was it, like...a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I eavesdropped through the window because he wouldn\u2019t talk to her in here. They\u2019re going to Casey\u2019s for lunch. You know, Casey\u2019s Irish Pub on South Grand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, dazed, \u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you guys really break up?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze returned to Rachel\u2019s. Her big brown eyes were worried, soft with compassion. \u201cI...don\u2019t even know if we were really ever together.\u201d</p><p>Rachel grabbed Rubi\u2019s arms and shook her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll your spunk is gone. This isn\u2019t the Rubi I know. This isn\u2019t the Rubi Wes loves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know you can do anything you put that wicked mind of yours to.\u201d</p><p>His words to her at the airport hit her. \u201cYeah. You\u2019re right.\u201d She turned and opened the door. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>Wes sucked down the second half of his beer as they waited for their lunch order. One he wasn\u2019t going to be able to eat given the roiling state of his gut. His knee bounced beneath the table. He glanced around before he set his gaze back on Courtney\u2019s. She was so calm. So cool. Almost predatory.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cthis can be completely confidential, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>Wes cleared his throat. Licked his lips. \u201cWhat kind of money are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>For the third time since they sat down, Courtney tried to pull the contract from her briefcase.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Wes put out a hand to stop her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it. I\u2019ve hired someone to look it over. I just want to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said on an exhale as if her patience was waning. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything definite yet, but I have three different companies interested. I\u2019d be working this contract as an agent, since none of Russo Industries are equipped to manufacture the rig. You would get fifty percent of the licensing payment and two percent royalties on the retail cost of the rig for every sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He wished he had more time. Wished he could take the money from this deal to do what he really wanted to do\u2014buy that house for Rubi. But he didn\u2019t. This was all he could think of in the short amount of time he had left to work with. \u201cNumbers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really premature to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBallpark me.\u201d</p><p>Another irritated clamp of her lips. Another heavy exhale. \u201cYou can\u2019t hold me to any of these numbers. Things change\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBallpark thirty million for the license and about a hundred dollars for every sale. With the market for the rig, we estimate your take to be two to three million for the first five years.\u201d</p><p>Wes felt like he\u2019d missed the airbag from a sixty-foot fall. He didn\u2019t want to look like an idiot, so he lowered his gaze to the table and scraped both hands through his hair, forcing himself to breathe.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Courtney said, sitting forward. \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s just a guesstimate. I generally err on the low side because I\u2019d rather you be pleasantly surprised when I get more than expected. Because this invention is so unique and so high tech, Dolph may be willing to raise the royalty to three percent, but...\u201d Courtney shook her head. \u201cWith that nonnegotiable stipulation you\u2019ve made on selling his house to Rubi, his flexibility might be iffy.\u201d</p><p>Whatever. He waved his fingers. \u201cOkay, let me have it. I\u2019ll have someone look it over and get back to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>A little grin curved her mouth. One he didn\u2019t like.</p><p>He looked down at the slab of paper she set on the table between them. Christ, it had to be half an inch thick. When he glanced up again, movement at the door drew his gaze. Rubi pulled one of the glass doors open.</p><p>His first response was visceral\u2014his gut flipped on itself and twisted. His heart added a few beats to the rhythm. Then reality hit. He flashed hot. Then cold. His mind spinning what-the-fucks upside down and sideways.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He pulled the contract into his lap.</p><p>Courtney glanced over her shoulder, then back at Wes. \u201cI\u2019ve never met her. She won\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>No, she\u2019d just see him with another woman. Or she\u2019d talked to her father and already knew what he had planned and was here to crush his balls.</p><p>But then she stopped halfway in the door and turned around. But she didn\u2019t leave. She just stood there with her back to the door, arms crossed. Turned again, shook her hair back, and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d Courtney started, trailing off when Rubi scoured the restaurant and her gaze landed on them. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll run with however you want to play this.\u201d</p><p>Wes cut a look at the woman across the table. \u201cThis is not a fucking game.\u201d</p><p>In his peripheral vision, Rubi swayed into view and stopped at the table. But Wes would have known she was there even if he hadn\u2019t seen her walk in. He smelled her. The scent brought memories spilling back. And he had to clench his teeth to keep himself from going boneless and dropping his head on the table in defeat.</p><p>She would hate him when he found out what he\u2019d planned.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Rubi asked.</p><p>Courtney slowly tore her gaze from Wes\u2019s and looked up at Rubi. She held out her hand. \u201cCourtney-\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshall. I know your name.\u201d When she kept her arms crossed, Courtney lowered her hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want to know. I want to know who you are to Wes.\u201d</p><p>Courtney just as slowly turned her gaze back to him. \u201cI think I\u2019ll let Wes field that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you.\u201d</p><p>Against his will, Wes\u2019s eyes fell closed in dread. At the same time, he gained the slightest sliver of sugary-sweet pleasure hearing her voice, smelling her scent, just having her near. This was why he\u2019d come up with this stupid idea in the first place. He needed her back.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Courtney said, \u201ccontrary to what you might believe, Ms. Russo, you don\u2019t always get what you want.\u201d</p><p>Holy. Fuck. Wes opened his eyes and shot a curt \u201cCourtney,\u201d at the woman.</p><p>Rubi chuckled, the sound knowing and placating. \u201cYou may not always get what you want,\u201d she said, \u201cBut Wes knows I can get anything I set my wicked mind on. And I\u2019m here to tell you that my mind is set on him.\u201d</p><p>Wes cast a confused sidelong glance up at Rubi and instantly wished he hadn\u2019t. It just made him want her. Miss her. And it made him realize her eyes were red from crying.</p><p>\u201cRubi-\u201d he started.</p><p>\u201cYou were not invited into this conversation,\u201d she said, her voice curt but her gaze filled with pain. \u201cYou will be in just a minute.\u201d</p><p>He bit the inside of his cheek against a smile. A fierce shot of love streamed down his chest, so hot he felt the searing trail. Darting a glance around, he found every gaze in the restaurant on them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just giving you a heads-up, Courtney,\u201d Rubi said. \u201cHe loves me. And even if he didn\u2019t, you\u2019re not his type. I am. Whatever you think you have with him won\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>Courtney grinned, the light of entertainment in her eyes. She leaned back and swung her arm over the back of the chair. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. And you could never be me, so don\u2019t even try.\u201d Rubi crossed her arms and in that sexy, arrogant stance she used to create a cover of bravado, she stared down at Courtney. \u201cAnd I love him, too. He\u2019s mine. So. Back. Off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him.\u201d</p><p>The words ricocheted around his head like an echo. Burned through his chest. Wes leaned back and covered his face with both hands. He wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. What he wouldn\u2019t give to rewind time. He would have stayed with her to finish talking about living together, hammered out her fears, reassured her that he wouldn\u2019t just up and leave.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d Courtney asked, eyes narrowed.</p><p>Rubi turned her gaze on Wes. \u201cDead sure.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze traveled over his face, his chest...and froze. Her eyes narrowed. Fire erupted in Wes\u2019s gut, and he leaned forward. Too late. Rubi grabbed the contract from his lap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wes tried to take it back, but she expertly snatched it away again, stepping back as her gaze traveled over the front page and silence filled the space.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Courtney said, \u201cI guess this meeting\u2019s over. Call me, Wes.\u201d</p><p>She started to stand. Rubi stepped in front of her as she turned to the second page. Then pressed a hand to Courtney\u2019s shoulder without taking her gaze off the written words and pushed her back into her seat. \u201cOh no. This isn\u2019t even close to over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubi.\u201d Wes stood. \u201cWe can talk about this alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She darted a look at Wes, matter-of-fact, open. \u201cIsn\u2019t she the one making the offer for my father? Have you had anyone look this over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I hired-\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to pay anyone when there is no one more versed in my father\u2019s contracts than me.\u201d She waved Wes toward his seat. \u201cSit. Let\u2019s just get this out of the way now.\u201d</p><p>Rubi had never been so angry in her life. She hated her father beyond measure. She wasn\u2019t sure what Wes was doing yet, but it didn\u2019t matter. If her father was involved, he was always the guilty party.</p><p>She flipped through the contract, skimming the details, and choked on the licensing percentage. The sound that came from her throat was part scoff, part laugh.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking fifty percent?\u201d She sneered at Courtney. \u201cLike hell.\u201d</p><p>Rubi knew her type even if she didn\u2019t know the woman. Her father always hired the same type.</p><p>A waitress came, and Rubi stepped aside to let her set the food down.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something?\u201d she asked Rubi.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she said without taking her eyes off the contract, her tone dry. \u201cI\u2019m here for the entertainment.\u201d And this contract was pure bullshit entertainment.</p><p>She turned until she found the royalty rate and exhaled heavily. This was so typical of her father-taking advantage of naivety or desperation.</p> <p>She lifted her gaze to Courtney. \u201cHow do you work for a man this greedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is business.\u201d</p><p>Rubi shook her head on a disgusted laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re just another parrot. Don\u2019t you realize his unscrupulous ways will come back around on you?\u201d</p><p>Courtney grinned, snide and superior. \u201cThanks for the advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Rubi shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to someone with decades of experience on how the man works. But neither one of you is getting your greedy little hands on Wes\u2019s rig. Not with a contract this fucked up.\u201d</p><p>She turned to the back of the papers, turning to the section where special provisions, if any existed, were outlined.</p><p>Wes stood and reached for the papers. Rubi didn\u2019t move fast enough this time, and he caught hold of the top of the contract, but she didn\u2019t let go. Their gazes clashed.</p><p>Courtney slipped from the booth. \u201cThat would be my cue to leave.\u201d She hitched her bag on her shoulder. \u201cRubi, you\u2019re everything your father said...and more.\u201d</p> <p>Fire flashed in Rubi\u2019s chest. She cut her gaze to Courtney\u2019s and smiled her very best wicked smile. \u201cYou have no idea. Stay away from me and mine or I\u2019ll show you first hand.\u201d</p><p>Courtney\u2019s aloof veneer cracked. She turned and walked out.</p><p>Rubi turned back to Wes. Their gazes warred for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t you want me to see?\u201d she asked, voice soft.</p><p>He closed his eyes. Shook his head. And let go of the contract.</p><p>He dropped into his chair, pushed his plate aside, and planted his elbows on the table, then dropped his head into his hands. \u201cChrist, what a clusterfuck.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Rubi glanced down at the provisions page. The first thing that caught her eye was her own address-or her soon to be previous address. A burn started in her gut and grew as she read. Her frown deepened as her mind searched for understanding. \u201cWhat...?\u201d She lifted her gaze to look at Wes, but his head was still down. \u201cWhy...?\u201d</p><p>He sat back and dropped his hands hopelessly in his lap. \u201cI just... I know the house is important to you. I didn\u2019t realize how important, didn\u2019t realize that it meant more to you than, just, you know, a nice house, until later when I thought about why you were so upset.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her arms, and the paper crinkled. Her stomach went light, as if it were floating. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I... I screwed up at my mom\u2019s. I know I shouldn\u2019t have gone to Melissa\u2019s in the middle of our argument. I didn\u2019t think-at the time-it would seem to you like I was walking out on you, because I\u2019d never do that. But after, when I realized you were gone, I...\u201d</p><p>She dropped into a chair and pressed her fingers to his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t. Please.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her hand away and curled his fingers around hers. \u201cLet me finish.\u201d He lifted his gaze to hers. \u201cRemember when you said you\u2019d give up everything for a family like mine?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel about the rig. I\u2019d rather have you than anything the rig could bring me. And it was the only leverage I had to get you what you so desperately needed-the stability that house gives you. That\u2019s what\u2019s important to me-because that\u2019s what\u2019s important to you.</p><p>\u201cI knew once you felt balanced again, things with us would work out, because...because I know we were meant to be together.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her throat to tight to speak. Waiting a moment, she swallowed. \u201cI believe that too. Which is why I\u2019m here. Because I know I shouldn\u2019t have left Missouri the way you believe you shouldn\u2019t have left your mom\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Rubi\u2019s belly flooded with a fluttering, panicked sensation that made her nauseated, but she breathed through it and went on. \u201cI have problems, Wes. Issues that aren\u2019t going to go away overnight. Honestly, I don\u2019t know that they\u2019ll ever go away. I know I let my fears from the past rule my actions, and I know that was a mistake. A huge mistake. I don\u2019t want those problems to keep me from you anymore.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head to meet his eyes. Cupped his jaw. \u201cI love you. And I want you. If you still want to live together...it scares the shit out of me, but...if we can just take things a day at a time...I still want to try. If you don\u2019t...I under-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He kissed her again, longer. \u201cFuck, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d He gripped her waist and lifted her onto his lap.</p><p>Rubi straddled him right there in the restaurant, laughing against his mouth. She pulled away and stroked his cheek, her heart fuller than it had ever been. \u201cCan we tear up this contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we look for a better contract with someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cCan we go look at a house today that my Realtor swears is perfect for me, but look at it for us?\u201d</p><p>A slow smile lifted his mouth. \u201cA house for us?\u201d</p><p>This was right. The most perfectly right thing she\u2019d ever done.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cA house for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you let me pay for half-when I get the money from this rig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re together,\u201d she said and kissed him gently, \u201canything you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
