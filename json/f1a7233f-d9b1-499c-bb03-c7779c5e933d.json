Both were human. One was tall, muscled, with dark hair and a busted-up face. His syn-cotton shirt was torn, his jeans dirty, and his boots scuffed. There were telltale weapon bulges under his arms, at his wrists, and at his ankles.</p><p>Clearly, he was the bodyguard.</p><p>The other wore a perfectly tailored silk business suit, his Italian loafers freshly polished. His sun-kissed hair was expensively coiffed, and the only bulge he sported was the one in his pocket, where he kept his wallet.</p> <p>Clearly, he was the money.</p><p>Acrid wind shrieked as if someone had cranked a hard rock song on a radio, dancing thick dirt granules in every direction, Money radiated impatience mixed with glee\u2014until two other men materialized a few feet away, and the impatience vanished.</p><p>The newcomers had appeared in a blink, without walking a single step: a white-haired Arcadian\u2014an otherworlder with the ability to teleport, among other things\u2014and another human, this one wearing a suit as well, only his was ill-fitting and made from a cheap synthetic fiber.</p><p>The human\u2019s arms were cuffed behind his back. He smelled of pungent fear and urine. Poor bastard must have pissed himself.</p><p>Without a word, the Arcadian pushed the trembling male to his knees.</p> <p>Night\u2019s about to get interesting.</p><p>The rust-colored sky appeared swollen, the storm-drenched clouds ready to burst. In the center, the sun was a hemorrhaging hook of gold, offering only a fraction of light. That hardly mattered to the witness. From high in the gnarled trees surrounding the field, his gaze cut through the gloom as easily as a knife through flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can encroach on my territory?\u201d Money snarled down at the kneeler. Another gust of wind created that perfect background music.</p><p>\u201cN\u2014no. I just ... I ... I\u2019m so sorry. I never meant ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never meant to offer New Chicago\u2019s elite prettier girls? Better prices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No. You have to believe me. I only thought ... hoped ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou thought ... hoped ...\u201d Money sneered. No question, he was a man used to getting what he wanted, when he wanted it. He held out his hand, and Bodyguard smacked the butt of a pyre-gun onto his palm. \u201cWell, your thoughts and hopes just got you killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kneeler sobbed like a baby. \u201cPlease! Don\u2019t do this. I\u2019ll leave New Chicago. I won\u2019t ever come back. I swear!\u201d</p><p>Money nodded to the Arcadian, who jerked his T-shirt over his head and stuffed the material in Kneeler\u2019s mouth. Kneeler shook his head, perhaps to dislodge the cloth, perhaps to attempt another plea for mercy.</p><p>Either way, he failed.</p><p>\u201cYou were right, you know,\u201d Money said, smug now. \u201cYou won\u2019t ever come back.\u201d A blaze of yellow light erupted from the barrel of the gun, arrowing out and nailing Kneeler in his chest.</p><p>A muffled scream of agony pierced the air. As Kneeler toppled to the ground, twitching, dying as his organs fried to a crisp, Money returned the gun to Bodyguard and wiped his hands in a job well done.</p><p>One</p><p>Alien Investigation and Removal Training Camp Day One</p> <p>TRAINEE AFTER TRAINEE EMERGED from the auto-bus. Some were in their late teens and had just graduated from AIR High, but most were in their early twenties, male, and obviously overwhelmed by the line of instructors watching unabashedly as they carried their bags to their new digs: a rundown, luxuries-are-a-thing-of-the-past bunkhouse in the middle of an isolated valley.</p><p>Isolated, and ugly. There was dirt, dirt, and more dirt, with the occasional knotted, naked tree to spice things up. Only thing that wasn\u2019t a complete eyesore was the obstacle course woven throughout the entire mile-long stretch, with its tall but thin brick walls, elevated beams, and manmade holes and pools, but by the end of the day, everyone here would hate the course so much they\u2019d want to burn it down and dance on the ashes rather than look at it.</p><p>The few females to disembark, well, they were in their early twenties, too, and just as overwhelmed. Except for the last two. They just appeared eager.</p><p>Poor, dumb kids. They\u2019d learn.</p><p>Thirteen years ago, Agent Hector Dean had ridden in that bus himself. Everyone on it had been yelled at, demoralized, and slapped around, all in an effort to weed out the pussies. What those two girls didn\u2019t know but should? The yelling, the demoralizing, and the slapping were just precursors for what was to come.</p><p>Poor, dumb, about-to-be-traumatized kids.</p><p>Hector didn\u2019t have to check the roster to learn the identities of his eager beavers. He\u2019d memorized the stats of all twenty-nine recruits, and recognized the pair from their photos. Ava Sans and Noelle Tremain.</p><p>Ava, a twenty-three-year-old fluff of femininity who was barely five nothing in a pair of heels. She had curly brown hair and chocolate brown eyes. Cute in a Sunday school teacher kind of way. Which was ironic. She had a rap sheet with more pages than the Bible.</p><p>She\u2019d grown up in Whore\u2019s Corner, the poorest part of New Chicago, with a drugged-out mother and more stepfathers than fingers. Hector could relate. Not about the multiple dads, he\u2019d just had the one, and a fucking terrible one who\u2019d enjoyed watching his young sons prize-fight, but about the drugged-out mom living in Whore\u2019s Corner.</p><p>The WC was where Hector had been born, chewed up, spit out, and reformed into the man\u2014or weapon\u2014he was today.</p><p>Moving on.</p><p>Noelle, also twenty-three years old, though she was a tall, reed-slender slice of elegance, with lighter brown hair that was straight as a board, and eyes of the lightest gray. The product of old money, she\u2019d grown up in the wealthiest part of town, in a giant-ass mansion, with doting servants to attend her every whim.</p><p>Hector could not relate.</p><p>She was as lovely as a cameo, and appeared to be as untouchable as a goddess. Which was also ironic. She might have a shorter rap sheet than Ava\u2014most likely because her money had bought her a cleaner file\u2014but every one of her arrests had stemmed from touching someone. Violently.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mind admitting he\u2019d been somewhat impressed with her before he\u2019d seen her. A former delinquent himself, he knew the gals and guys who\u2019d get down and dirty when necessary, uncaring whether they were hurt\u2014or worse\u2014always made the best agents.</p><p>Now he had to reevaluate. She looked like a tasty after-dinner treat ready to throw a tantrum over everything, not a potential badass.</p><p>He watched as she stretched her shoulders, her white T-shirt pulling tight over the plump rise of her breasts, the golden sun lancing down and worshipping flawless skin that somehow boasted a post-orgasmic flush. Hector stopped caring about relating and realized he wanted to do a little touching of his own.</p><p>Oh, hell, no. Attraction wasn\u2019t something he allowed himself to feel, even in the smallest degree. Touching wasn\u2019t something he allowed himself to do, ever. The one and only girlfriend he\u2019d had, he\u2019d accidentally killed.</p><p>Goddamn mutant arms, he thought with a snarl. Strong emotion literally fired them up, atomizing both into some kind of hot, molten steel that burned through bodies, ripped out organs, and hell, destroyed anything. Even a woman he only wanted to pleasure. So, lesson learned. He and females were not a good mix.</p><p>Friend and fellow agent Dallas Gutierrez stood on Hector\u2019s right and moaned as if in pain. \u201cSweet damn, but those legs are long enough to wrap around me like a pretzel. And God, I love pretzels. Anyone know when we break for lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my cousin, dickwad,\u201d Agent Jaxon Tremain said from Hector\u2019s left. Had Whacky Jacky been next to Dallas, he would have drilled his knuckles into the guy\u2019s bicep. \u201cWatch your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy watch my mouth do you mean I should invite your cuz back to my place for a game of Hide the Magic Wand, or my new personal fave, Puff on the Magic Dragon?\u201d Dallas asked conversationally. \u201cAnd I know what you\u2019re thinking. I\u2019m really into wizardry these days. Well, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Hector gave a rusty bark of laughter. He hadn\u2019t observed Dallas in this good a mood in a long time.</p><p>A low growl escaped Jaxon. \u201cI meant I\u2019d scoop out your liver with a spoon, you idiot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSterling silver or plastic?\u201d Hector asked. In their line of work, details were important. Besides, he liked being part of their banter. Considering the fact that his work friends were his only friends, and he rarely socialized after hours, this kind of thing made him feel connected, like a part of the team.</p><p>Team. Something he\u2019d never thought to be a part of, as dangerous as he was, but collaboration was a very important part of AIR. Sometimes the only thing that saved your neck was the man guarding your back.</p><p>Dallas groused, \u201cI remember the days when you were actually nice.\u201d</p><p>So did Hector. Once upon a time, Jaxon had been so by-the-book he could have been the book. Then he\u2019d met his wife, Mishka, and the pretty little assassin had somehow infected him with asshole-itis.</p><p>Jaxon liked to say she\u2019d helped him accept his \u201ctrue self.\u201d And he actually said it with pride and affection, rather than revulsion, as if being yanked out of the shithead closet was a good thing.</p><p>No one was pulling Hector out, and that was that. He was the way he was for a valid, life-saving reason, and that reason wasn\u2019t ever going to change. Therefore, neither was he.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be remembering anything,\u201d Jaxon said on a rumbling breath, \u201cif you say one more goddamn word about my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaxy!\u201d</p><p>The argument must have drawn Noelle\u2019s attention because she clapped her hands and twirled. Then, with a carefree laugh, she tossed her overstuffed duffel at Ava, raced across the distance, and flung herself into Jaxon\u2019s open arms.</p><p>Clapping? Twirling? Seriously? Maybe her record was exaggerated rather than cleaned, because damn, in that moment, the little-girl innocence radiating off her was astounding.</p><p>Sadly, that wasn\u2019t the turn-off it should have been. With those lush breasts and right side of dangerous curves, she was still one hundred percent woman.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there. AIR was his life, saving innocents his only goal. He\u2019d spent a good portion of his childhood locked in a cage, and had been forced to listen as his only brother was beaten to death. He never wanted anyone else to suffer that kind of tragedy. More than that, he never wanted to cause another tragedy.</p><p>Noelle, no matter how hot, was off limits. During camp, and forever after.</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d As she pulled back to look Jaxon over, she giggled like they were all at a sleepover and pillow fighting. Giggled, yeah, but there were hints of smoke in her voice. The naughty kind that made him think of sex. \u201cYou get handsomer\u2014more handsome? Whatever! You\u2019re prettier every time I see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, honey,\u201d Jaxon said. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for that, I\u2019m willing to forgive you for not calling, writing, or letting me crash at your place when I was being chased by the law.\u201d</p><p>The agent chucked her under the chin. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be aiding the law, Elle.\u201d</p><p>Elle. The nickname didn\u2019t fit her. It was too cutesy. Which, he supposed, should have fit the china doll in front of him. Actually, it did fit, except for those hints of smoke.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll aid the law, all right,\u201d she said with a flare of determination. \u201cJust as soon as I\u2019m given a badge.\u201d</p><p>Hector did his best to cut off his snort. He failed. As if she would last through a single week of training.</p><p>Before seeing her live and in person, he would have bet she\u2019d soar to the top of her class. After seeing her live and in person ... not just no, but are you fucking kidding me no. Whether she was truly violent or just a poser, no one he knew wanted a partner like her.</p><p>Those silvery-gray eyes flipped in his direction, narrowed briefly, swept up and down his body, as if seeing past his clothes and memorizing every detail. Then she looked away, dismissing him as if she\u2019d found him to be substandard.</p><p>All right, then. She didn\u2019t find him attractive. Good. That\u2019s actually what he preferred, because it saved him from having to deal with unwanted advances. In fact, he kept his head shaved to a glossy shine for just that reason. He was a man willing to do anything to discourage feminine attention.</p><p>Because yeah, females could be vanity hounds and most preferred their dates to have hair. Black, blond, red, it didn\u2019t matter, as long as the locks were thick and lustrous. And here was a news flash for little Miss Giggles: when he allowed his to grow, it was dark brown, nearly jet, with hints of gold and worthy of a fucking lion.</p><p>Not that he was feeling defensive or anything.</p><p>Besides, even if he\u2019d had hair, Noelle wouldn\u2019t have wanted him. Most females found him a little too intimidating to speak to, much less someone to consider hooking up with. And soft, pretty girl Noelle had to like soft, pretty boys. That\u2019s just the way the world worked.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d Jaxon said to the Sunday school cutie who\u2019d just ambled over to their group. Her duffel, as well as Noelle\u2019s, sagged from her arms, weighing her down. \u201cGood to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you, too.\u201d She returned the nod, curls bobbing around her face.</p><p>So. Ava and Noelle were friends. And long enough for the shorter girl to have met members of Noelle\u2019s extended family. Interesting. With their vastly different backgrounds, Hector never would have paired them.</p><p>Then again, Noelle enjoyed treating Ava like a servant. And Ava took it.</p><p>Huh. Why were they here again?</p><p>Ava leaned over to Noelle and whispered, \u201cAre you meaning to sound like such a douche?\u201d</p><p>Noelle winked at her.</p><p>If Hector hadn\u2019t been so focused on the pair, he would have missed the byplay. Now his attention sharpened. So ... there were times Noelle didn\u2019t sound like a douche? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Could the bubblehead thing be an act, then? If so, what was her purpose? And why hadn\u2019t Jaxon, her blood kin, recognized the difference?</p><p>That last question had Hector shaking his head, dismissing his suspicions. Jaxon was sharp, one of the best and most observant agents out there, and he would know his own cousin better than a friend/servant would.</p><p>Dallas cleared his throat, the universal sign for make-the-damn-introductions-already.</p> <p>Jaw clenched, Jaxon made them. Dallas first, then Hector. No one tried to shake anyone\u2019s hand, thank God, but at least Ava met his gaze. Noelle peered somewhere over his shoulder. After pinching Dallas\u2019s cheek as if he were the sweetest toddler she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Stupid shit enjoyed the fondling, giving her a high-wattage grin of encouragement.</p><p>\u201cYou both know I can\u2019t show you preferential treatment while you\u2019re here,\u201d Jaxon said, uneasy. His scarred face paled in the sunlight, becoming almost waxen. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we do.\u201d Finally removing her attention from Dallas, Noelle patted the top of Jaxon\u2019s head with the sugary tolerance usually reserved for the brain damaged. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay, because everyone else will.\u201d</p><p>Uh, that would be another are-you-kidding-no. No one got preferential treatment in this shit box.</p> <p>Hector was kicking things off this first week, and would then hand the reins of control over to Dallas, who would run things for a week before handing the reins to Jaxon for his week. Jaxon would then hand the reins to Ghost, as well as a female agent named Phoenix for their hell week. Then, Ghost and Phoenix would return the reins to Hector, and he\u2019d have to endure another seven days.</p><p>He\u2019d make damn sure Ghost and Phoenix knew these two were to be ridden harder than everyone else.</p><p>Ridden ... harder ...</p><p>Damn. Now he was Freuding himself. Arm-wise, that was the first sign of trouble.</p><p>Dallas he didn\u2019t have to worry about. Boy would know what to do. It was the principle of the thing and all.</p><p>\u201cI can guarantee you\u2019ll get the gold star treatment from me,\u201d Dallas said, bombing Hector\u2019s expectations into oblivion. \u201cAfter you answer a question for me. Do you like pretzels?\u201d</p> <p>Ava rolled her eyes and muttered something unintelligible under her breath.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, yes!\u201d Noelle\u2019s grin was all white teeth and that damn innocence. \u201cI love pretzels! They\u2019re just so yummalicious.\u201d</p><p>Yummalicious?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you said that,\u201d Dallas began. \u201cBecause\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jaxon reached around Hector and slugged Dallas in the jaw.</p><p>\u201cOw! What was that for?\u201d the agent grumbled, rubbing the already swelling area.</p><p>\u201cJust be happy I don\u2019t have a spoon.\u201d The scowl wiped from Jaxon\u2019s face as he gave Noelle his full concentration. \u201cDon\u2019t pay him any attention. Just ... go get settled, honey. Orientation starts in an hour.\u201d He gave her a gentle push in the direction she was supposed to go.</p><p>Noelle stopped at Ava\u2019s side and slung her arm over the girl\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll go. We know you guys have important stuff to do. I just want to say thank you. You\u2019ve done your best to make us feel welcome, and we\u2019re just so grateful.\u201d</p> <p>Were those tears in her eyes? Shit. They were. Deep down, he\u2019d known she was a crier. How pathetic. And even disappointing.</p><p>\u201cTake your bag already,\u201d Ava snipped at her. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, two hundred pounds heavier than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible. I merely brought the essentials. Clothes, my favorite boots, face cream, makeup, a few books to read, a couple cans of caviar, lingerie, and my coffeepot. Plus a few other things a girl like me just can\u2019t live without but can\u2019t mention in mixed company because it would be indelicate. You know, because they\u2019re sexual.\u201d There at the end, she whispered, the hints of smoke blending with echoes of midnight.</p><p>Worse, at \u201clingerie,\u201d Hector and Dallas had stood a little straighter. At \u201csexual,\u201d they\u2019d moaned. Jaxon punched them both in the back of the head.</p><p>Hector always ignored his attractions, yeah, but come on. Now images of the elegant Noelle wearing a trashy, barely-there scrap of lace and a take-a-bite-out-of-me grin were seared into his brain.</p><p>And wouldn\u2019t you know it? His arms began to burn, his hands to itch. The second and third signs of trouble.</p><p>If this kept up, his arms would begin to glow and the tattoos etched from his shoulders to his fingertips would crackle. The final oh, shit signs that meant he was nearly too late to stop the ensuing carnage, that his skin, muscle, and bone were about to mutate into fiery mist and melt everything he touched. A transition that would last several hours, until the heat finally lost steam and died down.</p><p>Problem was, he couldn\u2019t masturbate his sexual desires away because he\u2019d fry off his cock. And he couldn\u2019t take pills because they scrambled his cognitive process, preventing him from solving his cases.</p><p>So, when sexual frustration became too much for him and his arms, he called a hooker for a blow job. That way, the girl stayed on her knees, mostly out of reach, and he got off without having to worry about torching an entire town.</p><p>Another problem made itself known. He couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014call Happy Endings while he was here. That would mix the secret, seedier side of his personal life with the crucial business side, and he would never do that. AIR was the one pure thing in his life; he refused to taint it. For any reason.</p><p>\u201cI think I just heard someone groan from inside the bag.\u201d Ava shouted the words as she fumbled with the zipper. \u201cYou have a body in here, don\u2019t you? Well, you\u2019re not framing me again, and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>Noelle stepped away from her, palms up and out. \u201cDarling, just carry the thing already. You\u2019ve been whining about needing to step up your exercise program for a long time, and I\u2019ve decided to help you. You\u2019re welcome, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never asked\u2014oh!\u201d Ava stomped a foot. \u201cI\u2019m going to murder you in your sleep.\u201d</p><p>Noelle gasped, intense waves of hurt wafting from her. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just threatened me like that. I ... need a moment to collect myself. Excuse me, everyone.\u201d Sniffling, she walked away. Without taking her bag.</p><p>Frowning, Hector rubbed at the abrupt ache in his chest. What the hell? He actually cared that she\u2019d been threatened?</p><p>Ava followed after her friend, dragging both bags and mumbling under her breath about taking douchieness too far.</p><p>The three agents watched them go. Each for a different reason, Hector was sure. Jaxon, to make sure they entered the bunkhouse without any trouble. Dallas, to see his pretzel\u2019s perfect ass sway, and Hector because he just couldn\u2019t seem to stop himself.</p><p>\u201cGirls\u2019 bunk is upstairs, honey,\u201d Jaxon called. \u201cThere\u2019s an entrance to the right, so you won\u2019t have to go through the guys\u2019 area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks,\u201d Noelle returned without looking back\u2014and without moving to the right.</p><p>Funny, there hadn\u2019t been a trace of hurt remaining in her tone.</p><p>Ava finally managed to unload Noelle\u2019s stuff\u2014by drop-kicking it into the girl\u2019s path and causing her to stumble. Laughing, now free of her burden, Ava darted ahead of her. When Noelle righted herself, she swept up the nylon and raced forward, too, chuckling all the way. No more baby giggles for her, but a grown woman\u2019s amusement.</p><p>The change was startling, but understandable. She must have been nervous around them.</p><p>At the last moment, she shoved past Ava and reached the door to their new home first. The two disappeared from view.</p><p>O-kay, then. His final impression? Take the \u201cyummalicious\u201d then add the giggles, multiply the cluelessness and the split-second change of emotion, subtract the chuckling and the wink, and you most likely had a recipe for dumb as a box of rocks. Pretty as a cameo, yeah, that hadn\u2019t changed, but she was still dumb as a box of rocks.</p><p>No doubt about it now. Her record was exaggerated. Kinda like when the scrawny kid in class paid the bully to protect him. At the moment, Hector wasn\u2019t even sure Noelle Tremain could fight off a piece of lint.</p><p>\u201cHow many strings did you have to pull to get her here?\u201d he asked Jaxon.</p><p>The guy sighed, all kinds of weariness bubbling in the undertone. \u201cToo many.\u201d</p><p>Thought so. \u201cAnd why does someone like her want to do this?\u201d AIR agents worked long hours, made gruesome discoveries, and constantly waded through the darkest dredges of humanity. All of which had been lifesaving for Hector, but rich, pampered Noelle didn\u2019t need any saving.</p><p>\u201cShe said something about putting her kung fu skills to good use.\u201d Jaxon shook his head at the ridiculousness of his words. \u201cI laughed, so she finally admitted the truth. That she wants a chance to carry a badge and tell people what to do, then shoot them if they disobey her.\u201d</p><p>That, Hector believed. \u201cYou are such a sucker.\u201d</p><p>Good news was, there weren\u2019t enough strings anyone could pull if she screwed up. And she would. Probably before orientation ended.</p><p>The thought of never looking at that pretty face again caused an ache of ... something to smolder in his chest. The same ache he\u2019d experienced when she\u2019d reacted to Ava\u2019s threat.</p><p>He ignored that something, whatever it was, with the same determination he usually ignored his lusts.</p><p>I\u2019ll have you gone by the end of the day, Tremain. Guaranteed.</p><p>Two</p><p>NOELLE THREW HER DUFFEL\u2014WHICH was filled only with necessary clothes and shoes\u2014on the squeaky regulation twin rollaway and looked around. Honestly? This sucked sweaty donkey balls.</p><p>A hovel, that\u2019s what her new living quarters were. Peeling paint on the walls, a dirty concrete floor. No windows. No desks. No compusoles. Just a row of tiny beds and won\u2019t-hold-anything nightstands, with a layer of dust coating the air. So ... borderline-poverty basics, she thought with a grimace.</p><p>How would she survive?</p><p>There were only three essentials in Noelle\u2019s life. Ava, money, and comfort. In that order. Ava was her rock, her coconspirator, and her biggest supporter. But she couldn\u2019t wrap Ava around her like a mink to ward off the slight chill in the air. Not again. And her truck-loads of money were (supposedly) off limits while she was here. That meant comfort had a big fat \u201cdenied\u201d stamp over it.</p><p>For the next three months, at least. That\u2019s how long she was required to stay here. But the worst part? When those three torturous months were up, she still wouldn\u2019t be considered an AIR agent. Not until someone within the organization finally deemed her worthy enough to carry a badge.</p><p>Yeah, good luck with that. No one besides Ava had ever before deemed Noelle worthy of anything\u2014except therapy. Her parents had claimed to love her and her dad had sought to protect her, but she\u2019d never been ... enough. Not for either of them.</p><p>Can\u2019t you do anything right? How many times had her father shouted that little gem? In fact, he\u2019d been dead for years, but every so often she would swear he was yelling at her from the grave.</p><p>Are you really that stupid, Noelle Jade? Then and now, that was her mother\u2019s favorite phrase. And tossing in her middle name for that extra demoralizing affect? Priceless.</p><p>God, Noelle, when are you going to grow up? That delightful query came courtesy of her three older brothers every time a news station blasted a story about something she\u2019d done.</p><p>Corban Blue, the first, last, and only real boyfriend/ relationship she\u2019d taken a chance on, had insisted on picking out her clothes, telling her how to wear her hair and what to say. And yet, she\u2019d stayed with him for a little over a year, proving her mother right. How stupid was she?</p><p>Only when Corban had demanded she cut Ava from her life had she dumped him. That very day, actually. Hell, that very minute.</p><p>The moment the door had closed on his ass, Noelle had realized she had never really loved him, that she\u2019d just hoped someone would ... want her, she supposed. Someone who would at last admire and respect her, even in the smallest way, beyond her looks and money. Someone who would fill the void inside her. That hollow, hungry place that had never known a moment of satisfaction.</p><p>A void carved from anger, frustration, and bitterness. A wound that never quite healed, sometimes flared up, but always poisoned her sense of self. Her hands fisted at her sides.</p><p>Well, not this time. If AIR didn\u2019t want her, she\u2019d start her own agency and offer them a little competition in the bagging and tagging of predatory otherworlders\u2019 business. Wasn\u2019t like she truly wanted to be an agent. But Ava did, she reminded herself, and what Ava wanted, Ava got. So, never mind on the new agency. Noelle was doing this, one way or another.</p><p>\u201cRemind me why we\u2019re excited to be here again,\u201d she said to Ava, needing the pep talk after the award-winning performance she\u2019d had to put on for the Three Blind Mice outside.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make a difference, fight injustice, blah blah blah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blah blah blah part sounds familiar, but I\u2019m still mostly drawing a blank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you remember the part about getting to carry a weapon and hurt people legally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Now it\u2019s coming back to me.\u201d But seriously. Starve her, beat her, sleep deprive her, but don\u2019t take away her feather down comforter. Or her genuine wool rug. Or her servants. God, what she wouldn\u2019t give to have a servant fetching and carrying for her this very second.</p><p>\u201cHow sweet is this?\u201d Ava spun like a ballerina on crack, her arms splayed. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect, just perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you retarded? This place is a dump,\u201d another agent-in-training said as she folded her shirts and jeans and placed them in the nightstand next to her bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bed next to Noelle\u2019s.</p><p>First, no one but Noelle was allowed to speak to Ava like that. Ever. She loved Ava more than she loved herself. Maybe because Ava was the one person in the world she trusted. The one person in the world who always told her the truth, straight up, nothing held back. The one person in the world who thought Noelle was perfect, just the way she was.</p><p>Second, it was important to establish a prison-like hierarchy right from the beginning. That way, no one would dare try to shank them.</p> <p>A quick twist and kick on Noelle\u2019s part and the girl\u2019s nylon went skidding across the floor, panties flying in every direction. Another kick, and the girl followed. \u201cSay something like that to her again, and your balls will take the same path as you and your underwear. Feel me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle, my love,\u201d Ava said in a sing-song voice, balancing her bag on the now vacant bed. \u201cI think the person in question is female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my bad. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she told the girl with the same saccharine sweetness she\u2019d used on the guys. Her hand fluttered up to her heart, baby bird delicate. \u201cI thought you were a dude. It\u2019s the mustache. That\u2019ll fool me every time.\u201d</p><p>Huffing and puffing, the \u201cperson in question\u201d jumped to her feet. \u201cJust what are you gonna cut my balls with, bitch? They frisked you same as they frisked me. You got nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Question of the day: was now the time to reveal the switchblade she\u2019d smuggled in?</p> <p>Nah, she thought next. The girl was a crier. On the bus, the black and very gorgeous instructor, Ghost, had gotten in her face and called her a carbon-based waste of space, and her freaking bottom lip had quivered.</p><p>Talk about humiliating to watch. Noelle hadn\u2019t cried since her father paid his medical staff to fry her nerve endings and destroy her pain receptors while she was still awake, and she sure as shit wasn\u2019t going to cry when someone called her silly names.</p><p>And okay, her dad had done the unthinkable to safeguard her from ever being tortured by others, but that didn\u2019t change the facts. At twelve, she\u2019d been strapped to a gurney and cut open like a melon.</p><p>All because she\u2019d been abducted a few weeks before, her captors wanting to cash in on her ransom. To prove how serious they were, they\u2019d sent her parents video of her being beaten, screaming from the pain and begging for help. So, when her dad had gotten her back, he\u2019d gone a little nutso.</p><p>That little receptor-frying procedure had taken endless, torture-filled days, with needles shoved into her tendons, muscles, and sometimes even drilled into her bones. Days of having what seemed to be acid and broken glass poured straight into her bloodstream.</p><p>Anytime she\u2019d passed out, the doctors had woken her up with chemical injections to the heart. Adrenaline, and crap like that. She\u2019d had to tell them when something hurt, after all, so they\u2019d know where to concentrate their efforts.</p> <p>Well, everything had hurt. Until the very end, when she\u2019d stopped feeling anything at all.</p><p>\u201cJust going to stand there, coward?\u201d the girl huffed at her.</p><p>Coward? Oh, hell, no. Noelle was a lot of things\u2014spoiled, sometimes cruel and clueless, always gorgeous\u2014but never a coward. She had survived a hell most people would only ever have nightmares about.</p><p>If you flash metal, the first thing she\u2019ll do is run. The second is tattle.</p><p>Was that enough to get Noelle kicked out?</p><p>Ava must have known she was thinking about risking it because her friend, who knew her better than anyone else in the world, whipped her cell phone from her pocket, pressed a few buttons, leaned over, and said, \u201cLookie, Noelle. Lookie at what Ava\u2019s got,\u201d to distract her.</p><p>\u201cAs if that\u2019ll\u2014ohhh, a pretty!\u201d A holophoto of Noelle had crystallized above the small device.</p><p>Usually Ava only snapped her picture when she was at her worst. Black eye\u2014boom, there was Ava. Hangover morning\u2014Ava again. Nasty cold\u2014hello, darling Ava. But in this one, Noelle was leaning against a doorjamb, hands stuffed in her pockets, her expression far away, as if she were lost in thought.</p> <p>\u201cWhen did you take this?\u201d she asked, unable to find the memory herself.</p><p>\u201cA few months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re just now showing me? Harsh, Ava. So harsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m talking to you,\u201d Mustache Girl snarled. I\u2019ll call her MG for short, she mused, before saying to Ava, \u201cI look so smart. I bet I was pondering nuclear physics. Or maybe quantum mechanics. Oh, oh, I know. Paradox theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019d just asked you if you\u2019d eaten my granola bar.\u201d</p><p>MG gave up waiting for a response and wandered away to find a new rollaway.</p><p>\u201cSend it to me.\u201d Noelle rubbed her hands together. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be my new screen saver. For reals.\u201d</p><p>The photo disappeared, and Ava stashed the phone back in her pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll send it to you the day you share the butterscotch candies you\u2019re having delivered here.\u201d</p><p>Always the negotiator, her Ava. \u201cSorry, darling, but I\u2019m not\u2014ah, wait. I feel you, oh, devious one.\u201d Butterscotch was Ava\u2019s biggest weakness. \u201cI\u2019ll have them here by the end of the week, you just wait and see.\u201d Making her friend happy was one of her top priorities in life. \u201cUntil then ...\u201d Where had their conversation left off before they were so rudely interrupted? Oh, yeah. \u201cAre you retarded? This place is a dump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you forget. I\u2019ve lived in worse.\u201d</p><p>True. They\u2019d met in junior high, when Noelle had been acting out to prove her parents\u2019 disapproval meant nothing to her and had (allegedly) burned her former boarding school to the ground. Ava had been desperate to lose her drunken mom\u2019s attention, as well as the attention of the nasty men her mom had allowed to parade through their trailer.</p><p>They\u2019d needed each other, and so they had clung to each other. Hell, they still did. There was nothing Noelle wouldn\u2019t do for her beloved Ava. Commit murder? Sure, why not. Only thing to figure out was where to hide the body. Lie, cheat, steal? Done, done, and done. Eagerly, happily. Ava was the best thing that had ever happened to her, and Noelle took care of what was hers.</p><p>And yeah, they razzed each other. A lot. Matching \u201cdim wits\u201d with little Ava, as Noelle\u2019s brothers used to say, was fun. Torturing her was even more fun. But at the end of the day, if anyone else even looked at Ava funny, Noelle went lethally insane.</p><p>Speaking of funny looks. \u201cDid you see the way that Hector guy eyed me up and down, as if I belonged in a scientific studies magazine for newly discovered fungus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but did you see his muscles?\u201d Ava threw MG\u2019s forgotten wardrobe over her shoulder before unpacking her own.</p><p>\u201cHow could I miss them? His I\u2019ve-tasted-human-heart-and-liked-it black T-shirt was strained to the point of lunacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVocab lesson time. You mean lewdness. As in, indecent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff your lesson. I meant lunacy. As in crazy. One glance and my brain short-circuited.\u201d Short-circuited with the urge to touch, the desire to lick, the need to claim.</p><p>None of which she understood! Claim? Not in this lifetime.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t her usual type. He was tall, tattooed, and bald, with the cruelest frown she\u2019d ever seen. Oh, she liked \u2019em tall, but tattooed? No. Try refined. Bald? Even peaches sported fur.</p><p>Although he wasn\u2019t bald from age or genetics. A shadow of stubble had covered his scalp, proof his roots were there and thriving. So, obviously, he shaved. But who shaved on purpose? And why?</p><p>She\u2019d almost asked him. Only thing that stopped her was the suspicion he would ignore her. Because the entire time she\u2019d stood there, trying not to notice him but noticing him anyway, he\u2019d had her under that microscope for fungi\u2014and clearly found her the worst of the lot. Honest to God, that frown of his had made her shudder. Or shiver. She wasn\u2019t sure which. But there was no denying something about him appealed to her.</p><p>His eyes were an intense gold and utterly piercing, the rest of his features all kinds of intimidating. From the hard slash of his dark brows, to the blade of his nose, to the aggressive slant of his lips. Throw in the rough angle of his chin, and you had a visual definition for hardass.</p><p>And okay, okay, a beautiful visual, at that, with the kind of rugged sex appeal one might find in a survivalist. Which ... come to think of it, was a favorite fantasy of Noelle\u2019s.</p><p>She\u2019d often imagined herself alone in the mountains, some kind of hungry animal chasing her down. Survivalist Guy jumped from the shadows and saved the day. Then he turned to face her, shirtless, sweaty, kind of grungy, his pants ripped and stained with the creature\u2019s blood and gore, and he refused to wait for her to thank him. He just backed her up against a tree and plundered the living hell out of her mouth.</p><p>Sweet heaven. A definite shiver this time.</p><p>You don\u2019t go for hardasses in real life, remember?</p><p>Yeah, but Hector had such wide shoulders. And even as tall as she was, he\u2019d towered over her. He\u2019d dwarfed her, really. Made her feel small ... feminine. She liked feeling small and feminine, she realized.</p><p>\u201cOkay, time\u2019s up,\u201d Ava said. \u201cI gave you a chance, but you didn\u2019t take it. So, I call dibs!\u201d</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>Noelle was not disappointed. If one of them called dibs on a guy, the other had to back off. Besties before testes, and all that. So, no touching, no licking, and no claiming Hector for herself.</p><p>\u201cFine, but I\u2019ve got dibs on Dallas.\u201d Rather than unpack\u2014surely someone would eventually do that for her\u2014she jumped on her mattress. Dust plumped from the stiff syn-cotton covers, making her cough, scowl.</p><p>Maybe when she phoned for those candies, she\u2019d request a maid. One maid. AIR could not deny her such an indispensable part of life, a service as necessary as breathing. Not if she had her attorney threaten them. Food for thought.</p><p>\u201cDallas.\u201d Ava closed her nightstand drawer and rigged a lock on the handle to keep people like MG out of her stuff. \u201cGood choice. He\u2019s a gorgeous one.\u201d</p><p>And he was more Noelle\u2019s type. Tall, dark, and pretty. Although there\u2019d been a serial-killer vibe in his electric blues. Something that could explain why she wasn\u2019t as drawn to him as she was to Hector.</p><p>Even though Hector gave off the same vibe.</p><p>So, okay, there was a flaw in her logic. Big deal. She wasn\u2019t admitting to an attraction to Hector. Not aloud, at least. One, he clearly wasn\u2019t interested in her. And well, reason number two kinda fell back on reason number one. Being with a man who did not absolutely, utterly adore her would screw with her hard-won self-esteem and mess her up inside.</p><p>She\u2019d start trying to prove herself worthy of him. Like baking him a cake after his terrible day at work, when she and kitchens were long-time enemies. Or pretending not to care when he blew her off or forgot her birthday. Or attending parties with her family when she\u2019d rather have her skin peeled from her bones, just because that\u2019s what good girls did.</p><p>Noelle was done with that kind of thing. Done with trying to be something other than what she was. If a guy couldn\u2019t see the treasure underneath the smart mouth, he didn\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>And I am a treasure, damn it. Right?</p><p>Ava finished her chore and snuggled up beside Noelle on the bed. \u201cSo tell me. What was all that lame-assed giggling about? And the couldn\u2019t-find-my-brain-if-given-a-map-and-a-shovel stupidity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the laziness,\u201d she said, being helpful. As always. Automatically Noelle rolled to her side and tucked her hands under her cheek. This was how the two of them had spent many a night during their childhood. Lying side by side, chatting for hours.</p><p>Those were her favorite memories. Nothing she\u2019d said had ever shocked or disgusted Ava.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Ava rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re always lazy. That\u2019s just part of your charm.\u201d</p><p>And one of her more intelligent traits, if she did say so herself. Why do something for yourself when plenty of people wanted\u2014and needed\u2014to be paid to do it for you?</p><p>God, I\u2019m such a giver.</p><p>\u201cOh, and the next time you want to go the master-slave route,\u201d Ava said, \u201cI need at least a month\u2019s warning to work on my biceps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider this your warning. I want to go the master-slave route for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>A snort. \u201cDid I mention that I loved the pretend hurt over my death threat? Classic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I can say? I totally missed my calling as the best actress in the world.\u201d</p><p>A calling she\u2019d missed because she\u2019d never actually planned to work.</p><p>Noelle would have gladly financed Ava\u2019s entire life of leisure, saving her friend\u2014and herself\u2014from ever having to get a job. But Ava actually enjoyed earning her own way, so Noelle always went along for the ride.</p><p>They\u2019d worked in a bakery, at a used car lot, inside a makeup factory, and as interns at her brother\u2019s law firm. Sad truth was, Noelle would rather toil herself into an early grave than be without her best friend.</p><p>Codependency, thy name is Noelle. Did she care? God, no. She just loved Ava.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ava prompted. \u201cWhat gives?\u201d</p><p>Noelle pushed out a breath. \u201cWell, you know my family has always viewed me as a useless doll.\u201d Not just her immediate family, but her cousins, aunts, and uncles, and anyone else associated with the Tremain name. They fed off each other, delighting in sharing humiliating stories about the things she\u2019d done and said.</p><p>\u201cUseless, but so beautiful.\u201d Ava nodded. \u201cYeah. Continue.\u201d</p><p>She beamed. \u201cI knew you thought I was hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude. If you had a penis, I\u2019d freaking marry you.\u201d</p><p>A genuine chuckle left her. \u201cAnyway, I was just giving Jaxon a taste of what he expected.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLesbos,\u201d MG muttered as she walked past them, heading toward the ... enzyme showers.</p><p>\u201cTranny,\u201d Ava threw at her.</p><p>Ugh. Group showers. Sure, you could remain fully clothed in an enzyme stall, and the dry mist would even clean your shoes, but Noelle preferred to strip and sing in private.</p> <p>At home, she bathed in water. The real deal, which was hugely expensive, but she didn\u2019t care. There was something so soothing about the patter of liquid against porcelain, the spray of hot water against skin, the enveloping, invigorating steam that filled your nose, your lungs.</p><p>Ava snuggled closer. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus,\u201d Noelle continued as if there\u2019d never been a lag in the conversation, \u201cI thought it\u2019d be prudent to lower Hector and Dallas\u2019s expectations. You know, start at the bottom and fly our way up.\u201d Thereby making it easier to prove themselves.</p><p>What\u2019s this? Trying to prove yourself already? Tsk, tsk.</p><p>AIR wasn\u2019t a potential boyfriend. She could make an allowance, but only this once. And only because Ava wanted this so badly.</p> <p>\u201cNormally I\u2019d agree with your methods,\u201d Ava said, \u201cbut we kinda need their support if we\u2019re going to pass this thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ll more than pass. We\u2019ll crush this place.\u201d Delicate fingers smoothed the hair from her brow. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019re too awesome to do anything less. Plus, we\u2019ve got good old-fashioned lust on our side. I think Dallas was imagining your body twined around his like a pretzel. Hence his asinine question about pretzels and Jaxon\u2019s swift retaliation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, Dally was just showing off in front of his friends. Which is why I went with Oh, my God, as if I really thought he meant the food, but afterward, I felt like I should have brought it down a notch and said OMG.\u201d</p><p>The corners of Ava\u2019s mouth twitched with her amusement. \u201cWould have been priceless, and I would have broken a few ribs from laughing. As it was, I just peed a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other guys? How\u2019d they react?\u201d Not too obvious, not too eager. \u201cI was too entrenched in my role to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaxon was embarrassed by you. Sorry. And Hector was disapproving.\u201d</p> <p>No disappointment. You knew they felt that way.</p><p>Had Jaxon told Hector embarrassing stories about her before her arrival? she wondered suddenly. Was that why Hector had frowned at her the moment she\u2019d stepped off the bus?</p><p>Her cheeks heated as she imagined exactly what Jaxon could have shared. The time she\u2019d interrupted a dinner party her parents had thrown, walking through the dining room in only a bikini, giving an elderly gent a heart attack. All because earlier that day her father had said, \u201cYou want better grades, buy them. You don\u2019t have what it takes to earn them on your own and I\u2019m sick and tired of being embarrassed by your lackluster performance,\u201d and she\u2019d hoped to punish him.</p><p>Or the time she\u2019d filmed a bit part as a murdered waitress in Chucky\u2019s Evil Twin, just to embarrass her elitist mother. Another punishment. The week before, Madam Tremain, as Ava sometimes liked to call her, had asked all her friends to send their single sons Noelle\u2019s way so that she\u2019d stop \u201cdigging through the trash for her dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy math could be off here,\u201d Ava went on, \u201cbut I\u2019m pretty sure all three guys thought you\u2019d been dropped on your head one hundred and seven times.\u201d</p><p>Noelle gave another chuckle, a common occurrence in Ava\u2019s presence. \u201cTeaching them better is gonna make this experience,\u201d delicious, exciting, thrilling, \u201chalfway tolerable.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>AIR Training Camp</p> <p>Day Five</p><p>NOELLE HAD LIVED THROUGH orientation.</p><p>She also had lived through the first round of drills. And the second ... third ... and fourth\u2014no thanks to her instructor. Hector Dean had it out for her, for real, demanding she run faster, climb higher, and shoot straighter than anyone else.</p><p>Whenever he felt she wasn\u2019t giving something her all, which was all the damn time, he yelled at her.</p><p>Usually that kind of thing pissed her off and sent her spiraling\u2014either with anger or frustration, causing her to act out. Instead, she truly found herself running faster, climbing higher, and shooting straighter.</p><p>Trying to prove herself to him\u2014and not just for Ava\u2019s benefit either. For her own. Just like she\u2019d done with her parents and Corban. And yet, this time around, the experiences filled her with a weird blend of happiness and sadness. Happiness because she was succeeding, sadness because Hector didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>Why am I never good enough?</p><p>Well, whatever. She wasn\u2019t going to ponder that mystery again, and she wasn\u2019t going think about AIR or Hector. Wasn\u2019t going to consider how good he always smelled. Like fresh laundry and a storm-drenched sky. Wasn\u2019t going to remember the way his eyes glittered like amber when someone\u2014namely her\u2014pricked his ire. Or the way the swirling tattoos on his arms flexed erotically, highlighting the thick muscles underneath, whenever he moved. Or the strange way her blood heated every time she looked at him.</p><p>She\u2019d go insane. With rage. Yes, rage, and not an insatiable urge to fling herself against him and slide her tongue into his mouth. Ava had called dibs, after all. Not that Ava had done anything about it. There\u2019d been no time for flirtation, and at the end of each day, everyone was too exhausted to do anything but collapse into bed.</p><p>Not Noelle, though. Not tonight. She deserved a break. From Hector, from exercise ... from her own tormenting thoughts. Plus, Ava wanted those butterscotch candies and Noelle hadn\u2019t yet found a way to have them delivered.</p><p>That changed now.</p><p>Having peeked at (cough stolen cough) the week\u2019s schedule, she knew the agents planned to let the recruits sleep the entire night. A first\u2014and a one-time-only thing. A reward of sorts for Ava setting a camp record at target practice. Go Ava! The little tyrant had hit her mark every damn time, no matter the angle she\u2019d stood, and even when they\u2019d blindfolded her.</p><p>That\u2019s my girl. So, while Noelle\u2019s peers snoozed and snored, and while the agents zoned out in front of a plasma screen, she snuck out of camp.</p><p>Midweek, she\u2019d found an escape hatch on premises. Her dad had been an intelligence agent for the government as well as a businessman, and he\u2019d taught her that Plan B\u2019s were a necessity. So, while it was smart of AIR to have a place for trainees to go if otherworlders attacked, they should have hidden it better than underneath the back porch of the trainee bunk, with only a thin layer of dirt covering the lid.</p><p>Why not just hang a sign overhead that flashed the words Party Through Here.</p><p>Noelle had to shimmy underneath the wooden porch slats, streaking her bare arms and legs with the dirt, and ended up inhaling a mouthful of granules, but ... Worth it. No one had used the thing in years, as proven by the rusty hinges. The air inside was musty and coated with dust.</p><p>Fortunately, the long, narrow tunnel had everlasting bulbs posted on the rounded ceiling, providing a well-lit path for anyone who walked. Or ... drove? Hells yeah! There were three small go-carts lined up and ready to shoot into action.</p><p>I must have died and gone to heaven. Noelle climbed into the car at the head of the line. Voice activation and thumbprint ID had been disabled. Probably because the AIR agents who came to camp varied greatly. So all she had to do was turn the key already resting in the ignition.</p><p>The engine roared to life loudly, making her cringe and pray no one inside the overhead bunk heard. She waited a moment, expecting someone to peel back the lid, but ... no.</p><p>Grinning, she pressed the gas, and boom, shot into motion, speeding down the tunnel, twisting, turning, the blasts of air lifting her hair from her shoulders and winding the strands together.</p><p>Take that, Hector Dean. Not that she was thinking about him.</p><p>Exhilaration pumped through her blood. She\u2019d so needed this, every fiber of her being crying out for something that would fulfill her and quench the constant hunger for more. In fact, she would have to find a way to win another night off. Ava had to see this.</p><p>Even better, Ava had to race her.</p><p>Twenty minutes later the tunnel ended abruptly. A wall of brick with a dilapidated wooden staircase hanging in the center loomed ahead. Noelle slammed on the brakes, barely missing a lethal smash. She laughed out loud. Fun.</p><p>After shutting off the car, she climbed the steps, picked the lock of the new hatch, and shoved the heavy metal aside. Cool night wind blustered as she peeked out. Two graffiti-covered buildings at her sides. They were several yards apart, with a dark abandoned alley in the center, leading straight to\u2014</p><p>New Chicago\u2019s Main.</p><p>Rock on.</p><p>She climbed the last step and shimmed to a stand, then closed the lid and gaped. Wow. Anyone who walked this alley would see cracked concrete, nothing more.</p><p>Urgency riding her, she grabbed the lipstick from her pocket\u2014a girl had to be prepared for anything\u2014and marked the rim, then tossed the now-contaminated gloss in a nearby trash bin.</p><p>Her exit strategy taken care of, Noelle practically skipped from the alley. She made sure to note the shops. One a twenty-four-hour photo. The other an abandoned, crumbling crack house. Quaint.</p><p>She also made a mental note to inquire about buying both buildings. She could fix the alley, maybe turn it into a garden-type area, then run goods and services through the tunnel at her discretion.</p><p>What a day!</p><p>Cars whizzed along the road. Bikes and scooters, too. Despite the late hour, crowds had yet to thin on this poorer side of town. Humans and otherworlders traipsed the sidewalks, talking, laughing, shopping. She spotted a few Arcadians, the race known for white hair that couldn\u2019t be dyed, the ability to teleport, and in some cases, the ability to use mind control.</p><p>A group of Terans, a very cat-like species, with pointed ears, spotted skin, and feline grace. One Mec, tall and thin, with skin that glowed different colors with different emotions. And two Deleseans, with six arms and azure skin that kind of reminded her of whale blubber.</p><p>One day I\u2019ll be policing these people. A surreal thought. Noelle had always been the troublemaker. So, arresting others for breaking the law? Kinda seemed wrong.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why Hector kept pushing her so intently. Maybe he doubted her capability and integrity, as she\u2019d first assumed, and thought to mold her into something better.</p><p>You don\u2019t need improvement.</p><p>And you\u2019re not thinking about him.</p><p>Deep breath in, filled with the scents of corn dogs\u2014her mouth watered\u2014car exhaust and perfumes, as well as faint traces of dirt and ... other things. Towering lamps lined the streets, and the shop signs pulsed. Live Nude Girls. World\u2019s Best Coffee. A Toys R Us right beside a Hooters. The moon was full, a shining beacon of gold.</p><p>\u201cHey, darlin\u2019,\u201d someone called. \u201cHow much for an hour?\u201d</p><p>He better not be talking to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, you, in the red shorts. I\u2019ll take whatever you\u2019re selling, no matter the price.\u201d</p><p>Yep. Me. The only clothes she\u2019d had were for working out. Right now she sported a red tank and matching too-tight shorts. Streaked by dirt as she was, she probably looked like she spent a lot of time on her knees and back. Plus, her hair was tangled, as if someone had plowed their fingers through one too many times.</p><p>Someone had, of course, but that someone was her.</p><p>Noelle didn\u2019t bother searching for the guy, just threw a finger in the direction of his voice and kept walking.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>His friends snickered.</p><p>Yeah, yeah. Took her fifteen minutes, but she finally found a candy store. A bell chimed above the door when she entered. Ava would flip out of her mind when Noelle presented her with a butterscotch breakfast in bed.</p><p>Stray thought: Who served Hector breakfast in bed?</p><p>Noelle\u2019s teeth ground together sharply. The answer didn\u2019t matter. Hector was her instructor, nothing more. Not once had he ever acted as if he found her attractive.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the guy behind the counter asked.</p><p>She sized him up with a single glance. Human. Late forties. Comb-over, sugar gut. He wore a white apron and earned major points for cleanliness.</p><p>The store itself was small, with three display cases and nothing in the way of furniture. Definitely needed a new business manager. There were no couches for customers to sit on so they could chat and eat more and more of the candy. No tables offering samples and free alcohol to encourage unwise spending, as she was used to.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in the butterscotch department?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d He thumped a finger on the glass at his right, just above a plate of what looked to be fudge squares. \u201cJust these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them.\u201d</p><p>One of his brows winged into a stray lock falling down his forehead. \u201cOne or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll.\u201d</p><p>Cash signs practically glowing in his eyes, he got to work, wrapping the squares individually and stacking them carefully in a small box.</p><p>The bell over the door gave another chime. The server glanced up, said, \u201cI\u2019ll be with\u2014\u201d then snapped his mouth closed and gulped with apprehension. His bloated cheeks paled. \u201cUh, just a second, please.\u201d</p><p>Robber? Thug? Noelle spun around\u2014and came face-to-face with her tormentor.</p><p>Hector Dean stood in the doorway, wearing a black T-shirt that molded to his muscles and black slacks that hugged his thighs indecently. He scowled over at her, his golden eyes glittered brightly. His arms were folded over his chest, and his legs braced apart, as if he meant to leap into an attack at any moment.</p><p>Oh ... shit.</p><p>Four</p><p>NOELLE,\u201d HE SAID TIGHTLY, his voice full of gravel.</p><p>\u201cHector.\u201d What did it say about her that she was aroused rather than scared? He looked capable of murder, his hard features cold and merciless, but damn if he wasn\u2019t sexy as all hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe because he wasn\u2019t yelling at her.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>\u201cBuying a few sweet treats.\u201d Her heart sped into a too-swift rhythm. I will not come on to him. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I, uh, call the cops?\u201d the server said from behind her.</p><p>\u201cHe is a cop,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>Frost appeared in Hector\u2019s eyes, a snowstorm of menace. \u201cYou think AIR doesn\u2019t monitor that tunnel? You think they\u2019d place a hatch in town and not watch it? You were tailed the second you hit the alley, and I was notified.\u201d</p><p>The crack house, she thought. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Why hadn\u2019t she considered the possibility of cameras and alarms? Had she wanted to be caught? And why hadn\u2019t she sensed the tail?</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be, uh, twenty-one seventy,\u201d the server said now.</p><p>The frost thickened in Hector\u2019s eyes, his spine stiffened.</p><p>Nibbling on her bottom lip, she dug her ultra-thin money card from her pocket, flashed it in front of the scanner and added a twenty-dollar tip.</p><p>A bright smile full of yellowing teeth. \u201cThank you, thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome.\u201d She grabbed the box and returned her attention to Hector.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t moved from his command post at the entrance, probably assuming she wouldn\u2019t try to fight her way out, or that she would plead for mercy he wouldn\u2019t show. As if! She raised her chin. \u201cYou kicking me out of the program or what?\u201d</p> <p>If he does, I will have failed Ava. Her stomach somersaulted, acid tumbling around like clothes in an enzyme washer. I can\u2019t fail Ava.</p><p>He popped his jaw before reaching back and shoving open the door. With a tilt of his chin, he motioned her out. Well, well. He must not want a witness to what would happen next.</p><p>The acid burned a path up her chest. Still, Noelle strapped an imaginary iron rod to her back and marched into the night. She didn\u2019t look back to be sure Hector followed, and she didn\u2019t wait for him, either. She headed back the same way she\u2019d come, not bothering to move out of the way as pedestrians approached; she simply barreled past them.</p><p>The streetlamps suddenly seemed too bright, the roaring car engines and inane chatter too loud.</p><p>Hector caught up with her quickly enough, his booted feet stomping into the concrete. \u201cI take my job seriously, you know,\u201d he began.</p><p>O-kay. Not the direction she\u2019d anticipated. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>A crackling pause. \u201cDid you really just ask me why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Not to be facetious or anything, but because she was curious about him.</p> <p>\u201cI stop predatory aliens from hurting others,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cI save lives.\u201d</p><p>And didn\u2019t that just make him even sexier? she thought with a wistful sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to be an agent?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd don\u2019t give me that bullshit about wanting to shoot people legally.\u201d</p><p>So Jaxon had told him about that.</p><p>Hector went on, \u201cI believed it before, but I\u2019ve seen the way you push yourself.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d seen\u2014and been impressed? She wouldn\u2019t get her hopes up on that front. \u201cTo be honest, I just want to spent more time with Ava.\u201d No reason to lie. If AIR had decided to can her, she would be canned, no matter what she said.</p><p>A beat of silence. Most likely her bluntness had stunned him. That happened a lot. With her family, her friends, everyone but Ava. \u201cWell,\u201d he finally said, \u201cyour reason sucks, and it won\u2019t get you anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would a girl like me want or need to get anywhere?\u201d she asked, only the slightest trace of bitterness escaping.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl like me crap. You\u2019ve got determination and drive, and you should be proud of it, not masking it with sarcasm.\u201d</p><p>Hector Dean had just ... praised her. She was dreaming. She had to be dreaming. \u201cAre you saying I\u2019d ... make a good agent?\u201d</p><p>Another beat of silence, as if he had to gather his thoughts. And that was answer enough, wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>Knew better than to ask. Also, good thing she hadn\u2019t gotten her hopes up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying you need to think long and hard about whether or not you\u2019re right for this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard and it\u2019s dirty.\u201d</p><p>Even as she fought the urge to punch him in the face for implying she couldn\u2019t handle something like that, she forced her voice to go low and husky. \u201cHmm, hard and dirty. Just how I like my sex.\u201d</p><p>He tripped over nothing and, scowling, hurried to right himself. \u201cA few weeks ago, we found a storage unit with three otherworlder females trapped inside. They had been taken as prisoners, were malnourished, and near death. Is that something you can handle?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she could. She could handle anything. Rather than answer him, however, she asked a question of her own. \u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe set them free, got them medical care. Now they\u2019re on the mend, both mentally and physically.\u201d</p><p>Ire rose on behalf of the females. \u201cYou catch whoever put them there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but we will.\u201d</p><p>The words held a promise, a vow to avenge the weak. His sexiness factor jacked up a few more notches, and she shivered. \u201cYou really love your job. I mean, you more than take it seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He sound astonished that she\u2019d think otherwise. \u201cIt\u2019s my life,\u201d he added.</p><p>Like Ava was hers. Fancy that\u2014they had something in common. Both of them cared about something more than they cared about themselves. I will not admire him.</p><p>They turned a corner. A split second later, Hector slammed his shoulder into hers, shoving her into a shadowed brick wall in an abandoned alley. Gasping in astonishment, the touch catching her off guard, she lost her hold on the candy box. Splat. The bottom busted and the contents spilled out onto dirty concrete.</p><p>Oh, gross. There went Ava\u2019s surprise.</p><p>\u201cHey! That was uncalled for, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>A growling Hector got in her face, putting them nose-to-nose. He glared down at her as the heat of his breath fanned against her, caressing her despite his obvious anger. \u201cYou should be kicked out for this little adventure. If I had my way, you would be kicked out, effective immediately.\u201d</p><p>And I should knee you in the balls. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d she snapped, keeping her knee to herself. She hadn\u2019t been this close to a man in a long time. And that the one so close to her was Hector, a brute who shouldn\u2019t appeal to her but did ... her stomach fluttered with hot flames of arousal. Her nipples tightened beneath the fabric of her bra, abrading deliciously.</p><p>He pressed closer to her, caging her completely.</p><p>Suddenly she had trouble catching her breath. Her gaze lowered to his mouth, and her survivalist fantasy came roaring back to life. Just then, Hector was the epitome of danger, a man who saved the day and demanded his due. A man who took what he wanted, damn the consequences.</p><p>What would he taste like? How would his strong body feel moving on\u2014in\u2014hers?</p><p>His pupils flared, black overshadowing gold. Had she somehow given her thoughts away?</p><p>\u201cYou disobeyed orders, Noelle. You put the entire camp in jeopardy. How is that not doing anything wrong?\u201d</p><p>A spark of anger ignited, burning away the fear of being found out, but somehow increasing the arousal. \u201cI get the order thing, but how did I jeopardize the camp?\u201d I want to bite him. Claw him. The good kind of biting and clawing.</p><p>\u201cWhat if an enemy had seen you exit that hatch? He could next blow up the buildings around it, then sneak through the tunnel, no one the wiser, everyone too consumed with the outside chaos. Should I go on?\u201d</p><p>The anger drained, a guilty flush heating her cheeks. I want him to bite and claw me. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, and she meant it.</p><p>He slapped his hands at her temples, and pressed the rest of the way in, his lower body brushing against hers. For the second time in her life, she felt small and feminine. \u201cYou play the role of airhead damn well, but I\u2019ve got your number now, honey.\u201d</p><p>Panic momentarily overshadowed her desire and guilt. \u201cAnd what\u2019s my number?\u201d He couldn\u2019t know. He just couldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t want him to know. \u201cOne eight hundred LOVE BUNNY?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d always taken a perverse kind of pleasure in throwing fuel on the she\u2019s so silly expectation. And yes, that pleasure was a double-edged sword because no one ever saw the real Noelle. No one ever experienced pride for her or in her. No one ever laughed with her. Always they laughed at her.</p><p>Time and time again, she could have proven everyone wrong, could have laughed at them. One thought had always stopped her: What if they didn\u2019t like the real Noelle, either?</p><p>What if Hector had learned all about her, as he claimed, but found her lacking anyway?</p><p>\u201cThe others think you lucked out tonight,\u201d he said on a ragged exhalation, \u201cbut in all the years of camp, you\u2019re the only trainee to ever successfully sneak away. I think you knew to look for that hatch. I think you knew exactly what you were doing.\u201d</p><p>He suspected, but he didn\u2019t know. Part of her was relieved. The other part of her was disappointed. \u201cPoor Hector, thinking he\u2019s right when he\u2019s so obviously wrong. Didn\u2019t Jaxon tell you all about my life choices? About how childish I am. How frivolous. Of course I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I dropped a bracelet and crawled to get it.\u201d A high-pitched giggle. \u201cThat\u2019s how I found the hatch.\u201d</p><p>His eyelids slitted, the long length of his lashes fusing together. Such pretty lashes, she mused. Better suited for a woman, and yet, they were gorgeous on him. Perfect.</p><p>\u201cJaxon didn\u2019t tell us shit. We like to form our own opinions. And you didn\u2019t bring any bracelets to camp. Try again.\u201d</p><p>Double shocker. Jaxon had kept his mouth closed, and Hector had noticed her lack of jewelry. That meant he\u2019d paid attention, studied her. I just plain want him. Really, truly want him.</p><p>\u201cMy big, bad instructor thinks he\u2019s got me all figured out, huh?\u201d She\u2019d meant to taunt him. The huskiness of her voice merely revealed a lingering craving for him. She\u2019d probably been on low simmer for him since the moment she\u2019d met him.</p><p>Probably? Ha! She just hadn\u2019t recognized the signs properly. Now ... there was no denying what she felt.</p><p>Ava would want me to have him, she told herself. Dibs or no dibs.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he snapped, \u201cstop.\u201d</p><p>The truth slipped from her on a whisper, a deliberate provocation. \u201cStop thinking about what we could be doing right now? Stop waiting for you to bend down and feed me your tongue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he cursed quietly, punching the wall with a hard fist. Dust plumed. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Hector ... close ... tongue ... Unable to stop herself, Noelle blatantly arched her hips and rubbed her core against him. A moan left her. Sweet insanity, he had an erection.</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m already inside you.\u201d A groan\u2014but he didn\u2019t pull away from her.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want to be, all you have to do is resist me,\u201d she taunted. Have to kiss him ... She slid her hands up his chest, his muscles jolting in greeting. Heat radiated from him, wrapping around her. Still he didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cAre you scared I might get to you?\u201d</p><p>His breath shallowed, sawing in and out of his nose, and his gaze lowered to her mouth. \u201cScared,\u201d he parroted, as though in a trance.</p><p>Doubtful. Nothing would scare the intractable Hector, she would bet. \u201cGive me a taste, then, and we\u2019ll both walk away happy,\u201d she said, licking her lips, playing along. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing scary about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA taste, yes.\u201d</p><p>They met in the middle. The moment of contact, the gentle tasting she\u2019d imagined spun out of control. Swept up on a tide of sensation, she ate at his mouth, sucked on his tongue. He flavor was as decadent as his scent, fresh, wild, and stormy, passion spiced with apples.</p><p>Though he seemed as wrapped up in the moment as she was, the flicks of his tongue were hesitant at first. But when he decided to go all in, he really went all in. He became the aggressor, taking over, dominating.</p><p>He kicked her legs apart and held her up, off her feet, using his lower body to press her into the wall. Her nails scraped along the stubble on his jaw, then his scalp, angling his head for better, deeper contact.</p><p>He growled at her, demanding she accept his domination. She liked that. The muscles in his neck pulled tight just before he arced away from her, letting her slide, slide. Then he slammed forward and pushed his thick erection between the vee of her legs once more, this time as forcefully as he could, catching her before her feet could touch the ground.</p><p>She trembled violently, gasped, utterly lost in him. Lost in the electric connection.</p><p>He arched back and slammed forward again, then again, forcing his cock against her with so much vigor she though he might break the thing in half. Either he liked things rough, or was too wrapped in his own desire to care about any injury to his shaft. Naughty girl that she was, she liked that, too.</p><p>Knowing Hector wanted her as fervently as she wanted him caused the ache inside her to intensify, and moisture to dampen her panties. More, need more. She climbed him like a mountain, winding her legs around his waist, making the rub between them constant.</p><p>\u201cMore!\u201d she commanded.</p><p>Another slam, and she nearly erupted. The sensation ... so strong ... so wonderfully overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cNoelle. Yes, more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her nails dug deeper into his scalp as she kissed him with all the passion trapped inside her. Passion she\u2019d long denied herself. Passion she hadn\u2019t known she was capable of feeling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMore,\u201d he repeated, the word slurred. He bit at her lips, nibbling. \u201cI need more of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>A car honked, jolting them both. Panting, Hector jerked up his head. He peered down at her, comprehension and horror dawning in his eyes. Why horror? She tried to kiss him again, to help him forget whatever troubled him, but he turned away.</p> <p>\u201cDown,\u201d he barked.</p><p>\u201cHector, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Again she was cut off. \u201cDown, Noelle. Now.\u201d</p><p>Little chips of ice joined the fire in her blood, cooling her down. The moment her feet hit the pavement, he leapt away from her as if she were toxic, ensuring no part of them touched. Her knees were weak and nearly buckled, but she managed to remain upright.</p><p>She looked him over. His expression was now chiseled from granite, his jaw clenched, his lips swollen. His erection, gone. And there was a faint blue glow emanating from both of his arms. Arms he quickly hid behind his back.</p> <p>She must have been mistaken. Surely he hadn\u2019t glowed. No time to reason things out, though. As she inhaled, she caught the scent of burning cotton and frowned. A swift scan, and she realized her tank had been singed at the straps. Her brow furrowed in confusion. How had that happened?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not being kicked out,\u201d Hector rasped. \u201cYou\u2019ve excelled at every exercise, and for that, Mia Snow thinks you\u2019ve earned a second chance. You won\u2019t get another.\u201d</p><p>Mia Snow thought. Not Hector. \u201cThank you,\u201d she replied with only the barest tremor.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. Thank Mia.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to say anything about what had just gone down between them\u2014and what had almost gone down. Had it not been for that honk, they would have kept going, would have had sex right here, against the wall.</p><p>His rejection, when she still trembled with need for him, cut deeply. He didn\u2019t like her, was probably ashamed about kissing her. Probably? Try definitely. That horror ...</p> <p>Despite her money, he probably thought she wasn\u2019t good enough for him. That she was flighty, selfish, and stupid, after all. You pander to that mind-set. You can\u2019t blame him.</p><p>I\u2019ve got your number, he\u2019d said. As she\u2019d suspected, he hadn\u2019t really.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got two hours to make it back to camp. The tunnel\u2019s been locked, so you\u2019ll just have to hoof it the long way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means you\u2019re going to need every second of those two hours. I\u2019d get started if I were you. And Noelle?\u201d he added before she could take a step. \u201cDon\u2019t sneak out again, and don\u2019t ever\u2014ever\u2014kiss or touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t kiss or touch me back,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd don\u2019t play this game with me,\u201d he shouted. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her reply but stomped away.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d Noelle whispered, shaking her friend awake. The bunkhouse was dark as hell, and Noelle was drenched in sweat and dirt, but she didn\u2019t want to take a shower until she\u2019d spoken to her friend.</p><p>Ava bolted upright, reaching for the razor she kept under her pillow. Then she paused, caught her breath. Her glassy gaze cleared. \u201cNoelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kissed Hector.\u201d A murmur of longing, pain, and anger.</p><p>A delicate hand scrubbed over Ava\u2019s face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI kissed Hector, even though you had dibs.\u201d And now I think I hate him.</p><p>After he\u2019d stalked out of the alley, he\u2019d climbed into a nearby car. He\u2019d followed her back to camp. As she\u2019d run. The entire freaking way. Not once had he checked on her, offered her something to drink, or taken pity on her and allowed her to catch a ride with a stranger.</p><p>\u201cFirst taste is free. You\u2019ll have to buy the second one. So ... how was it?\u201d Ava asked, falling back on her mattress. Only curiosity filled her tone.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I did you a favor. He\u2019s such a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he not finish what he started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse. He told me to never, ever kiss or touch him again, as if I\u2019m toxic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to kill him for you?\u201d</p><p>See? This was why she loved Ava so damn much. \u201cNah. Let\u2019s just torture him a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf by a little you mean until he\u2019s writhing and screaming for mercy, I\u2019m in!\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>AIR Training Camp</p><p>Day Seven</p><p>GOD HAVE MERCY. IF Hector died of a massive coronary this morning, Noelle Tremain would be at fault. He had to be closing in on the number of erections one man could experience\u2014and ignore\u2014in a single week before he just up and died.</p><p>Hector wasn\u2019t the only one suffering with unrequited lust, either. Every man in the area watched her with differing levels of arousal. And that didn\u2019t piss him off; he\u2019d simply woken up in a bad mood. Again.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t getting any sleep. Not before their bone-melting kiss, and certainly not after. Every night he dreamed about her. About kissing and touching her, and that only deepened his need for her, the ever-growing obsession. Because he kept thinking that while he\u2019d rolled his tongue against hers, he hadn\u2019t cupped her breasts, or felt her nipples bead under his palm. Hadn\u2019t delved his fingers deep into her wet, dripping sex.</p><p>And he never could.</p><p>But now he wanted to do those things more than he wanted to breathe.</p><p>So what had started out as a small attraction was now a full-blown case of the must-fucks.</p><p>That ended today.</p><p>Hopefully.</p><p>If this was what happened in seven days, imagine what would happen in fourteen. Then twenty-eight. And, God forbid, fifty-six.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. Not without sweating.</p><p>He never should have gone near her that night, but she\u2019d peered up at him with such defiance, he\u2019d practically wrapped himself around her in a bid to intimidate her. At least that\u2019s what he\u2019d told himself. All while drinking her in, luxuriating in the sparkle in her eyes, the sultriness of her scent, the feminine curves of her body.</p><p>And the kiss? He had no excuse for that. It was the stupidest thing he\u2019d ever done. He\u2019d known it then, and he really knew it now. Especially since his desire to have her had been so consuming, his arms had fired up and he hadn\u2019t freaking cared.</p><p>He\u2019d burned her shirt, had nearly burned her skin, risking her safety, his own. Even his freedom.</p><p>No one at AIR knew what he could do, and that\u2019s the way he wanted it to stay. Because if anyone ever found out, they\u2019d either lock him up and toss the key or feed him the barrel of a .22. And he would deserve it!</p><p>Even still, he would never allow anyone to lock him away. He\u2019d spent most of his childhood in a four-by-four cage, laughed at, starved, bruised and broken after being forced to fight other disposable kids, time and time again.</p><p>Most had been picked up off the streets, but some, like him, had parents looking for a quick buck. Parents who\u2019d pit their own children against each other, while adult men and women bet on the winner and the condition of the loser.</p><p>Hector had worked hard to free himself, and had had to kill a lot of people along the way. Something he did not regret. His life might not be fun or easy, but he made his own choices. Made a difference in the world. Helped those who suffered as he once had. He had purpose.</p><p>Thankfully, Noelle hadn\u2019t noticed the glow. Had she, she would have said something. She wasn\u2019t the type to remain mute. About anything.</p><p>You\u2019re good to go, but if you keep this thought process up, you won\u2019t be. Concentrate on the here and now. On what matters. Anything but that kiss.</p><p>The trainees had been roused from their beds less than ten minutes ago. \u2019Course, they\u2019d only gotten two hours of shuteye before that, so most were dead on their feet. Once the horn blasted, signaling it was time to rise and shine, they\u2019d had five minutes to dress, do whatever they needed to do, and line up outside.</p><p>Noelle had emerged in the tiniest, tightest pair of pink shorts he\u2019d ever seen, and an equally tight white tank top. She should have looked like any other female in the camp, but he could see the curve of her ass, and goddamn. No one else in the entire freaking world had an ass like hers. Toned, curved, perfect. Biteable.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there.</p><p>Her hair was anchored in a ponytail on top of her head, and the length swung back and forth, back and forth with every perky step she took. Perky steps that bordered on lascivious because of the red lace winding up her combat boots.</p><p>Yeah. That\u2019s why.</p><p>Her face was scrubbed clean of makeup, giving her a fresh, dewy appearance. And with the rising sun behind her, framing her with golds, oranges, and pinks, she was every man\u2019s fantasy come to sizzling life.</p><p>A fantasy. That\u2019s all she could ever be to him. So he\u2019d just have to pretend he didn\u2019t notice that her nipples were hard from the cool, too-early morning air. Nipples he\u2019d felt against his chest. And oh, sweet Jesus, there were goose bumps winding around the band of skin seductively revealed between the hem of her shirt and the waist of her shorts. Her navel dipped so exquisitely, it would be a playground for his tongue.</p><p>Don\u2019t you dare go there, asshole. A plea from a deeply rooted need to protect himself.</p><p>\u201cStart running,\u201d he shouted to the twenty-four recruits remaining at the camp. Two had already dropped out due to injuries, two had been kicked out for finishing last, and one short, effeminate man with a thin mustache and a habit of sleeping in the female barracks had simply disappeared.</p><p>Shockingly, Noelle hadn\u2019t been among the out-for-the-counters. \u201cAnd don\u2019t stop until you\u2019re told,\u201d he added. \u201cYou do, you go home.\u201d</p><p>The group shot into action so quickly their moans of not-this-again barely had time to register. Desperate for a distraction\u2014one that would actually work\u2014Hector kicked into gear, determined to run this bitch of a course himself.</p><p>This was his last day here. At least until next month. Like the others, he was supposed to stay, but because of his ability, he\u2019d gotten permission to leave campus the weeks he wasn\u2019t in charge. Not that his boss knew the truth.</p><p>When Hector first joined AIR, he\u2019d lied about a medical condition. A skin disease that demanded his coworkers remain hands off, that he sometimes wear gloves, and sometimes, when \u201cthe agony\u201d became too much, that he stay home. Most of them respected the first, all of them laughed about the second, and on rare occasions, a few of them brought him chicken noodle soup because of the third.</p><p>Now he had less than twelve hours until he adiosed, which meant he had twelve hours to get rid of Noelle. He should have fought Mia when she\u2019d said, \u201cTremain snuck out? So what. I like a girl with initiative. She stays.\u201d Instead, he\u2019d jumped in his car and burned rubber into the city to go and get her.</p><p>All the way there, he\u2019d told himself she was too young for him. He\u2019d told himself that screwing a trainee was unethical, but his mind had snagged on the word \u201cscrewing\u201d and the rest had ceased to matter. He\u2019d told himself that, if he ever talked her into bed, she would consider him such a bad lay, she\u2019d laugh about their encounter for years to come, but his mind snagged on the words \u201clay\u201d and \u201ccome,\u201d and he\u2019d started plotting ways to taste her.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Bottom line: she shouldn\u2019t have lasted this long.</p><p>Yeah, she was more intelligent than he\u2019d first given her credit for, but you needed more than smarts to succeed at this job. How would she react at the scene of a gruesome murder? Vomit? Pass out? Probably both.</p><p>He\u2019d cleared most of his cases before coming out here, and all of them had been bitches. Especially that last one. A human teenager had fought a Teran teenager, and neither had walked away, leaving a bloody mess. The Teran\u2019s claws had slashed the human into a thousand different Christmas ribbons. Then, knowing otherworlders were judged harshly and sometimes things like self-defense were forgotten, the Teran had killed himself rather than spend the rest of his life in AIR lockup.</p><p>Kids, man. Their murders and suicides affected Hector in a way nothing else ever had. They hadn\u2019t yet truly lived, and they didn\u2019t know there was something better out there.</p><p>Noelle had only ever been pampered. What did she know of pain and suffering?</p><p>And her arrests? He still wasn\u2019t buying. Not to that degree. If she lived through camp and somehow became an AIR agent, she\u2019d be ripped to pieces on the streets. More than that, she would hinder whoever was unlucky enough to be paired with her. Guaranteed, she\u2019d contaminate evidence and shit like that. Rules meant nothing to her.</p><p>Last night, she\u2019d managed to smuggle in food\u2014and not through the tunnel. Actually, he didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d done it. She wasn\u2019t talking, and neither was anyone else. And because he couldn\u2019t prove any rules had been broken, Mia had once again put her foot down with a smug, \u201cShe stays!\u201d</p><p>Hector never would have known about the contraband if not for Dallas, who was always hungry and had followed his nose like a hound. And Hector, thinking the shithead just wanted a peek at Noelle in the shower, had followed the agent. What he\u2019d found: the trainees huddled together, ripping meat off chicken bones as if they were at the Last Supper.</p><p>That\u2019s what this fifteen-mile run was about. And why the trainees would be living outside for the next month.</p><p>Punishment was a bitch.</p><p>Still. Hector didn\u2019t think the location change would break Noelle. She\u2019d say something excruciatingly optimistic like, Camping is fun, and twirl. So it was time to step up the torment. Time to ... hurt her.</p><p>\u201cI think I forgot to tell you good morning,\u201d she said as she passed him, that smoky voice tugging him back to the course. \u201cSo, allow me to remedy that. Good morning, Hector.\u201d</p><p>He almost tripped over his own goddamn feet. Honest to God, she\u2019d said his name as if he were already inside her and thrusting. \u201cThat\u2019s Agent Dean to you,\u201d he snapped. Not with anger, as he should have, but with more of that crackling arousal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Arm check. Slight burn, slight itch. No glow. He was okay. For now.</p><p>She sniffled as if her heart were currently in the process of breaking. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to wish me a good morning, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d I hope your morning blows. Mmm, blows. Shit. Damn. And a thousand other curse words. He needed to rewind, and try another thought. I hope the rest of your day sucks. Mmm, sucks. Damn it! \u201cNow concentrate like a good little girl.\u201d A command to both of them. Because yes, he was more like a chick every second he spent with her.</p> <p>\u201cSir, yes, sir.\u201d No more hurt in her tone.</p><p>Was she mocking him? Surely not.</p><p>The first lap had left a fine sheen of perspiration on her exposed skin, making her glisten erotically. Same with her friend, Ava, who kept pace at her side. But he didn\u2019t want to throw Ava on his bed and screw into her spinal cord.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to do that to Noelle, either. This kind of wanting was new to him, that was all. He\u2019d deal. He\u2019d overcome. He always did.</p><p>\u201cAgent Mean, watch out for that\u2014\u201d</p> <p>His boot slammed into something hard and immobile, and he barely managed to keep himself vertical.</p><p>\u201cRock,\u201d she finished. Her husky laugh echoed across the distance, sank past skin and into cells, fizzing like champagne. She\u2019d moved several more feet ahead of him and didn\u2019t look back, that ponytail continuing to swing.</p><p>Mortifying.</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten the meaning of the word dibs again?\u201d he heard Ava ask her.</p><p>Noelle cartwheeled as she replied. \u201cNope. I was just showing you how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Ava snorted. \u201cHow what\u2019s done? Annoying everyone to death?\u201d</p> <p>They had a strange relationship. More than boss/ employee, as he\u2019d first supposed. Exactly what they were to each other, however, he hadn\u2019t yet worked out. But he wasn\u2019t going to ponder it now. There were more important things to do. Like run everyone into the ground, himself included.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>They groaned, but obeyed.</p><p>Time ticked by.</p><p>More time ticked by.</p><p>Noelle never again bypassed him, but that was not the blessing it should have been. She remained just ahead of him, and he never lost sight of her. She moved like a panther. Sleek, fluid, effortless. And she never slowed. But then, he never did.</p><p>She always pushed herself harder than anyone else\u2014except for him. He pushed her even harder, hoping to break her. So far, no luck.</p><p>Damn it. She had to be gone by the time he returned next month. His arms, his hands ... yep, they really began to burn and itch. The ink had already faded a bit.</p> <p>When he got home, he\u2019d take a few days of personal leave and redo his tattoos. Somehow those Celtic symbols were the only thing that actually helped him. How they kept his ability under control for as long as they did, he didn\u2019t know. Just like he didn\u2019t know why he was like he was. No one else in his family had ever exhibited this kind of curse.</p><p>Plus, the ink was his gauge. The lighter it was, the more of a danger he was. When there was nothing left, even God couldn\u2019t help him. Hector wouldn\u2019t just kill everyone around him; he\u2019d inadvertently destroy entire buildings.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to murder us,\u201d a trainee wheezed as he came up from the rear.</p><p>\u201cAfter this, I\u2019m going to murder myself,\u201d another rasped.</p><p>Hector glanced at the timer hanging from his neck. They\u2019d been running three hours and thirty-two minutes. So he\u2019d gone a tiny bit over the two and a half hours he\u2019d intended. Babies.</p><p>He studied each one. They were drenched in sweat, even Noelle, and their steps were now dragging. Good. He would have liked to push them even harder, and hell, push himself since the jog hadn\u2019t yet done shit to his hormones, but there was more crap to do before he could take off, so the sooner he got started the better.</p><p>And the sooner he got himself under control, the sooner he could get back to work. A case would occupy his thoughts, keep him focused.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he shouted, halting in the middle of the dirt track. \u201cBring it in. And hustle.\u201d</p><p>All but Noelle and Ava obeyed. The twosome kept running.</p><p>What was this? National Test His Patience Day? \u201cNow!\u201d he roared.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say stop,\u201d Noelle blasted back.</p><p>\u201cBefore,\u201d Ava panted, \u201cyou told us to run until you said stop.\u201d</p><p>They were right. Smarter by the second. His narrowed gaze swept across the trainees around him. \u201cWhat are you doing, standing around? I didn\u2019t say stop, did I?\u201d</p><p>With a symphony of groans, they leapt back into action. He let them eke out another mile before saying the magic word. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Every single one of them dropped where they were and sprawled on the hard, cool ground.</p><p>No mercy. \u201cDid I say you could rest? Bring it in. And actually hustle this time.\u201d</p><p>He watched as they lumbered to their feet and closed the distance. \u2019Course, he watched Noelle a little more intently than the rest. Because she was soaked, her white tank and sports bra were see-through. He saw more than hard nipples. He saw color. Pink, perfect circles made for a man\u2019s tongue.</p><p>Scowling, Hector rubbed the building burn from his left arm. Time to take care of his problem once and for all.</p><p>Six</p><p>HECTOR SPUN SLOWLY, SURVEYING each member of the group forming a circle around him. Well, every member but Noelle. Avoiding those nipples was priority one. \u201cSo far, all you pussies have done is exercise. Time to change that.\u201d</p><p>He gripped the collar of his shirt and tugged. The material swept over his head and dropped to the ground. Someone might have gasped, but he couldn\u2019t be sure. Next to go was the stopwatch. He rolled his shoulders, stretching the muscles. The bones in his neck popped as he turned his head left, right. Sweat formed rivulets down his chest, and caught in the waistband of his jogging shorts.</p><p>Another gasp, then a moan. A smoky moan. As if Miss Noelle Tremain liked what she was seeing.</p><p>Shit. He wouldn\u2019t look; he fucking wouldn\u2019t look.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d He pointed to the guy some of the girls had been caught sighing over. Johnny Deschanel. Dark hair, dark eyes. Not quite as tall and muscled as Hector\u2014who was?\u2014but he was the closest in size and perfect for the first demonstration. A demonstration that would, hopefully, scare the stubbornness right out of Noelle, saving him from having to take this to the limit. \u201cAss in the circle. We\u2019re doing hand-to-hand.\u201d</p><p>Cocky little bastard strutted despite his obvious fatigue.</p><p>Those with a modicum of training were always the easiest to flatten. They considered themselves experts, maybe because they\u2019d actually managed to take down a few opponents in the outside world. Here, now, that experience was more of a hindrance. Johnny had no idea what someone with a lot of training could do to him.</p><p>But again, he\u2019d learn.</p><p>\u201cAttack me,\u201d Hector said to Johnny. He withdrew the thin newly designed asbestos gloves hanging from the back of his waistband and tugged the material over both of his hands. \u201cHit me, even once, and you and the rest of the trainees are free to do whatever you want for the rest of the day.\u201d</p><p>Excitement and resolve glittered in those dark eyes. But the guy didn\u2019t say anything, just nodded and dove for him.</p><p>Something Hector had foreseen. He merely stepped to the side, and Johnny soared past him, slamming into Ava with a hmph. Noelle took exception and kicked him off. What did surprise Hector was the way Johnny used the momentum to his advantage and popped to his feet. Smart. Wouldn\u2019t bring home the victory for him, but smart.</p><p>Having witnessed how quickly Hector could anticipate and react, Johnny chose a different route for his second go. He circled ... circled ... closing in. Moment he was within striking distance, he threw his fist into Hector\u2019s nose. Or tried to. Hector caught his hand and twisted, spinning him around and pinning his arm against his back.</p><p>The angle was awkward, painful, and mortifying, because there was nothing Johnny could do to escape without popping his shoulder from its socket.</p><p>Easier than anticipated, and somewhat disappointing. Hector hadn\u2019t gotten to break a single bone.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do wrong?\u201d he asked the group. And yeah, maybe he was showing off a little. As Johnny squirmed, Hector\u2019s chest puffed up like a peacock\u2019s tail, all look at me, look how strong I am.</p><p>Noelle and Ava both raised their hands.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know. Me, me, pick me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, pick me! I\u2019m righter. More right. Whatever, pick me!\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later, they were attempting to lower the other one\u2019s arm.</p><p>Ignoring them, intending to explain the intricacies of his magnificence himself, he released Johnny and gave the guy a shove toward the open spot in the circle. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>Rather than obey, Johnny swung around with a growl, fist cocked and flying. Hector dodged, and threw a punch of his own. Johnny wasn\u2019t fast enough to dodge. Contact. The trainee went down like a stone in water, and just like that, it was lights out.</p><p>Hard fact: you put knuckles against cartilage, and knuckles would win every time.</p><p>\u201cLesson number one.\u201d Hector straightened, his arms falling to his sides. \u201cThe fight isn\u2019t over just because your opponent is. You can\u2019t use a pyre-gun to stun humans, and some otherworlders have somehow inoculated themselves and can move within seconds of being hit with the rays. Always make sure your target is really down and out. Example.\u201d</p><p>He kicked the unconscious Johnny in the stomach. Air whooshed from the guy\u2019s mouth, and his body jerked, but he didn\u2019t curl up to protect his vitals. All right, then. He was really down and out.</p><p>Someone clapped, whooped. Hector spun, eyes slitting. There was Dallas, in Johnny\u2019s old seat, pearl-white smile flashing against his deeply bronzed skin as his fist pumped toward the heavens.</p><p>\u201cTaught him everything he knows,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cHector, I mean, not the one who got the nose job free of charge.\u201d</p><p>I will not laugh. \u201cTake out the trash, would you, Dal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure.\u201d Dallas snapped to and was dragging Johnny out of the circle within seconds.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Hector performed another spin. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d He waited a few heartbeats of time. \u201cNoelle?\u201d</p><p>He nearly flattened her with the fierceness of his stare, their gazes locking together, clashing. Her starling gray against his crackling gold. He expected her to decline. Maybe to cower. She grinned the eager beaver grin he\u2019d seen day one, and stood. All innocence, all playfulness, total contradiction.</p><p>Irritation\u2014and surprise and more of that stupid arousal\u2014twisted a knot in his gut.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill him, Noelle,\u201d Ava cheered. \u201cJust hurt him a little.\u201d</p><p>Noelle gave her friend a thumbs-up. The sun had finally found its place in the blue, blue sky, shining brightly, no clouds obstructing the brilliance. Her ponytail was plastered to her head, her cheeks flushed bright red, but damn it all, she\u2019d never been prettier.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go easy on you.\u201d Truth. He couldn\u2019t. Not if he was going to be rid of her. And okay. Maybe he was wrong and she\u2019d make a good agent one day. That determination of hers, if channeled properly, could take her places. And maybe it was unfair of him to want her kicked out because he was attracted to her. Didn\u2019t matter. She was rich. She\u2019d get over it.</p><p>\u201cGo easy on me? Why, Agent Mean, I\u2019d be disappointed if you did.\u201d</p><p>He was not impressed.</p><p>\u201cSame rules? Meaning, it\u2019s on like Donkey Kong, and we get a freebie if you\u2019re hit?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. Donkey Kong? And goddamn it, her voice. That husky, smoky quality once again made everything she said suggestive and dirty. Like, same rules somehow became inside me.</p><p>So now he would have to give her everything he had without using his arms. The burning had cranked up a notch, the tattoos glowing through the material\u2019s pores. He prayed no one noticed. Or, if they did, that they assumed it was an optical illusion.</p><p>Not a farfetched thought, he told himself. As exhausted, hungry, and abused as they were, they\u2019d believe anything. Surely.</p><p>Hopefully.</p><p>In a world where aliens walked among humans who did not yet accept them, discrimination was rampant. How much worse would that discrimination be for a horrendous genetic mutation? And that\u2019s what Hector was. He knew it. He\u2019d researched the hell out of himself, his past, and his family, and that was the only explanation that made sense.</p><p>\u201cSoooo, are you just going to stand there or what?\u201d Noelle asked.</p><p>Shit. Distraction wasn\u2019t going to help his cause. \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d Eyes gleaming, she lifted her tank and bra. \u201cI\u2019ve got thirty-six C\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The male trainees might have whistled, the females might have gasped. Hector couldn\u2019t be sure because he lost focus of them. Lost focus of everything but those perfect breasts. Honest to God, his thoughts derailed, his nerve endings going white-hot throughout his body.</p><p>Rose-colored nipples, beaded and ripe for sucking. She had no tan lines, was the same sweet cream and honey all over. And she was closing the distance between them, jiggling, those breasts staring at him, tempting him, daring him, almost within reach. Totally within reach.</p><p>He flexed his fingers; he wanted to reach.</p><p>She double tapped him in the mouth so hard he was spitting blood as he fell. Stars winked through his line of vision before he landed. And then, when he hit, his skull cracking against the same rock he\u2019d tripped over, the stars vanished and thick black cobwebs took their place.</p><p>Night, night, Hector.</p><p>However long passed before he blinked open his eyes and saw a flame of white flashing over him, he wasn\u2019t sure. All he knew was that his temples throbbed and the stars had decided to do an encore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More flashing.</p><p>Seriously, what was\u2014Understanding dawned, and he growled with barely suppressed rage. The white flame was from a fucking camera phone. Humiliating.</p><p>Scowling, he grabbed the device and crushed it into multiple pieces.</p> <p>A grinning Noelle bent down, looming over him and blocking the sun, becoming all he could see. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, Agent Mean. I\u2019d already emailed myself a copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d he breathed, the words slurred past his rapidly swelling lips.</p><p>That grin brightened. \u201cI can\u2019t. You\u2019re Ava\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He was ... Ava\u2019s? Wait. What?</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Noelle said, grinning slowly, wickedly. \u201cDo you want to know where you went wrong now, or should I wait and tell you later?\u201d</p> <p>Seven</p><p>EIGHT-YEAR-OLD HECTOR BECKHAM GRIPPED the bars of his cage and peered over at his ten-year-old brother, Dean. Dean lay in his own cage, not asleep but not moving either. He\u2019d lost more weight. Bones protruded sharply on his bruised and dirty face, making him look like a skeleton with hair.</p><p>Hector probably looked just as bad. Why wouldn\u2019t he? All the other boys and girls around him did. Also like him and Dean, they were trapped in cages and utterly helpless.</p><p>There were twenty-six cages in total, some lined side by side, some stacked on top of each other. Old, rusty cages once used to contain dogs. But then, that\u2019s what they were. Dogs.</p><p>A week before every fight, they were all locked inside their new \u201chome\u201d and placed in this barn. That way, they were good and feral when they were released. They were purposely starved, even though that left them weak, because hunger made them do very bad things.</p><p>Plus, what better way to reward them for a job well done? Turn your friend\u2019s face into pulp, and earn a sandwich.</p> <p>Yeah, Hector had made friends with most of the kids in here. After all, some of them had been doing this for over a year and they were the only ones who understood his pain\u2014the only ones he could ever talk to about what happened. Come tomorrow, though, when the fights started up again, he\u2019d forget he liked them and they\u2019d forget they liked him.</p><p>Until it was over and all any of them would want to do was cry.</p><p>What are you, a sissy? his dad\u2019s voice suddenly screamed inside his head.</p><p>How many times had Hector heard that particular question? Too many to count. Not that he knew how to count. He\u2019d never been to school, had never learned to read.</p><p>Well, he wouldn\u2019t cry tonight. Or tomorrow. He was better than that. And, well, he just didn\u2019t have the strength.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been fed today, and the only thing he\u2019d gotten yesterday was a single scoop of slop. He\u2019d hated the bitter taste but he\u2019d licked the bowl clean\u2014because they were never given a spoon. Now his stomach was twisted into itself, no longer growling but burning. Burning so bad.</p><p>\u201cHector,\u201d Dean whispered.</p><p>Hector met his brother\u2019s gaze. Tonight their cages had been placed one in front of the other. \u201cYeah,\u201d he whispered back out of habit.</p> <p>The Zoo Keeper\u2014the man responsible for their \u201ccare\u201d\u2014had already done his nighttime check, so they didn\u2019t have to be quiet. Besides, kids were moaning and groaning all around them, some even sobbing. One girl was praying for someone to help her.</p><p>This was her first time in the cages, and Hector didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that no one ever would.</p><p>\u201cDad told me I have to kill the first person I fight this round,\u201d Dean said.</p><p>A sharp intake of breath. The smell of disgusting things filled his nose. From himself, from all the others. They were never taken out to go to the bathroom. \u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head, dirty hair scratching at his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHe says I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d That\u2019s the one thing they\u2019d never allowed themselves to do. Kill another kid. A kid in the same situation, locked away, forgotten when he was lucky, forced to fight for every scrap of food when he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Dean\u2019s golden eyes\u2014eyes so like his own\u2014were grim. \u201cYou know what\u2019ll happen if I disobey him.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Hector knew. A whipping far worse than anything they ever experienced inside the ring. \u201cAt least you won\u2019t feel guilty or hate yourself.\u201d Hector might cry sometimes after hurting another kid, but Dean shut down. He\u2019d cut himself, and wouldn\u2019t speak for weeks. Not even to Hector.</p><p>If Dean delivered that final blow ... he would never recover. Hector knew that, too.</p><p>He and Dean had tried running away together, but their dad had caught them two days later. At some point during the beating that followed, Dean had thrown himself over a blacked-out Hector, and gotten his arm broken for his daring. An arm Dean had had to treat himself. An arm that was still bent at an odd angle, six months later.</p><p>\u201cWho are you fighting?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cJust... don\u2019t kill him, Dean. Please. I don\u2019t want you to suffer about it later.\u201d</p><p>Again, silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it, okay? I\u2019ll do the killing. Whoever I fight, I\u2019ll kill him, I promise. You just ... don\u2019t. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Hector tried reaching his brother another way. He worked his arms through the bars, gripped Dean\u2019s cage door and shook. Rattle, rattle. \u201cListen to me. After this round, we\u2019ll run away.\u201d Risking another beating had to be better than this. Living on the street would be better than this. \u201cThis time, he won\u2019t find us. I won\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted you to know,\u201d Dean finally said, his voice low and emotionless.</p><p>Hector spent the rest of the night telling his brother how wonderful things would be when they were on their own, but Dean never said another word. Then the sun was gleaming brightly in the sky, illuminating the crumbling barn filled with dirty cages, listless kids, and human waste.</p><p>Outside, Hector heard what seemed to be a thousand cars drive up, and even more doors slam. Footsteps shuffled. Carefree laughter drifted to his ears.</p><p>There was an arena set up in the surrounding field. The bleachers were always overflowing. Beer and popcorn would be sold. Just the thought of that popcorn made Hector\u2019s mouth water.</p><p>People would watch the fights, cheering and booing. That always set Hector\u2019s already raw nerves on edge. Why didn\u2019t they help? Why didn\u2019t they realize the cruelty of what they were doing? Watching? Why didn\u2019t they care?</p><p>His own mother used the money she made off his and Dean\u2019s fights to buy her drugs. Hector hated her for that. Why couldn\u2019t she love him? Why couldn\u2019t she love Dean?</p><p>Dean was the best person in the whole world. Smart, kind, generous. A few times, Dean had pretended not to be hungry so that Hector could have his portion of slop. Hector was ashamed to admit he\u2019d actually accepted once.</p><p>Fear shuddered through him when the Zoo Keeper strutted in a few minutes later.</p><p>It was time.</p><p>A short, squat man with thinning hair and a few missing teeth, the Zoo Keeper liked wearing overalls stained with blood his \u201canimals\u201d had spilled. Grinning with satisfaction, he rapped a stick against each of the cage doors.</p><p>\u201cRise and shine, my little mutts. Today\u2019s your day to shine. Or not.\u201d He chuckled cruelly. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna kick things off with a big bang this go-round.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the stick and grabbed two of the leashes hanging on the far wall\u2014a pink one and a blue one\u2014then he strode to Dean\u2019s cage. Fear intensifying, Hector sat up. His mind swam with dizziness, sharp lances of pain making him grimace.</p><p>Dean just lay there as the Zoo Keeper unlocked his cage. Hinges squeaked as the door opened. The pink collar was strapped around Dean\u2019s skinny neck, and Dean was jerked to the dirt-laden ground.</p><p>\u201cStand up, boy.\u201d Another jerk.</p><p>Dean dragged himself to his feet, swayed.</p><p>The Zoo Keeper tugged him forward\u2014and stopped at the praying girl\u2019s cage.</p><p>Oh... God. Oh, no. \u201cDean,\u201d Hector said, his stomach threatening to heave, even though there was nothing inside it.</p><p>If Dean killed another boy, he\u2019d hate himself and never get over it. But if he killed a girl ...</p><p>Dean didn\u2019t look in Hector\u2019s direction.</p><p>The Zoo Keeper wrapped the blue collar around the girl\u2019s neck, but she had enough steam to get herself out and to her feet without aid. She was Dean\u2019s height, with matted blond hair and eyes glassy with fear.</p><p>\u201cBoys are never pitted against girls,\u201d Hector called, desperate to stop this. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t make him fight her. You have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to do shit, mutt.\u201d The Zoo Keeper tossed him a scowl that promised he\u2019d suffer later. \u201cBoys and girls didn\u2019t fight before. Now they do. And you\u2019ll keep your mouth shut from now on if you know what\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s body began trembling as Dean was dragged away. What would happen? What would Dean do? He closed his eyes, fighting those sissy tears he\u2019d told himself he wouldn\u2019t shed.</p><p>He knew the moment the fight started. The crowd erupted, people calling out instructions. Things like, \u201cRip his ear off!\u201d And, \u201cPunch her in the face!\u201d All he could do was huddle in the corner of his cage and wait to learn the outcome.</p><p>And when he did\u2014</p><p>Hector\u2019s eyelids popped open.</p><p>Barely able to catch his breath as the dream receded, he realized he was drenched in sweat, his body seemingly on fire. He did a quick scan of his bedroom. He was alone. His thick, dark curtains were drawn, and the only light source was the azure pulsing from his arms.</p><p>His arms. Shit! He jackknifed to his feet and studied both. The skin was raw from his determined scratching, the ink faded. Again.</p><p>Scowling, he looked over his bed. Despite his flame-retardant sheets, he\u2019d left singe marks behind. Have to control yourself better. His heart drummed erratically against his ribs, his blood molten in his veins.</p><p>Hector hated dreaming about his childhood, but he especially hated that particular memory. At least you didn\u2019t dream about what happened the next night.</p><p>Shaky, he lumbered to his kitchen. His tattoo gun, ink, various other paraphernalia, and gauze rested on top of his kitchen table, where he also had papers about his past scattered.</p><p>Articles about people with unexplainable abilities that had nothing to do with otherworlders. Things like skin turning to stone, and bone to metal. Things like eyes that swirled and hypnotized and voices that enslaved. Then there were the papers concerning his mother and father\u2019s family trees. Hector came from poor, uneducated trash, and he\u2019d even had to teach himself how to read and write.</p><p>Another reason you shouldn\u2019t be with Noelle.</p><p>The stray thought didn\u2019t exactly take him unaware. He\u2019d thought about her the entire drive home yesterday. He\u2019d thought about her while watching TV before bed. He\u2019d thought about her when he\u2019d fallen asleep. He was only surprised he hadn\u2019t dreamed about her.</p><p>Annnd ... there was his hard-on. The stupid shit. Hector had developed a very bad habit. Think of Noelle, and become aroused. No matter where he was or what he was doing.</p><p>You can\u2019t have her. Why is that so difficult to accept?</p><p>To encourage that acceptance, he listed the reasons he needed to avoid her.</p><p>She had money.</p><p>He did not.</p><p>She was sophisticated.</p><p>He was not.</p><p>Actually, he was as rough and gruff as a man could be.</p><p>With the publicity a woman like her garnered combined with his soiled past\u2014and present\u2014they\u2019d be headline news and none of it would be good. Mia had told him how the press had already phoned AIR about Noelle\u2019s enrollment, asking how she was doing at camp.</p><p>No matter what happened or how much digging was done, no one would learn about the violence of Hector\u2019s childhood. That, he\u2019d buried and buried deep, ditching Beckham for his brother\u2019s name. But the hooker thing? Yeah. That information was only a phone call away.</p><p>And if he was caught \u201cdating\u201d Noelle, his sexual practices would stare at him from every newspaper and TV screen he encountered. No, thanks. The fact that he knew was bad enough.</p><p>Plus, what better way to lose someone like Noelle? Not that you can ever have her. Once she learned the truth about him, she wouldn\u2019t want him anyway. She\u2019d stop looking at him as if they were alone and naked, the only thing keeping them apart a prayer that neither of them wanted answered.</p><p>A look he didn\u2019t trust. Girl was tricky. Big-time tricky. A man would never know where he stood with her, what she was capable of, or what she truly wanted from him.</p><p>Not only was she was devious, but she was smarter than she appeared, tougher, a little bit cruel, and a whole lot prepared for whatever AIR threw at her. After the double tap she\u2019d given him, there was no denying the truth: if something drastic wasn\u2019t done, she\u2019d make it to the end of camp and he\u2019d have to deal with her for the rest of his working life.</p><p>His hands fisted, the glow intensifying. Damn it, stop thinking about her and fix your tatts.</p><p>Hector plopped into a chair, sorted through his supplies, clipped the ink gun together. He\u2019d been doing this so many years, it was second nature. Honestly, he could have done it with his eyes closed.</p><p>The little needle glided over his skin, creating the Celtic symbol for peace over and over again. Every so often he would have to stop to wipe away the blood, but soon the glow died. Unfortunately, the heat never did.</p><p>Shit. Until he at last released the darkest edges of his body\u2019s sexual needs, Hector realized, the tattoos wouldn\u2019t help him. Because clearly, his desire for Noelle had made him sensitive to all other emotions. Especially anger. Now he was like a bomb ready to blow.</p><p>So. No question, he\u2019d reached the danger stage. The do-something-now-now-now level. Or suffer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You know what you have to do.</p><p>Yeah, he did, and he\u2019d get to that. Right now, he had to finish his tatts. They might not help him now, but they\u2019d help him later, after he\u2019d gotten to that.</p><p>He\u2019d discovered this method about a year before joining AIR. He\u2019d been desperate, having tried meditation, and even keeping a freaking food journal on the off chance the problem stemmed from something he was eating. Then he\u2019d read somewhere that once upon a time berserkers had tattooed themselves with images meant to keep themselves calm.</p> <p>Hector had thought, why not, and had done the same. Though he\u2019d quickly burned through the first round of ink, he\u2019d liked the fact that he could judge his heat factor with a single visual sweep. So he\u2019d tried again, peppering his arms with different symbols for peace. He\u2019d soon learned the Celtic one lasted the longest, helped the most, and acted as the best guide.</p><p>So he\u2019d been applying these ever since.</p><p>If any of his coworkers had ever noticed that the ink was sometimes light, sometime dark, or that the symbols sometimes linked in new places, they\u2019d never said. He never let anyone study them, anyway, and everyone knew never to touch him.</p><p>When he finished, he cleaned both arms and applied antibiotic ointment. Tomorrow he\u2019d have scabs, but whatever. He\u2019d wear his gloves and no one at AIR would know.</p><p>Mia had a case for him, and he was excited to dive in. Five more otherworlder girls had been found in a warehouse. They were around the same age\u2014late teens\u2014though each was a different race and unable to speak English. They weren\u2019t as undernourished as the three before them, but they were just as traumatized.</p> <p>Mia had brought in translators, but even still, the girls had given very few usable details. All they\u2019d known was that they\u2019d been home one moment and in the warehouse the next. Unfortunately they hadn\u2019t seen their captor\u2014or didn\u2019t remember seeing him. Drugs could screw with anyone\u2019s memory, and they\u2019d each had fresh track marks on their veins. Track marks they\u2019d claimed to know nothing about.</p><p>They\u2019d been trapped for three days, and no one had come for them. They\u2019d beaten at the walls and screamed for help, but no one had heard them. Understandable.</p><p>After the human-alien war, the planet had been razed and nearly everything had to be rebuilt. Most buildings were now comprised of shield-armor, and most walls were soundproofed steel. Even in warehouses.</p><p>Great if your planet was going to war. Bad if you were a woman locked somewhere you didn\u2019t want to be.</p><p>Mia had found them only because she\u2019d received an anonymous tip. The same way she\u2019d found the others. Hector planned to do a little digging and learn what he could about Mr.\u2014or Miss?\u2014Anonymous.</p><p>He also planned to interview the girls and see if they\u2019d remembering anything new\u2014or had held anything back. He would try to be gentle, but his voice was gruff no matter what he said or what emotion he was going for, and his appearance alone usually scared the fairer sex.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s what the girls needed, though. Maybe they were still afraid of their captor(s). Maybe they needed to know an AIR agent could be just as frightening, and that someone like Hector would protect them with his life.</p><p>And he would. He had a weakness for the young and the damaged, and worked that type of case harder than any other. Which was why he had to be top shape tomorrow.</p><p>Determined, Hector made himself a sandwich and quickly inhaled every crumb, even though the thing was tasteless and settled like lead, then downed a glass of water. All right, then. He\u2019d taken care of two needs. His arms and his hunger.</p><p>That left only one.</p><p>Biting the inside of his cheek, he picked up the phone and dialed Happy Endings.</p><p>Eight</p><p>THE DOORBELL RANG.</p><p>Hector had been waiting for that shrill ding dong all morning. Having stayed up the rest of the night, unwilling to go back to bed and risk another dream, he\u2019d had nothing to do but think of Noelle. Of her lips pressed against his, of her tongue battling his, of her body arching into his. Of her accepting him, just as he was. Of her needing him, all of him.</p> <p>If ever there had been a woman created solely to tempt him, it was Noelle. Her beauty, her scent, her taste, her ... everything. She appealed to him on every level.</p><p>Now he was like a junkie in need of a fix, worse off than before. He couldn\u2019t go to work on edge like this. And yet, he wished like hell he\u2019d never made that call to Happy Endings.</p><p>You want to accidentally hurt the otherworlders you\u2019re supposed to interview?</p><p>No. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Ding dong.</p><p>He stalked to the ID panel and gritted, \u201cOpen.\u201d The front door obeyed, metal sliding to the side, no longer separating inside from out.</p><p>Air laced with car exhaust, sunshine, and thick, cloying perfume drifted to him. He didn\u2019t look at his visitor\u2019s face; he didn\u2019t care what she looked like and actually preferred not to know. He looked at her arms. No track marks. He looked at the pulse at the base of her neck. Good, strong, and steady.</p><p>She wore a loose white blouse and a well-fitted black skirt, as if she were headed to the office rather than the bedroom.</p><p>His gaze moved beyond her. Bright sunlight glinted off the dark, nondescript sedan she\u2019d parked in his driveway. He scanned the houses across the street from his. Tall but narrow, each was built with a different color of brick\u2014from brown to gold and even purple\u2014and packed closely together. None of his neighbors were outside. Even though they\u2019d never be able to tell what the girl did for a living by her car or appearance, he was glad.</p><p>To his left was a dentist, and to his right a family of four. They\u2019d be disgusted if they knew what went on behind his door. He was.</p><p>Hector moved aside and motioned the woman inside.</p><p>She soared past him without a word. So. She knew his MO. Either she\u2019d been here before, or the girls who\u2019d been here had talked and told her what he \u201cliked.\u201d Zero communication, a straight shot to his guest room, a blow job, then a straight shot out.</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d he said and once again the door obeyed. He didn\u2019t turn around. Didn\u2019t follow the woman as she clicked and clacked down his hallway. He just stood there, looking around as if his home was new to him.</p><p>He had no holophotos, not of himself and certainly not of his family. He would have liked a few of Dean, if any had ever been taken or if Dean had still lived. They hadn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>There was no clutter. No vases, no colorful but useless bowls or other shit women seemed to like. Just the basics. A couch, a loves eat, and a coffee table. An entertainment bureau, and a few plaques for \u201cheroic\u201d behavior on the job.</p><p>The fabric on the furniture was synthetic and worn, the table cheap stone rather than real wood, and the TV as basic as electronics came. He didn\u2019t live here so much as exist here, flittering through between cases.</p><p>What would Noelle think of his stuff?</p><p>The answer didn\u2019t matter. Couldn\u2019t matter. Why are you stalling? You\u2019re a menace. This is necessary.</p><p>Necessary. How he hated that word. Hated how it took away his freedom of choice.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he be like every other man? Able to touch a woman, hell, even touch himself, without causing all kinds of devastation. Instead, he was a killer with undetachable weapons strapped to his body.</p><p>Rage at his own helplessness suddenly exploded through him, and he punched a hole in the living room wall. There was a spray of little rocks, some springing across the room, some just tumbling to the floor. His knuckles barely registered the sting.</p><p>Calm down, idiot. Anger had the same effect on his arms as sexual frustration. Combined, the two created a toxic mix of oh shit. He had to do this. He would do this.</p><p>Grinding his molars, he traced the lingering scent of that perfume to his guest room. He never let anyone into the master, never let anyone do anything to him in the living room or the kitchen, either. He didn\u2019t want to ever walk inside those rooms and think about this part of his life. Therefore, all sexual activity happened here.</p><p>The woman was already on her knees.</p><p>Per his specifications, she was still fully clothed and hadn\u2019t even bothered unbuttoning her collar.</p><p>He\u2019d never had sex with a working girl, had never dared risk that kind of physical contact with one. Hell, he\u2019d never had sex period. Not even with Kira, his one and only girlfriend. He\u2019d killed her before they actually sealed\u2014</p><p>Stop that shit. Now.</p><p>Hector threw a dark curtain over his thoughts. Out of habit, he checked the condition of his \u201cnothing can burn through these, I swear!\u201d gloves. A dark curse left him. Damn salesman. Hector should have known better. Even though he\u2019d tattooed himself last night, several spots were already burned and ringed, the edges of those rings caked in soot. He even smelled of cinder.</p><p>Damn that Noelle.</p><p>And wouldn\u2019t you know it? Just as before, merely thinking her name got him hard as a goddamn steel pipe, desire overshadowing his lingering anger.</p><p>What was it about her that lit him up so completely? She was gorgeous, but so were other women. She was silly and violent, a little playful, a lot vengeful. Her only vulnerability, that he could see, was Ava.</p><p>What was Noelle doing right now? Causing trouble, he thought, and next found himself grinning.</p><p>The moment he realized what he was doing, he scowled. He\u2019d never obsessed about a woman before. Always he\u2019d been able to walk away. So why did simply thinking Noelle cause such a strong reaction?</p><p>\u201cShould I ...\u201d The female in front of him motioned to his zipper. She must be in a hurry to get this done to have broken his no-communication rule.</p><p>\u201cNo. I will.\u201d But he didn\u2019t. He just stood there, as motionless as a statue. He wanted Noelle, yet he was going to allow another woman to put her mouth on him. A woman who didn\u2019t want him.</p><p>Guilt ate at him, the bites bigger than usual.</p><p>You aren\u2019t locked in a cage. You aren\u2019t forced to harm other kids just to stay alive. His life was good. He hunted predatory baddies for a living, helped prevent other kids from having a childhood as traumatic as his. So the fuck what if he paid a stranger to get him off while he craved someone else?</p><p>With shaky hands he unfastened the only button on his pants. Tendrils of smoke rose from the holes in his gloves. Shit. He had to do this quickly. He needed the release the hooker could give him, and soon, before he burned down his house with the two of them in it.</p><p>\u201cYou do the rest,\u201d he croaked, locking his arms behind his back. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ... don\u2019t talk anymore.\u201d He\u2019d lose his erection, but his hormones wouldn\u2019t cool down.</p><p>She nodded, reached for him, and down went his zipper. Cold fingers moved his underwear out of the way and wrapped around the base of his shaft. His disgust with himself climbed.</p><p>As if she were part of a movie and someone had pushed the slow-motion button, he watched as she opened her mouth and inched toward his cock ... closer ... He clenched his teeth.</p><p>What the fuck are you doing? his better half screamed. This is wrong, so wrong. There has to be another way.</p><p>The answer was simple. He was surviving.</p><p>Closer ...</p><p>Damn it, what if there was another way? He\u2019d never tried to masturbate, had let fear stop him, but maybe he should have risked it. Maybe singeing off his cock would finally end his physical and mental torment.</p><p>Closer ...</p><p>Sweat dripped from his temples, sliding down his cheeks. His legs vibrated with the strength needed to hold himself in place.</p><p>Just get it over with! the other part of him shouted. The part he knew, understood. Until you do, you\u2019re dangerous. Operating on a hair trigger.</p><p>That, too, was the truth.</p><p>What should he do? The two needs warred, both so fierce they threatened to pull him apart.</p><p>Closer ...</p><p>His entire body shaking. Closer ...</p><p>Heating.</p><p>Closer still ...</p><p>Sweating, blistering.</p><p>He jerked away, severing contact. The woman looked up at him, her eyes widening with confusion.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do it. He just couldn\u2019t. This wasn\u2019t right. He wanted someone else, and if he couldn\u2019t have Noelle\u2019s mouth on him, he wouldn\u2019t have anyone\u2019s. That didn\u2019t change the fact that he needed relief, somehow, some way, but he\u2019d deal with that as soon as the woman left.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I put the money on the nightstand. Please, just take it and go.\u201d He knew his voice lashed like a whip, but he couldn\u2019t help it. He hurt, he yearned. He was scared out of his goddamn mind about what he planned to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he croaked. Finally he allowed himself to study her face. She was most likely in her early twenties, though life had not been kind to her. Had aged her beyond her years, with stress lines branching from her eyes and mouth. Her hair was bright red, too coarse to be real.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t want me,\u201d she said, but damn if there wasn\u2019t relief in her voice. She grabbed the money and strolled away, out of the house, a spring in her step.</p><p>Nine</p><p>HECTOR WAITED UNTIL HE heard the front door snick closed before releasing the breath he\u2019d been holding and carefully wrapping his hand around the base of his cock. He was going to masturbate, even if it killed him. And he was going to do it now, before he lost his nerve.</p><p>He could feel the burn his arm emitted through the fabric of his glove, but he didn\u2019t fry his shaft to a crisp and took heart.</p><p>Do it. Slowly up, slowly down, he stroked. Still no problems. He increased his speed. Up, down. The glide wasn\u2019t easy, but it wasn\u2019t bad, either. Up, down, faster and faster.</p><p>The glow brightened. The heat blazed. And yet, still no problems.</p><p>Relaxing, getting into it, he squeezed his thick, marble-hard shaft with a strength borrowed from his desperation. Up, down, up, down. No matter how excited he became, he never hurt himself\u2014and yet orgasm eluded him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Come. On. As much as he loved knowing he could do this, he wanted to reach the end. To know he\u2019d be okay even then.</p><p>He tried softer strokes, then hard again, softer then harder. Harder still.</p><p>Nothing worked\u2014until Noelle\u2019s image took shape in his mind. Tall, slim, her glossy brown hair hanging past her shoulders, the sun glittering behind her and forming a halo around her. Her eyes were languid, the lids at half-mast, those lovely gray irises becoming liquid silver as she traced them over his body. Her lush mouth was parted, as if she couldn\u2019t quite catch her breath. As if the sight of him had aroused her.</p> <p>Next he saw her on his bed. She was naked, her nipples pink and beaded. Her stomach hollowed, and as he watched, enraptured, she dabbled her fingers around her navel, teasing herself\u2014teasing him.</p><p>A moan escaped her as she arched her back and spread her legs wide. The curls between her legs were dark and glistening with her desire. So much desire. For him. Only him.</p><p>\u201cHector,\u201d she said, a prayer and a curse all at once. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Yes, damn it, yes. He needed her, too. He imagined himself sinking inside this pliant, dream Noelle with a single thrust. Imagined the way she clutched him, hot and wet and so incredibly tight.</p><p>His cock loved the imagery as much as his mind, and his pleasure deepened. His strokes became jerky, but oh, shit, they felt good.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she pleaded, all smoke and eagerness as her knees squeezed at his waist.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he gritted. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Hector, yes. Touch me. Please, touch me. I love it when you touch me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he thought again. He was going to touch her. Touch her everywhere. Was going to brand her, own her, become all that she knew, all that she wanted to know. Was even reaching for her ...</p><p>His balls drew up tight, sensation ramping ... ramping ... Oh, hallelujah! He squeezed the head of his penis and jetted white-hot into his palm. Finally, finally, thank you God, finally.</p><p>When his shudders at last calmed, he simply stood there, sliding down from the high, the pleasure, and glorying in his success.</p> <p>His. Success. The two words echoed inside his mind. He\u2019d done it. He\u2019d actually gotten himself off without hurting himself or anyone else.</p><p>It was a miracle. It was ... his salvation. Whispers of excitement rushed through him. From this moment on, he could take care of himself. More words echoed. He could actually take care of himself!</p><p>His body must be immune to the heat and the atomizing. And damn, he should have realized that sooner. Felt stupid that he hadn\u2019t, and yet that still didn\u2019t dampen his joy.</p><p>Grinning, he walked into the hallway bathroom, tossed the gloves, washed up, and righted his clothing. The itching and burning in his arms had subdued completely. He was utterly calm, under control. It was like his slate had just been wiped clean. He felt wonderfully normal.</p><p>And now, any time his arms acted up, or his need became too much, he could take care of himself and feel this way again. He wouldn\u2019t have to call a hooker. He found himself laughing, the sound rusty.</p><p>He went to his bedroom and sat at the edge of his bed\u2014such a terrible start to his day, with such a spectacular finish\u2014then dialed Mia Snow, his bitch on wheels of a temporary boss. Jack Pagosa, his real boss, had taken a leave of absence for heart problems or some shit like that and had left Mia in charge of the New Chicago offices.</p><p>Truth be told, Hector had been a little surprised by Jack\u2019s choice. Mia was a good agent, one of the best, certainly, but Hector had been on staff just as long as she had, and had just as many arrests and kills. Same with Dallas. Hell, same with Ghost and Jaxon. And Jaxon was the most diplomatic of them all. Or rather, he used to be.</p><p>Probably didn\u2019t hurt that Snow was dating one of the most powerful men on Earth. An Arcadian who was as rich as Noelle, maybe richer, with the ability to move faster than the speed of light, control people with his mind, and predict the future.</p> <p>Hector was a little envious of Kyrin\u2019s openness. The guy didn\u2019t care who knew about his origins or his powers. How nice would it be to have that kind of freedom? To just be who he was, unconcerned about anything else?</p><p>But Hector\u2019s abilities destroyed, caused pain, and with pain came fear. Fear brought a whole new pot of problems to the table. Someone\u2014probably multiple someones\u2014would want to put him down to \u201cprotect\u201d the innocent.</p><p>\u201cThis is Snow,\u201d she said five rings in.</p><p>\u201cHey. It\u2019s Hector.\u201d No preliminaries, just the facts. \u201cWhere are my girls being held?\u201d</p><p>Breath crackled over the connection. \u201cYou beat me to the punch. I was just about to call you.\u201d</p><p>The tension in her voice distressed him. Mia wasn\u2019t touchy-feely by nature, and hardly anything threw her off her game. Took something major to upset her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissing?\u201d His happiness vanished in an instant. His fingers squeezed the cell, nearly cracking the plastic. Relax. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were in the hospital, hooked to IVs, with guards at their doors. Doctor goes in to check on one, and she\u2019s gone. He thinks she left on her own, so he goes to the next room. She\u2019s gone. Same deal with the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny witnesses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. I\u2019m sending a team to dust for prints, check for voice recordings, but ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get anything.\u201d Recorders were set up strategically throughout the city, and because alien voices were so different from that of humans, in ways humans couldn\u2019t detect without the proper machinery, those recorders only picked up otherworlder conversations.</p><p>When you had a location and a time, pinpointing specific conversations was easy. However, otherworlders knew about the recorders and knew to commit their crimes quietly.</p><p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d Mia said. \u201cI\u2019ve already watched video feed and there was no one coming in or out of their room except the medical staff. And none of the staff wheeled anything out that was big enough to hold a body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe women could have fought whoever grabbed them. Maybe they said something during the struggle.\u201d They were alien, so their voices would have been recorded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you dig through the recordings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hospital will be my first stop.\u201d For someone to grab the girls so quickly, so effortlessly, and without drawing a single bit of notice, teleportation had to be in play. \u201cAny Arcadians working there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few, and I\u2019ve already got men hunting their locations to pull them in for questioning.\u201d</p><p>They thought alike. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>A lot of Arcadians could teleport, yes, but there were ways to prevent them from doing so. Like certain metals that were mined from other planets. Expensive as hell to acquire, and hard as hell to drag through one wormhole after another\u2014the standard way to planet hop\u2014but AIR HQ and all AIR vehicles were comprised of the necessary materials.</p><p>If you weren\u2019t near AIR or your vehicle, lasercuffs worked just as well. They weren\u2019t metal, but the light they produced bonded to skin, any kind of skin. When an Arcadian was restrained that way, and he teleported, the bands would heat, just like Hector\u2019s arms, and his hands would literally melt off. Brutal, but necessary. AIR had to take precautions to protect the innocent.</p><p>\u201cSo here\u2019s a question,\u201d Hector said. \u201cHow did the abductor know the girls were in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t sure,\u201d she said. \u201cToo many options. A chatty or even corrupt hospital employee. A chatty or corrupt friend of a hospital employee. The spread of idle gossip to the wrong people. An isotope tracker. Maybe one of the girls called someone, and that call was traced. We\u2019re checking the lines, but the other theories require more time to investigate.\u201d</p><p>His free hand fisted. \u201cThe MO for this abduction, as well as the other one, is similar. Therefore, it\u2019s safe to say that whoever took our first batch of girls took our second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. And since the first one was yours, this one is all yours, as well,\u201d she said. \u201cWrap it up quick.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll do my best. He always did. \u201cNo anonymous tip to help us out this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we have no idea why the girls are being taken and locked away?\u201d Made no sense, really. Why take them if you weren\u2019t going to use them in some way? Why starve them?</p><p>He\u2019d studied pictures. Each girl was pretty, very pretty, and his first thought had been sex slaves. He\u2019d busted a few whorehouses throughout the years. Otherworlder females were promised lodgings on Earth, a job, whatever. So they came here expecting to start a new life.</p><p>They started a new life, all right. In some rich guy\u2019s bed. And that\u2019s if they were lucky. The unlucky ones were placed in those whorehouses, forced to service countless men and women each and every day.</p><p>But again, why take these girls and not put them to work right away?</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d Mia said. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t gotten any other answers out of them. Not any we understood, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Very well. \u201cAfter I finish at the hospital, I\u2019ll go over transcripts of what was said. Maybe I\u2019ll pick up on something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, uh, Mia.\u201d Self-preservation rose. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor personal reasons. And I swear to you, they\u2019re good reasons. Important. Life-threatening even.\u201d</p><p>A weary sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some time off, no prob. You rarely ask. And okay, sure, miss your second week at camp. I\u2019ll deal with Dallas\u2019s whining, as always. Because yes, he will complain about the injustice of someone taking a break without him.\u201d</p><p>Actually, Hector thought Dallas would be happy to have Noelle to himself, but whatever. He didn\u2019t care. He\u2014</p><p>Smelled melting plastic and realized his hand had heated to the point of deep-frying in mere seconds. Despite his sexual release. What the hell? He was so jealous, so possessive, he immediately reacted to the thought of anyone else with Noelle?</p><p>He\u2019d never had a woman, all to himself, and he\u2014</p><p>Didn\u2019t need to be thinking that way. Breathing in and out, Hector forced a surge of calm. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said to hurry the conversation along. \u201cI owe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re going back to camp for the final month,\u201d she cut in, heartless as only she could be. \u201cI value your opinion, and I need to know how the remaining trainees have progressed.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t point out that Dallas could tell her. Or Jaxon. Or Ghost. Phoenix was the youngest and newest member of the team, so no one would care what she thought. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go back.\u201d Maybe.</p><p>Hopefully, he wouldn\u2019t be thinking about Noelle every spare minute of every day. Hopefully, he wouldn\u2019t be thinking about her at all. But even if he was, he now had a method for dealing, he reminded himself.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Mia said. \u201cNow get to work, Dean. Oh, and say hello to Noelle Tremain for me when you finally return to camp. I hear you guys are tight.\u201d Her laughter echoed over the line.</p><p>\u201cFucking Dallas,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cUh, no. Don\u2019t blame him for your infamy. There\u2019s a video of your KO, and it\u2019s all over the web. At least thirty people have emailed me a link. Congratulations, you\u2019re a star.\u201d Click.</p><p>Wonderful. Worldwide humiliation. Exactly what he\u2019d needed.</p><p>Hector tossed his phone on his nightstand and padded to his bathroom, where he hopped in the shower. The dry enzyme misting from the overhead and side spouts caused the plastic he\u2019d melted to dissolve quickly.</p><p>Six weeks, he thought. Then he and Noelle would once again cross paths.</p><p>He had a feeling only one of them would survive. He wondered just who that would be.</p><p>Ten</p><p>AIR Training Camp</p><p>Week Eight</p><p>HE WAS BACK.</p><p>Noelle hadn\u2019t seen Hector since she\u2019d laid him flat, oh, around six weeks ago.</p><p>Maybe she should have gone easier on him. Two little taps, though. Love taps, really, and he\u2019d dropped as if he were the slowest gazelle in the pack and she the hungry lion who\u2019d won rights to first bite. Then he\u2019d collected himself, stood, and walked away without uttering a word.</p><p>In her defense, he\u2019d kind of deserved it. Not just for the way he\u2019d eyed her with such disgust the day they\u2019d met\u2014and had since admitted he\u2019d been wrong about, she reminded herself\u2014but because he\u2019d knocked Johnny Deschanel on his ass and looked at Noelle, all this is what\u2019s going to happen to you if you stay here.</p><p>Well, she had stayed\u2014but he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She sat at the window cubby in the bunkhouse. Night had long since fallen, but the lamps surrounding the instructors\u2019 quarters provided the perfect spotlight. Hector had just driven up in a sleek black Porsche, emerged without looking around, and carried a bag up the steps, finally disappearing from view.</p><p>She had not watched the way his pants pulled tight against his perfect, muscled ass with every step. And she had not thought of him while he\u2019d been gone. Not more than a few hundred times.</p><p>And she really hadn\u2019t thought about the way he\u2019d removed his T-shirt that day, revealing cord after cord of hard-won strength, tanned skin glistening with sweat, and a smattering of dark hair. Or how she\u2019d gasped when she had first spied him, awed and aroused and aching to put her hands on him.</p><p>Something else she hadn\u2019t thought about: how his right arm had sported fewer tattoos and how, just before he\u2019d tugged on his gloves, those tattoos had shimmered, softly glowing like they had that night in the alley.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought about why he glowed\u2014optical illusion on her part? exposure to a toxic chemical on his? allergic reaction to alien cuisine? weird fluke of nature?\u2014or how hot-off-the-streets sexy he was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, uh, she really had to stop (not) thinking about him.</p><p>This attraction ... she didn\u2019t understand it, didn\u2019t understand why his intensity fascinated her. Or why she\u2019d missed him so damn badly. Or how he\u2019d pepped her up while he was here. How he\u2019d pushed and pushed and pushed, yet hadn\u2019t sent her into a frenzy of self-destruction.</p><p>Maybe because he didn\u2019t do it to malign her character. He did it to make her a better agent, someone who saved lives and protected those who couldn\u2019t protect themselves. He\u2019d actually distracted her from her loneliness, making her forget all about that ever-gnawing void inside her. He\u2019d given her purpose.</p> <p>Or maybe the lack of sting was because he looked at her, really looked at her, as if she were a person worthy of his time and attention. And even though he\u2019d shouted, he hadn\u2019t called her names.</p><p>For that reason, she\u2019d abandoned her revenge plans for him. So he\u2019d kissed her and rejected her. Wasn\u2019t a punch to that gorgeous mouth enough?</p><p>But again ... why did she feel this way about him?</p><p>Sure, he was like no one she\u2019d ever met before and he didn\u2019t care about making nice. He treated everyone with the same sense of cold detachment\u2014except Noelle. With her, he barked orders and assumed she\u2019d just comply. When he didn\u2019t get it, he physically forced the issue.</p><p>Sometimes he joked around with the other agents, and he was relaxed, casual. Yet still he radiated all kinds of ferocity, as if he couldn\u2019t quite lower his guard all the way. With anyone.</p> <p>What would it take to relax him absolutely? What would he be like that way?</p><p>She\u2019d never know, she was sure. Because ... oh, God ... she was going to talk to him and at last douse the chemistry sparking between them. Or at least, on her end. One conversation, and she could finally stop (not) thinking about him. She just knew it. He\u2019d snarl, of course, and she\u2019d remember how grumpy he was. He\u2019d tell her he wasn\u2019t interested, and she\u2019d remember she wasn\u2019t into proving herself.</p><p>She tiptoed to Ava\u2019s bunk and sat at the edge of the mattress. \u201cAva,\u201d she whispered. No lights were shining over the bunk, no moonlight washing over the bed, but Noelle had been awake for the past hour and her eyes had long since adjusted to the darkness. \u201cYou up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her friend whispered back, voice scratchy from slumber.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. Quick question. Let\u2019s say, hypothetically, that I snuck out.\u201d Walking over to the instructors\u2019 cabin wasn\u2019t a crime. For all they knew, she\u2019d spotted something suspicious. But a girl never knew what the agents would decide to complain about.</p><p>Can\u2019t get a third strike. She did, and she doubted she\u2019d be allowed to stay.</p> <p>And now ... now she really wanted to stay.</p><p>She finally understood what all the fuss was about. She was good at this.</p><p>Challenged. Intrigued. She thrived where others failed. And, if given a chance, she could make a difference in the world; she could save lives, destroy killers.</p><p>Having a goal was nice, and something she hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d needed. But every day she felt a little more centered, a little more driven.</p><p>\u201cWould you cover for me?\u201d she asked, already knowing the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of the other trainees to know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>A big yawn, a total body stretch. \u201cDid you get slapped upside the head today? Of course I\u2019ll cover for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need backup?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d She had to do this on her own. She eased to a stand, the stupid mattress creaking.</p><p>Ava sat up, satin curls falling all around her face. \u201cSo where are you going?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t lie to her friend. She wouldn\u2019t. \u201cTo see Hector Dean. He just arrived. I want to ... talk to him.\u201d And a whole lot more, but she wouldn\u2019t do more, even if he begged. Definitely.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>\u201cYou going to kill him?\u201d Ava asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ve decided to play nice.\u201d</p><p>Noelle had only been with two men. The first, a mistake in high school. The next day, the slimy bastard had told everyone at school how he\u2019d popped her cherry. Within hours, she\u2019d become a raging slut.</p><p>Of course, Ava had then popped his cherry red sports car into his parents\u2019 living room wall. Noelle still got all weepy when she remembered. Such a heroic gesture. A gesture that had marked Ava\u2019s very first arrest.</p><p>They\u2019d celebrated by stealing very expensive champagne, and that had marked Noelle\u2019s.</p><p>The second guy, Corban, she\u2019d chosen more carefully. Or so she\u2019d thought. Even though he was an otherworlder, he\u2019d come from a wealthy background. And even though he\u2019d come from a wealthy background, he\u2019d proven himself to be a warrior at heart. He hadn\u2019t chosen law enforcement or anything like that, but professional football.</p><p>They\u2019d met at a cocktail party, and he\u2019d come on strong. At first, he\u2019d made her feel pretty. Special and accepted. When they began dating officially, however, that\u2019s when the criticism had started.</p><p>A girlfriend of his would never.... fill in the blank.</p><p>A girlfriend of his had to ... fill in the blank.</p><p>Men were complications. Men were hassles. And though Noelle wanted to open herself up and take a chance\u2014in theory\u2014she hadn\u2019t yet.</p><p>Since the break-up, she had dated other guys. A lot of other guys. Always within the first hour, she found a thousand things wrong, and declined all invitations to go for a second round.</p><p>Strangely, she\u2019d found a thousand things wrong with Hector, but she still wanted to see him. Again and again. Preferably naked.</p><p>\u201cNoelle, you little hussy,\u201d Ava whispered. \u201cAre you still with me?\u201d</p><p>She shook herself back into the present. \u201cNow I am, my darling\u2014wait, do you prefer little person, vertically challenged, or pocket rocket?\u201d</p><p>A grinning Ava reached up and patted her cheek with a bit too much force.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d she managed to quietly yelp.</p><p>\u201cOops, sorry. Sometimes I don\u2019t know my own strength. Now as I was saying. After the way Hector stared at your twins that day, I\u2019m gonna pretend I never uttered the word dibs, but only for tonight. \u2019Cause you know, the first taste is free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve told me. This will be the second taste.\u201d If anything happened. Which it wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cThe first and second tastes are free. You want a third, you\u2019ll have to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never doubted it.\u201d Noelle nibbled on her bottom lip. \u201cIf I\u2019m not back by morning, send robo-cadaver dogs after my body. Hector\u2019s killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure?\u201d</p><p>I wish. No, no, she didn\u2019t wish. They were going to chat, nothing more. \u201cNo, with a vengeance stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOtherwise known as a penis?\u201d</p><p>She had to smother her laughter with both hands.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d Ava said, \u201cI\u2019m rooting for you. Oh, and I have this strange feeling that you should check your phone for messages. See ya.\u201d She lay back down, but Noelle knew the girl wouldn\u2019t sleep. She\u2019d listen and she\u2019d wait, and if anyone woke up or came inside and noticed Noelle was missing, she\u2019d take care of it.</p><p>Outside, Noelle jumped down the fire escape, landed in the dirt, the moonlit air cool as she pressed her back against the dilapidated bunkhouse wall. When no one sounded an alarm, she whipped out her phone. The new message? A photo of Noelle with her face scrunched up, about to sneeze.</p><p>Caption read: Here\u2019s a true screen savor 4 U.</p><p>Little witch, she thought with an inward laugh.</p><p>Storing her phone in her back pocket, she considered her options. The path from bunkhouse hell to instructor\u2019s paradise would take fifteen seconds, give or take a few depending on her hustle, and was completely illuminated. No one was outside, but if an agent were to walk past one of the many windows, she\u2019d be spotted instantly.</p><p>No reason to worry about the trainees. Ava would tackle whoever wanted outside and perform a total knockout. Besides, after this morning\u2019s torture session, everyone was mentally and physically exhausted and more likely to die in their beds than get up to so much as pee.</p><p>Apparently the only way to learn how to interrogate your targets was to be interrogated. Also apparent, interrogation sometimes involved getting beaten to a pulp. Noelle\u2019s ribs had stopped her instructor\u2019s fist from slamming into the back of her chair, oh, about thirty times, and they were now probably cracked as hell.</p><p>Thanks to the nerve-frying procedure, those cracks hadn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t bother her. Noelle wouldn\u2019t even know if she were dying. In fact, the only time she ever knew something was wrong was by the bruising\u2014she had that in spades right now\u2014or if she passed out from blood loss.</p><p>Her father had thought he was doing her a favor, and yeah, maybe he had, but the process had inadvertently destroyed some of her pleasure receptors, too. Now a guy had to really work to give her an orgasm.</p><p>Would Hector be able to give her an orgasm?</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to think about the answer. After that combustible kiss they\u2019d shared, yeah. He would be able to give her one without trying.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about that right now. The mission was more important. Okay, so. She could either walk with purpose and risk enemy\u2014aka instructor\u2014capture and have to explain her presence, or crawl and risk damaging her ribs further, possibly cutting into her lungs and not knowing it until she woke up in a hospital bed. Also, she\u2019d ruin her pretty cotton T-shirt that way.</p><p>She\u2019d walk, she decided. The T-shirt was a gift from Ava and read Good Girls Need Spankings Too.</p><p>To her relieved surprise, no one spotted her and she reached the cabin without incident. Another surprise, the window closest to her was open, allowing fresh air inside and noise outside. She propped her arms on the pane and leaned in. Sounds, so many sounds. Laughter, cheering, taunting, curses, beer slurping, glasses tinkling together.</p><p>No wonder the agents hadn\u2019t paid any attention to possible infiltration. They surrounded a holoscreen and were watching a football game. Otherworlders had only been accepted into the NFL a few drafts ago, and no one had known what to make of that until after the first few games. Violence on the field had intensified, and so had the love of the fans.</p><p>Noelle had a profile view of everyone, and wow, Hector had the most wonderfully sloped nose, a little bump in the middle. Probably from being broken so many times. A girl could get ideas about that bump. Like kissing it all better.</p><p>\u201cDamn, but Corban Blue is the best quarterback I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Dallas said after finishing off his beer and grabbing another from the cooler beside him. \u201cHe\u2019s got an arm like a cannon. He throws and the ball just shoots to the receiver like it\u2019s on a string and being tugged.\u201d</p><p>Think of the past, and boom, it would fill your present.</p><p>Corban. An Arcadian with long white hair, eyes of the most brilliant violet, and the face of God\u2019s favorite angel. Would Dallas (cough Hector cough) be shocked to know Noelle had dated him? That she and Corban had practically lived together once upon a time? Something they\u2019d managed to keep out of the media. An easy trick when you owned a lot of the media outlets in your city.</p><p>\u201cWe should recruit him,\u201d Hector said, slamming his glass into Dallas\u2019s in some kind of parody of a toast. What long lashes he had, fanning out like a peacock\u2019s tail feathers. \u201cImagine him tossing a target like that. With his perfect aim, he could have the body in the back of our cars without us ever having to take a step.\u201d</p><p>Dallas whistled. \u201cGoddamn, Agent Meanie. I like the way your mind works. Noelle must not have damaged your brain as much as we feared.\u201d</p><p>Hector grinned. \u201cDoctor asked me if I\u2019d introed my face to the windshield of a Mack truck.\u201d</p><p>A grin. A freaking grin. And there were dimples in his cheeks. Noelle barely stopped a dreamy sigh from leaving her. Mostly relaxed, a lot amused, the tension drained from him, he was beyond gorgeous. His golden eyes were bright, his lips plumped and red rather than thinned with displeasure.</p><p>\u201cShe was some kind of lucky, getting the drop on you like that,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cAnd you were some kind of stupid, letting her get the drop on you like that. She\u2019s a cream puff, man.\u201d</p><p>The urge to sigh vanished. She gnashed her teeth together. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have thrown so much fuel on the I\u2019m-so-stupid fire. They\u2019d had weeks to uncover her intelligence, or what she liked to consider intelligence, yet only Hector had questioned his initial impression? Come on!</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jaxon barked from the other side of the couch. \u201cThat\u2019s my cousin. Show some respect.\u201d</p><p>She noticed he didn\u2019t defend her smarts, the bastard.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear me say she has the IQ of a peanut, did you? Anyway.\u201d Blue eyes flipped back to Hector, and those strong shoulders lifted in a give-a-guy-a-break shrug.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s still here?\u201d Hector asked, and he sounded less than thrilled, if resolved.</p><p>This kept up, and her pretty white smile would be nothing but powder. Funny that when she came up in conversation, Hector\u2019s mood instantly soured. He\u2019d just rejected her again, yet this time she hadn\u2019t had to say a single word to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and dude. Interrogation 101 was today, and you shoulda seen her.\u201d Dallas finished off his second beer and tossed the glass where he\u2019d tossed the first. On the floor.</p><p>Hector scrubbed a hand across his scalp. \u201cWho ran the op?\u201d His tattoos. The ink was darker than it\u2019d been before he\u2019d left, and there were more swirling designs on both arms. Odd, but her mouth watered for a taste of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNone of us could bring ourselves to do it, to hit her, you know, so we called in the girls. Phoenix was already here, but Siren and Kitten came to help.\u201d</p><p>Phoenix, as delicate and fragile in appearance as Ava, yet she was the one who\u2019d stepped in at the last moment to finish pulverizing Noelle\u2019s ribcage. Siren was plain, average\u2014until she opened her mouth. Girl had the voice of an angelic choir, and listening to her was embarrassingly orgasmic.</p><p>Kitten, despite her feline grace, was pretty in the same hardass way as Hector. Tattooed, intense, with no apparent softness.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Hector said. \u201cKitten wanted a go at her first.\u201d</p> <p>How had he known?</p><p>\u201cBingo. Kit asked her how she\u2019d smuggled the maid in\u2014the second time. Don\u2019t know if you were here for that. Anyway, Noelle said she\u2019d used the tunnel. So Kit went off on this tangent about how, if Noelle had used the tunnel, none of us were alerted, yada yada, and roughed our girl Noelle up a bit. Noelle babbled about being willing to do anything to stop the abuse, even showing Kit her tits. Vulgar language out of that candy apple mouth and spoken in that I\u2019m-already-in-bed-and-without-my-panties voice ...\u201d Dallas moaned, as if in pain.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jaxon growled again.</p><p>Hector gripped the arm of the couch, his knuckles bleaching. Then he stiffened and pried his fingers from the furniture. Breathing deeply, he settled his hands in his lap.</p><p>Such a strong reaction confused her, made her wonder what the hell was going on inside that head of his.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s really interesting, though,\u201d Dallas went on when he\u2019d collected himself from the hormone high. \u201cEven when Siren and Phoenix got in on the action, Noelle never cried. Never got winded or acted as if she were hurt in any way. I\u2019ll show you the video feed. This\u2019ll only be my eighteenth time to watch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Hector shouted, then more calmly added, \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m too into the game, and I, uh, need something stronger than beer.\u201d He gave his bottle to a still-scowling Jaxon, pushed to a stand, and turned.</p><p>That\u2019s when he spotted her. His eyes widened, his nostrils flared, and the gold in his eyes blazed.</p><p>Oh, was she in trouble now.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>NOELLE WAVED WITH ONLY the slightest hesitation, as if she wasn\u2019t reeling from the sight of him. As if she wasn\u2019t irritated for missing him all these many weeks while he wasn\u2019t even interested in watching her outsmart three of his coworkers.</p> <p>Not that he would realize she\u2019d outsmarted The Estrogen Brigade. Come on\u2014use the tunnel again? Please. But because Noelle had offered a plausible explanation, Kitten had locked on that, never even considering there could have been another way. Same with the others.</p><p>Hector stood there a minute, popping his jaw. Rather than rat her out, as she halfway expected, he stalked from the living room, out the front door, and to her side.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak as he grabbed her by the forearm\u2014when had he pulled on gloves?\u2014and tugged her away from the building.</p><p>Another shocker: he didn\u2019t haul her ass back to the bunkhouse.</p><p>Her heart drummed in her chest, and if she\u2019d been a normal human being, that probably would have hurt the shit out of her battered ribs, was probably damaging her in ways she didn\u2019t know, but honestly? She didn\u2019t care. He smelled delicious, like he had that night in the alley, all earth and sky, fresh, wild, and untamable.</p><p>His skin was warm through the soft fabric, warmer than anyone else who\u2019d ever touched her, and the intensity of that heat affected her, reaching those deadened receptors and forcing them to take notice.</p><p>After bypassing all of the lamps, he released her and rounded on her, getting in her face. He was scowling. She thought he was going to erupt into a tangent about sneaking from her quarters, but he merely stared down at her, silent.</p><p>She could still feel him, she mused, rubbing at her wrist.</p> <p>He glanced down, paled. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed, but only for a second. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing, spying on us?\u201d The gold in his eyes no longer blazed. They\u2019d frosted over. \u201cYou should be in bed\u2014I mean, you should be lying down, recovering.\u201d</p><p>He was so close, finally within reach. Every thread of her annoyance faded. She quivered with excitement. \u201cI wasn\u2019t spying. I was eavesdropping.\u201d Was her voice as breathless to him as it was to her?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference?\u201d he asked, arching a brow.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be, since I was doing one and not the other.\u201d She raised her chin, and the tips of their noses brushed.</p><p>Flickers of the blaze returned, melting some of the ice. He jerked backward, ensuring there would be no more contact. But he didn\u2019t stalk away, leaving her alone. He massaged his left hand up and down his right arm.</p><p>Was he glowing through the gloves? She couldn\u2019t quite tell.</p><p>\u201cYour arms,\u201d she said.</p><p>His scowl returned. \u201cI\u2019m wearing glow-in-the-dark lotion. So what?\u201d</p><p>He was glowing, then. He was also a liar. Glow-in-the-dark lotion possessed a very distinct odor\u2014an odor that did not cling to him. Also, if your goal was to glow in the dark, why cover up when you succeeded?</p><p>Ponder it later. The answer didn\u2019t matter, anyway. He was Hector, beautiful, strong, intense Hector, and she was finally alone with him. No telling how long he would\u2014or wouldn\u2019t\u2014stick around.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of damage did Kitten do to you?\u201d he suddenly demanded.</p><p>Was he simply curious, or did he actually care? \u201cWell, I think I\u2019m bleeding internally and I\u2019ll be lucky to live through the night, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>Horror bathed his features. \u201cYou\u2019re going to a medic. Now. Don\u2019t you dare think about protesting, either.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, she dodged before he could clasp on to her. Or swoop her up, whichever he\u2019d been planning. \u201cNo. I\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d His show of concern delighted her. Meant he cared, as she\u2019d hoped. Even if the caring was only for a subordinate. \u201cShe hit me a few times, but it\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t experienced before.\u201d</p><p>He stood there, a muscle ticking in his jaw. \u201cBefore.\u201d A menacing growl. \u201cWho hit you before?\u201d</p><p>What would he do if she told him? Hurt the offenders in turn? God, she liked that idea. Liked the thought of him rampaging in her defense. Ava was the only one who\u2019d ever had her back. \u201cI\u2019ve been in more fights than I can remember, so I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you any names.\u201d</p><p>A pause as he absorbed her claim, relaxed.</p><p>\u201cUnless I\u2019m in front of my computer, and open my People To One Day Destroy file,\u201d she added.</p><p>He shook his head in exasperation. \u201cSo. How did you do it?\u201d</p><p>Confused now, she merely blinked up at him. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSneak in the maid. You didn\u2019t use the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cHow do you know? I totally could have.\u201d</p><p>He snapped his teeth at her. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>She should lie. If he turned her in ...</p><p>He won\u2019t turn you in.</p><p>How do you know? You heard him with Dallas\u2014she\u2019s still here, he said. He\u2019s had it out for you since the beginning and wants you gone.</p><p>He\u2019ll recognize my skill. He\u2019ll realize I\u2019m an asset.</p><p>Great, now she was talking to herself. \u201cI overheard Dallas on the phone with you,\u201d she admitted, watching his expression. There was no flash of surprise or pride. No flash of anything. \u201cYou guys were talking about how an Arcadian had popped into several different hospital rooms, snagged a few ladies, and popped out with no one the wiser.\u201d</p><p>The ticking increased in speed. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not disappointed. \u201cI have an Arcadian on my payroll and made a call.\u201d</p><p>Still he didn\u2019t react\u2014but he did step closer to her. His night-wild scent enveloped her, seeping into her pores, forcing all of her thoughts on him\u2014on getting even closer to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tattle on me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>There were several beats of hesitation before he said, \u201cNo,\u201d the admission seeming to astonish him.</p><p>Relief cascaded through her. She wouldn\u2019t ask why. He might change his mind, the contrary brute. \u201cSo ... any luck on your case?\u201d</p><p>An abrupt shake of his head. He opened his mouth, and she suspected\u2014hoped\u2014he meant to tell her more about it, maybe even ask her opinion or thoughts, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she asked, putting them on the right track. \u201cYou were supposed to come back at the first of the month.\u201d Not that she\u2019d asked around or anything.</p><p>\u201cI was taking care of a few things.\u201d His eyelids narrowed to tiny slits. \u201cAnd the few things aren\u2019t any of your business, so don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>His lack of answer sent her mind into a tailspin. Had he been holed up with some skank he considered his intellectual equal? Working on that case and injured? Sick? \u201cDo you want to know what I\u2019ve been doing?\u201d A husky note had entered her voice.</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cI know what you\u2019ve been doing. Causing trouble.\u201d</p><p>Not. Disappointed. The men in her life never took her seriously, so why should Hector be any different? Even though he saw a bit deeper than everyone else. \u201cWe\u2019ve interacted so little, and yet you already know me so well. I\u2019m impressed. Really.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t take the bait. \u201cTell me something, Noelle.\u201d So seductively uttered, as if he were already in bed and crooking his finger at her. The change in him was breathtaking.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she managed without trembling. Much. \u201cWhat did you mean that day? When you said I was Ava\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d She waved a dismissive hand through the air. \u201cAva called dibs.\u201d</p><p>His brow did that arching thing again. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort and sweet answer is, she gets to have sex with you and I don\u2019t.\u201d Was that a ... pout in her voice? God, it was.</p><p>Breath hissed between Hector\u2019s teeth, all hint of seduction gone. \u201cI won\u2019t be having sex with either of you.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Such certainty on his part. That annoyed her so much, she forced herself to airily say, \u201cWell, of course you won\u2019t be having sex with me. I just told you, I don\u2019t have dibs on you. I have dibs on someone else.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Heavy, oppressive silence.</p><p>\u201cWho do you have dibs on?\u201d he asked quietly. Savagely.</p><p>Jealously? \u201cThe very gorgeous Dallas. I just hope he doesn\u2019t mind sharing me. I have an assembly line of men waiting for their turn with me.\u201d</p><p>One step, two, Hector closed the rest of the distance between them, in her face once more. \u201cHave you slept with him?\u201d Still he used that quiet tone. Quiet, yet somehow lethal, cutting. \u201cIs that who you were waiting for at the cabin?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t afraid of Hector, but she found herself backing away, anyway, until the cold brick-climbing wall stopped her. He was just so big, so masculine, unlike any man she\u2019d ever met. She wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to handle him. And he hadn\u2019t responded to her lie about the assembly line.</p><p>He braced his hands beside her temples, effectively caging her in. God, she loved when he did that. Warm breath trekked down her cheeks, scented with mint. The lamps were a good distance away, yet she could see him perfectly, his face bathed in golds and whites.</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d he snapped. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you knew what I\u2019d been up to. Therefore, you should know the answers to your questions already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play. Talk.\u201d</p><p>He was jealous. The knowledge filled her with such joy, the truth instantly spilled out of her. \u201cNo to both. I was waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Another round of silence, this one overflowing with promise. And yet his anger never faded.</p><p>\u201cLet me give you a tip,\u201d he said in that cutting tone. \u201cSleep with your instructors, and lose the respect of your peers.\u201d</p><p>She ran her tongue over her lips, her own sense of anger growing. \u201cWhat makes you think I care about respect? I\u2019m so dumb I wouldn\u2019t know the difference, anyway. Right?\u201d Oops. Some of her bitterness had escaped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dumb. You might be the smartest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Shocking. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou continually convince people to believe what you want them to believe. That isn\u2019t accidental.\u201d</p><p>He so deserved a reward. She decided to press, to see how far he\u2019d go with her. \u201cWhat about one agent dating another agent, huh? Like, say, you and me. Is that acceptable?\u201d</p><p>There. The reason she was here. She wanted to know where they stood, if the desire was mutual. He\u2019d been jealous, yes, but you couldn\u2019t base a relationship on jealousy alone.</p><p>Now you\u2019re thinking about doing the relationship thing with him?</p><p>He glared down at her with an emotion she couldn\u2019t read. Something hot, though ... not anger, not any longer. \u201cYou\u2019re not an agent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d Truth. She would continue to work hard, to push herself, and one day she would carry a badge. Save lives.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re an agent you can date whoever the hell you want,\u201d he said with a potent mix of hope and loathing. \u201cAnyone except me. I don\u2019t date women, Noelle. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Her breaths came fast and shallow, yet every single one brushed her pebbled nipples against his chest. The friction speared lance after lance of pleasure through her. Hot, tingling, all-consuming.</p><p>\u201cMen, then?\u201d No, please, no.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t date, period.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cThen ...\u201d She chewed on her bottom lip, pondering the dilemma he\u2019d just created, but no answers were forthcoming. \u201cWhat?\u201d she managed to get out, unsure how to phrase her next question.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do when I need to get off?\u201d he asked, even as he rubbed the hard, thick length of his erection between her legs, just as he\u2019d done the last time they were in this position.</p> <p>Was he doing that on purpose, urging her need for him higher, simply to leave her? Or, like her, was he acting on instinct?</p><p>Having trouble filling her lungs with oxygen, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cI used to pay for it. Does that shock your privileged sensibilities? Offend you? And stop nibbling on your mouth.\u201d He leaned down and sank his own teeth into the sensitive tissue. Not enough to sting, just enough to stake a claim.</p><p>Oh, God. He was a biter. She really wished she hadn\u2019t learned that fact. No doubt she\u2019d start fantasizing about those teeth claiming all of her.</p><p>Claiming ...</p> <p>Have to ... touch him ...</p><p>\u201cNo response?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She flattened her hands on his chest. His pectorals jumped up in response, flexing.</p><p>\u201cNoelle.\u201d A snarl.</p><p>What had he asked? Oh, yeah. The prostitutes. \u201cIt confuses me.\u201d His intensity probably scared a lot of women away, but it would draw some, too. There was no reason for him to pay for what he wanted. \u201cYou kissed me, and I liked it. You shouldn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Wait. He\u2019d said used to, hadn\u2019t he? What did he do now?</p> <p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI won\u2019t explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me if you liked kissing me?\u201d</p><p>Such a tortured expression. \u201cYes. No. Damn it, it doesn\u2019t matter. We can\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>Oh, really? \u201cChallenge accepted,\u201d she purred, already rising on her tiptoes.</p><p>He opened his mouth, maybe to tell her off, maybe to welcome her inside, but either way, she rolled her tongue over his lips.</p><p>An agonized moan left him, and just like before the kiss immediately spun out of control. Their teeth banged together, and they both angled for deeper, better contact. He tasted sweet, decadent, and she thought she might already be addicted.</p><p>She gave him everything she had, feeding him kiss after kiss, conforming her body to his, kneading the muscles at his back. Pleasure rocketed through her, and she arced against him again and again, tossing fuel on her own need because, with every forward glide, her clitoris brushed against him.</p><p>This was far better than the first kiss, and that had been spectacular. But she knew more about him now. Wanted more of him. Had dreamed of this, night after night.</p> <p>\u201cHector, touch me. Please.\u201d Knead her breasts, pinch her nipples. Give her more.</p><p>The rock wall behind her shook ... shook ...</p><p>\u201cHector. Please.\u201d She slid a hand down his chest, to the waist of his pants. So long and thick, his erection strained past the material, the tip already weeping for her. Mine, she thought. This is mine.</p><p>He wrenched his mouth away with a roar. \u201cDamn it!\u201d Still he ground that erection against her, and she closed her fingers around it as best she could. \u201cI can\u2019t do this!\u201d</p><p>His skin was like a lick of flame, blasting heat at her. Little beads of sweat broke out on her brow. She loved it, wanted more. Wanted it to be hotter. \u201cLift my shirt. Suck my nipples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit! Are you listening to me?\u201d he snarled. \u201cDo I have your full attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Yes, yes, yes. She could feel his heartbeat, pounding against her other palm.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The rubbing ceased abruptly, and she moaned. \u201cI told you before not to seek me out. Now I\u2019m telling you not to even speak to me. Not to even look at me. And I\u2019ll extend you the same courtesy. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted from you, Noelle.\u201d With that, he straightened, severing all contact, and walked away.</p><p>Walked away from her. Again.</p><p>He never glanced back.</p><p>What. The. Hell? She\u2019d suspected, but ...</p><p>Noelle rested against the wall, her knees weak, her blood on fire, with fury ... with passion ... She\u2019d wanted his mouth on hers, taking, giving, ravaging. She\u2019d wanted to relearn his taste\u2014and not just from his mouth\u2014wanted to hear him groan as the pressure became too much for him, too.</p><p>And all along, he\u2019d merely thought to prove a point. To humiliate her.</p><p>To force her into avoiding him.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d get his wish, she thought. She wouldn\u2019t spend another moment craving him. She wouldn\u2019t even allow herself to think about him. They were done. Before they\u2019d ever really started, they were done.</p><p>His loss.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, determined, Noelle returned her weight to her feet. She spun, would have marched back to the bunk, but a thick waft of smoke, scented with burned syn-cotton and spiced with molten metal, danced in front of her face. She gazed around, searching for the source.</p><p>Not her this time, but the wall. Two perfect handprints had been burned into the brick. Big hands, a man\u2019s hands. Exactly where Hector had placed his.</p><p>Gulping, confused, she reached out and ran a finger over the indented stone. She hissed at the moment of contact. Though she didn\u2019t feel the sting, she knew the metal was hot enough to blister her skin.</p><p>So, the marks were fresh. But ... how was that possible?</p><p>Her gaze returned to Hector. Or rather, to where he\u2019d once been. He was gone now, no sign of him in the darkness. Was he ... could he be an otherworlder capable of flaming objects with only a touch? Even though he appeared one hundred percent human?</p><p>Maybe. Many races possessed special abilities that their human counterparts did not. She\u2019d always embraced those differences, and she would have embraced Hector\u2019s, if he\u2019d given her a chance.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t. By his own admission, he\u2019d rather pay for sex from a nameless stranger than have Noelle for free. So, he would get his wish, she thought again. She would leave him alone.</p><p>A stray, torturous thought formed. One day they were going to have to work together, and she\u2019d have to act cool, collected, as if this night had never transpired. And really, that should be easy to do. Ultimately, the men in her life always found something wrong with her. So, in that regard, Hector was no different than the rest. He\u2019d simply been more upfront about it than the others.</p><p>I\u2019m fine. This is fine. She\u2019d suspected they wouldn\u2019t suit, and he\u2019d proven her right. No big deal. Except her chin wobbled and her eyes blurred with tears. Shit. She never cried! Why here? Why now? Why over him?</p><p>The answer didn\u2019t matter. Like every time before, she stuffed her hurt deep inside and pasted an unconcerned smile on her face. She strolled back to the bunkhouse, to Ava, the only other constant in her life.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>A year later</p><p>HURRY, HURRY, DAMN IT, hurry.</p><p>Though Noelle had only been an AIR agent for a few weeks, she already had one successful case under her belt. A case Ava was now engaged to marry, but whatever. Noelle couldn\u2019t think about that.</p><p>Her second case was currently sprinting down the wealthy side of Main.</p><p>Midday, on a nice, cool Saturday, the sidewalks were crowded with clueless shoppers and the otherworlder servants carrying their bags. The same species of otherworlders she\u2019d spotted so long ago on the other side of town, only these were dressed in crisp, clean uniforms.</p><p>The shops were high end and pristine, the cafes sparkling with activity, their outside tables shielded by large umbrellas. This was the atmosphere she was used to. The perp busted through the crowds and toppled the tables, leaving chaos in his wake, forcing Noelle to push and shove her way after him, all while leaping over shattered glass, dropped purses, and slippery food.</p><p>Hector Dean was working this case, too. Not with her. Never that. In fact, they hadn\u2019t really spoken to each other since that night at camp. But Mia Snow, the new official head of AIR, had informed all agents to be on the alert for a white minivan with tinted windows.</p><p>Apparently, an anonymous tip had promised the van would be carrying three otherworlder females who\u2019d been abducted from their homes. As that same anonymous tipster had never before been wrong, Mia had taken him\u2014her?\u2014seriously.</p><p>And ten minutes ago, Noelle had spotted the van and called in the plates.</p><p>Hector had barked over the radio: This is mine, Tremain. Stay back, but maintain a visual. I\u2019m on my way.</p><p>As if.</p><p>Yeah, he was invested in the case. He\u2019d worked it a year ago, but the whole thing had been iced when no new clues surfaced, the recovered girls vanished without a trace, and no other kidnappings occurred. (That they\u2019d known of.) The tips had stopped, too. Then, two days ago that minivan info had come in, as if there\u2019d never been a lag, and well, now things were back on.</p><p>Have to beat him, have to beat him, damn it, have to beat him.</p><p>The driver had realized she was on his tail, threw on the brakes, and abandoned the vehicle right there in the center of the road. There\u2019d been no time to check on the women, so Noelle had sprinted after him while at the same time radioing in about the new development.</p><p>Agents were probably at the van now. Hector wouldn\u2019t have stopped there, though. A bruiser at heart, he would have followed the commotion and come after the driver. Like her.</p><p>Have to beat him!</p><p>Perp was a scrawny human in his mid thirties\u2014and thereby unstunnable. He was also out of shape. Was now slowing, taking the corners with less vigor. No longer throwing stuff or people in her way. I\u2019ll have him yet.</p><p>Sweat poured down her back. Her muscles burned, the first sensation she\u2019d had in months, and the bones in her legs vibrated every time she pounded a foot into the concrete. She was off the clock and not dressed for a street chase. Black leather halter, black leather pants, five-inch heel boots.</p><p>Plus, she had a killer hangover.</p><p>Ava\u2019s bachelorette party had roared all night long, and had still been going strong this morning.</p><p>Noelle increased her speed. Drew in closer ... closer still ... The guy rounded another corner. She stayed tight on his ass, practically stomping on his shadow. Another busy sidewalk came into view. He slammed into a pedestrian and flew backward\u2014</p><p>Straight into Noelle.</p><p>Just the break she\u2019d needed. She caught him with a humph and, using the momentum to her advantage, swung him around and slammed him into the side of a building. Smack.</p><p>Reacting on instinct, he threw back an elbow and knocked the air from her lungs. For a moment, she saw stars.</p><p>He tried to sprint off, but she kicked out a leg and tripped him. He toppled on his stomach.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d he spat, twisting around, going for a blade in an ankle sheath.</p><p>\u201cI invented that move.\u201d Noelle kicked the weapon out of his hand, then kicked him in the face\u2014knocking out a few of his teeth. He spat blood and attempted to crawl back, away from her.</p><p>With a muttered, \u201cOh, no you don\u2019t,\u201d she dove for him. Just before she hit, she reached for her own switchblade. Contact. She kneed him in the balls, making him howl with the intensity of the pain. Then she flicked her wrist, snapped the blade in place, and pressed the tip into his throat. Not enough to damage him, but enough to sting.</p><p>His struggles increased as panic hit his bloodstream, causing the knife to slide in deeper. Jolting upright, he head-butted her in the chin and she once again saw stars.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she spat, and tasted blood.</p><p>\u201cLet ... me ... go,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Yeah, sure. I\u2019ll get right on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I kill you?\u201d She hated being without her pyregun, but as she\u2019d known she would be drinking last night, she\u2019d left her piece at home.</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d he said on an explosion of breath, but he ultimately settled down.</p><p>\u201cGood boy. First, a little warning. You run and you\u2019ll suffer. Second, I\u2019m going to ask you a few questions and you\u2019re going to answer them. Or you\u2019ll suffer. Basically, just get used to the idea of suffering. First up. Where were you taking those women?\u201d Interrogations usually happened back at headquarters, but she wanted to throw the information at Hector and pretend it had been a breeze to acquire.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d he repeated, panting. \u201cYou can\u2019t hurt me. I\u2019m human. I know my rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Noelle slammed the palm of her free hand into the end of his nose, snapping the cartilage on impact.</p><p>Blood spurted from his nostrils. His scream nearly busted her eardrums.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try again,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cWhere were you taking those women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot scared of you.\u201d His trembling body belied the assertion. \u201cNothing you do will be worse than what he\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Should I be offended? \u201cWho\u2019s he, and what will he do?\u201d Realizing he\u2019d said too much, the perp really panicked.</p><p>People formed a circle around them, gasping and contemplating what to do.</p><p>\u201c\u2014officers are on their way,\u201d she heard someone say.</p><p>\u201cDude! Out of my way, you\u2019re blocking my camera\u2019s view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a cop,\u201d she growled. \u201cEveryone stay back, and shut the hell up.\u201d</p><p>They continued talking to each other.</p><p>\u201cCops are getting sexier by the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfficer Hotness can ticket me anytime.\u201d</p><p>Okay, maybe she wouldn\u2019t chastise them for the chatter. They were highly observant.</p><p>As if he\u2019d been frightened past his limits, her suspect\u2019s head lolled to the side, his body going lax. Noelle wasn\u2019t buying. She recalled Hector\u2019s lesson all too well. Always make sure unconsciousness had been achieved by delivering another blow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her guy could have easily gotten control of his panic, faked a pass-out, meaning to leap up and attack her the moment she let him go.</p><p>Rather than hit him, she jiggled his broken nose. No reaction. Still not taking any chances, she moved the blade tip to his belly, where his shirt rose above his pants, revealing a strip of flesh. \u201cI\u2019ve got a knife at your gut, so I\u2019d be careful if I were you.\u201d</p><p>Warning issued, she balanced on her knees, intending to pat him down. Of course, that\u2019s when he erupted into motion. Yep. A fake-out. His determination must be great, to have ignored that jiggle.</p> <p>The action caused her blade to slice his stomach, but he didn\u2019t seem to notice or care. Bleeding, he slid out from under her, jumped to his feet, and ran. Just ran.</p><p>\u201cI am not chasing you!\u201d Noelle jumped up, too, and tossed the knife. It whizzed through the air. The length embedded in the back of his calf, where he had just placed most of his weight, and he went down like a brick in water, screaming in agony. Heart thundering in her chest, she stomped over to him.</p><p>He\u2019d cracked his cheek on the concrete when he landed, and a pool of crimson seeped from his mouth. He writhed, twisting, trying to reach the blade to remove it. Maybe she\u2019d never gotten the mercy gene because she stepped on the hilt, digging the weapon even deeper.</p><p>Another howl rent the air.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to run, asshole,\u201d she said. And damn it, she didn\u2019t have a pair of cuffs on her.</p> <p>She bent down anyway and grabbed his wrists, pinning them behind his back and straddling his waist, so that her weight pinned him down. Tears leaked down his cheeks, joining the blood.</p><p>Gasps echoed behind her. Shuffling footsteps. The pounding of boots.</p><p>Noelle turned her head\u2014and spotted Hector shoving his way through the crowd and stalking toward her. Big and muscled and so sexy her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Puffing up, she said, \u201cBagged him,\u201d sounding so damn smug, he\u2019d probably fume.</p><p>Dressed in his usual black shirt and slacks, he looked menacing and without a hint of warmth. As always. His tattoos looked different, though. The circles more jagged, the lines thicker. He\u2019d grown his hair out, too. A Caesar cut, the messy, darkened strands adding an air of savagery to him.</p><p>Sweat glistened on his brow, dripped from his temples. He wiped the droplets away with the back of his hand, his golden gaze sweeping over her. His pupils expanded. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d heard his voice these past few months, of course. When he\u2019d spoken to Dallas or Mia, or anyone else in AIR. But right now, with that gravelly timbre directed at her, she felt her body respond. Her blood heated, and her nipples tightened underneath the leather top.</p><p>Oh, hell, no. Not going there again. Lesson learned. No need for a repeat.</p><p>\u201cBetter than,\u201d she replied, and prayed she sounded breezy. She relayed everything the guy had said, and for a moment, Hector actually looked impressed. With her\u2014or the info-hold-out perp? \u201cGot a pair of cuffs on you?\u201d</p><p>One of his brows shot into his hairline. \u201cYou chased him without a pair of cuffs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Mine are still hanging from my bedposts.\u201d</p><p>No reaction. \u201cWhat did you plan to do with him when you tackled him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh. Exactly what I did. Hurt him until he caved.\u201d Frowning, Hector reached behind him. Next he extended a pair of cuffs in her direction. She managed to take them without allowing her fingertips to brush over his skin.</p><p>In two point two seconds, she had the human bound, the laserbands wound around his wrists, lit up to a pretty gold\u2014though not as pretty as Hector\u2019s eyes\u2014and bonded to his skin.</p> <p>And yet, still the guy writhed.</p><p>She said, \u201cYou pull at them too much, and you\u2019ll lose your hands. Or so I\u2019ve heard. I\u2019m more than willing to use you as a test subject and find out for real.\u201d</p><p>That got his attention. At long last, he stopped fighting.</p><p>Did you see that, Hector? I won this round. Noelle climbed off the perp, but kept a boot pressed into his shoulder blades to remind him that she was there. \u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d she asked Hector.</p><p>\u201cRight there.\u201d He hitched his thumb to the street beside them, and sure enough, she spotted a standard AIR sedan.</p><p>\u201cNo Jag today?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem surprised that she knew he\u2019d traded in the Porsche, even though they\u2019d never run into each other outside of work. \u201cNo. I\u2019m on the clock.\u201d His gaze swept over her a second time. Another flare of his pupils. \u201cBut you\u2019re not. Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was out on a date with my newest lover, the insatiable Don Carlos.\u201d She wanted to believe Hector liked what he saw, but ... She\u2019d gone that road with him before, hadn\u2019t she? A girl never forgot a burn like that.</p><p>\u201cDon Carlos? Where\u2019d you meet him? A romance novel?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed. How had he known she was lying? \u201cDo me a favor and carry the perp to your car,\u201d she said, ignoring his question.</p><p>A moment passed in silence, then he shook his head. \u201cBastard clipped your chin. He doesn\u2019t deserve a carry.\u201d As he spoke, he withdrew a pair of familiar gloves and slipped them on.</p><p>Her gaze immediately slid to his arms, and yep, for the third time in their acquaintance, she spotted that slight, barely noticeable azure glow. A glow that remained even after he donned the gloves, just above the top edge. She only detected it because she knew to look. And okay, because she was staring. Most people would probably think his tattoos were colored that way. She wasn\u2019t most people, and besides that, she had a picture of him seared into her memory. She had forgotten nothing about the way he was made, and always spotted any changes in his appearance.</p><p>She wished she knew what the glow meant, though. She\u2019d even done some online research\u2014because she\u2019d been bored and not for any other reason\u2014but had learned nothing.</p><p>Without looking at her, Hector closed the remaining distance, reached down, and hauled the guy to his feet, holding him by the scruff of his neck when his knees collapsed. Then he practically dragged the guy to the sedan, stuffing him in the backseat with as little finesse as possible, even letting his head bang into the top of the door.</p><p>Three other agents finally appeared on the scene, and they did crowd control, moving everyone back and out of the way, blocking off the pool of blood.</p><p>Hector faced her, still unwilling to peer into her eyes. \u201cYou want a ride to the station?\u201d</p><p>No enthusiasm in his voice. Only dread.</p><p>Why do you dislike me so much? What did I ever do to you? Besides throw herself at him, time and time again.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she forced herself to reply. \u201cI\u2019ve got people to do, and things to see. Besides, I abandoned my car a few blocks away. Behind our boy\u2019s.\u201d Our. Wrong word. Her heart skipped another beat.</p><p>An abrupt nod as his nostrils flared in\u2014anger? \u201cMia and Dallas were there a few minutes ago, so ...\u201d</p><p>So get lost, he was saying. Bastard. \u201cNext time put some hustle in your step and you might actually be first on the scene. Or maybe you couldn\u2019t help yourself. Old age is a bitch, I hear.\u201d Grinning as if she\u2019d never been happier, she turned to walk away. One step, two. Three. Every inch farther away caused an ache to intensify in her chest.</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d Hector growled, stopping her. \u201cYou caught him, so you get to question him. I\u2019ll text you after medical\u2019s cleaned and bandaged him.\u201d</p><p>Without looking back, she responded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll try to keep my blades to myself during the next round of my interrogation.\u201d She waited a moment, but he said nothing else, so she kicked back into motion. Totally not disappointed.</p><p>Soon as she rounded a corner and Hector couldn\u2019t see her, she lost her fake grin and hailed a cab, hauling ass back to the other scene. Mia and Dallas were still there, talking to witnesses. The pale, shaky girl Dallas was chatting up spotted Noelle and pointed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>Electric blues found her, and Dallas smiled in greeting. And yet that smile lacked any hint of amusement. Like Hector, he\u2019d been careful to keep his distance from her these past few months. As if there were something toxic about her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of the good ones,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d the girl responded, clearly frustrated that she hadn\u2019t helped nail a suspect. And clearly hating on Noelle. Her eyes narrowed before she returned her attention to Dallas and placed a proprietary hand on his bicep. \u201cAs I was saying ...\u201d</p><p>There was her car, no worse for wear. She\u2019d had the foresight to shut down the engine before diving outside, and someone would have had to know how to bypass her very extensive security system to start it up again.</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d a familiar voice called. \u201cWait up.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, and Mia Snow jogged to her side.</p><p>\u201cHow are the females?\u201d Noelle asked her.</p><p>That petite face scrunched in anger. \u201cMy source said we\u2019d find three, but we only found two. Not sure where the third is, but the other two were drugged, so they didn\u2019t know anything. They might have been pegged with a tracker, too. We\u2019re looking into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither of them speak English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one. We sent both to New Chicago General with two agents in each ambulance and lasercuffs on the girls so they couldn\u2019t be teleported away. There will be two agents at their bedsides the entire time. Until they\u2019re well enough and we can move them into AIR HQ, where no one will be able to teleport them elsewhere, no matter what. This time, I will find out what the hell is going on with these abductions.\u201d</p><p>So much determination in such a tiny body, which reminded Noelle of Ava. A pang in her chest, razing that hollow place. \u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything I can do.\u201d</p><p>Mia nodded, dark bob swinging around her chin. \u201cHector texted me, told me what happened. You did well.\u201d</p><p>Pride unfurled wings and fluttered inside her. How pathetic was she, that she wanted to twirl a strand of hair around her finger and ask what, exactly, Hector had said? \u201cI always do.\u201d</p><p>A snort. \u201cWhere are you headed now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome to shower.\u201d And most likely to replay every change in Hector\u2019s expression, his every word, his every glance.</p><p>Yep. It was official. She was pathetic.</p><p>Mia gifted Noelle with one of her rare smiles. \u201cSee you at the wedding tomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Tomorrow her life changed forever. And not in a good way.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>AVA WAS LEAVING HER!</p><p>\u201cGraduate Camp Hellhole\u2014check,\u201d Noelle muttered. \u201cHired by AIR\u2014check. Complete my first mission successfully\u2014check. Kick Hector\u2019s ass at a foot race\u2014check. Lose my best friend\u2014check, check, fucking check, and scribble and crumble the notepad and slam it into the trash.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the bathroom stall, clutching her two favorite men: a bottle of Jack and a bottle of Jim. She was trying not to cry. She hadn\u2019t felt this vulnerable since that terrible night at camp, when Hector had given her a figurative finger. Had thought she\u2019d prepared herself for this life-changing moment last night, staying up to watch holo-vids of her and Ava.</p><p>Well, she wasn\u2019t prepared and never would be! Noelle banged the back of her head against the wall over and over. For once, she wished she could feel physical pain. A terrible, gut-wrenching pain. Anything to distract her.</p><p>Ava was about to marry her vampire boyfriend McKell, and Noelle would forever be alone.</p><p>At least I look good, she thought with a bitter laugh. As the maid of honor, Noelle wore a gorgeous red sheath dress that conformed to her curves. Spaghetti straps, a scooped neck that revealed ample cleavage. The material flowed to the floor, flirting with her amazing diamond-encrusted red stilettos.</p><p>Her hair was curled and now waved down her back, dancing with her every motion. Her makeup, perfectly applied. Her skin, glowing with health and vitality\u2014or was that sickly dread?</p><p>Ava, her best friend, her only true friend, had fallen in love. Deep, abiding love.</p><p>Today Ava would abandon Noelle to tie herself to a vampire warrior.</p><p>Tonight Ava would give up the daylight and become a vampire herself.</p><p>Trying not to fall into a spiral of panic, failing, Noelle drained Jack and tossed the bottle in the toilet. Still trying not to fall into a spiral of panic, failing, she drained Jim and tossed the bottle in the toilet. She had to get herself under control. She couldn\u2019t let Ava see her like this.</p><p>This was Ava\u2019s day. Noelle would not ruin it. No matter how much she wished Ava would change her mind, tell McKell where he could stick his fangs, and sprint from the chapel. That way, things could return to normal. Just the two of them, kicking ass and forgetting names.</p><p>Alone, alone, alone. The word echoed through her mind, tormenting her.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t like she could call her mom and sob out all her problems. Madam Tremain disapproved of her more than ever.</p><p>Isn\u2019t it enough that Jaxon has tarnished the Tremain name? the blasted woman had sneered during their last phone conversation. Why couldn\u2019t Noelle act like a lady for once and do something with her life? Like charity work for one of their many causes?</p><p>No support from her brothers, either. She was more than welcome to silently sit on the board of Carter\u2019s firm. More than welcome to fly to Third World countries with Anthony and help the poor. More than welcome to seclude herself in Tyler\u2019s Italian villa while he partied.</p><p>As long as she stopped embarrassing everyone with her \u201cwildness\u201d and her \u201cwayward mouth\u201d and her \u201cblue-collar job.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it time she grew up?</p><p>A tear threatened to burn a path down her cheek, but she managed to blink it back. Oh, Ava. I miss you already. There would be no more ditching work to go shopping and have their nails done. No more midnight pillow fights. No more five-hour-long phone conversations about their hopes and dreams. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fine. They hadn\u2019t done any of those things before, but now they wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity. Once Ava turned into a vampire, she would be unable to venture out during daylight hours without burning like deep-battered shrimp.</p><p>So Ava would only be doing night patrol for AIR. And yeah, okay, Noelle could change her schedule, too, and would, if AIR would let her, and they had better fucking let her, or she\u2019d quit, even though she\u2019d come to love the job. Even still, McKell would be the one with access to all of Ava\u2019s free time.</p><p>Time that had once belonged to Noelle.</p> <p>Guilt was like acid in her veins, a disease without a cure. Ava was so happy. So damn happy, and here Noelle was, pouting about it. But too many things were changing all at once, and Noelle simply couldn\u2019t process everything.</p><p>A hard knock rattled the stall\u2019s door, and she yelped, straightened. The alcohol must have finally kicked in because the motion left her head swimming and her thoughts fogging. Good, that was good. The foggier she was, the happier she\u2019d appear.</p><p>\u201cHey, Noelle, you in there?\u201d Ava asked, concerned.</p><p>She could play this. No one would ever know the depths of her despair. Not even Ava. \u201cYes, rudeness, I am. Can\u2019t a girl do her business in private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this girl, and not today. Finish and come tell me how gorgeous I look.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, she could do that. Noelle leaned over and waved her hand over the motion sensor. The toilet flushed, Jack and Jim rattling together and refusing to go down. No matter. She squared her shoulders, pasted on her megawatt grin, and opened the door.</p><p>And there was Ava, her sweet Ava. \u201cMy God. You look gorgeous.\u201d Truth. Breath was actually catching in Noelle\u2019s throat, clogging the passage.</p><p>Ava beamed, love radiating from her, giving her burnished tan a melted cookies-and-cream sheen. Her curls framed her delicate face and tumbled past her shoulders. She wore a gown of golden silk, in a goddess cut, the material flowing all the way to six-inch hooker heels. The best part, though? A necklace made from human finger bones hung around her neck. A gift from McKell.</p><p>\u201cI want to marry you,\u201d Noelle teased.</p><p>Ava was supposed to laugh, maybe twirl and demand more compliments. Instead, Ava cupped Noelle\u2019s cheeks, and peered deep into her eyes. \u201cI love you. And really, McKell\u2019s just my starter husband. You know I despise commitment. I\u2019ll probably leave him before the honeymoon is over.\u201d</p><p>Hardly. Those two were forever, and all three of them knew it.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do this if I thought I would lose you,\u201d Ava said, voice softening further. \u201cYou and me, we\u2019ll be together for eternity. Probably not in heaven, but we\u2019ll still be together. You know that, right? Tell me you know that.\u201d</p><p>Noelle held onto her smile. Barely. \u201cI know that.\u201d And she did. But things would change, and more than they already had. One day Ava and McKell would have a kid. Or six. The way they went at it, they might have a baker\u2019s dozen. Ava would have a new family, one that did not include Noelle.</p><p>Aunts, even kick-ass aunts like Noelle would be, were merely an extension, rather than part of the whole. That\u2019s just the way things worked.</p><p>Don\u2019t you dare cry!</p><p>Where was her happily ever after? Where was her stand-by-you man? She hadn\u2019t been on a single date since leaving AIR training camp. There\u2019d been offers, of course, but she\u2019d been unable to feign interest.</p><p>Always she\u2019d thought, Where\u2019s Hector? What\u2019s he doing? and flaked.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she said, performing a twirl of her own. A mistake. The dizziness magnified. When she stopped, two Avas watched her with more of that concern. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>Several moments ticked by in silence before determination overwhelmed the concern, and Ava smiled. Knowing the little witch as she did, Noelle knew her friend had just decided time would prove her right.</p> <p>\u201cYou look amazing, and if one person, just one, says you look prettier than me, there\u2019s going to be a massacre after the vows are said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if that someone is me? Because I\u2019m just gonna say it. I do look prettier than you.\u201d She sighed, revealing only a hint of her wariness. \u201cMaybe at your next wedding you\u2019ll manage to outshine me.\u201d</p><p>This time Ava laughed. \u201cShut up. I can get away with talking that way, but when McKell hears anyone else voice any kind of doubt, he lectures about what\u2019s his, his, his.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, there was no one more possessive than McKell.</p><p>Noelle experienced a slight pang of envy that none of the guys she\u2019d dated throughout the years had ever tried to stake a claim on her. Corban might have demanded more of her time, but in the end, when she\u2019d left him, he hadn\u2019t come after her, hadn\u2019t fought for her, and she\u2019d realized he\u2019d never really loved her either.</p><p>How could he? She\u2019d never been the woman he\u2019d wanted.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing in here?\u201d Noelle asked. \u201cYour ceremony starts\u2014\u201d she glanced at the clock on the wall \u201c\u2014five minutes ago. Oh, shit. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been helping Ava with her hair, had felt the panic burning up her throat, and had fled into this bathroom under the guise of having to pee so badly she was ready to wet herself. Half an hour had passed.</p><p>The area was small, with two stalls, one sink, and no sitting area to check your makeup and chat. At least the walls were painted a pretty silver, none of the stone crumbling.</p><p>Ava should have sheer opulence, utter luxury, but she had flat-out refused to allow Noelle to pay for anything. Not that that had stopped Noelle from sneaking in a few improvements. Like, say, paying for the entire building to be refurbished in secret.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get married without my maid of honor at my side, so do me a favor and hustle that sweet ass of yours into the chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Noelle jumped into motion, and Ava smacked the ass in question.</p><p>Out of the bathroom, through a narrow hallway with scarlet carpeting and glowing wall sconces she went. When she reached the main foyer, with faux wood tables pressed into the corners, and a chandelier dripping with glittering crystals, she paused.</p><p>There were the arching double doors that led to McKell. Though her stomach twisted with nausea, she held out her arm, waiting. Ava linked their fingers. Her skin was cold, a little clammy.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d Noelle asked. Beyond the entrance, she could hear the gentle strum of a harp, the delicate notes of a piano.</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Ava admitted.</p><p>Some of the nausea eased. \u201cI can get you out of here in five seconds flat and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ava laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not having doubts, you dope. I love McKell, and he loves me, and I honestly can\u2019t live without him. I just hope I don\u2019t trip and fall. Or, do I have food in my teeth? I knew I shouldn\u2019t have eaten those strawberries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you trip and fall, I\u2019ll point and laugh, but I\u2019ll also make sure your panties aren\u2019t showing. If you\u2019re wearing any, that is. But that\u2019s the worst that can happen, so your worry is kinda pointless. As for your teeth, they\u2019re perfect. Just like you.\u201d</p><p>The tension drained from Ava\u2019s grip, her temperature warming. \u201cYou\u2019re such a sap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for today.\u201d I\u2019m a big girl. I will survive this. \u201cSo, are you ready to do this or what?\u201d</p><p>Deep breath in, hold, hold, finally released. \u201cYes. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. Here we go.\u201d With that, Noelle kicked open the doors and escorted her best friend down the aisle.</p><p>A gasp swept over the crowd, and like a wave, they stood, one row after the other. McKell paced on the dais, his tux ripped at the collar, his tie sagging, as if he\u2019d pulled them both a few times too many. He possessed hair the most luscious shade of indigo, pale skin and eyes of the purest violet.</p><p>He was a beautiful man, strong and muscled, toweringly tall, and he was utterly undone by the sight of his bride. He stilled, his gaze locking on Ava, his anxious expression changing to one of awe and reverence. He didn\u2019t care that everyone saw his reaction, either. He was too proud of his woman.</p><p>The little pang returned to Noelle\u2019s chest. McKell hadn\u2019t wanted a best man, or any groomsmen for that matter\u2014none deserved the honor of standing next to him, he\u2019d said\u2014but all of AIR occupied the first few rows.</p><p>Noelle nodded to Mia, who looked gorgeous in blue. Beside Mia was her husband, Kyrin, a delicious Arcadian who reminded Noelle of Corban in appearance only. Same white hair, same lavender eyes, and skin the color of a winter storm. But Kyrin thought his woman was perfect and wouldn\u2019t change anything about her.</p><p>A movement at the corner of her eye had her glance shifting. Dallas had just reached up to tug on his earlobe. He realized she was watching him and smiled, but there was no amusement in the baring of those teeth. He\u2019d been doing that a lot lately, like at yesterday\u2019s crime scene. Trying to appear nice and polite, but failing miserably. She had no idea why.</p><p>Her gaze slid away\u2014and landed on Hector, who stood beside him.</p><p>Hector. He watched her intently, warily, as if she were a bomb about to detonate.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t texted her yesterday, so she figured she\u2019d done more damage to the perp than she\u2019d thought.</p><p>Why, why, why, hadn\u2019t time and Hector\u2019s shitty attitude lessened his appeal, dissolved her fascination, and stopped the draw?</p><p>She really hadn\u2019t learned her lesson, had she?</p><p>He wore a dark pinstriped suit, and her heart fluttered at the sight of him. His eyes were shadowed, almost haunted\u2014and they were glued to her face. As always, he was frowning.</p><p>So badly she wanted to catch a glimpse of his smile. A flash of those dimples, a peek at those straight, white teeth. Teeth he\u2019d once used to bite her bottom lip. Some nights she imagined she still felt the sharp, luscious sting.</p><p>His head tilted to the side, his interest gliding from one of her features to another. Her brow, her eyes, her mouth, her chin. Either he was drinking her in, as she had just done to him, or he was fitting puzzle pieces together.</p><p>Could he see the pain behind her happy mask? No, surely not. He didn\u2019t know her well enough. Yeah, he saw deeper than any other man, but. ... Only Ava saw the real Noelle, and Ava had no idea about the depths of her pain.</p><p>\u201cWho gives this woman away?\u201d a male voice suddenly boomed out.</p><p>Ava squeezed Noelle\u2019s hand, and she snapped to attention. Shit! They\u2019d reached the end of the walkway, and she\u2019d been twisted like Dallas\u2019s favorite sexual pretzel position, peering over her shoulder for God knew how long, staring at Hector.</p><p>Now there was silence. Such expectant silence.</p><p>\u201cUh ... what now?\u201d Her voice echoed from the steepled ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWho gives this woman away?\u201d the pastor repeated with the utmost patience, as if this kind of thing happened all the time.</p><p>Deep down, she wanted to shout \u201cNot me! Never me! And no one else does, either!\u201d but she didn\u2019t. Bile chugged up her throat again, threatening to spill over, but she managed to say, \u201cMe. I do. In a minute,\u201d she added. \u201cI haven\u2019t yet given my wedding present to the groom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Ava began.</p><p>\u201cCome here, you sexy morsel.\u201d She pulled an unresisting, now laughing Ava in for a passionate kiss. That\u2019s how she and Ava had snared McKell, once a target of AIR but now the agency\u2019s biggest asset, after all. They\u2019d distracted him with a girl-on-girl kiss before stunning him, and he\u2019d loved every moment of it. In fact, he\u2019d been pushing for another GOG PDA session for quite some time.</p><p>A few members of the crowd gasped. A few whooped. McKell reacted just as before, going taut with excitement. This was the only time he\u2019d share \u201chis woman,\u201d and only with Noelle. Anyone else tried this, and heads would roll.</p><p>When she felt they\u2019d pushed the line of scandal to its limit, Noelle straightened and peered down at her bestie, whose smile was brighter than the sun. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Trembling, she placed Ava\u2019s hand in McKell\u2019s.</p><p>McKell\u2019s grin was just as bright.</p><p>\u201cShall we begin?\u201d the pastor asked, some of his patience gone.</p><p>This is it, Noelle thought, sad for herself and blissfully happy for Ava all at once. The beginning of the end.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH Noelle. Big time. Hector had known it the moment he\u2019d spotted her.</p><p>He remembered her as she\u2019d been yesterday, so damn hot his mouth had watered for a taste of her. Black leather practically painted on her breasts, her flat stomach the tantalizing color of honey and cream, her legs painted with the same leather. He was certain no woman had ever rocked an outfit better. And yet there\u2019d been a gleam of sadness in her eyes as she\u2019d subdued her captive.</p><p>Still his cock had reacted instantly. So had his arms, proving she was as dangerous to his peace of mind now as she\u2019d been before. Even when she\u2019d insulted the shit out of him, calling him a slow old man, and lied through her teeth, he hadn\u2019t cooled down.</p><p>I\u2019m not old, damn it. I\u2019m in my prime.</p><p>Today\u2019s red dress\u2014holy hell. A fantasy come to dazzling life, revving him up. But once again he noticed the sadness in her eyes. Only now it was amplified.</p><p>He sat in his pew and pretended to care about the ceremony while examining her. She was smiling prettily, but her cheeks were pale. She was smiling contentedly, but a line of tension creased her brow. She was smiling, but she was breaking his goddamn heart.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how\u2014he would have placed good odds on his not having a heart\u2014and he didn\u2019t know why. All he knew was that he preferred her wild and silly and yeah, too smart for her own good.</p><p>After interacting with her yesterday, he\u2019d craved more. Just a glance, something, anything, so he had finally broken down and watched her interrogation tape from camp. Not the one that had so enthralled Dallas, but the last one. The one Phoenix had overseen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hector had flinched every time Phoenix had slammed her fist into Noelle\u2019s midsection. But Noelle hadn\u2019t. Noelle had taken it and thrown out taunts.</p><p>Phoenix, who should have known better, had reacted, all emotion and no thought, allowing Noelle to lead her around on a leash. Hector had already realized Noelle was smart and tough, but that even he hadn\u2019t foreseen.</p><p>A clip played through his mind.</p> <p>Phoenix: You really think you\u2019re AIR material, huh? You think that pretty smile of yours is going to solve cases for you?</p><p>Noelle: Of course. Proof: when I walked into this room my smile solved the case of the mysteriously missing blond agent who only has half a brain.</p><p>Punch.</p><p>Phoenix: Do you like your brain slamming against your skull?</p><p>Noelle: More than anything.</p> <p>Punch.</p><p>Phoenix: Think your smile will be as beautiful if I pop your front teeth?</p><p>Noelle: Oh, Agent ... Blond Girl ... Person. The fact that you\u2019d find me so pretty even without my teeth is sweet, but you\u2019re not my type. I like my men with thinner mustaches.</p><p>Brutal punch.</p><p>Phoenix: How\u2019s my mustache looking now?</p><p>Noelle: Who cares? Caress me again. I liked it.</p> <p>Really brutal punch.</p><p>Hector had been so turned on by Noelle\u2019s attitude, his arms had glowed and he\u2019d had to take care of himself. Twice.</p><p>Damn it, pushing Noelle away had been the stupidest, most intelligent thing he\u2019d ever done.</p><p>After their second near miss that night at camp, he\u2019d told Mia to take him off instructor duty or he\u2019d quit AIR for good. Usually Mia didn\u2019t take ultimatums well, but in this, she\u2019d caved. Maybe because she\u2019d sensed his desperation.</p><p>Once he\u2019d arrived home, he\u2019d gotten himself under control. On his own. And he\u2019d remained mellowed out, except for the few times he\u2019d run into Noelle at HQ.</p><p>Other agents had flirted with her, and she had flirted back. But if she was dating anyone\u2014seriously or otherwise, not counting the imaginary Don Carlos\u2014he didn\u2019t know it. And he didn\u2019t like that he didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t like the thought of her with someone else, in any capacity, either. Especially not the imaginary Don Carlos! And he knew the bastard was imaginary. Noelle\u2019s eyes took on a pearlescent sheen every time she lied, and they\u2019d looked plucked straight from the sea when she had mentioned him.</p><p>Dallas used to flirt with her, but that had stopped a few weeks ago, after they\u2019d all run into each other at a bar after hours. As if the pair had seen each other naked, but had argued and parted ways.</p><p>The thought alone enraged Hector. He flattened his hands on his thighs before he did something stupid. Like ask in the form of punching. The answer didn\u2019t matter. Couldn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>Even as a teenager, with more hormones than brains, he\u2019d known he was better off keeping females at a distance, and he\u2019d succeeded. Until Kira. From the worst of the streets herself, she\u2019d wanted, needed, a protector. Someone to keep her safe, to scare away anyone who thought to rape her. Someone to make sure she had a place to stay. So she\u2019d charmed him and he\u2019d fallen.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to be careful with her. For a while, they\u2019d kept things nice and easy. A kiss good night, a kiss hello. Then they\u2019d graduated to a little heavy petting. His arms hadn\u2019t acted up too badly, and she\u2019d hinted that she wanted to take things further, so he\u2019d decided to go for it.</p><p>One night, as they made out, he\u2019d stripped her, then stripped himself. His first skin-to-skin contact, and oh, had he been excited. The heat had intensified, but he hadn\u2019t realized how much. Until he\u2019d reached up and cupped her breast. His arm had already atomized, so he\u2019d gone through her and hit the mattress springs. She had died instantly, her heart rendered useless.</p><p>Seeing her like that ... he\u2019d never been the same. What little hope he\u2019d carried for making a relationship work had gone up in flames with her. And to be honest, no one had ever tempted him to try again. Until Noelle. But ...</p><p>His fear was simply too great, too deeply rooted. The fact that he craved her far more intently than he\u2019d ever craved Kira only freaked him out more.</p><p>If he hurt her, burned her, he would never be able to forgive himself. Would never recover. That\u2019s why he\u2019d done everything in his power to make Noelle hate him. Avoiding her at the office, making snide comments when they ran into each other.</p><p>Well, mission accomplished, he thought now.</p><p>Yesterday, they\u2019d been all about the awkward polite. As if they\u2019d never kissed. Never pressed their bodies together, straining, rubbing, both of them ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cBe honest,\u201d Dallas whispered. \u201cAre you imagining that red dress on your bedroom floor?\u201d</p><p>He would not reply. Would not voice the words that would undermine his good intentions.</p><p>\u201cBecause I am,\u201d his friend admitted miserably.</p><p>He fucking would not reply. Not his agreement, and not a warning. What good would warning another man away do him? None, that\u2019s what. Hell, if anything, a warning would only make things worse for himself.</p><p>Dallas would expect him to act on his attraction. And if he didn\u2019t, well, he\u2019d open the door for Dallas to act on his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad, but I can\u2019t seem to help myself. I want her.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so the door was already open. \u201cWhy would I be mad?\u201d The words escaped loud, gravelly, and pissed as hell, drawing stares and a few hushes. Better question: how would he stop himself from ripping his friend\u2019s face off?</p><p>Noelle had called dibs on Dallas, which meant she was attracted to him. Wanted him in return. Would probably like being stripped by him, touched by him. Tasted by him.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been already.</p><p>He whispered fiercely, \u201cHave you two ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dallas answered, and he relaxed.</p><p>Dallas is your friend. Maybe Hector\u2019s only friend. Dallas knew about his arms. Hector had finally broken down and revealed all. While working a case together, Dallas had used a few unexplainable abilities of his own, moving faster than the eye could track, controlling people with his voice, shit like that.</p><p>Apparently Dallas was part otherworlder.</p><p>I wish there were an explanation for me. Though he\u2019d kept searching, he\u2019d found nothing. But he\u2019d wanted Dallas to know there were others out there, that he wasn\u2019t alone with his differences, and Hector had never regretted sharing. They\u2019d bonded over it, almost like brothers.</p><p>And you can\u2019t kill your brother, he reminded himself.</p><p>\u201cAnd you two haven\u2019t?\u201d Dallas asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d be okay if I ... ?\u201d</p><p>No! \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good,\u201d Dallas said in that quiet voice. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m gonna go for it, then. Tonight. As long as you don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s good,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBridesmaids can\u2019t help themselves, either. The romance, you know. Practically puts a bull\u2019s eye on their panties.\u201d</p><p>Another forceful breath, in and out, careful, measured, followed by another. Hector tried to release his growing tension with every exhalation. Suddenly his hands burned, itched, and both sensations spread up, up, all the way to his shoulders, until he knew the skin beneath his jacket was glowing.</p><p>This was very, very bad.</p><p>He jumped to his feet. The pastor stuttered to silence, and every head in the room turned his way, including Noelle\u2019s. He was careful to avoid her gaze as he stuffed his hands in his pockets, and shoved out of his row. Was that burning cloth he smelled? Despite the fact that he only ever wore fire-retardant clothing?</p><p>Without any kind of explanation, he stalked down the aisle and out of the chapel. Before he torched it and everyone in it to the ground.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>WHO KNEW A WEDDING reception attended by stone-cold killers would prove to be the party of the century?</p><p>Noelle hid in a corner in back of the spacious ballroom, swathed in shadows, trying to take everything in. The walls were painted to look as if they\u2019d been covered in pink lace. Glasses were clinking, conversations were raucous, and champagne and chocolate scented the air. Laughter abounded, as did the sucking sounds of a good kiss. A lot of people were getting down and dirty wherever they happened to be. A few down and dirtiers were even by the buffet table, rattling the dishes when gyrating hips met stone.</p><p>McKell had Ava on the dance floor, bumping and grinding and generally looking epileptic. So did everyone else on that floor, for that matter, moving to the hard, fast rock buzzing from strategically placed speakers. An elegant, twinkling teardrop chandelier winked over the seizers, highlighting their every blackmail-worthy nuance. She\u2019d already done a little covert videoing from her cell, and planned to torture the agents for the rest of their lives.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing over here all by your lonesome?\u201d a male voice suddenly asked.</p><p>A flick of her gaze, and she realized Dallas had sidled up beside her. She\u2019d have to pay better attention. Sensing a possible threat was necessary for her job, after all. Although Dallas didn\u2019t look threatening today. In his pristine suit, with his dark hair slicked back, his dark complexion flawless, and his electric eyes bright, he was handsome in a fallen angel kind of way, half innocence, half wicked temptation.</p><p>And he\u2019d said something to her, she recalled. \u201cI\u2019m two-fisting drinks with dignity,\u201d she replied, toasting him with both of her nearly empty glasses. Her earlier buzz had already worn off, and she was looking for another.</p><p>His lips twitched, even as his gaze swept down the length of her, heating with desire.</p><p>Desire? Surely not. Not after the distant way he\u2019d treated her lately.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d he said, \u201cI hate to break it to you, but you lost your dignity the moment you walked down that aisle. In my mind, I already had you stripped.\u201d</p><p>So seductively uttered, so charmingly delivered, she found herself grinning with genuine amusement for the first time that day. \u201cI do know how to rock a fantasy, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>The desire, or whatever it was, cranked up a notch, turning those vivid eyes into a kaleidoscope of differing shades of blue. \u201cPlease tell me that\u2019s not the only thing you rock.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle bubbled from her. \u201cTsk, tsk. I almost think you\u2019re flirting with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you almost think then I\u2019m not doing a good enough job.\u201d His voice dropped a few octaves, going husky, layered with a needy rasp. \u201cSo, let me clear things up. I am flirting with you. Is it working?\u201d</p><p>Her heart began to thud against her ribs. Not from arousal but from surprise and, well, quite frankly, unease. He was Hector\u2019s friend. So if he was flirting with her this heavily, he didn\u2019t think Hector would mind.</p><p>Hell, maybe Hector had even told him to go for it.</p><p>Her heart thudded harder, and she was disgusted with herself. Why did she care what Hector did, said? Or what he didn\u2019t do, didn\u2019t say?</p><p>She didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t let herself care.</p><p>\u201cNo response?\u201d Dallas asked silkily.</p><p>Oh, she had a response, all right. \u201cWhy now?\u201d She drained one of her glasses, then the other, and handed them both to him. \u201cFirst few months we knew each other, you treated me like a mischievous kid sister. Lately, I\u2019ve been a diseased gutter rat.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one finger, the universal sign for one sec, and trotted off to set the glasses on a passing waiter\u2019s tray. When he returned, his hands were empty. Probably a wise thing, not plying her with more liquor. She\u2019d start babbling about her kisses with Hector, her dreams about Hector.</p><p>Hector, Hector, Hector. Where the hell was he? Why had he stormed out of the chapel?</p><p>Dallas jumped back into the conversation as if he couldn\u2019t wait another moment to engage her. \u201cLet\u2019s just say there were complications, and leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>Intriguing. \u201cLittle known fact about me. I can\u2019t leave anything at that. So, staying with the topic. What were the complications and how do they no longer apply?\u201d</p><p>One strong shoulder lifted in a deceptively casual shrug. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you what they are, but I will tell you that they\u2019re diminishing in importance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Damn, but her curiosity was piqued in a huge way.</p><p>He released a wary sigh. \u201cI\u2019m certain I was wrong about one aspect of the\u2014I was wrong, that\u2019s all. And don\u2019t you dare ask about what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what were you wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh.\u201d Grinning like the imp he was, he shook his head, dark hair falling over his brow. \u201cI\u2019m not telling, and you can\u2019t make me. Not dressed, at least.\u201d</p><p>Clearly, he was an expert at flirting, and yet still she didn\u2019t soften toward him. \u201cI took a class on interrogation, you know. There are ways to make a guy talk that involve a handful of thumb tacks and, drum roll, being fully clothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you dance with me instead?\u201d Not giving her time to protest, he twined their fingers and ushered her to the dance floor, where he stopped and drew her into the hard line of his body.</p><p>He must have cued the band, because the music instantly turned soft and slow. For a long while, they swayed, silent, each lost in thought. Hers: this was almost nice. He smelled good, like soap and the after-sweetness of a rainstorm. Heat radiated off him, enveloping her.</p><p>And yet, still no attraction.</p><p>Sighing, she flattened her hands on his chest and pushed. Just a little, just to achieve a few inches of distance. He pulled her back in, closer ... closer ... until their chests were flush.</p><p>\u201cThere, isn\u2019t this better?\u201d he asked in that seductive tone, his breath fanning her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDepends on what you\u2019re comparing it to. Better than a root canal? Yes. Better than a pedicure? No.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOuch. Harsh, Elle. Harsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonest.\u201d Elle. All the men in her life eventually called her Elle. A soft nickname for the soft girl they assumed her to be. Or rather, wanted her to be. Little wonder she longed to punch every one of them in the face when they used it.</p><p>Not that she\u2019d ever admit the truth, however. Expressing your displeasure with something was tantamount to begging to be tortured by it.</p> <p>Dallas\u2019s hand slid down her back and landed on the curve of her ass. His fingers splayed, covering as much ground as possible. \u201cBesides the pedicure, what do you consider better than this?\u201d</p><p>Where to begin? \u201cLong walks on the beach, even if it\u2019s freezing outside. Good\u2014or cheap\u2014wine in front of a crackling hearth. Chicken noodle soup. But it has to be made from real chickens, and not that syn-shit, or I\u2019ll have to strike it from the list. A lukewarm bubble bath, a mediocre book, a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. God,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cYou are hell on a guy\u2019s ego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours needing some stroking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething of mine needs stroking,\u201d he muttered, \u201cbut it\u2019s not my ego.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I can feel your something,\u201d she replied dryly. \u201cCan you move that thing already? It\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnoyingly big, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine big.\u201d</p><p>Another warm, rich chuckle left him. \u201cFine. Give me a minute.\u201d He pulled back long enough to reach into his pants pocket. Her mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d She stopped. He was readjusting his erection in front of everyone!</p><p>Only he withdrew a pyre-gun, the crystal dull rather than sparking, indicating the safety was on, and stuffed the weapon in the waist of his slacks, behind him. Then he drew her back into his embrace.</p> <p>\u201cNow. Is that better?\u201d</p><p>The shock had yet to leave her. \u201cNow who\u2019s hell on an ego?\u201d she grumbled, her cheeks just a bit hot.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s help each other out and revisit the whole stroking issue, hmm?\u201d</p><p>Incorrigible sex fiend. And she wished, really and truly wished, she desired him. Even in the minutest amount. He was fun, funny, and probably a damn good lover.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Dallas,\u201d she said, straightening to gauge his reaction. \u201cI have this friend ...\u201d</p><p>The light in his eyes expanded, only to be crushed a moment later as his pupils expanded, too, the black pulsing. Just as Hector\u2019s had done each time before they\u2019d kissed, and then again yesterday when he\u2019d eyed her black leather. \u201cIs she a mild-mannered AIR agent by day and an insatiable nymphomaniac by night?\u201d</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t Noelle attracted to him again? Because this shit was amusing. \u201cHer name is Hope Van Der Pyke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd does she\u2014wait.\u201d The pupils retreated to normal size, and he lost his glaze of excitement and desire. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s very pretty. Very wealthy. Kinda snobby, though. Anyway, you\u2019re exactly her type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to set me up?\u201d he said, nearly choking on the words. \u201cWith someone else? While I\u2019m laying my best moves on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are your best? Wait, never mind. Don\u2019t answer that. I\u2019d just have to feel sorry for you. So, to answer your question, yeah. I am.\u201d His incredulity was adorable, and she couldn\u2019t help but twist the knife deeper. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I saw ... we\u2019re supposed to ...\u201d</p><p>One of her brows rose. This was more interesting by the moment. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to what?\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then a heated, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>O-kay. \u201cDo you mean that as a verb or a curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d He released her to run a hand down his face, once, twice, three times. With the first, he revealed confusion. With the second, anger, and with the third self-deprecation tinged with humor.</p><p>His arms returned to her waist, but there was no drawing her in. Not this time.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me what just happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Another grumble.</p><p>\u201cDo it anyway before I show you the blades I\u2019m carrying.\u201d</p><p>At least his humor intensified, his lips quirking at the corners. \u201cViolent women really crank my chain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnnd, not what I wanted to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d he said, fingers stroking up and down her spine. In reflex, she thought, rather than in a bid to arouse her. \u201cThis is just so new to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Being let down gently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that. You\u2019ll find this difficult to believe, I know, but I\u2019m turned down flat all the time. I\u2019m not sure why, either.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. She just couldn\u2019t help herself. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a real mind puzzler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. Is that sarcasm I detect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dallas,\u201d she said, reaching up to pat his cheek. \u201cSomehow you have turned the blackest day of my life into one that\u2019s merely dark and gloomy. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cBlackest day? Why? You look happy to me.\u201d</p><p>Damn. She shouldn\u2019t have let that slip out. \u201cWhat are you talking about? I am happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just said ... I just ... Never mind. You\u2019ll only tax my poor, abused brain further. So, here\u2019s an admission for you, and an answer to one of your earlier questions. I saw this day ... saw us ... and we ended up in ... Oh, never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d The song ended, and his arms fell to his side, severing contact. \u201cUh, I\u2019m needed elsewhere, so I\u2019ll see you around, Noelle.\u201d Off Dallas raced, never once glancing back.</p><p>\u201cWell, okay, then,\u201d Noelle muttered. Her gaze landed on Ava, who was peering up at McKell with utter adoration.</p><p>I want that, she thought.</p><p>Suddenly done with the party scene, and craving a minute alone, she took off in the opposite direction, heading for the back door. No one tried to stop her, and for that she was immensely grateful.</p><p>Outside, the parking lot was spread out around her. The sun was hidden behind dark, gray clouds, the air damp and cool. Closing her eyes, she leaned against the wall. She\u2019d lived through the worst of the day. She could deal with anything else.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>DAMN IT,\u201d HECTOR CURSED when he spied Noelle. He should have left the wedding and stayed gone.</p><p>He\u2019d left the wedding all right, but he hadn\u2019t made it more than a mile from the chapel. Dallas\u2019s I\u2019m going for it had continued to ring inside his head, taunting him, infuriating him. Then he\u2019d thought about Noelle\u2019s red dress on his friend\u2019s bedroom floor, resting beside a suit other than his. He\u2019d pictured two naked bodies straining together on a mattress, had heard pleasure-filled moans.</p><p>He\u2019d nearly destroyed the interior of his Jag as he reprogrammed the chapel\u2019s address.</p><p>Once there, he hadn\u2019t gotten out, hadn\u2019t gone inside. He\u2019d remained in the car, in the parking lot, the tint on his windows darkened to the highest setting so that no one could see inside. He\u2019d glared at the building, and yes, he\u2019d taken care of himself while imagining Noelle. With him.</p><p>Finally he had calmed down, the burning in his arms subsiding, the glow completely diminished.</p><p>The only thing that burned him now was humiliation and shame. That he\u2019d done such a thing in a public place ... his stomach rolled. At least he was out of the danger zone. Small comfort, considering he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d stay out.</p><p>One of the agents inside the building was emailing pictures of the wedding reception to everyone in her address book, and not two minutes ago Hector had opened one of Dallas on the dance floor, his strong arms wrapped around Noelle. Noelle had been grinning up at him.</p><p>Only reason Hector hadn\u2019t stormed inside to rip them apart was that Noelle had still radiated so much sadness. Seeing her, his chest had ached unbearably.</p><p>He\u2019d told himself to go home, that Dallas would work his magic and Noelle would fall under his spell. That the two of them would drive to the nearest hotel\u2014they wouldn\u2019t be able to wait until they reached Dallas\u2019s apartment, because God knows, if the situation had been reversed, Hector wouldn\u2019t have been able to wait\u2014and sleep together.</p><p>And once Noelle had slept with his friend, Hector would stop thinking about her. Stop dreaming of her. Stop craving her. Surely. He needed to stop. She was a thorn in his side, a torment to his soul, a sickness in need of a cure.</p><p>He could never be what she needed, never touch her the way she\u2019d want. More than that, he wasn\u2019t good enough for her. Another man would make her happier. Far, far happier.</p><p>Yet he opened his car door, got out, and walked toward her anyway.</p><p>Noelle heard the footsteps and opened her eyes, prepared to paste on a smile and wave whoever had intruded on her personal space inside. Then she spotted Hector, and straightened. A frown pulled at the corners of her lips. His presence was a surprise.</p><p>His big body was gorgeous, as always, but humming with tension.</p><p>His night-wild scent reached her before he did, waking every cell she possessed. Next she felt the heat of his body, electrifying her. And then he was there, just a few feet away. Within touching distance, the width of his shoulders practically engulfing her.</p><p>Bad Noelle. No touching. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, not yet daring to met his gaze. She was too afraid of what she\u2019d see. Irritation, maybe. Or maybe even nothing at all, as if she were meaningless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cleaning my gun. What does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d</p><p>O-kay. The snotty attitude wasn\u2019t a surprise. \u201cIt looks like you\u2019re annoying me.\u201d</p><p>Still he didn\u2019t attempt an explanation. He just shrugged and said, \u201cWell, you look beautiful.\u201d Grudgingly offered, as if the compliment had been yanked from his throat.</p><p>And yet that was the first time he\u2019d ever said anything nice to her and she became wet. Just like that.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she muttered, fighting the arousal.</p><p>\u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><p>Finally, she looked up.</p><p>Instantly her body reacted as if she\u2019d just run a ten-mile marathon uphill. Her breath shallowed so much she was panting, her lungs refusing to fill. Her temperature went from melting to one hundred percent liquefied, her knees weakening, trembling.</p><p>Intense golden eyes narrowed down at her, long lashes nearly fused. Hard lips stretched tight over those perfect, bite-so-good teeth, the scowl most likely meant to intimidate her into silence. His chin angled stubbornly, and there was no sign of his dimple.</p><p>His tie was gone, his suit wrinkled and disheveled. His gloves, missing.</p><p>God, she\u2019d never seen a more beautiful sight. And with those few inches of hair ... wow. Beautiful wasn\u2019t a good enough description.</p><p>\u201cYou were sad a minute ago. And earlier.\u201d His head tilted to the side. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>A cold shower went through her veins. He didn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t. At least he hasn\u2019t noticed your reaction to him. Her beading nipples, her quivering belly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re clearly upset about something.\u201d</p><p>He did. He knew. Butb how did he know? \u201cI\u2019m not upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>How dare he call her on her lie! \u201cThis is my best friend\u2019s most special day and I have never, ever been happier\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014more miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014than I am right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you ever fooled me,\u201d he said, all kinds of self-disgust in his tone. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar.\u201d</p><p>How. Did. He. Know? Dallas hadn\u2019t. Ava had suspected, but even she hadn\u2019t realized the depths of Noelle\u2019s misery. Noelle was a master at hiding her emotions. She had to be. Otherwise her mother and brothers would have realized how they chipped at her self-esteem and launched a full-scale attack.</p><p>\u201cWhat ... what makes you think I\u2019m lying to you?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cLike I\u2019m really going to blurt out your tell.\u201d</p><p>She gaped up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t have a tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need to believe to comfort yourself, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Sweetheart. He\u2019d just called her sweetheart. He didn\u2019t mean it, though. Didn\u2019t see her that way, the way other guys saw her. But the funny thing? She liked that he\u2019d said it. She\u2019d known him a year, and he\u2019d never once called anyone else by a nickname or endearment, even sarcastically. Still. Letting him get away with his attitude so wasn\u2019t happening. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d she gritted.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly, suddenly more serious than she\u2019d ever seen him. \u201cI don\u2019t, do I?\u201d</p><p>To Hector\u2019s astonishment, he was as desperate to learn about Noelle\u2019s life and her emotions as he was to have her underneath him. The latter was too dangerous, so he\u2019d just have to settle for the first. \u201cDo you feel like you\u2019re losing Ava or something? Is that why you\u2019re sad?\u201d</p><p>A punch below the belt, maybe, but that was just his style. No mercy, and no prisoners. A motto he lived by. A motto life on the streets had drilled into his head.</p><p>Noelle crossed her arms over her chest, the fabric of her gown going taut, the pressure shoving her breasts together and creating the most delectable cleavage, but also hiding those beaded nipples he longed to tongue.</p><p>She snapped, \u201cI\u2019ve told you time and time again that I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you\u2019ve told me twice. You\u2019re not fine, and sad girls aren\u2019t as much fun to play with, so start talking.\u201d</p><p>A lick of fire in her eyes, pursed lips. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re doing? Playing with me? But Hector, darling, aren\u2019t sad girls what you\u2019re used to?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ouch. She hit below the belt, too, but then, he\u2019d jumped right into that one, hadn\u2019t he.</p><p>He never should have told her about the hookers. None of his friends knew the truth. Not even Dallas. Hell, all of AIR probably thought he was gay. But he\u2019d told Noelle in an effort to elicit her disgust. And lookie. You got it. Shocker.</p><p>\u201cYou better answer this, genius, or I\u2019ll kick your ass!\u201d he heard Ava say before he could think up a reply. He frowned, panned the area. Ava was nowhere to be seen. \u201cYou better answer this, genius, or I\u2019ll kick your ass!\u201d</p> <p>With her left hand, Noelle held up her index finger in a bid for a second of privacy. With her right, she pulled a very slim cell from between her breasts.</p><p>Damn, that was sexy.</p><p>\u201cI only have the ringer on for one person,\u201d she said at the same time Ava threw out another, \u201cYou better answer this, genius, or I\u2019ll kick your ass!\u201d Noelle added, \u201cAva stole my phone and programmed this as her personal ring tone. I liked it so much, I decided to use it for every call.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, though he was strangely charmed by her admission. She truly adored her friend. Every aspect of her friend, at that, even the bizarrely cruel streak both women seemed to possess. He was also strangely envious. He might tease the guys at work, but he wasn\u2019t comfortable enough with any of them to fool around. Again, not even Dallas.</p><p>\u201cThis better be important,\u201d she said into the receiver. Jealousy flickered in his chest as her previous words sank in. She\u2019d kept her ringer on for someone. A special someone obviously. His hands fisted.</p> <p>\u201cI told you no.\u201d Her gaze skidded away from him, allowing him to study her face more intently. Such a red, red mouth ... He licked his lips, suddenly imagining ripping the phone away from her and giving her a hard, punishing kiss.</p><p>She smelled of something rich and heady, a perfume from the wilds of a jungle, as well as the stars in the heavens. His cells heated, his skin pulled tight against his bones. Nothing dangerous, not yet, allowing him to remain where he was.</p><p>And therein lay the danger.</p><p>He wanted her so badly, he might try and fool himself into thinking all was well so that he could have her. If he hurt Noelle, scarred her, marred her in any way, he truly would hate himself forever.</p><p>You won\u2019t hurt her. You\u2019ve kissed her twice. She\u2019ll be fine.</p><p>He found himself reaching out to sift his fingers through her hair. Thankfully he caught himself in time. He scowled. Temptation was a dark, dark bastard.</p> <p>Mind out of gutter. She needed support, not a pawing.</p><p>He attempted to listen to her whispered conversation, but couldn\u2019t make out more than \u201cForget it\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m thinking about becoming a lesbian.\u201d That couldn\u2019t be right, though.</p><p>Bit by bit, those silver eyes frosted over. \u201cMother.\u201d She gave up trying to keep things quiet. \u201cThis is Ava\u2019s wedding. I told you I\u2019d talk to you tomorrow. And for the record, I will tell you no about the set-up then, too.\u201d With that, she hung up, stored the phone, and glared at Hector as if everything were his fault.</p><p>Her mother. The jealousy vanished\u2014even though the woman had been trying to set her up. Noelle had said no, at least, and would say no tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cI can relate,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother was ...\u201d A horrendous bitch. Trash. Uttertly sadistic. \u201cPersistent when she wanted something from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d The sharpest edge of her anger smoothed and just as she had the first day he\u2019d met her, she suddenly appeared cool, aloof, and untouchable. Now, however, he knew she was none of those things.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d And I\u2019m the one who killed her.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes locked in a long battle for domination. A battle he didn\u2019t give his all. He was too busy enjoying her. She was a visual feast, and he couldn\u2019t help but gorge. Such lush femininity, ripe for the taking.</p><p>Careful.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care what I\u2019m feeling, anyway?\u201d she grumbled, caving first.</p><p>Score one for him. Finally. He always felt out of sorts with her, as if he had never\u2014could never\u2014come out ahead. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d He said the words, an automatic response, but for once, he didn\u2019t mean them.</p><p>Her back straightened and her shoulders squared, a predator uncoiling for attack. \u201cThat was a very rude thing to say.\u201d</p><p>He was getting to her, cutting at her, and she needed that. Needed to drain the poison inside of her, whatever kind of poison it was. \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for it.\u201d Unlike Dallas, Hector couldn\u2019t make her laugh. At least, he didn\u2019t think he could. He\u2019d never tried to cheer a female up through humor. But he could help her, and maybe ... maybe one day, when she looked back on this night, she\u2019d remember him fondly.</p><p>Or not. \u201cOh, you darling man,\u201d she said with her sugar sweetness. \u201cYour lips say no but your eyes say I\u2019ve never been sorrier for anything in my life.\u201d</p><p>Will not laugh. \u201cDid you really think you and Ava would grow old together?\u201d he asked, tossing enough disgust in his voice to piss anyone off. \u201cThat neither one of you would ever fall in love? Get married?\u201d</p><p>Smoldering silence followed his words. She remained still\u2014more predator than before. A wounded panther, ready to strike.</p><p>Whatever she dished, he could take. He wanted to take. To do something besides walk away from her\u2014or watch her walk away from him. \u201cMcKell won her pretty quickly, didn\u2019t he? I mean, it only took him a few months to rip her from your side. That must mean she was ready to leave you, was probably tired of you.\u201d</p><p>Annnd here came the explosion. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t tired of me, you bastard! She will never be tired of me, just like I will never be tired of her. I\u2019m her best friend, and she loves me. She loves me.\u201d</p><p>Success, he thought, and oh, was it bittersweet. He did not like seeing Noelle so torn up. Did that stop him from continuing to push? No. \u201cAnd you love her? Enough to miss her already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Okay? Yes. Is that what you want to hear? I miss her so damn badly.\u201d Tears pooled in her eyes, a bone-deep hurt reflected there. \u201cI love that she\u2019s happy, but I hate that I\u2019m losing her. She\u2019s mine, not McKell\u2019s. Mine. I found her first, and I should get to ... she should ...\u201d Her shoulders slumped.</p><p>\u201cShe should appreciate you better? Because you built her up, right? You made her what she is?\u201d</p><p>The fire returned, swiftly burning through the hurt. \u201cHell, no! She built me up.\u201d Noelle thumped her chest, just over her heart. \u201cShe made me better. I was on a very dark path, and she became my light. I love her more than ... more than ...\u201d She raised her chin. \u201cI love her more than anything. I would bend over backward to help her bend someone else over backward! And I will always be there for her\u2014if I\u2019ve got nowhere better to be.\u201d</p><p>Maybe the hurt hadn\u2019t burned away. Maybe Hector had absorbed every last drop, because damn, his chest was doing that aching thing again. She was throwing out facts\u2014her love\u2014but mixing it with her pain\u2014claiming she had somewhere better to be. A heartbreaking, amazing mix.</p><p>The tears sprang forth anew and cascaded down her cheeks in a white-hot stream. She wiped them away with a shaky hand, then stared down with shock at the wetness on her skin. \u201cI\u2019m crying. Shit! I\u2019m crying. I never cry.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and the sight of those tears nearly undid him the rest of the way. Can\u2019t tug her close. Can\u2019t hold her. \u201cWhy are you beating yourself up about your feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she sniffed, retreating into her stubborn shell.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me rip the answer out of you. Why?\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right.\u201d Another grumble. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, but only to save time. I can\u2019t wait to get away from you.\u201d</p><p>Hardly. If that were the case, she would have already left. Would have busted his lip with her fist and bolted.</p><p>The knowledge that she wanted to be here, with him ... He remembered how she\u2019d once begged so sweetly for him to kiss her. Just a taste, she\u2019d said, luring him straight into temptation, unable to resist.</p><p>Can\u2019t fucking hold her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beating myself up because I should only be happy for her,\u201d she whispered, each word dripping with shame. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be sad for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, being both\u2014happy for her and sad for you\u2014doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. It makes you human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d How miserable she still sounded.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather be a cold son of a bitch like me?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. The first thing he noticed, her lashes were long, spiky, and wet. The second, she was a damn pretty crier. No swollen eyes or red, splotchy skin for this one. Just vulnerability and angel-soft loveliness.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d she asked in that soft tone. \u201cYou hate me.\u201d</p><p>Hate her? When he hungered for her more than he\u2019d ever hungered for another? But then, he done everything in his power to shove her out of his life, hadn\u2019t he? And he needed to keep shoving.</p><p>If he stopped, gave in to her, the consequences would be everlasting.</p><p>Yeah. He should leave. Now. Should walk away. He was good at that, as he\u2019d already proven. Instead, he gave her the words that might damn them both. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Noelle. I fucking crave you.\u201d</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>SHOCK BOMBARDED NOELLE AS Hector\u2019s confession rang in her ears. He was breathing heavily, some dark emotion practically bursting through his skin. So badly she wanted to believe him.</p><p>Crave her? Please.</p><p>She studied his tortured expression. Pushing for answers here, now, wasn\u2019t wise anyway you sliced it. Public place, possible public humiliation. Did that stop her? Hell, no. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014what you said can\u2019t be true. You wouldn\u2019t ignore me\u2014\u201d</p><p>A moment passed as he visibly fought for control. He rubbed a hand down his face, the skin on his palm normal, the ink dark. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Too bad. \u201cYou brought it up. Also, you made me talk about my problems when I didn\u2019t want to.\u201d And he\u2019d helped her in a way she could hardly believe. She felt lighter, more guilt leaving her by the second. \u201cA year ago, you stomped all over me, told me never to speak to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I told you,\u201d he snapped, interrupting again. \u201cI don\u2019t need a retelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you with me right now? Helping me with my problems? Telling me that you ...\u201d\u2014her voice lowered to a barely audible rasp\u2014\u201ccrave me.\u201d Why? The intensity of her need to know the answer staggered her.</p><p>How many nights had she pleasured herself while thinking of him? Now he was suggesting, in a roundabout way of course, that he had done the same. That amazed her, delighted her. Truth or lie, though?</p><p>He looked over his shoulder, at his car, as if he longed to bolt.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d Scowling, she cupped his cheeks and forced his attention back to her. \u201cYou\u2019re staying right here and confessing.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed to tiny slits, a glare that usually preceded multiple dark curses. Instead, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d Harsh, broken. \u201cIf we talk about something else.\u201d</p><p>Damn him. He meant it. Restrictions grated, big time. In fact, she would have left him in the dust on principle alone, but then he did the strangest thing. He leaned into her touch, rubbing his stubbled jaw against her palm, practically purring like a contented kitten.</p><p>Maybe he did crave her. But ... but ...</p><p>When he realized what he was doing, he went military straight and paled. He shook out of her hold, his eyes glazing fearfully, guiltily, then angrily.</p><p>He had liked the connection, but hadn\u2019t wanted to like it. Why? The question of the day, it seemed. Hell, the question of the year.</p><p>Whatever the answer, though, he wasn\u2019t yet ready to spill all and really would bail if she remained in pursuit. That fear ... So she would drop the craving thing. For now. But, oh, God, hope swirled through her, a bright light in an endlessly dark void.</p><p>\u201cSo, uh, how have you been?\u201d she asked, hands tingling where they\u2019d touched him.</p><p>Now he arched a brow, losing his worry, guilt, and anger in a single instant. Relief descended. \u201cSince yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, smartass. Since ...\u201d Our last kiss. \u201cAll year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame.\u201d</p><p>Awkward silence.</p><p>O-kay. Was this how it would always be between them? Either snipping and snapping at each other, on the road to kissing, or struggling for something to say? A fraction of the hope withered.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s our suspect, the van\u2019s driver?\u201d she asked, deciding to talk shop rather than separating and ending on a bad note. There had to be more to their relationship than the snipping and silence. Right? He craved her.</p><p>A little color drained from his cheeks, and he rocked back on his heels. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell you until after the wedding, but ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! How? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the hospital. Cyanide pill. Had one in a hidden pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone do that?\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s strong shoulders lifted in a shrug. \u201cFear. You remember what he said, about the mysterious he hurting him worse than we ever could.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, but still. \u201cYou get any useful info out of him first?\u201d</p><p>An abrupt shake of his head, the color returning to his cheeks and deepening with ... shame? Probably. Hector took his job more seriously than most, and took his cases personally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noelle flattened her hand above his heart. The organ rushed up to meet her, the beat quickening. Hector didn\u2019t chastise her. \u201cWasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d she said, offering comfort. \u201cAnd two women were saved from God knows what.\u201d</p><p>He gulped. His gaze met hers, the gold glittering, no hint of the frost he so often directed at her.</p><p>In an instant, her thought path changed course. From business straight back to the pleasure. She had her hand on him. He was close enough to kiss. And he craved her.</p> <p>Thought you weren\u2019t going to do this with him ever again?</p><p>Things change. He craved her. She would never get tired of those words.</p><p>You\u2019ve forgotten the humiliation of his rejection, then?</p><p>Argh! She despised these conversations with herself.</p><p>Dallas had amused her, but Hector... Hector tantalized her. He didn\u2019t tease, he snarled. He didn\u2019t flirt, he informed. His intensity was a constant brush against her nerve endings, awakening long forgotten parts of her body, working her into a frenzy.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, the last two times we stood like this, we ... did things,\u201d she reminded him huskily.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he croaked. \u201cNever forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Me, either. \u201cWe should probably\u2014\u201d Go our separate ways. She tried to force the words out of her mouth, but they congested in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he repeated. He leaned closer, closer, probably seeing the pulse at the base of her neck speed out of rhythm. He hovered there, breathing her in, as if he wasn\u2019t sure what to do next.</p><p>Forget separating. She wanted more and took care of the rest, tracing her tongue along the seam of his lips. He moaned, but didn\u2019t open, so she turned her attention to his pulse, licking up the base of his neck. She loved the honey and almond flavor of his skin. Loved the\u2014</p><p>Honey and almond.</p> <p>Like a woman\u2019s body lotion.</p><p>Jealousy was like a thousand knives inside her. What he did\u2014had done\u2014wasn\u2019t her business. They weren\u2019t dating. He could do whatever the hell he wanted, with whomever the hell he wanted.</p><p>And yet, still Noelle felt her nails dig into his chest as she straightened. \u201cHector, I\u2019m going to ask you a question and you\u2019re going to answer honestly or I swear to God I\u2019ll ensure you\u2019re never able to have children. Did you just have sex with someone?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, that flush of shame now so deeply rooted he might never get rid of it. \u201cNo, I did not have sex with anyone.\u201d Each word was carefully uttered, precisely measured, as if he didn\u2019t want to lie, but didn\u2019t want to admit the truth, either.</p><p>In his favor, he hadn\u2019t stated the obvious by pointing out that she had no right to pry into his love life.</p><p>\u201cDid you make out with someone after leaving the chapel?\u201d she asked. Every base would be covered before she allowed him to leave her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss someone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pulled a pair of black gloves from his back pocket and tugged them on. \u201cLet me make this interrogation easier and just admit that I haven\u2019t done anything with a woman, any woman, for a while. And before you ask,\u201d he added with barely a pause, \u201ca while is a long time and no, I won\u2019t define a long time.\u201d</p><p>Well, all right, then. The potent mix of jealousy and fury drained the rest of the way.</p><p>\u201cAre my testicles safe?\u201d he asked, and damn if his lips weren\u2019t twitching as if he wanted to grin, those golden eyes sparkling.</p><p>Irresistible man. \u201cFor now.\u201d As relaxed as he suddenly was, now might be the perfect time to gain perspective and dig up some answers. Other than the ones he\u2019d already denied her. \u201cSo, why did you storm out earlier?\u201d</p><p>Lids narrowing, lashes fusing. \u201cI didn\u2019t storm out. I simply made a hasty exit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your pants were on fire?\u201d Wasn\u2019t that how the old song went?</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Fighting an urge to draw him closer, she traced her fingers down the edge of his lapels, the material soft. He licked his lips.</p><p>Seeing his tongue ramped her up all over again. You\u2019re so easy. With him, yeah. She was. \u201cYou made me cry, Hector.\u201d Today, a year ago. But she didn\u2019t mention the past.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replied, gruff. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sorry. You needed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you have to kiss me better.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in Hector\u2019s body stiffened. Kiss her? \u201cWhat about Don Carlos? Will he mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a very open mind.\u201d</p><p>Exactly what I thought. \u201cNo other boyfriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. \u201cI will kiss you, then,\u201d he croaked out, and it was a vow. \u201cI\u2019ll make you better.\u201d He knew how he wanted to go about it, too. Strip her, spread her legs, push her against the wall, then touch and taste every inch of her. Knead her breasts, pinch her nipples, tongue her clit. Then pound his cock deep inside her, so deep she wouldn\u2019t walk for weeks.</p><p>What he\u2019d allow himself to do was another story.</p><p>Running from this? Not an option. Her sweet scent was in his nose, her hand was on his chest. He\u2019d leveled himself out only half an hour ago, wasn\u2019t in the danger zone. He could do this, have this.</p><p>A tremor moved through her. \u201cYou take too long. I\u2019ll help.\u201d Then she pressed their lips together and his thoughts totally and completely derailed.</p><p>More.</p><p>She tasted of champagne, female heat, and mint. He nearly brought his hands up to cup her jaw to angle her head for deeper access. Don\u2019t touch, don\u2019t you dare touch. Instead he pressed his gloved hands into the wall beside her and crowded her backward, until she couldn\u2019t move, was caged.</p><p>Their tongues rolled together, clashed. He operated on instinct, lust, and pent-up frustration. At no point was the kiss a gentle exploration. At all points, it was savage and hot and consuming, a rending of self, an unquenchable thirst. He wanted more, more, more, now, now, now.</p><p>No. Slow it down, fool. He had to remain distanced, had to keep himself under rigid control. But no matter what he told himself, he couldn\u2019t stop taking, giving, taking again. Taking everything she had, eating at her, desperate for her. To own her, possess her.</p><p>\u201cHector,\u201d she breathed. Her arms wound around his waist and she arched her lower body, grinding against him. A little moan escaped her, sliding down his throat and heating his every cell.</p><p>Her nipples were hard against his chest, rasping at his shirt. So badly he wanted to trace a path down the ridges of her spine and feel her ass. He pressed closer, instead, and she rubbed all the harder against the thick, swollen length of his cock.</p><p>At the first contact, she cried out and he groaned. \u201cYou feel so good, baby.\u201d</p><p>If he lifted her dress, opened his slacks, he could press into her wet, wet core\u2014and she was wet, she had to be. Her need was palpable. What would it feel like to be surrounded by a woman? By this one, specifically? Warm and wet ... tight.</p><p>Amazing. He could pound inside her, stretch her, pull out and start all over again.</p><p>He was rubbing against her madly, he realized, wringing deep, rich cries from her.</p><p>Fuck! You\u2019re supposed to go slowly, you stupid asshole.</p><p>Her fingers found their way to his scalp, skating through the strands of his hair. \u201cSoft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he admitted. He liked every damn thing about her. Just then, he wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d resisted her for so long. Always she was a drug, everything about her designed to lure him.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t ... do this ... with agents,\u201d she said between kisses.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Usually.\u201d Ever.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m special.\u201d A statement, not a question. \u201cBecause you crave me?\u201d</p><p>One he couldn\u2019t deny. \u201cYes.\u201d Despite everything, she\u2019d drawn him from glance one. A draw that had only grown stronger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d She bit down on his bottom lip, the sting flaming his need, reminding him of when he\u2019d bitten down on her. How her exquisite flavor had teased him, how he\u2019d felt, for one stolen moment, that she was his, only his, that she belonged to him, body and soul.</p><p>Something he\u2019d denied, even to himself. Until now, when he experienced that sense of ownership all over again.</p><p>He sucked on her tongue harder. Their teeth banged together, and even that he liked. Her hips continued to slowly gyrate against him, round and round, brushing against him, then leaving him panting for more, then brushing against him again.</p><p>Her fingers slid down his chest, to the waist of his pants, dug past the material, seeking his cock. They closed around him, and he hissed in a breath. Shit, he was going to lose it!</p><p>\u201cThe things you do to me,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cSo big,\u201d she breathed. \u201cMmm, Hector, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to fit in me, but I can\u2019t wait to find out.\u201d</p><p>The first tingles sparked in his arms. Panic battered against his arousal, and he forced his arms to snap behind his back. \u201cStop. Just for a second. Please, Noelle.\u201d Begging? Shit. Yeah, he\u2019d begged. \u201cJust need ... a moment. I have to calm down.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, licked at his lips one final time, as if she couldn\u2019t help herself, then lifted her head, her breath coming shallow and quick. Her mouth was red, swollen, and glossed with his taste. God, he liked that, liked knowing some part of him was on her, in her, that he was connected to her and she to him.</p><p>Her eyes were glassy with her arousal, her pupils blown and shadowing her irises. \u201cDid I do something you didn\u2019t like?\u201d Fingers loosening ...</p><p>Wanting to moan at the loss, he shook his head. \u201cI liked what you were doing too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d A blush stained her cheeks, or maybe a deeper flush of arousal. \u201cOh.\u201d A slow, wicked grin spread, lighting her entire face as she clutched him tighter. \u201cSo by stop you actually meant keep going?\u201d</p><p>He fought a laugh. Humor, when he was skirting the edge of danger. Such a thing should have been impossible, and would have been, with anyone else. Noelle\u2019s teasing spirit spoke to a part of him he\u2019d never known. The mischievous child he\u2019d never gotten to be.</p><p>\u201cNo. I just ... I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. Unless you leave me like this.\u201d She stroked up, down.</p><p>Another hiss of breath. \u201cI can hurt you in other ways. Believe me, I really can.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed with her confusion, and she straightened the rest of the way, removing her hand from his cock completely. He wanted to curse, but offered up a prayer of thanks instead. \u201cHow?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Hinges squeaked, Mia Snow sticking her dark head out the door a second later. Her blue gaze scanned the area, then lightened when she spotted them. \u201cThere you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d An unspoken this better be a matter of life or death coated Hector\u2019s voice as he angled his body away, hiding his erection and blocking her view of Noelle.</p><p>\u201cNice greeting, asshole,\u201d Mia snapped.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered. I am a calm, rational being. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>With her, you never knew. Could be something easy, like being asked to go into work early the next day, or something slightly more difficult, like kicking your own ass into next week for some perceived slight.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a homicide. Dallas is having a meltdown about something, so I\u2019m making you primary,\u201d Mia told him. \u201cYou need to head to the scene now, and have a look-see before local PD screws everything up.\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s gaze sought Noelle unbidden. She\u2019d gotten herself under control, her expression blank, her breathing even. That she\u2019d recovered so quickly, he didn\u2019t like. At all.</p><p>\u201cGive me the details,\u201d he forced himself to say.</p><p>Mia spouted them off as if she were reading bullet points from a computer screen. When she finished, she added, \u201cOh, and take Tremain with you. You\u2019re going to need her.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>NOELLE TRIED TO RELAX in her seat. Hector had traded rides with Mia, taking her AIR standard issue, complete with uncomfortable syn-leather interior, a console perched between the driver and passenger seats, and dash-screens in place of a steering wheel and glove compartment. Clear shield armor separated front from back, so that naughty otherworlders couldn\u2019t attack with fists, teeth, or even mind control.</p><p>Noelle owned a garage full of cars, some made before the human-alien war nearly a century ago, and before the armor-modification had become customary. She much preferred the older models. What was more fun than cutting corners as if you were on rails, burning rubber, and spinning donuts without sensors to stop you from crashing?</p><p>Besides making out with Hector in a public place, that is. Again. After a year-long abstinence, as if no time had passed. Nothing, that\u2019s what.</p><p>Her blood still shimmered with desire. Her hand still ached from trying to fit all the way around him, his length so thick her fingertips hadn\u2019t come close to connecting.</p><p>Yet he appeared unaffected, all business.</p><p>She studied the harsh planes of his profile. He had a staring contest going with the road, ignoring her. Sensors covered the entire outside of this vehicle, so there was no reason to focus that steadily. The car maneuvered the streets on its own, slowing, stopping, and speeding up as necessary.</p><p>Well, she could do that, too. Noelle peered out the window. Soon they left the suburbs behind, with the cute houses and the cute families, inside eating dinner. They made their way toward the poorer part of the city. Cool air trickled from the vents, but nothing could override the scent of Hector that permeated the small front enclosure. Wild, earthy, and sweaty.</p><p>Every breath Noelle sucked in reminded her of what they had been doing before Mia interrupted\u2014eating each other\u2019s faces. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Both times before, a single taste had caused instinct to propel Noelle over a ledge she couldn\u2019t see until too late. He was a drug to her, able to destroy any barrier, addicting her quickly, heating her inexorably, spinning her closer and closer to the bottom of what would either prove to be a deep, dark cavern of loneliness, or a bright, consuming bed of passion.</p><p>Hell, this time she hadn\u2019t even needed a taste. She\u2019d fallen the moment he had approached her, and there had been no stopping her spiral to splat. Every cell she possessed had yearned to have his hands exploring her, his body pounding into hers.</p><p>Damn him and his irresistibility. Now she wanted more of him, more from him, and would have given him more of herself. Would have asked him to go home with her, where she would have given him all, everything.</p> <p>Maybe. One-night stands weren\u2019t her thing, and never had been.</p><p>Maybe he would have wanted more than a one-night stand, though. Maybe he would have wanted to stay the night with her, see her again the next day, and the next. He craved her, after all.</p><p>Except he was already distancing himself from her. Regretting?</p><p>Hello loneliness.</p><p>With Corban, she\u2019d known where they were headed before they ever hit the sheets. He\u2019d wooed and won her, and then stuck around to polish his prize. With Hector, she\u2019d never known, and it had never mattered.</p> <p>With Hector, she still didn\u2019t know, and it still didn\u2019t matter. Damn him, she thought again.</p><p>\u201cHector,\u201d she began. She wasn\u2019t a coward. She would simply ask him what he expected from her. If he said they could give this thing, whatever it was, a try, she\u2019d give the relationship everything she had. If he said this was the end\u2014rejecting her for the third time in their acquaintance\u2014she\u2019d stab him in the jugular and hide his corpse.</p><p>Besides, this was her first murder investigation. Concentration was key. So after she found out where she stood with Hector, her mind would be clear, and then boom, she could solve the case and save the day. Easy as that.</p><p>\u201cThis was a mistake,\u201d he said before she could utter another word.</p><p>Just her luck, they reached their destination a moment later. The car parked in front of a line of police tape. Hector didn\u2019t push from the vehicle, but sat there, waiting for her response.</p><p>A mistake? A freaking mistake? Wow, that hurt. While she had luxuriated in what they could have done, could still do, he\u2019d obviously been thinking of how to let her down without bloodshed.</p> <p>Do not react. You suspected. She would paste a happy smile on her face, as always, and concentrate on the case.</p><p>The smile was a bit more difficult than usual to pull off, considering the emotional upheaval of the day. Needing a moment, she gazed outside, and yeah, she was highly aware she was acting like the very coward she\u2019d denied being. The moon was full and golden. Other cars littered the area, official red and blue lights flashing. A wide, open field stretched in every direction, grass growing in patches, crisp leaves dancing in the gentle breeze.</p><p>Where was the slain human they were supposed to examine? She increased the periphery of her focus. About fifty yards of dirt had been sectioned off by that tape, but the handful of officers who were standing outside were talking rather than working.</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d Hector said. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Smile, damn you. \u201cOf course I heard you. I\u2019m sitting right beside you.\u201d She added, \u201cI guess I should have told mother dearest yes. Her old biddie of a friend thinks I\u2019d be perfect for her son the surgeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Hector growled, then caught himself. \u201cBut whatever you want to do is fine.\u201d</p><p>Smile! \u201cAnd just so you know, this is gonna be Cherry Picking Barry all over again,\u201d she said before she could stop herself. Cas, keep it cas.</p><p>She didn\u2019t recognize any of the officers, none of them had attended the wedding, but that didn\u2019t change the facts. One look at her and Hector in their upscale attire, and it would be assumed they\u2019d been out on a date, with plans to get hot and heavy afterward.</p> <p>Had Hector wanted to get hot and heavy with her, she would have smirked. Now ... she just wanted to hide. \u201cPeople are going to think you\u2019re a god for possibly nailing me, while calling me all kinds of easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just that\u2014Wait. What?\u201d He turned in his seat to at last stare over at her. Those golden eyes were bright with an emotion she couldn\u2019t name. And maybe that was for the best. Just then, she could have removed his balls with the razor she had strapped to her thigh.</p><p>Why did no one want her for keeps?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Barry?\u201d Hector demanded, and this time she could read the emotion. Fury, lethal in a way only a man on the very edge could be.</p><p>On her behalf? Sweet of him, but she wouldn\u2019t soften. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy I oh, so generously gave my virginity to.\u201d The rest spilled from her, her resentment no longer a living thing but sharper tonight because of the man beside her. \u201cThe next day, he told everyone what we\u2019d done. All the guys slapped him on the back in a job well done, then tried to get into my pants as if they had a right to plant their flag, too, and all the girls but Ava treated me as if I had the plague. As if I would steal their boyfriends with my whoring ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? No.\u201d A true grin kicked at the corners of her mouth. \u201cBut Ava wrecked his car. Slammed his pride and joy right into his parents\u2019 house.\u201d Now that was friendship.</p><p>A tense pause. Then, \u201cI would have killed him for you,\u201d Hector said in a low, quiet voice that left no room for doubt. \u201cI would have burned him and dumped the ashes in a pile of animal shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Damn it. She was softening. He doesn\u2019t want to continue seeing you, remember?</p><p>His nostrils flared as if he could already smell the burning flesh. \u201cYeah, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you still can. He lives in the Lakeshore Apartments on Lake Shore Drive. Number eighteen B.\u201d</p><p>One of Hector\u2019s brows arched, the gold in his eyes frosting over in that way of his. He wasn\u2019t just on the edge of lethal\u2014he\u2019d already leapt and was falling. \u201cYou actually kept track of him. Why? Did you want to see him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Hell, no, I don\u2019t want to see him again, but someone has to send his wife pictures of his illicit activities, and that someone is me. Yeah, I\u2019m a giver like that.\u201d</p><p>A quicksilver blaze of amusement, gone before she could wonder at its source.</p><p>She waited, but Hector remained quiet and his expression never reverted back to ... whatever. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d she said anyway. \u201cWhy\u2019d I let him off with such a minor, lifelong punishment? Well, let me tell you a little something about me.\u201d Something you might learn intimately, bubby. \u201cIf anyone so much as drops a beer can on my lawn I pay for DNA testing. The very day the results come in, I have two tons of trash dumped in their yard. I don\u2019t get revenge, I teach valuable lessons. Barry\u2019s still learning his.\u201d</p><p>Hector massaged the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d His voice had dropped another octave, reminding her of when he\u2019d pressed his erection between her legs. She shivered like the stupid girl she was. \u201cWell, uh. Huh.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cAs I was saying. This was a mistake. Us messing around, not us showing up together.\u201d</p><p>Smile\u2014check. \u201cI know that, too. No need to drive home the point.\u201d Or rather, the dagger in her chest. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to see each other romantically. No big deal.\u201d Except, it was a big fucking deal!</p><p>Maintain your happy face.</p><p>His hand dropped from his nape to rest on the seat, his fingers digging into the upholstery with enough force to leave cracks. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t like you. It\u2019s that I\u2019m dangerous, Noelle. Really, really dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the AIR version of it\u2019s not you it\u2019s me, right?\u201d she asked dryly. \u201cIf only you\u2019d used it before, I would have known to use it on Dallas tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, damn it!\u201d Back up the hand went, scrubbing down his face, leaving red marks. \u201cWell, yes, it is a version of that, but it really is me. I want you, so damn badly I ache all the damn time, but I can\u2019t do relationships. I just can\u2019t. Damn it!\u201d So many damns.</p><p>Something in his tormented expression thrust its way past her defenses and clanged a warning. He wasn\u2019t just spouting nonsense to get rid of her. He believed what he said wholeheartedly. He wanted her\u2014craved her, ached for her\u2014but he couldn\u2019t let himself have her.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you try with me? I wasn\u2019t picking out china patterns or anything.\u201d He\u2019d like something bold. Scarlet, maybe, with ebony flecks and asymmetrical edges. \u201cI save that for date two.\u201d She\u2019d tried for a witty tone. She\u2019d failed. She just sounded needy.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve something better,\u201d he said miserably. \u201cI\u2019m not just really dangerous, I\u2019m too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Dangerous. How many times had he tossed that word at her? As many times as he\u2019d tossed out damn, she was sure. \u201cUh, have you met me, Agent Mean? I\u2019m kinda dangerous, too.\u201d God. She was practically begging him to date her. How pathetic she was. She should stop, leave now while she still had a little dignity. He might want her, but if he wasn\u2019t willing to try, she couldn\u2019t force him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dangerous, yeah, there\u2019s no denying that. I saw you tackle a perp, then stab him in the leg when he ran away. But I\u2019m on a whole different playing field, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>This was the second time he\u2019d called her sweetheart, and her heart skipped a treacherous beat. When other guys used cute little nicknames with her, she wanted to strangle them with their own intestines. When Hector did it, she wanted to swoon like a Victorian maiden. Weird. \u201cLet\u2019s pretend I believe that.\u201d She. Should. Stop. She should shut up. But then she recalled the handprints he\u2019d left in that wall, the night he\u2019d warned her away, and the way he always tugged on those gloves, time and time again, and some of her hurt vanished, leaving a hollow curiosity. \u201cHow? Make me understand.\u201d</p><p>A heavy pause. She thought he meant to deny her.</p><p>Then, \u201cI can ... I hurt ... People die when I touch ...\u201d He banged a fist into the dashboard, the skin boasting a slight glow\u2014even though he still wore the gloves. There were several holes in the material. Tendrils of smoke wafted, curling up.</p><p>When he noticed, he trembled with abject fear, removed them, and fumbled for a new pair in his pocket. As he pulled those on, he said, \u201cLook, it doesn\u2019t matter. I shouldn\u2019t have approached you. Shouldn\u2019t have promised you anything more. Nothing can ever happen.\u201d He turned away from her, facing his window, but hesitated. \u201cAll right? Okay?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2014kill? I hurt\u2014women he touched? People die\u2014because of his sometimes-radiant arms that could singe asbestos, or whatever material he wore, and burn through metal? Probably. He was so agitated, tension layered with more of that self-disgust vibrating off him.</p><p>So ... say she was right. Say his hands really were hazardous, like weapons. Weapons he couldn\u2019t control. Say he normally avoided women to prevent himself from burning them like he\u2019d done the metal wall. Yet still he had kissed Noelle\u2014three times. Still he had almost given her more. Because he hadn\u2019t been able to help himself. That meant he craved her, just as he\u2019d claimed. As desperately as she craved him. Desire ruled him whenever he neared her. If only for a little while.</p><p>Could be wishful thinking on her part. Or she could be dead-on right. She needed to think, to figure out what she was willing to risk\u2014like, say, her pride\u2014to have this man in her life. Or if she was willing to risk anything at all. Right now everything she felt could stem from the lingering heat of his kiss, the fear of losing Ava, and the thrill of her first murder investigation.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI won\u2019t jump you.\u201d Not tonight, at least. \u201cNow let\u2019s go solve this mystery so I can go home and call Ava.\u201d</p><p>Hector turned so quickly he would surely suffer from whiplash, his gaze narrowed and zeroed in on her, his lips pulled back in a scowl, his teeth a flash of white in the surrounding darkness. \u201cWhat the hell, Noelle?\u201d</p><p>Noelle glanced left, right, trying to figure out what had just pissed him off so badly. Nothing had changed, no one had approached the car. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you going to call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what twisted your panties? Jeez. This is the first night of her honeymoon, and I want to know how McKell performed.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in Hector\u2019s jaw. \u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s the only reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why\u2014\u201d Finally, understanding dawned and she scowled. \u201cWhat, you thought I planned to tell her about you and your speech?\u201d She forced a chuckle. \u201cDarling, if I told her about every man I came close to screwing, we\u2019d never be able to discuss anything else.\u201d A lie, but he would never know that.</p><p>His eyes slitted further, but in the end, he emerged from the car without uttering another word.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>SMILE IN PLACE, NOELLE exited her side of the vehicle, the length of her gown swishing down her legs and brushing the ground. The officers gave her a thorough once-over; some leered, the obviously blind ones shrugged and looked away, as if she were nothing special. Someone whistled, and someone else cackled out a, \u201cWho\u2019s that? Red Carpet Barbie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, \u2019cause then we\u2019d get to strip her and bend her however we wanted.\u201d</p><p>Snickers.</p><p>Had Ava been here, the man would already be on his knees, begging for forgiveness. Noelle would have cheered her on, content in the knowledge that she was loved unconditionally and protected fiercely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now she\u2019d have to take care of herself. Something she could do, something she had done many times before, and something she would continue to do again and again, because\u2014</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, or I\u2019ll rip out your throats and do it for you,\u201d Hector growled.</p><p>Silence. Absolute silence followed the threat. Or promise.</p> <p>\u201cGood boys.\u201d His tone gentled, though it was no less brutal. \u201cNow tell me who called this in.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to point out that the men couldn\u2019t shut up and talk to him. She was too pleased by his defense of her.</p><p>Smile suddenly genuine, she walked to his side, clipping a few of the guys with an elbow to the gut as she did. They hunched over, wheezing for breath. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said, so sincere she brought tears to her own eyes. \u201cThe dress ... so long ... I tripped ...\u201d</p><p>Hector coughed to cover a laugh. \u201cSo? Who called it?\u201d</p><p>Hector ... amused ... the unveiling of his dimples ... a shiver rocked her.</p> <p>A young man with sandy hair and glasses stepped forward. He was average height, on the slim side, and just a little scared to find himself in Hector\u2019s sights. \u201cAgent Dean, sir, uh, a witness called. Claimed he\u2019d seen four men. Two were here, waiting. One in a suit. One dressed casually. Then two others just appeared. One was an Arcadian, so we think teleportation was used. The other was the victim. Alive at the time. Witness claims the guy in the suit said, \u2018Thinking you could blow the lid off my operation just got you killed \u2019 and pulled the trigger on a pyre-gun.\u201d</p><p>Hector had stiffened at the word Arcadian, then growled at the word teleportation. He must be thinking of the women he\u2019d found, so long ago. The ones in the warehouse who had disappeared while in the hospital. An Arcadian had been suspected then, too, but had never been found.</p><p>Noelle knew because she\u2019d maybe kinda sorta peeked at some of his old case files.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d the witness know it was a pyre?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Pyres were made for AIR agents, and illegal for civilians to carry. Plus, they weren\u2019t the only weapons that lit up like firecrackers.</p><p>\u201cSaid there was a flash of bright light, but no booming sound. Said it was the same type of gun he saw agents carrying on that TV show, As the Other World Turns.\u201d</p> <p>Good show. Gotta catch up on that.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Hector asked. \u201cYou check the tapes for alien voice?\u201d</p><p>The officer gulped. \u201cWe did. There\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go over them myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. As for the rest, the vic was hit in the chest, his organs fried. That\u2019s when the witness screamed, and the three men realized they\u2019d been spotted. They gave chase, but the witness hid and called us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he give you descriptions of the three?\u201d Noelle asked, inserting herself into the conversation. My investigation, too, big boy.</p><p>Those spec-covered eyes flipped to her, softened. \u201cNo. He said it was too dark, and that he only knew one of the men was Arcadian because of the white hair and the instappear act. Which is why we called AIR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the witness now?\u201d Hector demanded.</p> <p>A thumb hitched over his thin shoulder. \u201cBack of my car, sir.\u201d</p><p>Noelle scanned each of the vehicles and spotted their guy in the back of the farthest, the inside light burning bright. A junkie, she thought. Human. Pasty, papery skin. Red, sunken eyes. Chapped lips. Dirt-streaked his face. He rocked back and forth and was muttering to himself.</p><p>\u201cPut him in the back of mine,\u201d Hector instructed. \u201cAnd post two guards at the doors. Eyes are to be on him at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Before the guy could rush off, Hector reached out and withdrew a pair of latex gloves from his uniform pocket. He pulled the latex over the gloves he still wore as he walked to the trunk of Mia\u2019s sedan. There, he grabbed a tool kit.</p><p>Expression blank, he ducked under the tape and strode away. All without a word to Noelle. Well, that wasn\u2019t going to stop her. She looked at the elegant length of her dress, then at the ground. With a shrug, she palmed the blade strapped to her thigh\u2014earned a few more whistles\u2014and stripped off the bottom half of the material, leaving herself bare from the top of her knees down. Risqu\u00e9 for a crime scene, sure, but she\u2019d bared more skin at the last cocktail party she\u2019d attended. This way, she wouldn\u2019t brush away any prints.</p><p>As the men gaped, she bummed a pair of gloves from one of the officers and followed the same path Hector had taken. All business, she thought. Her personal life would not get in the way.</p><p>He crouched beside a dark lump. Once there, she could smell the coppery scent of blood, the release of bowels. Could see ... far more than she wanted. The man was on his stomach, his face turned to the side, away from her. She purposely didn\u2019t study that part of him too intently. Already she could see that his mouth was still open in a silent scream.</p><p>Hector rolled him to his back, careful, so careful. The vic wore dress slacks, and his button-down shirt had burned away. There was a gaping hole in his chest, the skin at the edges charred, the organs inside deep fried.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Hector said, digging through his now open toolbox. He stood before she could remind him that she wasn\u2019t stupid and returned to the tape. He walked the edges, stopping every so often to stake a halogen in the ground.</p><p>By the time he reclaimed his place at her side, those lights were bathing the scene with unforgiving purpose, chasing away every soothing shadow.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell by glance alone?\u201d Hector asked her. Lines of tension branched from his eyes, his skin losing a little color.</p><p>Still trying to teach her, even though she was now considered his equal? Fine. Whatever. \u201cThere are no tire tracks. No footprints, either. There\u2019s nothing to suggest the body was dragged. So, even though the witness is a drug addict, he was telling\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hector gave a start of surprise.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I noticed that, too. Anyway, he was telling the truth. Our vic was popped here and killed here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think he wasn\u2019t killed somewhere else and teleported in already dead?\u201d</p><p>Was he serious? \u201cLook at the burn marks where he\u2019s lying. He was still frying when he fell on his face, and charred the grass beneath him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. What else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudging by what the witness heard\u2014\u2018thinking you could blow the lid off my operation\u2019\u2014this was a premeditated crime. Our shooter wants to keep something hidden. And our vic was a good Samaritan trying to take him down. Which suggests he knew his attacker, or at least was connected to him in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he repeated. \u201cReally good observations, Noelle.\u201d</p><p>She was used to being patted on the head, told what she needed to do to be better\u2014at everything. His praise, so easily offered, floored her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now what else can you tell about him?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly she was desperate to impress him. \u201cWell, he had money.\u201d A soft breeze danced between them, lifting strands of her hair and caressing them over her cheeks.</p><p>Hector\u2019s gaze sharpened, as if she\u2019d astounded him. \u201cExplain how you deduced that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis pants. They\u2019re fitted for his frame specifically and not off the rack. Plus, the material is genuine silk rather than a synthetic blend. And look at his shoes. They\u2019re Burbans and go for three thousand dollars a pop.\u201d</p><p>A pause, as if he were processing what she\u2019d said. \u201cGood eye.\u201d</p><p>The praise lit her up inside. Careful. He could addict her to his compliments as surely as he\u2019d addicted her to his kisses.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find out who we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d Hector pressed his lips together, pulled a small ID scan from the box, and gently pressed the man\u2019s thumb into the screen. A blue light appeared, roving from the top of his print to the bottom.</p><p>With more care than a man as muscled as Hector should possess, he placed the victim\u2019s hand in the same position he\u2019d found it. Then he read the screen. \u201cBobby Marks. Five feet eleven, one hundred and eight-five pounds. Dark hair. Dark eyes. Caucasian.\u201d</p><p>The name rattled through her mind until she felt as if she\u2019d been punched in the temple over and over again. Now, more than before, she wanted to avoid looking at the guy\u2019s face, but her gaze strayed there anyway.</p><p>Familiar brown hair, rumpled and in disarray. Familiar brown eyes stared at nothing, still glassed with pain and terror. Those lips had once pressed kisses onto the top of her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou knew him,\u201d Hector said, a confident observation.</p><p>She must have gasped. \u201cYes,\u201d she croaked. \u201cI do. Did.\u201d</p><p>Shock caused the words to leave her with the same inflection an automaton would have used. Zero. \u201cHe was a gambler. Built himself up from nothing. Won stock in several different companies. Sold some, bought more in others. Those with old money hated him.\u201d</p><p>As Hector dug around in his toolbox, he said, \u201cYour family is old money.\u201d He took several samples from the body\u2014blood, tissue, clothing, under the nails.</p><p>\u201cYes. My dad never met him. Died before Bobby\u2019s time. But my mother hates\u2014hated him. She made no secret about that. No one did. So if you want a list of families who could have wanted him dead, it\u2019ll be a long one.\u201d</p><p>The witness had claimed the shooter had worn a suit. Could he have been a businessman Bobby had taken down?</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll want a list. Did you?\u201d Hector sorted the vials before placing them in their proper locations in the box. \u201cHate him, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Surely he hadn\u2019t intended for that to sound like an accusation. As if she were a suspect, just because she\u2019d had an association. \u201cI thought he was charming. Ruthless in getting what he wanted, but charming.\u201d So charming, now dead. Gone. \u201cBut then, I\u2019m a trust fund baby and my wealth never depended on my business. I could afford to like him.\u201d</p><p>And now he was dead, she thought again. Such a startling realization. She remembered his laughter. He\u2019d laughed at her jokes, genuinely amused. He\u2019d fetched her single malt when she\u2019d asked, and had even danced with her a time or two. But he\u2019d never laugh again. Never share a drink with her. Never dance with anyone else.</p><p>Though she hurt for what Bobby had surely endured, she forced herself to compartmentalize. Focus, drive. She couldn\u2019t save him, but she could avenge him.</p><p>Hector paused, and for a moment, she doubted he was even breathing. \u201cWere you one of the things he wanted?\u201d</p><p>In his mind, he\u2019d just dumped her on her ass. Again. He had no right to the answer.</p><p>\u201cMaybe at one time.\u201d She told herself she replied for the case, but deep down she knew better. \u201cHe loved having arm candy, and I played that role for him every once in a while. Then, a few months ago, he stopped dating. He still went to all the parties, but he never showed up with a woman. Always went solo. Always left the same way.\u201d</p><p>A whoosh of air, the click of a lid, the cinch of a lock. \u201cOkay,\u201d Hector said, standing. His expression never changed. He gave nothing away. \u201cDo me a favor and call Dallas. Ask him to get out here, and to keep it on the DL. I\u2019ll process the rest of the scene and see what we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>So. Hector didn\u2019t think Noelle was a good enough partner for this job. He wanted Dallas. Insulting, embarrassing ... devastating. Never good enough. But okay. She\u2019d call the guy. Then they could both be shocked and impressed with her skills.</p><p>\u2019Cause yeah, she would solve this thing. No matter what she had to do, she would solve it. Bobby deserved vengeance. Bobby deserved peace.</p><p>And maybe then Hector would consider being with her worth any risk.</p><p>When the thought registered, she had to cover her mouth to cut off her cry of alarm. She was doing it again, reverting to her childhood ways, becoming a girl willing to do anything to prove herself, and when that failed, acting out for attention.</p><p>And though she\u2019d successfully smothered the cry, Hector caught her distress and pinned her in place with the intensity of his gaze. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>How did he do that? How did he always know? \u201cNothing,\u201d she said, lowering her hands. Shame coated her, a film on her skin. \u201cNothing.\u201d She would solve this case, but she wouldn\u2019t do it to impress a man or to prove she was worthy. She would do it for Bobby. Only Bobby.</p><p>Hector frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d His gaze roved over her, perhaps searching for injuries. He must not have seen the condition of her gown until that very moment, because his jaw dropped. Heat melted his eyes into liquid gold, a frothing cauldron of ... desire? \u201cYou\u2019re also almost naked.\u201d</p><p>Fighting the urge to snuggle up to him, to encourage his arms to wrap around her and buffer her from the rest of the world, from herself, even from him, she lifted her chin. \u201cRight now you\u2019re my coworker, nothing more. You don\u2019t have the right to pry into my feelings or even to comment on my lack of clothing. So back off.\u201d</p><p>He was the one to radiate shame this time. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t I always?\u201d A flippant reply when all she really wanted to do was sag in defeat.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>THE LITTLE COFFEE SHOP reeked of caffeine (a given), sugar (a bonus), and cigarette smoke (a crime). As the only patrons were AIR agents, however, no arrests would be made tonight or any other.</p><p>Noelle had spent some time in juvenile detention for lighting up in junior high. Of course, she\u2019d intended to piss her parents off, and\u2014she hated to admit this next one\u2014she had hoped to develop lung cancer. She\u2019d prayed the disease would strike her down, she\u2019d be hospitalized, and all of her family would rush to her side, squeezing her hand, crying, telling her how much they loved her, just as she was, and how sorry they were to have treated her so badly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then she\u2019d met Ava. First day, they\u2019d exchanged insults and actually gotten into a fist-fight. Second day, they\u2019d kissed and made up, and the little tart had leaned into her and said, \u201cWhy do you smell like my mom?\u201d Noelle had given up cigs from that day on.</p><p>God, she missed Ava already.</p><p>Ava should be here. Ava should partner her on this case.</p> <p>Should, should, should. Sighing, Noelle slid into the booth at the back of the The Last Stop, a small, rundown, all-night diner, expecting Hector to slide in beside her. He did not. He sat across from her, and Dallas claimed the space beside him.</p><p>And of course Dallas was back to his moody, broody self, glaring at her.</p><p>As big and muscled as they both were, they consumed the entire bench. The tabletop pressed into the hard ropes of their stomachs. Their shoulders rubbed.</p><p>They\u2019d rather be uncomfortable than touch her. Awesome. Well, she would rather they were uncomfortable and touching her. She dipped low in her seat, stretching out her legs, ensuring one of her knees wedged between Hector\u2019s legs and the other wedged between Dallas\u2019s.</p><p>They stiffened in unison, and she fought a smug grin.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s bad for your posture, you know,\u201d Hector said in that grumbling tone he just loved to use with her. \u201cSit up. Now.\u201d</p><p>How cute he was, issuing commands as if he were her boss. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will. And if my back knots up,\u201d she replied with the sugar-sweet tone she loved to use with her enemies so they\u2019d never suspect her strike, \u201cI\u2019ll let you massage it better, so you can stop hinting that that\u2019s what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>He scowled at her. She smiled at him, a mere baring of her teeth\u2014before flipping him off. Dallas watched the byplay through slitted lids. His mouth hovered between a fierce frown and a twist of abject terror.</p><p>What was his deal?</p><p>Well, she wouldn\u2019t worry about him. Only the case mattered, she reminded herself. They\u2019d dropped the witness at AIR before coming here, hoping he\u2019d sober up and hurry through withdrawal so they could talk to him.</p><p>A harried waitress approached, a computerized notepad in hand, shifting impatiently from one sneakered foot to the other. She was older, with frizzy salt-and-pepper hair and ink stains on her hands. But she wore a necklace made from macaroni noodles, and Noelle\u2019s heart gave a lurch.</p> <p>She\u2019d made a similar necklace for her mother long, long ago. Madame Tremain had pinched the thing between her fingers and grimaced. Grimaced, as if she were handling a rotting animal carcass.</p><p>\u201cMama wears diamonds, darling, not pasta,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cBesides, we don\u2019t want nasty insects getting into the house, now do we? No, we don\u2019t. So throw this thing away, and we\u2019ll go buy a real necklace.\u201d</p><p>Noelle shoved the memory deep inside her, where a thousand others just like it resided.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have coffee,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cBlack, strong. Fine, just go ahead and bring me motor oil.\u201d There was something wrong with his voice. Gone was the charmer entirely. In his place was a raging asshole. \u201cOh, and about a thousand painkillers, if you\u2019re serving them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly with the eggs. You?\u201d One graying brow winged up as she focused on Hector.</p><p>\u201cJust coffee for me.\u201d</p><p>At long last, that stressed gaze landed on Noelle. She hadn\u2019t even glanced at the menu glowing on the side wall, but she\u2019d been to places very similar to this one and knew what they served. Except for one tiny yet important detail. \u201cDo you have real meat or do you only use the syns and clones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake.\u201d Hector, grumbling.</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding me with this?\u201d Dallas, snarling.</p><p>Noelle never removed her gaze from the waitress. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSyns and clones. You want real, you\u2019ll have to go somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>She heaved another sigh. Yeah, she\u2019d figured that was the case; she was disappointed nonetheless.</p><p>During the war, things like water, animals, and, well, anything delicious had been contaminated, ruined, or almost completely wiped out. Now, to get the real thing, you had to pay\u2014and pay out the ass. Only a few shops in this district catered to people like Noelle, who were more than willing to bend over.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d the waitress said, what little patience she\u2019d had vanishing. \u201cYou want something or you don\u2019t. Which is it?\u201d</p><p>The attitude could use a tune-up, but its rust and lack of shine wouldn\u2019t diminish her tip. In fact, she could mess up Noelle\u2019s entire order, spit in her food, whatever, but the macaroni guaranteed her a hefty tip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have two eggs, over medium, with a side of hash browns, and don\u2019t skimp on the butter or whatever variation you use. I want four strips of bacon, two sausage patties, and four hotcakes. I don\u2019t care what kind of syrup you bring, just make sure it\u2019s warm. Also, I want two pieces of toast, but don\u2019t put any butter on those. And I want jelly, whatever you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>An astonished, \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>A hmph sounded as the waitress finished typing. She wandered off, and Noelle noticed that both Hector and Dallas were staring at her with equal measures of bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m hungry. I didn\u2019t eat before, during, or after the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you just came from a gruesome murder scene,\u201d Hector, Mr. Obvious, said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that means I should starve for the rest of my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means you shouldn\u2019t eat something that looks like the dead guy\u2019s chest,\u201d Dallas snapped. \u201cNow can the two of you stop flirting with each other? It\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p><p>Seriously, what was wrong with him? \u201cHow about this,\u201d she told them both. \u201cI\u2019ll worry about my appetite and potential digestive problems, and you two worry about shutting your fucking mouths. Sound good? As for the flirting thing, your radar must be malfunctioning, Dallas. If you consider that flirting, I feel sorry for your girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>No response was forthcoming, just more staring. Although Hector seemed to be battling a grin.</p><p>She snuggled deeper into her uncomfortable seat, the vinyl cracked and torn and catching in what was left of her savaged dress. She couldn\u2019t wait to shower and change. Alone. Without Hector.</p><p>Avoid, avoid. Any topic was safer than the man across from her.</p><p>She cast her gaze through the smoke-hazed room. There were about twenty booths, nearly all of them stuffed with AIR agents, some in uniforms, some in street clothes. Conversations were loud, and laughter, when it came, was gruff.</p><p>There were two TVs posted in the far corners of the room, both playing the same game. Football. And there was Corban Blue in all his Arcadian glory, tall, strong, as pale as a moonbeam, making an astonishing pass, the ball whizzing through the air so quickly the camera couldn\u2019t track it.</p><p>Lately, she just couldn\u2019t escape him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at with such an amazed expression?\u201d Hector asked. He turned, saw the television, and grunted like the caveman he truly was. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were into sports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m into the men. Uniforms are hot.\u201d</p><p>Hector had removed his gloves on the drive over and hadn\u2019t replaced them. Now he curled his fingers around the edge of the table, his knuckles quickly bleaching of color. What? Had her reply pissed him off? Made him jealous? Well, good. He deserved to stew.</p><p>God knew she would relive their interaction tonight over and over again, and it\u2019d be nice to know he had reacted to her, even in so small a way.</p><p>Dallas nudged him, and the two focused on each other. A conversation about sports ensued, followed by an exchange of wedding gossip. Hector relaxed, the fine lines around his eyes easing.</p><p>Since neither of them seemed keen to discuss the case, she whipped out her cell and texted Ava.</p><p>R U a vamp yet? Fingers crossed the text interrupted something important.</p><p>McKell\u2019s blood could turn anyone or thing\u2014like, say, a dog named Hellina that Noelle used to own\u2014into a vampire. And now that bloodsucking bastard was vamping up her Ava. Her sweet, baby-faced Ava. Would her tan fade? Probably. Would she sprout fangs? Definitely. Hellina had.</p><p>No worries, though. Noelle would ensure Ava always looked her best. She drafted a mental Christmas for her friend. Sunless tanner, bloodred lipstick that wouldn\u2019t smear, a car with UV-repellant shield armor, and a recipe for making Mr. Bloody Marys with McKell\u2019s blood. Because they were mated, Ava would be unable to drink from anyone but McKell without sickening. So no noshing on agents or targets who got on her nerves.</p><p>Noelle\u2019s phone vibrated, signaling the reply had just arrived.</p><p>Knowing Ava, her cell rested on the nightstand beside the bed. Just in case Noelle needed her. A darling gesture, and one of the many reasons Noelle adored her.</p><p>Screen name Tits McGee said: Nope. We bargained. He has 2 last 30 mins before I let him turn me. 3 tries in, and no go. Noelle had named her after a character in an old movie she and Ava loved to watch, but just then she seriously considered changing the name back to Pocket Rocket. That one always had a nice ring.</p><p>2 excited about having U 4 eternity, I guess.</p><p>I know! He\u2019s so lucky!</p><p>The waitress arrived with the coffees, sloshing them on the table before hurrying away. Noelle added a liberal amount of fake cream and fake sugar, wishing to God she\u2019d thought to bring a purse full of the essentials.</p><p>After a few sips of the nasty concoction, she started typing again. Thought: maybe I should become a vamp 2. She tossed out the suggestion as a joke, but absolute, utter longing swept through her. Ava was going to age slowly. Noelle wasn\u2019t. Ava was going to live a long, long time. Noelle had another forty or fifty years. Maybe. And that just wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>So what if she would never again be able to venture out in the daylight. There were simulators and virtual reality programs available. So what if she would be as pale as milk. That\u2019s what cosmetics were for. As long as she had Ava, nothing else mattered. Right?</p><p>Tits McGee: R U joking? U better not B joking! I will stab U in throat if U R joking!</p><p>Her gaze strayed to Hector, who was still engaged in conversation with Dallas. Still ignoring her. If she vamped it up, he would age quickly and she would age slowly. She would have to watch him die.</p><p>Okay, so maybe something else mattered. Even though Hector currently occupied the top spot on her shit list, the thought of him dead and gone made her chest ache.</p><p>She typed: Let me think about it.</p><p>I will do my best 2 help w/right decision. Luv U.</p><p>Luv U 2.</p><p>A few seconds later, her phone gave another vibration, and she had to blink rapidly to see the screen clearly.</p><p>Tits McGee: Food 4 thought. U will look so hawt w/ fangs &amp; I will</p><p>The text ended there. Without punctuation, without finishing. Then Noelle\u2019s cell was ringing, Ava\u2019s voice saying, \u201cYou better answer this, genius, or I\u2019ll kick your ass!\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Dallas glanced around the diner. \u201cAva\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hector pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cThat\u2019s Noelle\u2019s ring tone you\u2019re hearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes, hello?\u201d Noelle said into the piece, knowing exactly who it was. On her way here, she\u2019d programmed her ringer to go off for everyone but her mother, who had tried calling again. \u201cNoelle Tremain, master of the universe at your service. How may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop texting my wife,\u201d McKell growled from the other end. Bingo. \u201cI need her full attention right now.\u201d Click.</p><p>A chuckle escaped Noelle as she put her phone away. Original mission accomplished.</p><p>Hector\u2019s golden eyes pierced her, becoming a spotlight on all the needy places inside her. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>To hide the fact that she was now quivering inside\u2014God, his intensity was arousing\u2014she waved the question away with a flick of her wrist. \u201cYou have no right to the answer. Besides, we\u2019re here for business. Let\u2019s get to it, shall we? If you two are done cackling like hens, that is.\u201d</p><p>Dallas popped his jaw. \u201cI do not cackle. I bitch like a he-man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have that in common, then.\u201d She sipped at her coffee, grimaced at the thickness, and added more cream and sugar. \u201cSo why are you here when I\u2019m secondary on the case?\u201d A fact she would not let either of them forget.</p><p>Hector answered for him. \u201cHe helped me a year ago, with the women found in the warehouse. A mysterious Arcadian popping in and out after our tipster comes out of hiding. It\u2019s suspicious.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d jumped to that as well.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m so ready to nail whoever was responsible,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>The fact that both men remembered that case, despite the hundreds of others they\u2019d since worked, meant it had left a mark deep in their souls.</p><p>\u201cAny luck on identifying the Arcadian who snatched the women out of the hospital?\u201d she asked. Nothing had been in the file, but then, all details weren\u2019t always reported.</p><p>Dallas shook his head, dark hair falling over his forehead. He didn\u2019t brush the strands aside. Maybe he didn\u2019t notice them. He\u2019d been silent and stiff at the crime scene, but after seeing the body, he\u2019d become deadly silent, and savagely stiff. \u201cFirst order of business is finding out who Marks was working with and if any recent dealings had gone sour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll search Marks\u2019s home and office in the morning,\u201d Hector said. \u201cTalk to his employees, that kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>With me, right? she projected at him. Partner.</p><p>His expression remained blank.</p><p>She brought her mug to her lips, blew into the steam, gulped. The sugar had dissolved, sweetening the taste, and the cream had thinned the liquid. To make sure she had his full attention, she moaned her approval louder than necessary, as if she were having sex with her cup. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rubbed at his arm, his jaw clenched. Not so blank any more. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Innocent as the devil, she blinked over at him. \u201cDon\u2019t do what?\u201d Arouse you? Make you crave more of me?</p><p>\u201cSo what I\u2019m trying to say is, we should consider using the witness as bait to draw out the Arcadian or whoever hired him.\u201d Dallas\u2019s snapped words stopped her from doing something stupid, like leaping over the table and devouring Hector. Uh, she meant, slapping some sense into Hector. \u201cIf the two cases are connected, the Arcadian will try to cover his tracks and tie up all loose ends. Right now, the witness is the only loose end we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat we know of,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut he\u2019ll never agree. He was scared as hell already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we don\u2019t have to use him in the field,\u201d Hector said. \u201cJust his name and someone who kinda looks like him. I don\u2019t want to go that route, though. Not yet. Not until we have a few more answers.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment after he\u2019d spoken, he watched her, silent, his intense expression somehow transporting her back to the reception hall, with his arms caging her, his lips pressed into hers. Hot, aching arousal pooled between her legs.</p><p>Stop. You have to stop this.</p><p>She cleared her throat, breaking the spell.</p> <p>He looked away. \u201cI\u2019ve got agents scouring Whore\u2019s Corner, searching for other possible witnesses. Especially someone who isn\u2019t a user. They\u2019re texting me updates and so far no luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably won\u2019t find anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cWitness mentioned a foot chase. Our killer would have found anyone else in the vicinity and we would have found a trail of dead bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Or, if our killer found someone else, he might have taken him to a secondary location, thinking everything was then under control. But there are no footprints anywhere. So either our witness was lying and there was never a chase or they were wiped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be difficult for a rich man to wipe the prints. With the right equipment, you can wipe anything. You need to have the agents search the field for a small pinlike device. It\u2019s small, thin, and will blend in, but when shoved into the ground and switched on, it disrupts the natural lay of the land, kind of like shaking dirt in a glass.\u201d Of course, if the device was used, the body could have been dragged there without leaving tracks.</p><p>\u201cNever heard of something like that,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t we have felt a quake or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. And you\u2019ve never heard of something like that because it\u2019s black market and new. I certainly don\u2019t know about it because Ava and I trashed a senator\u2019s prized backyard after he threw a tantrum when she wouldn\u2019t sleep with him. I just like to stay up to date on new inventions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUp to date?\u201d Hector said. \u201cThat\u2019s the alibi you\u2019re going with?\u201d</p><p>A shrug of one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the agents look. As for us, we need to notify Mr. Marks\u2019s family about his death before the press learns his identity. I tried to phone the mother, Brenda Marks, on the way over, but there was no answer.\u201d There was a dagger-like sharpness to his tone. Clearly he hated that part of the job. \u201cWhen she finds out, there will be a public outcry for action and answers, and we\u2019ll have cameras on our every move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Brenda Marks is as cold and unfeeling as a woman can get. You don\u2019t have to worry about any tears or accusations that you should have done your job and saved Bobby. But she does like the limelight, and she will phone every newspaper in town the moment you leave her.\u201d</p><p>A tangle of scents wafted to Noelle a split second before the waitress arrived. Noelle\u2019s mouth watered. Steaming plate after steaming plate was skidded across the table. Her stomach twisted with eagerness.</p><p>Her favorite development? The men stared at her food with absolute longing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask, because I\u2019m not sharing.\u201d Smug, she lifted a piece of extra crispy bacon, bit off the tip, and gave another of those moans, as if the cloned meat was the best thing she\u2019d ever tasted. Maybe it was. The flavors exploded on her tongue as she chewed.</p><p>\u201cNot nice,\u201d Hector growled, rubbing his arm more forcefully.</p> <p>Dallas reached out to confiscate a piece of toast, but she stabbed his hand with her fork in a lightning-fast motion he couldn\u2019t dodge.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m not sharing means I\u2019m not sharing.\u201d She signaled the waitress and said, \u201cMy friend would like a bowl of pretzels if you\u2019ve got them. Oh, and a bandage for his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can find.\u201d Off the waitress went again, returning a few minutes later with a bowl of crackers and a clean rag.</p><p>Dallas ignored the rag and munched on the saltines, glaring at Noelle the entire time.</p><p>Hector waved his fingers at her sausage. \u201cGive me the patties or walk home.\u201d</p><p>O-kay. Normally a guy making any kind of demand after semi-rejecting her\u2014more than once\u2014would have pissed her off. But ... that husky voice, paired with those glittering eyes, and the stubborn tilt of his chin, was just flat-out sexy. Wouldn\u2019t do to give in gracefully, though.</p><p>Forcing a put-on expression, she scooted the plate of patties his way, and said, \u201cOnly because I\u2019ve had my hand wrapped around your ...\u201d His eyes slitted and she smiled innocently ... \u201ctool kit.\u201d</p><p>Dallas looked between them.</p><p>Hector\u2019s pupils pulsed at that, but he said nothing else, just focused all of his intensity on the food.</p><p>\u201cMia will be ticked.\u201d Dallas worried two fingers over his stubbled jaw.</p><p>\u201cThat I didn\u2019t share my toast with you?\u201d Noelle shook her head as she shoveled in a bite of eggs, swallowed. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>The worrying paused for a moment. \u201cNo, moron, if the media learns Marks\u2019s identity before the family is notified.\u201d</p><p>He was lucky Ava wasn\u2019t here. The namecalling would have sent her friend into a red-hazed rage and when Ava raged, people required hospitalization. Or coffins. \u201cBut you guys still want his name kept out of the papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hector bit into the sausage with gusto.</p><p>\u201cME\u2019s report will hit our desks in the morning, and you can wait to notify Marks\u2019s mother until then,\u201d Dallas said, shifting the bowl of crackers back and forth between his hands. \u201cBut there\u2019ll be no keeping the details on lockdown after that.\u201d</p><p>Noelle noticed that while she called the victim by his first name, Hector and Dallas used his last. Their way of remaining distanced, she thought. Any other case, she probably would have done the same. But then, she\u2019d known Bobby before his murder.</p><p>\u201cWe still risk a leak beforehand.\u201d Reporters would be all over a rich man\u2019s death. Just like the vultures they were. While she could ensure information was filtered in the media outlets her family owned, she couldn\u2019t do a damn thing about the ones they didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m sure a press conference will even be called, and as the primary on this case, your face will be plastered on every TV screen in town,\u201d she said to Hector.</p><p>He cursed under his breath. \u201cI\u2019ll just say no comment and leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>Clearly the man had never dealt with a reporter determined to stake a flag in the cutthroat world of news. \u201cThe only way to keep them from running one story is to give them another. Something better. Hotter.\u201d</p><p>She polished off the rest of her food. Or rather, the portion Hector and Dallas left behind. As she ate, her hands busy, they threw what they could into their mouths, successfully managing to avoid a forking.</p><p>All the while they discussed false stories they could feed the media, and she listened, doing her best not to roll her eyes. Alien abductions and probings weren\u2019t exactly news anymore\u2014considering the aliens lived here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the story,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one will care about Bobby.\u201d And that was a shame. But an agent did whatever was necessary to solve her case. That had been drilled into her head since day one.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Hector demanded.</p><p>\u201cTrust me. I know how to manipulate the press.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Dallas insisted.</p><p>She would have preferred to make this call in private, but whatever. She lifted her cell and dialed her contact at What\u2019s Happening, New Chicago. After three rings, a too-perky female voice answered.</p><p>\u201cThis is Noelle Tremain,\u201d she said, and both Hector and Dallas leaned toward her, propping their elbows on the table. Dallas still looked a little shell-shocked and sickly, but Hector was all intent and emotionless again. That must be his default setting. \u201cYou know, the heiress. The adventurer. The YouTube sensation. You saw me smack that AIR agent around last year, right?\u201d</p><p>Yep. Default. His expression didn\u2019t change.</p><p>She wished she were better at reading him.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God! Elle! How are you, darling? I haven\u2019t heard from you in so long, I thought you\u2019d forgotten me.\u201d A pout. Faked, of course. Just like the news Marsha Tolle delivered.</p><p>Noelle and Ava had gone to high school with Marsha, and though the girl had thought her dreams of stardom made her better than everyone but Noelle, she\u2019d never said an unkind word about dirt-poor Ava. That\u2019s why, when she\u2019d phoned a few times last year hinting for invites to certain exclusive parties, Noelle had given them to her. Now Marsha owed her.</p><p>Time to collect.</p><p>\u201cAs if I could have forgotten you, sweetie.\u201d She used the bubble pop voice she usually reserved for the men in her family, all air, no substance. \u201cListen, I just found out the most amazing news, and I wanted my closest friends to be the first to know.\u201d</p><p>A gasp of pleasant surprise. \u201cI\u2019m so honored you thought of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d Noelle forced a giggle, her gaze locked on Hector. His lips were now twitching, and she decided she might not need an instruction manual to read him, after all. He enjoyed her grade A acting. \u201cSo get this. I still can\u2019t believe it myself, but oh, it\u2019s just so exciting, and I\u2019m shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s happened?\u201d Marsha couldn\u2019t keep the greed out of her tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant! And you know that football star, Corban Blue? He\u2019s the father!\u201d</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>EVERYTHING\u2019S CLEAR.\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s voice drifted from the upstairs of Noelle\u2019s home. Her heart drummed erratically as she navigated the foyer on shaky legs. She tried to concentrate on her surroundings rather than the gorgeous warrior she yearned to have in her bed. The floor was a lovely gold-veined marble, the wall tables carved from rich mahogany. Crystal vases and bowls rested on top and cast colorful flecks of light in every direction.</p><p>Still shaking, she climbed the winding staircase and walked the plush carpet of one of her many hallways, and entered her private wing.</p><p>She found him standing in the doorway of her bedroom, peering inside, as though frozen. His back was to her, but he sensed her and stiffened.</p><p>Brushing past him, she breathed in the scent of wild sky and clean laundry. After she\u2019d hung up with Marsha, he\u2019d driven her home. She hadn\u2019t been ready to part with him, so she\u2019d played the it\u2019s dark out, and I\u2019m afraid to go in alone card.</p><p>Whether he\u2019d believed her or not, he\u2019d checked every shadow, every closet for the bogeyman.</p><p>As she\u2019d waited for him to finish, her mind had replayed their earlier kiss and her blood had heated. He was here, in her home. They were utterly alone. The low simmer of arousal she\u2019d experienced all evening had exploded, demanding its due. Demanding satisfaction, no matter what he\u2019d said about being too dangerous, no matter that she\u2019d decided to think things through first.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t appear ready to leave ...</p><p>He leaned against the jamb, and stuffed his hands in his back pockets. He wasn\u2019t looking at her, was studying her bedroom. A single sweep of his gaze, and he had memorized every detail, she would bet.</p><p>What did he think of the large, canopied bed, with the ice-blue silk draping the sides? Too girly? What did he think of the matching curtains, the fabric so sheer, so delicate, the golden rays of the sun seeped through the window every morning, haloing every inch with rings of shimmering fire? Too romantic?</p><p>He probably liked the stone hearth, with two thickly cushioned chairs in front of it, a small, round table between them. And the books ... maybe. They were the real thing, with paper pages, and colorful covers, not the electronic pads. The books were old, some of them brittle, but she couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, part with them. Before Ava, those books had been her favorite, and often only, companions.</p><p>Noelle pictured Hector standing on her balcony, her garden surrounding him as he smoked a cigar. She\u2019d never seen him smoke a cigar before, but whatever. She pictured him bathing in her natural spring, even crooking his finger at her, silently demanding she join him.</p><p>The water remained warm year round, always bubbling, always whirling. Even now, steam curled from the surface, winding through the air like ivy, clinging to the ceiling. Beyond that was her bathroom, complete with an enzyme shower, as well as a real water shower, a vanity mirror and chair, and a black and gold granite countertop.</p><p>Was Hector surprised by the elegance? Had he envisioned something more hedonistic? Something more exclusive? This wasn\u2019t the choicest location in the city, but it was close to Ava. To Noelle, that made it the best.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, turning to face him, splaying her arms. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this is where God would move if he could afford it.\u201d</p><p>As tall and thickly muscled as Hector was, encircled by such delicate, expensive things, he should have looked out of place. Plus, his dress shirt was wrinkled, and there was a dirt smudge on his pants. Dried mud caked the bottom of his shoes. But out of place? No. He was wild and wicked, the dark knight willing to do anything to slay his damsel\u2019s dragons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And those tattoos of his ... How had she dismissed them so easily after their first meeting? How had she never considered such markings attractive until him? Because damn. They were little roadways for her tongue to follow, swirling and dipping, up and down, tempting, luring.</p><p>A shiver slid down her spine. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d</p><p>A shadow of amusement before those amber eyes frosted over, an ice storm churning inside them. The change was reminiscent of his last rejection of her, and she braced herself for another.</p> <p>\u201cI should go,\u201d he said, but didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cOr you could stay.\u201d She\u2019d wondered what she would risk to be with him. Right now the word \u201canything\u201d popped in her mind.</p><p>He drew in a breath. \u201cWhat is it you want from me, Noelle?\u201d</p><p>His secrets, his body, and his slavish devotion. For starters. Things he wasn\u2019t yet ready to hear. \u201cI want you to have dinner with me tomorrow tonight.\u201d Innocent, easy.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I told you I was dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but I still want you.\u201d Putting yourself out there again, girlie. Probably not wise.</p><p>I know. And she would have backed off if he hadn\u2019t shown her that glimpse of jealousy earlier. If he hadn\u2019t looked at her as if he wanted to eat her rather than the food. If he hadn\u2019t searched her home so diligently and eyed her bed so hungrily.</p><p>Even though the frost melted, the storm remained, turbulent and troubled. \u201cThat\u2019s a very bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, all the fun things are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about this? I promise not to fuck you on the table, and you promise to enjoy yourself anyway.\u201d Role reversal. A direct hit every time. Not to mention the fact that she\u2019d just insulted his masculine pride.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snapped. \u201cDinner. Together. Tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour enthusiasm is heartwarming. Truly.\u201d She didn\u2019t change course, though. Dinner wasn\u2019t meant to romance him, wasn\u2019t even meant to relax him. Though that would happen, too. Hopefully. Dinner was simply her way of learning about him.</p><p>Why he used hookers\u2014and when he\u2019d last screwed one. Why he refused to date. Why he thought he was too dangerous for Noelle to kiss. What, exactly, he craved doing to her.</p><p>Hector scrubbed a hand through his hair, an action she figured was habit. From nerves? Or desire? Please be desire. She studied his face. The hard pinch of his lips, the slits of his eyes. Desire, yes, but he was still fighting it.</p><p>Noelle closed the distance between them. He straightened from the jamb, stiffened, but he didn\u2019t try to prolong the separation. Practically purring, she placed her hands on those wide, strong shoulders.</p><p>His nostrils flared as he breathed. Deeply, harshly. \u201cWhat are you doing, Noelle?\u201d</p><p>Another step closer brought her breasts into contact with his chest. Immediately her nipples budded, rasping against his shirt just the way she liked. \u201cI\u2019m having a very stimulating conversation with you.\u201d</p><p>His muscles twitched underneath her palms, heat radiating from him in a continuous stream. \u201cTalk to me from across the room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Do I bother you when I\u2019m this close to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to brace himself for ... something. Rejection, perhaps. \u201cI told you I only ... mess around with hookers. You shouldn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do.\u201d</p><p>A low growl rumbled from him. \u201cI kissed you and told you we could never do anything like that again, that I\u2019m too dangerous for you. You really shouldn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAnd you want me. You were hard for me before, and you can\u2019t deny it.\u201d She arched forward, brushing against that delicious place between his legs. \u201cYou\u2019re hard for me now.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. \u201cI ... I ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, and don\u2019t run from me. You hurt my feelings when you do.\u201d</p><p>He softened, but only slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me why you only mess around with hookers, and why you are too dangerous to be with me. And what does mess around mean?\u201d</p><p>They stood like that, touching, but not doing what they both wanted\u2014grinding\u2014for several long, silent minutes. His scent thickened around her, enveloped her, became a part of her, the heat of him intensifying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about it,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cDo it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I never talk about it.\u201d</p><p>And yet he had with her. Before, at camp, and then again today. \u201cDo it anyway,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou almost did at the church. You almost did in the car.\u201d</p><p>His teeth gnashed together. \u201cBoth times, I stopped myself. I don\u2019t trust you enough.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. There was no arguing with that. Still, male pride might once again come to her rescue. \u201cDo you like to do kinky, embarrassing things, and that\u2019s why you won\u2019t be with a girl like me?\u201d She\u2019d meant to sound flippant, or even suggestive, but the pain just kind of seeped out of her.</p><p>A girl like me. Never good enough.</p><p>Sheer, absolute longing painted the harshness of his features. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019d be happy with straight-up missionary with you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened with surprise. The way he\u2019d said \u201cmissionary,\u201d as if he\u2019d never wanted anything more, well, she nearly stripped then and there. Permission first, then the shedding of clothing.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t be a pussy,\u201d she said to goad him. \u201cDo something with me.\u201d</p><p>He was the one to step closer this time, and there was so much menace in his eyes she found herself backing away, despite the intensity of her desire for him. But he kept coming, until her knees hit the back of the bed and she fell to the mattress. His legs imprisoned her knees, halting any retreat she might have made.</p><p>\u201cSomething?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? Help ... me.\u201d</p><p>With pleasure. She grabbed his hips and pulled. He fell forward as she fell the rest of the way back. He managed to catch himself before their bodies aligned, straddling her waist, glaring down at her. He was harder than before, his erection straining the fly of his pants.</p><p>Moisture pooled between her legs, making her desperate for his touch, his tongue. Something, anything. Little aches arced through her bloodstream, razing her cells, making them clamor for contact, too. She drew two fingers down the buttons of his shirt, popping them and causing the material to gape open.</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d he rasped, bracing his arms as if he meant to push away. \u201cI remember when you told me that you\u2019d called dibs on Dallas.\u201d</p><p>Bothered by the idea? God, she hoped so. \u201cFirst, I might have called dibs, but I never actually wanted him. Second, I do want to sleep with you.\u201d More than I\u2019ve ever wanted anything. \u201cBut you have to give me something, Hector. Please. Info or another kiss. Gentleman\u2019s choice.\u201d</p><p>She traced her fingers along the ridges of his stomach, then circled his nipples. He sucked in a breath\u2014but didn\u2019t tell her to stop.</p><p>He leaned down, nipped at her lower lip. God, she loved when he did that.</p><p>\u201cTo save you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere. That\u2019s an answer, a bit of the information you demanded. I stopped kissing you to save you.\u201d</p><p>Just a nip, but she tasted him. Sweet, minty, drugging. She let her fingers fall ... fall ... and cup his erection, rubbing up and down, and sweet merciful heaven. He was the stuff of fantasies. \u201cFrom?\u201d</p><p>Growls began to erupt from his throat. His hips moved with her hand, jerky thrusts that deepened the contact.</p><p>\u201cYou picked information. You can\u2019t stop there,\u201d she said. \u201cTrust me. I won\u2019t betray you, and I\u2019ll even share a secret about myself.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. A moment passed while he caught his breath. \u201cIf I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think you decided to give me a kiss instead. I\u2019ll keep throwing myself at you. I\u2019ll even up my game. And if you think I was shameless before, get ready. Flashing? Old news. Innuendos? Nothing. I\u2019ll show up on your doorstep naked, and that\u2019ll just be the appetizer.\u201d</p><p>Bargaining?</p><p>Well, she knew how to buy and how to take. With Ava, she knew how to give. Time, affection, anything and everything, because Ava gave so freely to her. But this thing with Hector was uncharted territory. What she wanted couldn\u2019t be bought or taken. And she found that she didn\u2019t want him that way, anyway. She craved his willingness.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. Not in a way you\u2019ll believe. I\u2019ll have to show you,\u201d he said, his timbre guttural, gravelly.</p><p>Triumphant heat shimmered through her.</p><p>Quickly, as if he feared talking himself out of his actions, he removed his shirt the rest of the way, then extended his arms above her. He was still without gloves, and she could see that the strange light glowed from his shoulders to fingertips. Brighter and brighter, until she could no longer see his skin. Or his muscles and bones. Just particles, floating in the air, like a thousand little sparks that conformed to the same shape as his limbs. A morbidly beautiful, hauntingly lovely sight.</p><p>She\u2019d known he sometimes glowed, but hadn\u2019t figured out why or how and never would have guessed this. Dazed, she reached out to touch. He jerked both arms higher in the air, preventing contact. The glow faded ... disappeared, his skin returning to its natural burnished tan, though some of his tattoos were now gone. Both arms fell to his sides.</p><p>Sweat beaded on his brow, and the mix of emotion in his eyes startled her. She saw fear, anger, hope, and grim expectation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever touch me when I\u2019m like that,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI could burn you, scar you. I could punch through your body and rip out your heart in less than a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector, I\u2014\u201d Didn\u2019t know what to say. She\u2019d never seen anything like that. Never heard of anything like that. Not among humans, and not among the alien races.</p><p>The grim expectation won the fight for dominance and now painted each of his features. \u201cDo you understand why I can\u2019t let myself have you? I can force my arms to atomize, yes, but sometimes, most times, they atomize on their own.\u201d</p><p>She gulped, experienced a wave of fear. Atomizing unbidden. Like the times they\u2019d kissed, when he\u2019d burned through metal.</p><p>At the time, she\u2019d been in tremendous danger, just as he\u2019d said, but she hadn\u2019t even suspected. He had, though. He had known and he had feared, and that\u2019s why he\u2019d left her.</p><p>What would have happened if he\u2019d accidentally touched her, even in the slightest way? She wouldn\u2019t have felt the pain, might have even prolonged the contact, and she would have been severely injured. \u201cWhen does it happen on its own?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m aroused. When I\u2019m frustrated. When I\u2019m pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve hurt people before?\u201d she asked, gentle now, so gentle. \u201cUnintentionally?\u201d</p><p>A hard nod as he leaned his weight into her and carefully, oh, so carefully, braced his hands beside her temples. Close, though not daring to brush against her. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to you. A few times, I did it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>She wondered who he\u2019d harmed\u2014killed?\u2014and why, but she wouldn\u2019t ask. Not yet. She didn\u2019t want such lethal memories to intrude on this moment. He was finally opening up, sharing, giving her a chance to prove herself worthy of his trust. So push for too much too soon? No.</p><p>Her mind caught on three little words. Prove herself worthy. This time, though, she was glad to do so. This was difficult for him, a huge step. She owed him the best she had to give.</p><p>\u201cWhy are your arms like that?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>Some of the stiffness melted from his shoulders. \u201cI was born that way, I guess. First time I remember hurting someone with them, I was eight.\u201d</p><p>Eight. So young. So sweet and innocent. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The price tag on such a lethal ability must be unbearable, and yet he soldiered on. The mental and emotional strength he must possess ...</p><p>She thought back. She\u2019d never seen him touch anyone casually. Sometimes he handled suspects, but never for long. For the most part, he kept to himself. Perhaps he was as lonely as she often was.</p><p>He nodded to acknowledge he\u2019d heard her. \u201cI ... care about you, Noelle. I don\u2019t like the thought of you in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good because I can\u2019t feel any. Pain, I mean. I don\u2019t have any working receptors,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s my secret. That my father paid to have them fried.\u201d</p><p>A burst of confusion in his eyes, then anger. \u201cYou were altered?\u201d he demanded. \u201cSurgically? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case I was kidnapped again.\u201d</p><p>A cold wash of horror. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d trusted her; now she would trust him. As promised. \u201cYes. Again. For ransom. The kidnappers told my father they\u2019d kill me if he went to the police or if the media found out, but that wasn\u2019t why he kept things quiet. If no one knew, no one would miss the men responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>\u201cMy dad paid good money for my release, but by then, I\u2019d been a captive for three days and two nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had just turned twelve. Anyway, to get their point across, the kidnappers hurt me, on camera, and sent the videos to my father. A new video each day. They made the mistake of thinking him a simple businessman. Truth was, he\u2019d worked for the shadier side of the government most of his life, as only a rich man can. He had connections and resources and in the end was able to travel all over the world without suspicion and do terrible things with no one the wiser.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>After he\u2019d gotten Noelle back, he\u2019d savagely killed the men who\u2019d held her.</p><p>Only then, in an effort to be proactive, had he had his doctors screw with her nerve endings. That had hurt far worse than any torturing the kidnappers had done. So no, nothing Hector could do would cause her a moment of pain.</p> <p>\u201cYour dad loved you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sadness flickered in her chest. \u201cHe loved the idea of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She wiggled against him, her hunger for him returning full force. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the good stuff.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou may not feel the pain, sweetheart, but I could still do some damage.\u201d Comprehension blazed with lightning sharpness. \u201cAnd now I realize you wouldn\u2019t know if I was causing damage until it was too late. We should stop,\u201d he added. \u201cBefore this goes any further.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Like a dog that refused to relinquish her new chew toy, she dug her claws into his chest. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to, I do. I like spending time with you\u2014when I\u2019m not battling rampant lust for you. God knows, I want you all the damn time. And I care about you, like I said, but I will not hurt you. I won\u2019t let myself.\u201d</p><p>He more than craved her. He cared about her.</p><p>He liked spending time with her.</p><p>The knowledge affected her. Deeply. How strong he was, to resist his own needs. How sweet he was, to protect others from what he could do. But she felt the same about him\u2014she cared, she liked\u2014and she wasn\u2019t going to let him shove her aside and keep her at a distance. Even though she was now scared, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat about tying you up?\u201d she asked. Anything. She would try anything to be with him. And a little bondage? Nice.</p> <p>Shock flared in his eyes, that she so easily accepted, but it quickly dissolved in the face of regret. \u201cI burn through rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelt them.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. \u201cWhat do you do with the hookers?\u201d</p><p>A blaze of shame. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p><p>Did he think her desire for him would wane? \u201cTell me anyway. You know I\u2019ll press until you do.\u201d His expression remained stubborn; so, once again she pricked at his pride. \u201cRemove your tampon and tell me, Hector. I\u2019ve pursued you, I\u2019ve won you, and now I deserve to know.\u201d</p><p>He snapped his teeth at her, reminding her of the times he\u2019d bitten her. \u201cThey get on their knees and blow me,\u201d he snarled. \u201cHappy now? Last time was over a year ago. And before you ask, I\u2019m not letting you do that to me.\u201d</p><p>Over a year ago. So telling, whether he meant it to be or not. Tenderness filled her. She thought for a moment. Then she said, \u201cAll right. So you won\u2019t let me blow you. What will you let me do to you, Hector? Because you\u2019re not leaving this room until we\u2019re both sated.\u201d</p> <p>Twenty-two</p><p>HECTOR PEERED DOWN AT the woman splayed underneath him, the woman studying him with an intensity and longing that floored him. She was addictive in so many ways. Her ever-changing scent\u2014now jasmine and honey. Her always decadent taste\u2014sugar and spice. But this ... this was where the true danger lay. The way she looked at him. As if he were beautiful. As if he were strong, valiant, sexy ... worthy.</p><p>When compared to her, he was none of those things. Hell, when compared to a piece of lint, he was none of those things. The fact that he and Noelle were so damn different hadn\u2019t changed. She was energy, a kaleidoscope of colors. He was linear, a bold black and white.</p><p>Yet, throughout their sexually charged conversation, she hadn\u2019t seemed to notice, or maybe she just hadn\u2019t cared, that he belonged in a different world. Desire had\u2014and did\u2014thrum from her in sultry waves, increasing his own.</p><p>And now he knew they had something in common. A shitty childhood. Once Hector had assumed she\u2019d never known pain or suffering. Stupid of him. She\u2019d been kidnapped, tortured, then tortured again when she returned home. This beautiful, sexy creature had been made to scream with something other than pleasure. Never fucking again, he vowed. He would guard her, from afar if necessary.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want me?\u201d he asked, truly confused. He was a bad bet, no matter from what angle she studied this. And he knew she wasn\u2019t just leading him on or hoping for a temporary distraction. She could find that anywhere, with anyone, with a lot more ease and zero threat. Example: Dallas.</p><p>The thought alone nearly caused Hector to rip the silk covers at her temples into shreds.</p><p>\u201cYou fascinate me,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Slowly he relaxed. On that front, at least, they were even. No one had ever fascinated him more than this\u2014what had he once called her?\u2014slice of elegance.</p><p>\u201cYour intensity ... I wonder, all the time, what it will be like, having every bit of it focused on me.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity too, then. How disappointing. Enough to make him walk away, though? No. Just then, he doubted anything could. She was soft beneath him, and though only their legs were touching, he could feel the heat of her. Could she feel the heat of him?</p><p>\u201cI never noticed this until today, but your face displays every emotion you\u2019re feeling, in the minutest degree,\u201d she said. \u201cDisenchantment, anger, arousal. I don\u2019t know why you felt the first two a moment ago, but I want you to listen to me. I\u2019ve only had one serious boyfriend in my life, and only two sexual partners. One of which doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarry,\u201d he said, still offended on her behalf. How dare anyone treat her like that prick had? \u201cI\u2019m putting the guy in ICU as soon as tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her lids went to half-mast, the gray of her eyes softening to a smoky silvery-blue. \u201cI think you\u2019re a better gift giver than Ava, and she\u2019s a master. But the point is, I\u2019m choosy, and I don\u2019t screw around for fun. Wait. I do screw around for fun, but it\u2019s also for keeps.\u201d</p><p>Two men. At last those words sank in, and grew roots. Only two. And she wanted him to be number three. He was baffled, humbled. And yeah, aroused. So damn aroused. The length of her glossy hair spilled around her head, her seemingly delicate shoulders. Her cheeks were flushed a lovely rose, and her lips were plump and parted, her every breath shallow and laced with need.</p><p>No matter how strong and valid his fears, he couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, spit on her gift to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve, uh, never had sex,\u201d he admitted. \u201cNever been with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Those exquisite eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re a virgin?\u201d</p><p>A stiff nod, cheeks flushing.</p><p>\u201cBecause of your arms?\u201d</p><p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cOh, Hector.\u201d A moan of excitement. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I like that. Want to be the first.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down ... down ... until her nipples were pushed against his chest, needy little peaks that enthralled him. She wigged until her thighs were outside his, trembling, locking around his hips. Damn, but she felt good.</p><p>\u201cI told you. I don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d he croaked out.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going to have to give me everything you can.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t much, but damn if he wouldn\u2019t do everything in his power to make every second they spent in this bed the best of her life.</p><p>And there was the voice of temptation, luring him into danger.</p><p>Can\u2019t resist. \u201cI\u2019ll make you come without using my hands.\u201d He\u2019d never tried that with anyone, but with her ... \u201cDo you want me to make you come?\u201d</p><p>White teeth nibbled on her bottom lip, plumping and reddening the luscious petal further. Undoing him. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just tell me how, then, and it\u2019s done.\u201d Whatever she suggested, he would try. He had very little experience with a woman\u2019s pleasure, but damn it, he would try. He desired her, had dreamed of her too many nights, had fantasized so many times reality was now blurred.</p><p>If, at any point, the burning and itching flared up in his arms, he would stop.</p><p>Stopping would probably kill him, but he would do it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with something small, easy. Like a kiss. Yes. Kiss me,\u201d she pleaded, breathless. \u201cWe\u2019ve done that before, and nothing bad happened. Right?\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to her mouth. Her tongue swept over her lips, leaving a gloss of moisture. His cock twitched, a lance of need shooting through him. Any minute now, and his zipper would bust, he was so full and hard.</p><p>He scooted off her, off the bed, and stood at the edge. She remained splayed on the mattress, her hair spilled around her, and her dress bunched just under her waist, hiding her panties. Fucking gorgeous. \u201cSit up for me,\u201d he croaked. Things were less likely to fly out of control that way.</p><p>Still trembling, she pulled herself up, hair cascading into place. What he would have given to run his fingers through the strands. He knelt in front of her, placing himself a little lower than eye level.</p><p>\u201cIf I burn you, scare you, do anything you don\u2019t like, tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d A feverish sigh.</p><p>Whether she would actually do so or not, he didn\u2019t know. He wouldn\u2019t risk her safety, though, not in any way, so he would remain vigilant. He would fuel her passion without becoming lost in his own. Something he\u2019d never done. But for her ... anything.</p><p>\u201cHector.\u201d She leaned into him and pressed their lips together. Her tongue swept inside his mouth, her intoxicating flavor exploding through him. As sweet as before, with a splash of something darker, richer.</p><p>Don\u2019t touch her. Don\u2019t you dare touch her. Or explore her curves, or knead her breasts, or finger her deep and hard. He\u2019d probably come if he did. He\u2019d never dared to thrust his fingers inside a woman, but he knew this one would be hot and wet, clutching at him.</p><p>\u201cI want to put my arms around you,\u201d she breathed. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d God, yes. He placed his hands on his thighs, his fingers hooked over the curves of his knees. \u201cAround my neck, but don\u2019t touch below my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>She scooted closer, placing her ass at the edge of the mattress while framing his torso with her legs. She danced her fingers across the spikes of his growing hair before sliding down to ride the ridges of his spine.</p><p>\u201cNow. Kiss me now, and don\u2019t ever stop,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Their tongues met, mated, rolling together, darting apart, finding each other again, dueling. She moaned, and he swallowed the sound. Her nails bit into his shoulders, perhaps even making him bleed. He liked the thought.</p><p>In a snap, the burning and itching in his arms started up, but only slightly. He disengaged only long enough to check them out. There was a muted glow seeping from his pores, but nothing to worry about. Yet.</p><p>And for the first time, he didn\u2019t have to worry about the woman he was with seeing what happened to him. She\u2019d already seen. She knew the truth. And she hadn\u2019t judged him. She hadn\u2019t screeched in fear, hadn\u2019t pushed him away or commanded him to leave her home. All the things he\u2019d always nervously and angrily presumed. She\u2019d simply questioned him, doing her best to find a way for them to be together.</p><p>\u201cHector, I want more. Please.\u201d</p><p>Please. As if she needed to beg him. But he realized he had stopped to stare up at her, wonder radiating from him. This strong, brave female with a taste for luxury wasn\u2019t afraid of him. Wasn\u2019t disgusted by him.</p><p>If things proved too treacherous and he couldn\u2019t allow himself to come, too, he would still do everything in his power to bring about her release. But what could he do to her that did not involve his hands? He could think of a few things ...</p><p>His heated gaze skated over her, locked on her deliciously hard nipples. Moisture flooded his mouth. \u201cTake off your dress.\u201d</p><p>Without protest, she whipped the material over her head. Her breasts were hugged by a crimson bra that sparkled in the light. She wore matching panties that hugged the sweetest female body in existence.</p><p>\u201cUnhook the clasp.\u201d His tongue was so thick, he barely got the words out.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her trembling increased, making her clumsy.</p><p>When the bra at last sagged open, freeing those lush morsels from their prison, revealing her berry-pink nipples, he leaned forward, as if in a trance. He flicked one with his tongue, then fit his mouth around it and sucked. Her hands once again made their way around him, holding him close ... closer.</p><p>There was no woman more perfect. Lust incarnate, that\u2019s what Noelle was, her groans swiftly becoming cries. He\u2019d begun the day desperate to avoid her, yet now he was desperate to have her.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you, too,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He switched his attention to her other nipple, paying it the same homage, worshipping with his tongue, his teeth. Twice he found himself reaching up, his hands curving to fit against the plump mounds of her breasts, but both times he caught himself in time.</p><p>\u201cWant to touch you, too.\u201d A needy whimper from her.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d A groan. The burning climbed another degree, and soon thin plumes of dark smoke were curling from them, wafting to his nose. Shit. Fuck. Not here, not now. He pulled away from Noelle, stood. Shit, he raged again, even as he pulled the gloves from his pocket and slid them in place.</p><p>Noelle\u2019s moan of disappointment echoed from the walls, and he had to brace herself against the bed to remain upright. \u201cAre we... done?\u201d</p><p>Never had a woman looked sexier while pouting. \u201cNo.\u201d Please, no. \u201cCan you stand?\u201d he asked, his voice so guttural and raw he was almost embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d She pushed to her feet, wavered as a tremor racked her entire body, but she didn\u2019t fall. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wanted her better than good. \u201cTake off your panties.\u201d</p><p>Her pupils gobbled up her irises as she obeyed. \u201cSo forceful. I like you this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeapons, too.\u201d She had blades strapped to her thighs. She also sported an ankle holster, and the weapon inside did not appear to be a regulation pyregun. What it was, though, he couldn\u2019t tell.</p> <p>Within seconds, she was completely naked. And fuck. He could blow his load just looking at her. Those more-than-a-handful breasts, that slightly concave stomach, those wonderfully toned legs.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you now,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAll of you. You promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could ... hoped ... but I can\u2019t. If I take off my pants, I\u2019ll be inside you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze zeroed in on his zipper, her tongue peeking out to lick her lips. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>In a lot of ways, yes, but rather than ruin the moment and explain, he said, \u201cLay down, Noelle. Please. And keep your ass at the edge of the mattress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour kinkiness is a very nice surprise, too,\u201d she said as she complied. Her legs were closed and now dangled over the side of the bed, shielding her feminine core from his view.</p><p>Once again he fell to his knees. \u201cPut your feet on my shoulders, as close to my face as you can get them.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence, of inactivity. Then, \u201cWh\u2014what are you going to do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to eat you up.\u201d Exactly as he\u2019d dreamed of doing for months. In fact, a few mornings he\u2019d even woken up already seconds away from release, because he\u2019d devoured her in his dreams.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she gasped out, and he knew his crudeness had ramped up her arousal.</p><p>First one leg, then the other, and then her feet were in place, anchored on his shoulders, and her knees open, his gaze enraptured by the new center of his world. The sweetness of her feminine musk drifted to his nose, and he breathed deeply, savoring. She was pink and wet, and so pretty he wanted to move in and stay forever.</p> <p>Only a thin strip of hair covered her, like a treasure map to her core. And he\u2019d thought her pout sexy. This was the sexiest fucking thing he\u2019d ever seen. He leaned in ... closer ... closer still ... He\u2019d never done this before and didn\u2019t want to mess up. Wanted to do it right, make it good for her.</p><p>No, he reminded himself. Better than good.</p><p>The savageness of his instincts wouldn\u2019t allow him to hesitate for long. Desperate to taste her, he licked his way to the treasure in question, the sweetest honey filling his mouth. A scream tore from her throat as her hips shot off the mattress. She liked, then. Well, he loved. And with a groan of pleasure, he buried his face and did as he\u2019d promised.</p><p>He licked and he sucked and he nibbled. He consumed. She writhed. She gasped his name. She begged. She pleaded. She cursed him. She prayed for mercy. He never stopped, could never have stopped. This was heaven, pure and simple.</p><p>Again he found himself reaching for her, his fingers wanting inside her so badly they ached with the same raging desire as his cock. Again he caught himself just in time. Mine, mine, mine. All mine. Will protect, even from myself.</p><p>\u201cHector!\u201d Her legs fell from his shoulders, and she jerked upright, but her hands never stopped clutching his scalp, holding him to her, and he never stopped enjoying her.</p><p>He licked his way to her clit, and sucked. Hard. So hard. His name on her lips was as addictive as everything else about her, and he was determined to draw it out of her again and again.</p><p>\u201cHector, oh, God, Hector I\u2019m so close. I\u2019m almost there ... I\u2019m ... oh, God! There!\u201d</p> <p>Another scream ripped from her, her body convulsing, her grip tightening on him, probably leaving bruises. Bruises he\u2019d wear with pride. He\u2019d done this. He\u2019d pleasured her, given her this, made her lose control. Her inner walls clenched around his tongue, a tongue he darted in and out, in and out, fucking her that way since he couldn\u2019t fuck her the other. All that delicious honey flowed down his throat, burned him alive and created a new creature.</p><p>Her slave.</p><p>Panting, she collapsed against the mattress in a boneless heap. He pulled back, but only slightly, and licked at his mouth, wanting every drop of her he could get.</p><p>He slid the edge of both his gloves back. His arms were shaking, still glowing, a little more than before, and more of the ink had faded. There were a few holes singed into the material, and those holes still released thin curls of smoke.</p><p>But. He hadn\u2019t burned anything down, and he hadn\u2019t hurt Noelle. So he would consider this a success.</p><p>He stood, his knees practically giving out. \u201cWhere\u2019s your bathroom?\u201d Ragged breath in, ragged breath out. He needed a moment\u2014or ten\u2014to himself. To calm, to cool down. To finish himself so that he was no longer a menace. For the moment, at least.</p><p>As quickly as she\u2019d fallen, she sat back up. Her gaze found his, and despite the languid satisfaction of her expression, she still bore signs of arousal. Heavy lids, an inability to steady her oxygen intake. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He blinked down at her. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t tell me? Or no, I can\u2019t use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not leaving me and taking care of that on your own.\u201d At \u201cthat,\u201d she motioned to his straining cock.</p><p>Torturing him ... \u201cSafer that way.\u201d The urge to do more to her, to have more of her ... can\u2019t, you can\u2019t.</p><p>Her lashes fused together, hiding the perilous glitter of her eyes. Without another word, she reached out, unbuttoned and unzipped him, then jerked his underwear out of the way. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to deny me this. And you\u2019re not going to give it to someone else, even if that someone is yourself. It\u2019s mine. I earned it.\u201d</p><p>Hers. Fuck, but he\u2019d never heard a more arousing speech. His cock sprang free, the tip already weeping. He should have moved away from her. Instead, he whipped his arms behind his back. He didn\u2019t have to ask what she was doing. He knew, and he craved. He was ashamed of himself, but yeah, he craved.</p><p>She wrapped her fingers around the shaft, seeming to marvel that the tips couldn\u2019t close. \u201cYou said before that you won\u2019t let me blow you. Is your answer still no, even if I\u2019m dying to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d he gritted. To have a woman willingly taste him ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes. Please do it.\u201d</p><p>Good, because that\u2019s how he\u2019d meant it.</p><p>She turned them both so that he was the one propped against the mattress and dropped to her knees. Then she fit her lips around the head of his cock, the wet heat of her scorching him perfectly. Down, down she slid on him, her teeth scraping him, until his length hit the back of her throat.</p><p>So good, so damn good. The shame vanished, and no guilt pierced him. Just the sweetest pleasure.</p><p>Never before like this. Sweat broke out in beads over his skin, his veins expanding to contain the ferocity of his arousal.</p><p>The urge to hold her, to guide her, was almost too much for him. So he moved his hands up, curling his fingers behind his neck, forming claws and locking down. Careful, he had to be careful. Already his forearms were hot enough to blister. Still he didn\u2019t tell her to stop.</p><p>He\u2019d already lost that battle.</p><p>Up and down, up and down, she ate at him, swallowing the pre-come still leaking from him, humming as if she loved the taste. One of her hands played with his testicles, tugged on them.</p><p>He was so used to forcing himself to come as quickly as possible, he currently lacked stamina. And the fact that it was Noelle between his legs, Noelle sucking his cock, Noelle driving him to the brink, Noelle\u2019s taste still in his mouth, down his throat, he wouldn\u2019t have lasted anyway.</p><p>He\u2019d never in his life been so turned on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ... if you don\u2019t pull away ... you\u2019ll ...\u201d No one had ever swallowed him. Always he\u2019d come in a condom, or told the woman to move away so he could shoot on the floor.</p><p>Noelle increased the speed of her strokes, the ferociousness of her suction, until he forgot his hands, forgot his ability, the problems, complications, reasons they should stay away from each other and exploded, jetting into her mouth.</p><p>He roared like an animal, out of control, utterly lost, never wanting to be found. The pleasure ... too much, soul-changing, everlasting. Every muscle he possessed clenched, knotted. And he just kept coming and coming, and she just kept swallowing every drop.</p><p>Afterward, as he lay there, fighting for breath, she crouched beside him, careful not to touch him, and met his gaze. Her cheeks were flushed. She was panting, licking her lips as if she\u2019d enjoyed him with the same intensity he\u2019d enjoyed her.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He nodded, unsure he could find his voice. His arms had stopped glowing, but though they had immediately cooled down with his release, they were still too hot to be handling her.</p><p>A slow smile spread across those swollen bedroom lips. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll do this again?\u201d</p><p>Another nod, a little wary, a lot shocked. She wanted more of him? After all the work she\u2019d had to do, she hadn\u2019t decided he was just a one-time thing?</p><p>The smile grew, became dazzling, more wicked than sensual. There were so many facets to her personality, he thought. The playful little girl, the vicious revenge-hungry woman. The seductress, the innocent. The giver, the taker. The game-player.</p><p>He wanted to fuck them all.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, purring like a contented kitten. \u201cBecause now I know what we\u2019re having for dinner tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>HE WAS A BASTARD, Hector thought the next morning.</p><p>He should have phoned Noelle. Picked her up. They should have driven to Bobby Marks\u2019s house together. Instead, he now climbed the steps to Marks\u2019s front door on his own.</p><p>Hector had ditched her.</p><p>After last night, he just wasn\u2019t ready to see her. Even the thought of her fired him up, distracting him. And now that he knew the honey that awaited him between her legs, how the hell was he supposed to work a case with her at his side and not toss her down and ravage her every other minute?</p><p>He\u2019d call her later. Apologize. Maybe she\u2019d forgive him, maybe she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>If she decided to end this thing between them, he\u2019d be better off. She would be better off.</p><p>His hands fisted, and rage sparked inside his chest. Can\u2019t lose her.</p><p>You will eventually.</p><p>Those sparks heated.</p><p>Concentrate. He jerked on his gloves and rang the doorbell. He\u2019d once again tried calling Brenda Marks, Bobby\u2019s mother, who lived a few houses down. No luck. When he finished here, he planned to go there. So far, Noelle\u2019s pregnancy story had overshadowed everything else, as hoped.</p><p>Noelle ... pregnant ...</p><p>Fucking concentrate.</p><p>Hector waited, expecting a servant. No one came to the door, so he rang again. The sky was cloudy, gray, a storm brewing. He felt as if he were being watched, but found no evidence of cameras, no one peeking from slits in the blinds.</p><p>He waited a few more minutes, then looked around. A Mercedes meandered along the street. Across the way, a human male\u2014tall, lean, dark hair, handsome, probably some rich woman\u2019s boy toy\u2014walked a shaggy white dog, paying Hector no attention.</p><p>There were four other homes around this one, each one bigger than the last. Lots of white marble, luscious trees, and colorful arrays of flowers. Again, no one watched him from the windows.</p><p>An iron gate surrounded each as well. Even this one. Bypassing Marks\u2019s gate had been difficult\u2014his was more advanced than most\u2014but not impossible. As Hector\u2019s presence at the door had proven.</p><p>This was the kind of neighborhood Hector had assumed Noelle would live in. While she\u2019d renovated her place, she wasn\u2019t situated in the best part of town. But then, she was only ten minutes away from Ava\u2019s apartment, so ... there you go. He liked that about her. Her sense of loyalty.</p><p>That\u2019s why he\u2019d finally decided to trust her, to tell her the truth about his arms. Once, he\u2019d thought a man would never know where he stood with her. She enjoyed her storytelling a little too much. Not to mention her silly-girl fa\u00e7ade. But Hector was beginning to understand her.</p><p>You could always tell with her. She\u2019d said she had only just noticed that he carried his emotions in his eyes. Well, the same was true for him and her eyes. You looked deep enough, and you saw how much need and vulnerability those silver irises radiated. And when she smiled wickedly, you were in trouble. But when she smiled sweetly, something he\u2019d only ever seen her do for Ava\u2014and now him\u2014her faithfulness had no boundaries.</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t need another reminder to CONCENTRATE. Mad at himself, Hector carried his tools to the garage door around the way and hacked through the security system. Living on the streets finally paying off, he mused.</p><p>The door lifted slowly but steadily, revealing a black BMW, the windows tinted so darkly no one would be able to see anyone inside at any time, and a silver Viper. There was also a golf cart and a four-wheeler.</p><p>What were you trying to blow the lid on, Marks? Hector wondered.</p><p>Inside the house, he found reinforced steel walls painted to look like stucco. The kitchen was clean, nothing out of place. The living room, also pristine. The office, emptied out. There were no computers. No electronic files. There was a desk and a file cabinet, but nothing inside either of them.</p><p>Had Marks cleaned up\u2014or had someone else? Someone wanting to keep that lid sealed on certain information? Hector did a print sweep, but found only Marks\u2019s. He was about to head out to search the rest of the home when he felt the tile beneath his boot give the slightest shake.</p><p>Loose, he thought. No way a man as wealthy as Marks would have let such an imperfection slide. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hector bent down and pried at the tile. Took some finessing, and a few hard jerks, but he finally got the piece to lift. A cubby. With a small handheld resting in the center. Hello, pretty lady.</p><p>Excitement rushed through him as he carefully placed the device in his tool box.</p><p>Upstairs, he found the media room. With two rumpled blankets on the couch, the area looked like a favorite. And one Marks had recently used to entertain a guest. The TV hadn\u2019t been turned off, and a daytime soap played across the screen.</p> <p>Marks had been single, and there were no reports of him dating anyone. Four guest bedrooms, empty and sparkling. Then he found the master bedroom. The king-size bed was unmade, both sides clearly well used, judging by the indentations in the mattress. But unassailable proof that Marks had entertained a woman? The clothes hanging in the closet alongside his.</p><p>Dresses, both formal and casual. Sparkly shirts, and jeans with swirling designs stitched up the sides. The wearer had been more than an overnight guest. She\u2019d stayed. Often. Maybe even lived here, though he\u2019d caught no other sign of her. Only one way to find out the identity of his mystery girl, then. Hector set his toolbox down, straightened. DNA testing on her dirty clothing.</p><p>Behind him, he heard the quietest rustle of footsteps.</p><p>Palming the pyre holstered under his arm in less than a second, Hector spun around and aimed. A female had been approaching him with a vase lifted over her head. She swung it at him, missed as he jumped out of the way. Gasping as her momentum twisted her, she tried to catch herself and launch at him a second time.</p><p>\u201cNot another move or I shoot.\u201d Only his reflexes had saved her from being shot the first go-round.</p> <p>She froze in place. He could have pulled the trigger anyway, but he didn\u2019t. He was too curious, wanted answers now rather than later.</p><p>She was a Rakan, he realized as he considered her. A rare species that hardly ever ventured to earth. She possessed long golden hair, golden eyes, golden skin, and besides Noelle, was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>His mystery girl, he would guess.</p><p>\u201cPut the vase down,\u201d he instructed calmly. She\u2019d meant to brain him, no question.</p><p>Nervous, she licked her lips. Even her tongue was golden. Glittery tears filled her eyes as she stuttered out, \u201cP\u2014please, do not h\u2014hurt. This is my home. Y\u2014you must leave.\u201d Heavy accent. He\u2019d bet she hadn\u2019t been here long.</p><p>\u201cPut the vase down,\u201d he repeated, more harshly this time. \u201cI don\u2019t want to shoot you, but I will. And if I shoot you, you\u2019ll be helpless. Do you understand what that means?\u201d He could do anything he wanted to her.</p> <p>Slowly she obeyed, sitting the \u201cweapon\u201d on the floor. When she straightened, a tremor shook her entire body and the tears broke free of the dam, cascading down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cM\u2014margarete. Wife.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cTo Bobby Marks?\u201d There\u2019d been no wife on file. But then, a marriage to an otherworlder wouldn\u2019t exactly be legal. And Margarete\u2019s claim explained why Marks had stopped dating. Also explained why he\u2019d never taken Margarete out in public.</p><p>Not everyone was pro-otherworlder. And as Rakans were hunted, often de-skinned and cut into pieces for their gold, Marks wouldn\u2019t have wanted to put her continued health in jeopardy.</p><p>\u201cY\u2014yes. Bobby.\u201d She nodded, her hair dancing around her delicate shoulders. Dressed in a flowing ice-blue sheath, she appeared as innocent and truthful as an angel.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t take him long to learn whether the image was true or false. \u201cI want you to walk over to the bed and sit down,\u201d he said, and a sob parted her lips. Damn it. He had to be more careful with his phrasing. Bed most often equated to rape in this situation. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you unless you challenge me. I\u2019m an AIR agent, and I\u2019m going to ask you some questions. That\u2019s all. When you\u2019re sitting, I\u2019ll lower my gun.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly she obeyed, the tears flowing continuously now. As promised, he lowered the gun. Surprise filled her golden eyes. Keeping his gaze on her, he crouched in front of the toolbox and flipped the voice recorder on. Then he straightened, squared his shoulders.</p> <p>She watched him, nervously rocking back and forth.</p><p>First things first. The part of the job he most loathed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to be the one to tell you this, Margarete, but Bobby Marks was murdered last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The surprise gradually mutated into horror. \u201cNo. No! I saw him only yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Hector remained quiet, giving her time to absorb the news. First she spouted a few more denials about how he couldn\u2019t possibly be dead, then she cried, then she settled as shock took hold and numbed her out. Reactions he knew very well. He\u2019d done the same thing when he learned about his brother.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you saw him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI ... I ... yesterday. Last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time exactly?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe ...\u201d She glanced at the clock resting on the nightstand, as if that would help. \u201cAround nine p.m. I think.\u201d</p><p>Keeping his tone gentle, easy, he said, \u201cWhat had he done before that?\u201d</p><p>Teardrops caught in her lashes, and she had to blink rapidly to clear her line of vision. \u201cDinner with me and his mother. He finally introduced me to her.\u201d</p><p>Good. They were getting somewhere. \u201cHow did that go?\u201d</p><p>Her chin trembled. \u201cI do not want to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Words he\u2019d said to Noelle only yesterday. \u201cI know, but you must. I need to find his killer, and you can help me.\u201d</p><p>Several minutes passed before she collected herself enough to say, \u201cHe always made me hide when someone came over, but that hurt me, and he knew it, so he invited his mother over. When he told her, she screamed. I have never heard words as vile as the ones she used. He told me to go to our room and wait for him to come and get me. I did, but he never came.\u201d</p><p>So. The mother had just gotten a bit of bad news. Well, bad news according to her. She\u2019d been upset. Motive for murder? Maybe, but that didn\u2019t explain what the witness had seen and heard.</p><p>Still. Hector definitely needed to question Ms. Brenda Marks. She was now a suspect, plain and simple. With her money, she could have easily hired out.</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>Margarete shook her head. \u201cI do not know. That was the last time I saw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call him? Talk to him on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call anyone? Not even to report him missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she shouted, suddenly angry. \u201cI trust no one on this planet besides Bobby. He told me people would injure me if they discovered me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you meet him?\u201d</p><p>She drew her arms around her middle, as if battling an abrupt waft of cold. \u201cWhy do you want to know? How can that help you with his ... with his ... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised by what helps,\u201d was all he said. Her gaze darted away. \u201cHe came to my planet. We fell in love. He brought me here.\u201d</p><p>She was lying, Hector thought. The words sounded rehearsed, as if she were repeating something she\u2019d been told. Plus, Bobby would have had to gain permission to go off planet, and he hadn\u2019t. Hector had already checked, per standard procedure.</p><p>He could take her in, lock her up in AIR for his suspicion alone, but he didn\u2019t want her logged into the system. Wasn\u2019t that he lacked trust\u2014although he did\u2014but he hadn\u2019t forgotten how those girls had disappeared from the hospital last year, an Arcadian suspected of taking them. And with an Arcadian involved in Marks\u2019s murder ... no chances.</p><p>Besides, taking her from her home, her familiar surroundings, would be unnecessarily cruel. Whatever had happened, she had loved Bobby Marks.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t hurt to garner her trust, either. She\u2019d tell him anything he wanted to know if he could just make her trust him. \u201cWe think your husband was trying to gather evidence for a crime someone committed. Did he tell you anything about that?\u201d</p><p>The color faded from her face, leaving her with a sickly ashen pallor. \u201cN\u2014no. I know nothing about that.\u201d</p><p>Abject fear. Okay. Definitely the right path. \u201cNothing at all?\u201d Men would tell a woman anything during pillow talk. At least, he supposed. Look at everything he\u2019d revealed to Noelle. Deeply personal stuff he\u2019d never shared with any other person in all the years of his life.</p><p>This time, Margarete\u2019s chin was trembling too intensely for her to reply. She violently shook her head.</p><p>You\u2019ll tell me yet. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave New Chicago,\u201d he told her. \u201cI might have more questions for you, and you need to be available. If you leave, I\u2019ll hunt you down, and you won\u2019t like the results.\u201d</p><p>Threatening a frightened female who\u2019d just lost her husband was far worse than cruel. He couldn\u2019t let himself care about that, though. Results mattered right now. Nothing else. And she would learn to trust him despite his strong-arm tactics. She would have to.</p><p>\u201cI will not leave,\u201d she whispered brokenly.</p><p>\u201cGood. But just in case you\u2019re tempted ...\u201d He withdrew a syringe from the toolkit and closed the distance. She shrank back, but he grabbed her arm only long enough to inject the contents. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the sting.\u201d He released her, stepped back. \u201cThat\u2019s an isotope tracker. A few clicks of a button, and I\u2019ll be able to find you.\u201d</p><p>Rather than snip at him, she nodded in understanding.</p><p>Won\u2019t feel guilty. He\u2019d come back tomorrow. And the next day. Until she spilled. Asking her follow-up questions, little things to get her talking. She\u2019d learn that he could be relied on to protect her. That he was dedicated to helping vindicate her husband and put his killer away.</p><p>And maybe ... maybe he\u2019d send Noelle over. Maybe Margarete just needed another female. Although Noelle was a ball buster and likely to offend. And threaten. And shout.</p><p>A pang in his chest. A rush of sensation through his body. You\u2019re doing it again. Thinking about her. Reacting to her.</p><p>\u201cI need to do a little work around this room,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I want you to remain where you are, okay?\u201d</p><p>A soft \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He dusted the dresser drawers for prints, took a couple pictures of the closet, even one of Margarete, and she did as promised. She never moved from the bed. The thing with AIR, you didn\u2019t always need a warrant for stuff. Otherworlders did not have the same rights as humans.</p><p>When he finished, he placed a holocard on the nightstand. A small black button that she had only to press for a blue screen to crystallize overhead, his picture, name, and number glowing. \u201cThis has my cell number. You call me if you remember anything about that night that you haven\u2019t told me. Anything at all.\u201d</p><p>A nod as she just kind of folded into herself. The numbness must be wearing off, grief taking over.</p><p>Hector packed up and took off, leaving the same way he\u2019d come.</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>RATHER THAN DRIVE BACK to AIR HQ and type up his thoughts, Hector picked up two coffees, black, downloaded a copy of every newspaper being offered that morning, and programmed his car to head to the business district.</p><p>There was something he had to do\u2014something he shouldn\u2019t do. A cold, callous crime, but also a public service, and one he would relish.</p><p>Took him half an hour to complete the task, and when he settled back inside his car, his knuckles were cracked and bleeding inside his gloves, but he was smiling. Time to get back to work. He programmed Dallas\u2019s address into the console and was soon winding down the road, the scenery more dreary than before. Thick gray clouds concealed the sun. Mist rose from the ground, and acidic dew scented the air, seeping into the car through the vents.</p><p>The car\u2019s sensors took care of the slowing, stopping, and turning, allowing him to lean back in his seat and close his eyes. Finally he could give in to thoughts about Noelle, if only to at last exorcise her from his mind.</p><p>After he\u2019d left her place, he\u2019d gone home, but he hadn\u2019t gotten any sleep, had tossed and turned, his body on fire for more of her. For everything.</p><p>Of course, even now he hungered for her.</p><p>Temptation, man. He\u2019d known it was more dangerous than his arms. Once you tasted the forbidden fruit, you would always crave more. Yet still he\u2019d gone inside her house. Stopped in her bedroom, transfixed by her bed, wondering if she\u2019d ever lain there and pleasured herself while thinking about him.</p><p>The way she\u2019d looked at him while he\u2019d hovered over her, as if he were a slab of ribs and she was dying of starvation, had melted any remaining resistance.</p><p>Yet now, even though Noelle\u2019s honey was branded into his every cell, even though he could still feel her nipples rasping against his chest as he ground his erection against her, could still see her face soften as he tongued her to orgasm, even though he would never forget the way she\u2019d sucked him off so perfectly, she was free to date anyone she wanted.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t asked for exclusivity, and she hadn\u2019t either. Just a dinner date.</p><p>He\u2019d never before been on a date. Not with Kira, not really. Not with anyone. Would he know how to make small talk? Hell, would Noelle even want to see him tonight?</p><p>Would she ask someone else out?</p><p>Great. Now Hector wanted to fucking murder any man who even thought about her.</p><p>He was a mess. This was one of the many reasons he\u2019s always avoided relationships. Already he was jealous and possessive. Like arousal, those emotions weren\u2019t good for him. He\u2019d just ... he\u2019d never craved a woman like he craved Noelle.</p><p>He wanted her like he wanted air to breathe, and not having her now, now, damn it, now hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noelle would be embarrassed by his past, so even if they made something work, she would leave him later. He just couldn\u2019t find a way around that fact. And if he was this much of a mess now, how much more of a mess would he be if they actually made love? If he\u2019d actually tried to share his life with her?</p><p>If he harmed her irrevocably?</p><p>Can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even considering going for more. You\u2019re a menace.</p> <p>Hell, at this rate, he really would destroy her. He\u2019d redone his tattoos before Ava\u2019s wedding, but after what had happened last night, he\u2019d already burned through some of the ink. And yeah, okay, he\u2019d redone the tattoos this morning, would redo them every morning if necessary, but he was still treacherous. That wouldn\u2019t change no matter what precautions he took.</p><p>Damn it, he had to break things off with her. Completely. He couldn\u2019t risk being with her again.</p><p>When Noelle had dragged him on top of her, he\u2019d felt the first sizzle and pop. Only thoughts of marring her flawless skin had given him enough strength to keep his arms pinned at his sides. Hadn\u2019t stopped last night\u2019s dreams, though. Dreams of going all the way. Of having her, in a thousand different ways.</p><p>Yeah, he should have called her this morning. She was a good agent, and besides, that\u2019s what partners did. Worked together. That\u2019s what she had probably hoped for. Fifty-fifty, equals in everything. Sharing details, and talking things through. He hadn\u2019t. He still couldn\u2019t. If he saw her, spoke to her, his good intentions would vanish like vapor.</p><p>Have to see her sometime. Not yet. Not now.</p> <p>The car slowed, stopped, and Hector opened his eyes to find himself parked in the underground garage of Dallas\u2019s apartment building. He gathered the coffees and his reader before striding to the elevator. A short ride later, he was walking down the long, narrow hallway that led to Dallas\u2019s den of iniquity.</p><p>This was a nice building, one of the more expensive units in New Chicago, with clean walls, clean floors, and shield armor on the windows. Hector had been here a few thousand times, but this time he looked at it as Noelle might, comparing it to his own. His place lacked personality, Dallas\u2019s did not. Soft scarlet carpet at his feet. Vibrant stone walls at his sides. Colorful portraits of flowers hanging in every direction.</p><p>Dallas and Noelle. They were a better match. Scowling, Hector knocked on the door harder than he\u2019d intended. A few seconds later, that door slid out of the way. No one stood in the entrance, but Hector knew the agent had a camera hidden out here, monitoring everyone who approached. He walked inside, the entrance automatically sealing shut behind him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re back here,\u201d Dallas called.</p><p>We? Hector followed the sound of his voice. He found Dallas and Devyn in the living room, on the couch, watching as a naked human female dusted the coffee table. She was short, curved, and stacked in all the right places, and any man with a fully functioning penis would have reacted to her.</p><p>Hector didn\u2019t react to her. Only Noelle tempted him past his endurance. No one else compared.</p> <p>He\u2019d wanted to talk to Dallas in private. He should have guessed Dev\u2019s presence, though. The boys were inseparable, and you couldn\u2019t be friends with one and not the other. Kinda like with Noelle and Ava.</p><p>Now his body reacted, his shaft twitching, his arms heating, itching. Shit. \u201cYour wife doesn\u2019t mind you watching other women ... work?\u201d Hector asked Devyn as he set the coffees on the table, careful not to initiate any contact with the maid.</p><p>The king of the Targons never removed his amber gaze from the girl. \u201cSilly boy. Bride called the service and picked her out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean me,\u201d Dallas corrected. \u201cBride picked her out for me.\u201d</p><p>Hector studied him. Tension still radiated from him. Bruises were under his eyes, as if he hadn\u2019t slept, and there were sores chewed in his bottom lip. \u201cWell, get rid of her. I\u2019m here on official business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe room isn\u2019t clean. Besides, I\u2019m here to cheer up my bestie. Bestie\u2014isn\u2019t that what people call their best friend forever? I\u2019ve heard Noelle Tremain use the term with little Ava.\u201d</p><p>More twitching.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had this conversation before. That\u2019s what teenage girls call them,\u201d Dallas muttered.</p> <p>Devyn smiled his most charming smile. \u201cAs our bromance will last the ages, that sounds pretty perfect to me.\u201d</p><p>Hector glanced around. Usually, the place was a disaster area, with clothes strewn about, empty beer bottles everywhere, and food wrappers stuffed between the couch cushions. Now there were three stacks of folded laundry in a basket. There wasn\u2019t a bottle in sight, and a soft swathe of material was draped over the arm of the couch.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d Hector said. \u201cThere\u2019s something you can do for me.\u201d</p><p>Her blond hair was pulled back in a ponytail, giving him a clear view of her pretty face\u2014and the fear that filled her brown eyes when she looked him over. A common occurrence in his presence. Noelle was one of the only females to regard him unflinchingly from day one.</p><p>Twitch, twitch.</p><p>\u201cY\u2014yes?\u201d she stuttered.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed and leave.\u201d</p><p>Relief replaced her fear. \u201cCertainly.\u201d</p><p>Amid Devyn\u2019s protests, she tugged a black and white dress over her head. As the material fell into place, it conformed to her curves. She slid her feet into too-high heels, and they clicked and clacked as she hurried out of the apartment.</p><p>\u201cNow, then.\u201d Hector pressed a few buttons on his reader, sending the contents to both Dallas and Devyn\u2019s systems, and fell into the chair across from them. He told them what he\u2019d learned about Bobby Marks\u2019s wife, the explosive dinner with the mother, and they decided to hunt Brenda Marks down after checking in at the AIR office in an hour.</p><p>Every reply from Dallas was harder and harsher than necessary.</p><p>\u201cSo ... you want to tell me what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dallas replied tightly.</p><p>\u201cHe had a vision,\u201d Devyn said.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Dallas frowned at him. \u201cWhen I tell you something\u2019s a secret, and you tell me that secret is locked in the vault, you aren\u2019t supposed to blab about it.\u201d</p><p>Devyn blew him a kiss. \u201cHow was I supposed to know Hector would have the key to my vault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dallas grumbled. \u201cAnd what\u2019s the key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour happiness. God knows, nothing I\u2019ve done has helped your pissy mood. So maybe, just maybe, talking about it with the other man involved will.\u201d</p><p>Motions jerky, Dallas grabbed one of the coffees and drank deeply. \u201cFine, whatever, but you tell him. I can\u2019t discuss it without vomiting blood.\u201d</p><p>Dread poured through Hector\u2019s veins. What the hell was going on?</p><p>\u201cDallas had an unchangeable vision,\u201d Devyn said, meeting Hector\u2019s gaze with steady determination. \u201cHe saw himself in bed with Noelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Hector exploded, on his feet, a pyre-gun palmed and aimed before he realized he\u2019d moved. He knew all about Dallas\u2019s visions. Knew they were never wrong. Knew that predicting the future was one of his many half-alien abilities. Damn that ability!</p><p>A narrowed-eyed Devyn said, \u201cSit down. Now,\u201d in a cold and deadly voice.</p><p>Deadly, but at the moment Hector was a predator without any type of moral compass. No one was more lethal.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me ask twice.\u201d</p><p>As if he\u2019d asked the first time. The Targon would kill to protect his \u201cbestie.\u201d And as he could control energy molecules with his mind, manipulating human bodies as if they were nothing more than puppets, he attempted to lower Hector\u2019s arm.</p><p>Hector felt mental fingers clamping around his wrist, pushing, and resisted until both men realized the depths of his strength. He even let his skin atomize just enough to glow above the edge of his gloves and heat. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You can\u2019t force me to do anything I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>Devyn hissed, as if he\u2019d felt the heat of Hector\u2019s skin even through the mental connection.</p><p>When Hector sat and sheathed his weapon, he did it under his own steam. He only had trouble forcing his arms to cool. Dallas. Noelle. In bed. Together.</p><p>He\u2019d known it was a possibility, had even considered them a perfect match a few minutes ago, but this ... fuck no!</p><p>Red glittered over his line of vision, and he once again curled his finger around his gun.</p><p>\u201c\u2014listening to me?\u201d Devyn asked, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d he snarled, throwing out the curse like a weapon. \u201cFuck. Fuck. Fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you he\u2019d react that way,\u201d Dallas said, falling back against the couch and staring up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cWell, he should have kept listening to me and we could have avoided the tantrum,\u201d Devyn said after tsking under his tongue. \u201cDallas also had a vision of you sleeping with her, Hector. And I gotta tell you, that shocked the piss right out of me. I thought you were gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFu\u2014wait. What?\u201d The red dissipated with a single blink.</p><p>\u201cOh, now I have your attention.\u201d</p><p>Hector. Noelle. In bed. Together. Again? \u201cDid I have sex with her?\u201d he asked Dallas in a rush. \u201cDid I harm her?\u201d</p><p>Dallas gulped. \u201cYou woke up next to her, and both of you were naked. No, she wasn\u2019t harmed.\u201d</p><p>Shock blasted him, realization quick on its heels. In the vision, Hector had slept with her, next to her and naked, and he hadn\u2019t hurt her. A miracle. His heart drummed against his chest with stinging precision.</p><p>He could have her, all of her. Would have her. Dallas was never wrong. Praise that ability!</p><p>\u201cThe problem is,\u201d Devyn went on. \u201cOnly one of the visions will come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem. I want her. She\u2019s mine.\u201d Words he\u2019d never thought to utter, but now that he had, he meant them. She. Was. His. If he could have her without hurting her, he would have her. Period. No one would be able to stop him. Not even Noelle.</p><p>Shit. He had some serious backtracking to do with her. Probably some groveling, too. She\u2019d demand an apology for his lack of contact. He\u2019d give it\u2014and anything else she wanted.</p><p>\u201cLost you again.\u201d Devyn sighed. \u201cLet me finish before you start unzipping your mental pants, all right? If one vision comes true, Dallas will be saved. If the other vision comes true, Dallas will be ruined. I don\u2019t want my Dallas ruined,\u201d the Targon ended with toxic force.</p><p>Hector\u2019s excited burst of possessiveness drained, leaving an empty shell in its wake. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Save him from what? Ruin him how? Which vision will cause which?\u201d</p><p>Despondent, Dallas toyed with the lid on the coffee. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I had the visions a while ago, but I didn\u2019t know what the double thing meant until Kyrin explained it to me yesterday. I wish we could both avoid her, or both have her, but apparently, no matter what, one or the other is going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. I could kill her,\u201d Devyn suggested.</p><p>Hector jumped back to his feet, the pyre-gun extended, his finger resting on the trigger. \u201cYou will not go near her.\u201d</p><p>The Targon\u2019s lips stretched into a languid smile. \u201cHow adorable. You actually sound like you believe you can stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can stop you. I can destroy everything you hold dear.\u201d Hector had killed in cold blood before. Not since he was a child, fighting his way out of the slums. But for Noelle, to keep her safe, he would kill again. And again.</p><p>One side of Devyn\u2019s upper lip lifted over his teeth in a scowl that would have scared a ravenous grizzly. \u201cI dare you to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to kill her.\u201d Dallas waved his hand through the air, the kill-or-be-killed vibe dissipating. \u201cOkay? All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I was saying was that accidents happen.\u201d Devyn spread his arms innocently. \u201cAnd for that, everyone nearly snaps my head off.\u201d</p><p>Tendrils of smoke rose from the seams of Hector\u2019s gloves, making him cough. He gritted his teeth and sheathed the gun before he could melt it.</p><p>Dallas reached behind his back and withdrew something black and floppy and tossed it Hector\u2019s way. \u201cNew pair of mitts. Knew you\u2019d need them.\u201d</p><p>Hector caught them and exchanged the old for the new. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you asked me to bring them,\u201d Devyn said with a nod. \u201cI thought you were getting kinky on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Bride wishes. She actually asked me why you didn\u2019t kiss me at my wedding like Noelle kissed Ava at hers.\u201d</p><p>Now was not the time to recall that tantalizing meeting of female mouths and tongues and\u2014</p><p>Hector gripped his thighs, and even though he felt the burn all the way to the bone, he knew his legs wouldn\u2019t bear so much as a streak of pink. If only the same were true for Noelle. \u201cSo what are we going to do about Noelle?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want his friend hurt. Ever. For any reason. And he especially didn\u2019t want to be the reason.</p><p>His fantasy of being with Noelle, totally and completely, began to wither and die as quickly as it had formed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Dallas said, despondent again. \u201cI know you want her. I want her, too, but I can share, and I can walk away. No problem. You can\u2019t. However, I keep thinking, what if sleeping with her is what will save me?\u201d</p><p>Eyesight ... going red again. \u201cAnd what if sleeping with her ruins you?\u201d</p><p>A lengthy pause, a heavy sigh. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s always my second thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the time being, why don\u2019t both of you stay away from her?\u201d Devyn suggested. \u201cIn the meantime, Dallas might have another vision and that vision might provide the answers you need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe can try and avoid her,\u201d Dallas said with a hint of anger this time, \u201cbut it won\u2019t do us any good. One of us will be with her when the time is right.\u201d He glanced at Devyn, frowned. \u201cTalking about it didn\u2019t help. We have to change the subject.\u201d</p><p>Good. Talking about it wasn\u2019t helping Hector, either. He felt raw, brutalized, unsure. Capable of any dark deed. He desired Noelle, but he also loved Dallas.</p><p>Yeah, he thought, he did indeed love the guy. He joked around with some of the other agents, but Dallas was the only one who knew him and accepted him anyway. Can\u2019t hurt him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to talk to Mia,\u201d Hector croaked out. \u201cGet her to take Noelle off our case.\u201d Noelle would feel rejected, and rightly so. She\u2019d be humiliated. Hate him. Never forgive him for so public a denunciation. Sickness spilled straight into his stomach.</p><p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d Dallas said in an equally abrasive voice.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of the case, is that why you emailed me the morning news?\u201d Devyn asked him, studying the screen of the device he\u2019d just pulled out of his pocket. \u201cAh. I see.\u201d A rich chuckle. \u201cMotherhood certainly agrees with Miss Tremain, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His own device had fallen to the floor when he\u2019d stood, he realized. Hector didn\u2019t dare reach for it, too afraid he\u2019d melt the plastic, so he leaned over and drank in the image he\u2019d left on the screen. Noelle in black and white, a grainy photo but lovely nonetheless. She stood beside Corban Blue, and the bastard had his arm wrapped around her waist.</p><p>Both were dressed formally, Noelle in a short, tight dress that managed to glitter, even from the tiny screen, and Corban in a tux. He was tall, leanly muscled, his white hair slicked back from his face. He was almost pretty. Fine, no almost about it. He totally was.</p> <p>Was that the kind of guy Noelle usually went for? If so, Dallas was more than a better fit for her; he was her type. And Hector couldn\u2019t forget that she\u2019d once called dibs on him. Even though only last night she\u2019d claimed never to have wanted him.</p><p>Red returning ... sickness spreading ... Hector inhaled slowly, held, held, exhaled even more slowly. Can\u2019t have her. He needed to get used to that. He had before, and he would again.</p><p>Yet still the questions formed. When had the photo been taken? How long had Noelle known the guy? Did they still talk?</p><p>The urge to murder the football star suddenly bombarded him. Hector never should have claimed Noelle as his. His mind and body weren\u2019t going to let him forget as easily as before, were both forging full speed ahead as if her seduction was still an option.</p><p>The story speculated about the very things Hector had. Were the two on or off? How far along was her pregnancy? Was she having a boy or a girl? How had Corban reacted to the news? There were a few smaller photos of Corban\u2014each with a different woman. How were those women taking the reports of his impending fatherhood?</p><p>A hard knock echoed through the room.</p> <p>Dallas glanced at the monitor resting on the table beside the couch and jerked upright. The bronze of his skin leached of color, every negative emotion he\u2019d projected returning to his gaze in a frenzied flood.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hector demanded, already reaching for his gun. He sensed a threat, a big one, and reacted accordingly.</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d the agent said, his voice as dead as the grave. \u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-five</p><p>NOELLE STROLLED INTO DALLAS\u2019S apartment as if she owned it. In a way, she did. The building belonged to her family. Hell, half the buildings in the city belonged to her family. A reason to gloat, sure, but she never cracked a smile.</p><p>She was in too volatile a mood.</p><p>When Hector hadn\u2019t called or swung by to pick her up, as she thought she remembered him promising to do before he left her place last night, she\u2019d assumed they were supposed to meet at AIR. So, after dressing in a tantalizing ensemble sure to entice him, off she\u2019d gone, arriving bright and early and eager to see the man who\u2019d given her such a glorious orgasm. Only to wait. And wait.</p><p>He was a good agent, and an even stronger, more dangerous man, so when he failed to show there, she hadn\u2019t worried for his health. She\u2019d simply assumed his own mind-blowing orgasm had made him lazy and he\u2019d slept in.</p> <p>Hoping to wake him, she phoned him\u2014no answer. No big deal, though. He\u2019d probably turned off his ringer. She\u2019d driven to his home, a middle-class house in the center of suburban paradise. She\u2019d looked forward to seeing him surrounded by his things, getting a tour of the place. Maybe kissing each other hello. But he hadn\u2019t answered the door.</p><p>At that point, she\u2019d begun to fume. Where was he? What was he doing?</p><p>She\u2019d broken in.</p><p>His furniture was plain but well cared for, his bedroom neat and tidy. There\u2019d been no personal touches anywhere, and that had surprised her. He really did keep himself distanced from everyone.</p><p>Last night he\u2019d made an exception for her, but he must have changed his mind, because clearly he\u2019d ditched her like yesterday\u2019s news. His badge, gone. His pyre, gone. Which meant they were with him. Which meant, he was on the job. Without Noelle.</p><p>Mia Snow was a smart woman, had known Bobby\u2019s identity before Hector and Noelle ever made it to the scene. After all, one of the cops would have IDed him before calling AIR. Dealing with the rich was often difficult, and Noelle could help in ways Hector hadn\u2019t realized. Yet he\u2019d rather go it alone than deal with her.</p><p>Well, he would soon learn that wasn\u2019t even a possibility.</p><p>She\u2019d headed back to AIR to hack into the GPS database and find his location, planning to show up and knock the shit out of him. Along the way, the PI she\u2019d hired to document Cherry Picking Barry\u2019s every move for the rest of his unnatural life had emailed her a string of photos.</p><p>Hector had stopped by Barry\u2019s office. Hector had beaten the ever-loving hell out of him.</p><p>Hector had somewhat redeemed himself.</p><p>However, white knight or not, the beating hadn\u2019t earned him a free pass. He had a lot to answer for. Now, however, she\u2019d use words rather than steel-toed boots.</p><p>Dallas, Hector, and hello, gorgeous Devyn Targon were on their feet, watching her with differing amounts of astonishment as she sailed inside the living room. Dallas was wearing a wrinkled T-shirt and jeans, his dark hair in complete disarray around his model-perfect face.</p><p>The sight of Devyn, warrior king of the Targons, had her sighing dreamily. As always, he was a walking fantasy. His hair was dark and glossy, while his skin possessed the radiant sheen of crushed diamonds. And his eyes, oh, his eyes were the color of the richest, most decadent brandy.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t ignorant of his appeal. He\u2019d be the first to tell you exactly how magnificent he was. Actually, no. Not true. Anything female would be the first to tell you. He\u2019d be a close second.</p><p>He wore a pinstriped suit tailored specifically for his spectacular body, not a wrinkle or flaw in sight. His silky brown hair was styled away from his face, ensuring his amber eyes were perfectly framed, and his crushed diamond skin on full display.</p><p>At one time, he would have made her mouth water. Same with Dallas. Over the last year, she\u2019d developed an obsession for raw intensity.</p><p>Finally, her gaze moved to Hector. His hair looked even longer today, a glossy jet, with the occasional strand of flax. He wore a black T-shirt, black slacks, and both paid his bad-boy muscles the proper homage. His dark brows were drawn low, his golden eyes narrowed. Thick lashes fused together and cast spiky shadows over cheeks flushed with growing ... anger? Probably.</p><p>Fuck you, Hector. Back to his pissy, distant self, regretting what they\u2019d done. Whatever. He\u2019d made his bed, and now he could lie in it. Alone.</p><p>\u201cMorning, boys. I\u2019m happy to see you, too. Oh, goody. Coffee.\u201d She grabbed the cup resting on the table and sipped. Grimaced. \u201cGross! What is this crap? Because it\u2019s definitely not coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe took turns peeing in the cup,\u201d Hector snapped.</p><p>Non-deserved hostility was always a party in a box. \u201cWell, your piss needs cream and sugar.\u201d Wishing she had a shot of bleach for her mouth, she placed the cup back on the table.</p><p>\u201cToo good to drink what the rest of us drink?\u201d Dallas muttered. A night apart hadn\u2019t improved his mood, either. Wonderful.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually, I am.\u201d Her taste buds were not snotty; they just knew the difference between good and nasty as hell.</p><p>Hector shoved his gloved hands in his pockets. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now. Is that any way to talk to your partner?\u201d</p><p>He blanched.</p><p>That\u2019s when she knew beyond any doubt that he wanted to do this without her, despite the passion they\u2019d shared. Hurt bloomed. Rather than give in to it, she raised her chin. \u201cDallas offered to take me to sexual heaven, and since I wasn\u2019t busy, I decided to let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexual ... heaven ...\u201d Hector nearly popped a vessel in his forehead. His gaze swept over her body. The deep V of her thin white top, with a silver chain hanging seductively between her breasts, the tightness of her black leather pants.</p><p>Dallas gulped, paled.</p><p>Devyn had already lost interest in her and was playing some kind of game on his phone.</p><p>\u201cHe tell you boys the same thing and you\u2019re expecting all kinds of pleasure? Should we just get in line?\u201d she asked, then strode to the couch, about to scoot herself between the two very hard D\u2019s. That way, she\u2019d have a straight-shot view of Hector\u2019s face. And his emotions. \u201cOr am I interrupting some kind of male bonding ritual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sit there!\u201d Hector shouted.</p><p>She froze, her pulse points even skittering to a stop. He hadn\u2019t sounded angry or even jealous; he\u2019d sounded frightened. \u201cUh, okay.\u201d Unsure, she straightened. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the question and pointed to the chair adjacent to him. Miles from the D\u2019s, it seemed. \u201cSit there.\u201d</p><p>After the way he\u2019d treated her, she should flip him off and throw herself across Dallas and Devyn\u2019s laps. Only Hector\u2019s terror stopped her. That terror struck her and spread quickly. With forced casualness, she ambled to the chair he\u2019d \u201creserved\u201d for her and flopped down.</p><p>She peered over at him. He watched her as intensely as when he\u2019d had his face between her legs, trying to judge her reaction. Heat slithered across her skin, and her belly quivered.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about that magic tongue of his. She\u2019d only want more from him. Want everything. Like sex in the shower to ease his fears about burning her. Not that she\u2019d been thinking of ways to do that all fucking night.</p><p>He\u2019d made his intentions clear. Romantically, they were done. He\u2019d opted to let his fears rule him and that was fine. Whatever, she told herself again. She refused to beg for every scrap of his attention and affection.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to learn to include me,\u201d she told him. \u201cThis is my job, too, and there\u2019s nothing you can do to get rid of me.\u201d Try again, and I\u2019ll gut you.</p><p>A play of emotions in those beautiful golden eyes. An increase of terror, a blend of relief, joy, even shame. \u201cIt\u2019d be better if we worked separately.\u201d</p><p>No mercy. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening,\u201d she said, as soft as she was able. \u201cSo let me help you kick things off. Why don\u2019t you tell me what you found at Bobby\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>One of his hands emerged to tug at his shirt collar. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all kinds of things.\u201d</p><p>Several heartbeats of silence. \u201cDid you know he was married?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cNo. He was married?\u201d</p><p>An abrupt nod.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Bobby had never hinted about being part of a committed relationship. Although his lack of dating might have been hint enough.</p><p>Another nod from Hector. He glanced at Dallas before pinning her with a resolved stare. \u201cWife was there, hiding. I picked up a handheld from his office, talked to her. She seemed genuinely upset by his death, genuinely surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenuine can be faked, I promise you.\u201d Her implication: just like I faked it last night.</p><p>He popped his jaw, shrugged as if he didn\u2019t care what she\u2019d done. \u201cHer name is Margarete. She\u2019s Rakan, and I don\u2019t know how they met. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait,\u201d Devyn said, suddenly interested in the conversation. \u201cYou told us the wife was an otherworlder, not that she was a Rakan.\u201d</p><p>Hector splayed his arms. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re an idiot. Rakans are rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that slavers everywhere have a jones for the gold, and that\u2019s the only way your Marks could have gotten her? Believe me, I once looked for one myself. For years. Their planet was in ruins, and the remaining people scattered\u2014but not here. Marks bought her, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlavers?\u201d Noelle asked. Buying and selling people. She knew it happened, but wow, not so close to home.</p><p>Devyn pursed his lips. \u201cOh, yes. There\u2019s a bona fide sex market, auction houses, you name it, it\u2019s out there. I used to attend those kinds of events and frequent those places myself, so I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think Bobby bought her?\u201d Hector asked, looking past the living room, into a place Noelle couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d Devyn said, and he did sound confident. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if whoever did the selling wants her back the moment he learns of Marks\u2019s murder, if he didn\u2019t do the murdering himself. That\u2019s what I would have done, if I were rotten to the core, that is, but my evil is only skin-deep. I would have sold her, then killed to get her back. She\u2019d make a damn fine profit, over and over again. You\u2019d be smart to put a detail on her at all times.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An idea tumbled through Noelle\u2019s mind. Sex market. A rare Rakan. Blow the lid off ...</p><p>She sat up straighter. All the women she\u2019d seen in those photos had been pretty. Taken from their homes. Held captive. No ransom had been demanded. They hadn\u2019t been beaten. Starved, yes, but that could have been because the skinny ones fetched a better price. Who knew?</p><p>Maybe nothing had been done to them yet because they hadn\u2019t been sold. Maybe they were to have gone to a single buyer rather than seeing to hundreds in a single day. Slavery had to be a big business. Skeevy, disgusting, and to the one doing the selling, worth killing over, as Devyn had said.</p> <p>They could be way off base, but ... maybe they weren\u2019t. Right now they had no other leads.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put that detail on the Markses\u2019 house, and I\u2019ve got Margarete injected with our isotope tracker,\u201d Hector said, fingers flying over the keyboard on his phone, already texting Mia, she was sure. Probably even checking Margarete\u2019s location. \u201cWhile I was there, I noticed the walls were reinforced metal. Those shields will keep any otherworlders from teleporting inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have contacts in the slaver world, Devyn?\u201d Noelle asked.</p><p>Hector propped his elbows on his knees, leaning toward Devyn, riveted. He cared about the victims. Truly cared, wanted justice.</p><p>She liked that about him.</p> <p>You softening, girlie? Look where that got you the last three times.</p><p>I\u2019m hard as stone!</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Devyn said. \u201cAbout a year ago, a promising up-and-comer went missing. Gerard Hendrick, gone in a puff of smoke. He would have done anything to make a sale, was practically going door to door, then suddenly stopped. I didn\u2019t care enough to check up on him. Then, before I started helping AIR out, I killed my last remaining foot in that door to save our very own Eden Black.\u201d</p><p>Too bad. Would have made things easy.</p><p>Hector cleared his throat. \u201cThis is adding up to some heavy shit. We need to keep any connection between Marks, Margarete, and the slave market quiet. Not just because we might be wrong, but because we don\u2019t want anyone going after our Rakan. Of course, that\u2019s moot if the killer is the slaver. He already knows she\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the detail will catch him trying to grab her.\u201d So, in a way, she was like bait.</p> <p>They spent the next half hour tossing around other ideas, but nothing else stuck or felt even partially right. Not even the info Noelle kept to herself\u2014for the moment. If Hector wanted to ditch her again, he\u2019d have to fly blind.</p><p>Soon conversation began to lag. Then, of course, awkward silence reigned, no one wanting to look in her direction. She was extra, unwanted baggage. Whatever. I don\u2019t care.</p><p>Noelle wasn\u2019t letting Hector out of her sight. For the case, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou better answer this, genius, or I\u2019ll kick your ass!\u201d Ava\u2019s voice suddenly belted out.</p><p>\u201cAva\u2019s here?\u201d Devyn frowned, searching the room for a sign of her.</p><p>\u201cYou explain it to him,\u201d Noelle told Hector. \u201cI need to take this.\u201d Without leaving the room, and knowing she was rude as hell, she fit the cell against her ear. \u201cTremain here, goddess extraordinaire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant.\u201d A flat statement, not a question, and crackling with so much rage Noelle was surprised her mother hadn\u2019t already combusted. \u201cWith an otherworlder\u2019s child, at that. An otherworlder who is also a football player person.\u201d</p><p>Football player person was said with the same disgust one might expect to hear malignant cancer. Her mother was the biggest freaking human elitist on this planet or any other. \u201cMother, how many times do I have to tell you? You can\u2019t believe what you read.\u201d</p> <p>A hopeful pause. \u201cYou\u2019re not pregnant?\u201d What her mother didn\u2019t say but implied: Thank God.</p><p>A laugh escaped her. \u201cI do have a bun in the oven, yes.\u201d And it had been glazed with honey and sugar, butter melted over the top. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure who the father is. And, to be honest, I\u2019m in a meeting with three of the other candidates, so can we save this conversation for after the paternity test?\u201d</p><p>Another pause, this one heavy, crackling again. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who the father is? That\u2019s disgusting and idiotic, Noelle, even for you. How dare you embarrass the family like this! Your brothers are flying home. I\u2019ve had to cancel my cocktail party. How far along are you? Is it too late to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom,\u201d she said cheerily. \u201cKnew you\u2019d understand.\u201d Click.</p><p>Okay, that had felt good.</p><p>All three males were watching her, their moods somehow suddenly lightened.</p><p>\u201cThat was an interesting one-sided conversation,\u201d Hector said, a gleam entering those luscious ocher eyes and chasing away a few of the shadows that constantly seemed to swirl inside.</p><p>\u201cSucks for you that I won\u2019t give you a play-by-play.\u201d You don\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>\u201cYou better answer this, genius, or I\u2019ll kick your ass!\u201d</p><p>Another call? Groaning, she flashed her middle finger in a bid for one sec of silence. Then she placed the phone to her ear and tuned everyone out. \u201cTremain here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d Jaxon demanded without preamble.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the\u2014oh. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just needed the press to keep their rabid hunger for a story away from our case.\u201d Bothered her that Jaxon hadn\u2019t known that right off the bat. Like her mother and brothers, he still saw her as that flaky little girl, yet he\u2019d spent the past year hovering over her shoulder.</p><p>Well, you still feed that image. Can you blame him?</p><p>Yes! Hector had seen through it. Why couldn\u2019t anyone else?</p><p>And I\u2019m still not softening toward him. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell my mother. She\u2019ll alert the press en masse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Jaxon\u2019s chuckle slithered over the line. \u201cYou want me to throw fuel on the fire? Maybe have Corban come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, tell my brothers that Corban refused to marry me, and that they should really let him have it, defend my honor, that kind of thing. That\u2019ll keep the vultures happy for quite a while. Oh, and they should let Corban have it in person rather than on the phone so he\u2019ll forever understand how he\u2019s wronged the Tremain name.\u201d Call waiting beeped. Damn it. She was changing her number. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of your brothers.\u201d</p><p>Click.</p><p>Tune-in. Dallas opened his mouth to say something.</p><p>One sec. Tune-out. \u201cTremain,\u201d she said into the mouthpiece. Maybe Jaxon wasn\u2019t such a bad cousin, after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this bullshit about Corban Blue being the father of your fake baby?\u201d Ava demanded.</p><p>See? Ava hadn\u2019t needed to be told. Ava just knew.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were lusting after Hector Dean,\u201d her friend went on. \u201cAnd don\u2019t try to deny it, because I noticed the way you eye-raped him at the wedding. Why didn\u2019t you pick him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I have missed you and your slappable mouth so much!\u201d Noelle\u2019s chest constricted tightly. They\u2019d seen each other just yesterday, texted constantly, but still. \u201cAnd to answer your question, hardly. He doesn\u2019t deserve me.\u201d</p><p>At that, Hector scowled. Oops. Her tuned-out had failed this go-round. Just to be irritating, she pinky waved at him with her free hand.</p><p>Smoke curled from the tops of the gloves. Smoke that did not contain the slightest trace of nicotine. His hands ... flaring up ...</p><p>Dangerous, she thought. To Ava, she said, \u201cHang on,\u201d and got a lot of sputtering in return. \u201cYou should probably take a breather, Hector.\u201d Hint, hint. \u201cMaybe go outside, cool down.\u201d</p><p>He gave an abrupt shake of his head. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He would know best, but ... She didn\u2019t like this. Can\u2019t question him here and now. \u201cSo have you done the deed yet?\u201d she asked Ava, keeping her eye on Hector.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cHey, you. Tiny tot,\u201d she added so that only Ava could hear. She didn\u2019t want anyone else calling her friend by that nickname. Then she added more loudly, \u201cI\u2019m talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Ava asked. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn now for your exalted notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hector had mentioned strong emotion caused the flare-ups, but what had set him off and why? \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. So here\u2019s the other reason I called. I\u2019m happy to say that forty-three minutes ago, I drank McKell\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Though panic immediately clawed at Noelle\u2019s skull\u2014losing Ava, officially losing Ava now\u2014she forced herself to remain outwardly calm.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t feel any different.\u201d</p><p>She caught a hint of concern in her friend\u2019s voice, something she didn\u2019t hear very often. She pushed to her feet. One last, lingering glance at Hector\u2014he was watching her through narrowed lids\u2014and she gave the guys her back.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, it\u2019ll happen,\u201d she said, striding into the kitchen for a little privacy. If Hector took off without her, fine, she\u2019d deal. She knew where Brenda Marks would be in an hour, and she\u2019d go it alone if necessary. \u201cI promise. And you know I always keep my promises.\u201d As she spoke, she looked through Dallas\u2019s cabinets. Soup cans sat alongside fallen boxes of cereal. What a sloppy, disorganized man. Soup should be next to bread mixes, and cereal next to bags of chips. Everyone knew that.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but what if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d Ava said. \u201cI mean, this is one thing neither of us can control or force. And what if McKell stays young and I start aging, and then I become a wrinkled hagbag of bones?\u201d</p><p>When Ava worried, Noelle worried. She twirled a lock of hair around her finger, daggers in her chest, determination in her veins. \u201cDo you want the God\u2019s honest truth or a sweet, soothing lie?\u201d</p><p>No hesitation. \u201cGive me truth. Hardcore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, here it is. You\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Ava got her second round of sputtering on.</p><p>\u201cRemember when he turned Hellina?\u201d Noelle\u2019s dog. \u201cHe told us hours passed before she experienced even the slightest change. Besides, we\u2019re talking about grumpy, possessive McKell. If he could, he\u2019d keep the world\u2019s supply of oxygen to himself. Like he\u2019ll really let time have you. Time he can manipulate, I might add.\u201d</p><p>The sputtering slowed, stopped. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. I\u2019m always right.\u201d</p><p>She heard banging in the background.</p><p>\u201cMcKell\u2019s trying to bust into the bathroom,\u201d Ava said with what sounded like a shiver of excitement. \u201cI maybe might kinda sorta have told him that his inferior blood wasn\u2019t working and stomped off.\u201d</p><p>Oh, to have video feed of that. \u201cGo soothe the savage beast and call me back when you have fangs. I want to make fun of your lisp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone and done. And Noelle? Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, tiger.\u201d Noelle returned to the living room and found the guys exactly as she\u2019d left them. Scowling at her. She flopped back into her chair. \u201cSo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell was that?\u201d Hector demanded.</p><p>Him and his demands today. At least his arms had stopped smoking. \u201cThat was some random guy I once banged asking me if I was sure Corban was my baby daddy. Oh, and I almost forgot.\u201d Her cell was still in her hand, so she quickly sent all three men the same email attachment. \u201cCheck your in boxes. You\u2019ve now got a copy of Bobby\u2019s financials, as well as his daily planner for the last month, as well as his mother\u2019s schedule for the month.\u201d</p><p>Because Hector hadn\u2019t left her behind, he had earned a reward. Information.</p><p>Stunned silence met her pronouncement.</p><p>Hector palmed his phone, fiddled with the buttons. Then he gaped at her. \u201cHow did you get these so quickly?\u201d</p><p>Was he kidding? \u201cIf you aren\u2019t cheating, you aren\u2019t trying. A few taps of my keyboard, and magic happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you hacked into his system?\u201d he sputtered, reminding her of Ava.</p><p>\u201cAnd his attorney\u2019s and his mother\u2019s. You\u2019re welcome. Now you don\u2019t have to wait for answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAIR can skirt a lot of things, Noelle, but not the paperwork needed to obtain this kind of info from a rich human.\u201d Chastising words, but there\u2019d been ... dare she think it ... pride in his voice.</p><p>\u201cSo arrest me.\u201d When he made no reply, she added, \u201cAnyway. Guess who inherited everything?\u201d She didn\u2019t give anyone a chance to answer. \u201cThe mother. Yeah, that means she had motive to pay for Bobby\u2019s eternal good-bye, but I\u2019m still not buying it. We do need to talk to her, though, because she was the last person to see Bobby alive. They had dinner last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wife confirmed that dinner,\u201d Hector said, massaging the back of his neck. \u201cHe introduced them, and Margarete said she was pissed. But like you, I\u2019m still not buying. She would have been more likely to kill the otherworlder, even with the payoff for her son\u2019s demise.\u201d He pushed to his feet, and faced the still somber-faced Dallas. \u201cI can\u2019t make that call to Mia now. You understand that, right?\u201d</p><p>Dallas gave a choked, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me if you ... envision anything else.\u201d</p><p>A nod as stiff and reluctant as Hector\u2019s had been. What was going on between them? And what had Hector meant by \u201cenvision\u201d?</p><p>He breezed over to her. \u201cUp.\u201d</p><p>Only place she would have let him tell her what to do was in bed. Now? He could suck off! \u201cAsk nicely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shrugged as if he didn\u2019t care what she did. \u201cStay behind, then.\u201d</p><p>Bastard, calling her bluff like that. She was on her feet in an instant, and he nudged her out the living room with his shoulder. His skin was warm, almost too warm, the heat seeping past his clothes and into her skin, but oh, it was delicious.</p><p>\u201cYour technique for guiding a lady out of a room needs work,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cJust move your ass.\u201d \u201cHector,\u201d Devyn called just before they reached the door.</p><p>Hector paused, stiffer than before, definitely angrier. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember what you were told today, and don\u2019t do anything stupid. I\u2019d hate to resort to Plan B.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-six</p><p>NOELLE QUESTIONED HECTOR ABOUT \u201cPlan B\u201d the entire first half of the drive to the restaurant. He did his best to ignore her and succeeded, his thoughts in turmoil. No way in hell could he tell her the Targon\u2019s plan involved a disappearing act on her part.</p> <p>Devyn would do it, too. Off her, without any hesitation. Anything to protect Dallas. Worse, the Targon king knew how to hide bodies. So if Devyn wanted Noelle\u2019s death to be a mystery, it would be a mystery. No one would be able to find her or prove Devyn had been involved.</p><p>Just the thought made Hector want to vomit.</p><p>He should be trying to distance himself from Noelle, but fuck it. She should have worn a bra. Instead, the thin swath of white she called a blouse did nothing to hide the hard outline of her nipples. Nipples that had been pointing at him, practically begging for his attention the entire time they\u2019d been with Dallas.</p><p>Attention Hector could have given her without (much) fear. If Dallas\u2019s vision was true, and they always were, Hector could have had her without hurting or killing her. How, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>And okay, now that a little time had passed, he realized Dallas hadn\u2019t provided a timeline for when the sex would supposedly happen. A year from now? Two? Nor had a location been mentioned. His home? Hers? Or some shitty motel while they were on stakeout? Had Hector been drugged out, to keep himself mellow? Or had he and Noelle just fallen asleep on a bed together and never actually made love? Dallas claimed he\u2019d seen them wake up naked together, but he hadn\u2019t expounded on the sex itself.</p><p>Whatever. Details didn\u2019t matter. He couldn\u2019t have her, and that was that. Because what if sleeping with Noelle brought about Dallas\u2019s ruin? Hector would hate himself. But then again, what if sleeping with Noelle saved Dallas?</p> <p>Shit. No wonder Dallas was such a mess. A man could drive himself crazy trying to figure this kind of thing out, second-guessing himself, all while craving the woman in question.</p><p>Yeah, Hector wanted to have her so damn badly he ached. She was too damn gorgeous for her own good. Those leather pants hugged her ballerina legs. Legs he\u2019d had wrapped around his shoulders. And the necklace hanging between her cleavage kept jiggling, drawing his gaze.</p><p>Sitting in Dallas\u2019s living room, as casually as if they were picking their fantasy football team, while Noelle was within striking distance of Devyn, kissing distance of Dallas, and caressing distance of Hector, had been tough. Now as they meandered down a crowded roadway, her sweet, sexy perfume enveloping him, his mouth watered. His hands itched, burned.</p><p>No, even without Dallas\u2019s thing, Hector couldn\u2019t have her. He just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about last night?\u201d he asked her, just to break the silence. \u201cIgnoring her\u201d wasn\u2019t working for him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She peered out the passenger-side window, at building after building built to look as if they were composed of chrome and glass. Some were towering, some wide, but all were lit up like Christmas trees in the gloomy haze of the day.</p><p>\u201cWhat about this morning,\u201d he persisted, \u201cand why I didn\u2019t include you in the investigation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a smart girl. I\u2019ve already figured it out. You\u2019re too dangerous, blah blah blah even though you didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p> <p>So dismissive of something that tormented him daily. \u201cI could have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne wrong move, that\u2019s all it takes. I won\u2019t risk you,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said, over and over. But let me tell you something.\u201d Swinging around, she glared at him. Those eyes were stormy, liquid silver with flashes of lightning. \u201cI\u2019ve been a nuisance to my family my entire life. The next time you want to do something for my own good, grow a pair and tell me. They at least have never left me in the dark.\u201d</p><p>He deserved that. And he hated, utterly hated, that he\u2019d treated her the same way he\u2019d seen Jaxon treat her\u2014or worse. As if she were a pest, to be easily swatted away. And suddenly her comment about her dad loving the \u201cidea of\u201d her made sense.</p><p>Jaxon wished she were different. Her dad had probably wished she were different, too.</p><p>Shame on them, because she was perfect just the way she was. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She relaxed, but only slightly. \u201cThen what\u2019s Plan B?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my tale to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh! Well, then, tell me more about your arms. Have you seen a doctor, been examined?\u201d She threw the words at him, each one a weapon.</p><p>He replied anyway, happy to assuage her curiosity in some way. \u201cNo. Who could I trust? I\u2019d be put down, and you know it.\u201d How weird was this? He\u2019d gone from never talking about what he could do, to telling a vengeful woman whatever she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cHave you tried\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. Yes. And even if I were normal, you wouldn\u2019t want to date a guy like me, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for making my decision for me. Appreciate it. Really.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, disregarded her sarcasm. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you stuff about me, okay, and I want you to listen. Don\u2019t ask questions and don\u2019t look at me.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for a response. Didn\u2019t wait for her to turn away. He had to do this, had to tell her and finally, officially quash the blaze between them.</p><p>\u201cI was born in Whore\u2019s Corner, and my parents were, obviously, poor. So, to make money, to support their drug habits, they entered me and my older brother into human cockfights. Before each fight, all the kids were kept in cages for about a week. We were treated like animals. They decided what we ate and when, and it wasn\u2019t much and never nourishing. We had to use the bathroom in the cages, on ourselves. That way, we\u2019d be feral when we got out.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his gaze to the seat. Her fingers were digging into the vinyl.</p><p>\u201cWe never had to fight each other,\u201d he said. \u201cMy brother and me, I mean. That was the only thing we refused to do. But then one day, during a fight, my brother was killed. By a kid just like us, sold, used. A girl. They dragged Dean\u2019s lifeless body to my cage. Told me that I\u2019d be fighting the girl who\u2019d killed him the very next day. I aa... went crazy. I killed her during the fight, and then I killed my parents. I burned the ring and everyone in it down. There was nothing but ash and the echo of screams when I was done.\u201d</p><p>His voice cracked there at the end.</p><p>And still he wasn\u2019t done. \u201cI ran off. Hid. Was found by the authorities. I gave them a new name, Hector Dean, because Dean was my brother\u2019s name. I also gave them a fake past, and they put me in the foster care system. For several years, I was so numb inside that my arms never acted up. But then, one day, someone pushed me too far, and I accidentally killed him. I burned the body to ash, just like I\u2019d done to everyone in the ring, so no one would ever know.\u201d</p><p>He drew in a shuddering breath, gathering more courage. \u201cI tried to be careful after that, tried to keep my emotions under control from then on. And I did, until I met a girl. Kira. I was just a teenager and I wanted her, and she wanted me, so we started hanging out. Things were great at first, I was still careful, but I got a little too excited one night, when we were about to go all the way, and I killed her, too. But I told you that already.\u201d</p><p>Finally silence, such heavy silence.</p><p>\u201cAnd there you have it. My entire life. Now do you understand a little about why I\u2019ve pushed you away? Not just because of my arms, but because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY\u2014yes.\u201d Emotion clogged her voice, but he wasn\u2019t sure which emotion. \u201cI would have wanted you, anyway,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Would have, she\u2019d said, and that hurt. Meant she didn\u2019t anymore. Do not cave. More at stake than her life now. \u201cNow answer a question for me. Who were you talking to on the phone earlier, the one you missed and called sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva.\u201d</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have been relieved\u2014but he was. Stupid on his part. But then, he doubted he\u2019d ever get over this woman. And hell, he\u2019d just ensured she never got under him ever again, either.</p><p>Twenty-seven</p><p>TEN MINUTES LATER, NOELLE hadn\u2019t stopped shaking. She\u2019d been shaking since Hector had begun his confession. Oh, the pain he had endured.</p><p>She ached for the traumatized child he\u2019d been, ached for the strong yet broken man he\u2019d become. But. Yeah, but. He still wasn\u2019t willing to try with her, didn\u2019t want her enough. And that\u2019s what everything boiled down to.</p><p>The car eased to the side of the road, then stopped altogether and parked at the curb in front of Alfonzo\u2019s, a members-only snobfest.</p><p>\u201cI can do this, because I can do anything,\u201d she whispered, a pep talk for herself as she emerged into cool, damp wind and dodged a honking car that swerved to miss her. Emotionally raw inside, she flipped off the driver.</p><p>Can\u2019t think about Hector right now. Have to focus. For Bobby.</p><p>Later, though....</p><p>Hector moved in front of her to block the wind. He held the door open for her, rather than allowing the doorman to do his job. What the hell? Push her away, and then act the gentleman?</p><p>Killing me.</p><p>Inside she saw dark velvet draping the walls and flecks of ebony and ivory sparkling in the floor tiles. Small crystal chandeliers hung over every table, the lights dim, a soft tawny, all to promote intimacy.</p><p>Multiple perfumes fragranced the air, a clash of designers. Champagne, chocolate\u2014made from real, rare cocoa beans rather than fake\u2014and caviar also joined the scented fray. Noelle\u2019s mouth watered, but she soldiered on without stealing a morsel or six from any of the trays carried past her. Starving! she thought.</p><p>For which she blamed Hector. She hadn\u2019t eaten breakfast; she\u2019d been too busy hunting for him, fuming.</p><p>As they maneuvered around the tables, conversations ceased, then murmurs of a different nature arose. Noelle wasn\u2019t sure if the patrons were now discussing her scandalous pregnancy, or if they were focusing on the huge biker dude in front of her, a man clearly packing an arsenal of weapons on his battlefield body. Maybe both.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t bothered by the attention they garnered. To her, every person in the room was a version of her mother. Disapproving, superior, and entitled. So, basically, they could all suck it. Her life was her life, and she did not have to explain her choices.</p><p>Her gaze landed on a very handsome man at a table all by his lonesome. He was somewhat familiar to her. Must have seen him at a party or something. He had olive-toned skin and dark hair. Pain filled his azure gaze, but he smiled a sinful smile when he realized she was staring at him.</p><p>She nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p>Hector stopped abruptly, and Noelle rammed into him. His gloved arm stretched backward. For one second, only one, he settled a hand on her hip to steady her. Of course, he then realized he\u2019d broken one of his cardinal rules\u2014contact with another living being\u2014and severed the connection.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. The touch, quick as it\u2019d been, electrified her, the heat of him bypassing her clothing, her skin, just as it had every time before, settling deep in her bones. She shivered at the deliciousness of it. What really got her, though, was the fact that she\u2019d never seen him touch anyone else this casually, even by mistake.</p><p>Can\u2019t soften. Have to focus, she reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Brenda Marks snapped. \u201cMove along.\u201d</p><p>Ah, there she was. Noelle stepped around her maybe-partner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Agent Dean,\u201d Hector said. \u201cAnd we need to talk to you about your son.\u201d</p><p>Brenda\u2019s back, already ramrod straight, stiffened beneath the thin cut of her I\u2019m-almost-a-businesswoman dress. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. I know.\u201d</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Hector asked. \u201cDid you kill him?\u201d</p><p>A flash of too-white teeth. \u201cHow dare you accuse me of something like that. I\u2019m in mourning.\u201d</p><p>Mourning? Really?</p><p>\u201cI know because someone from AIR called me,\u201d she said with a false sniff, \u201cand told me he\u2019d been shot, then asked me a few questions.\u201d</p><p>Hardly. No one from AIR would have called her without permission from Hector. \u201cWhat was his name? The one who called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Smith.\u201d</p><p>There was no Agent Smith. Either she was lying, or ... what? The bad guy had called her and pretended to be an agent?</p><p>Hector crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat did he ask you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have to do this here and now?\u201d Brenda demanded, glancing around the restaurant with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Noelle and Hector answered in unison.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, if we\u2019re playing Q and A, here\u2019s one for you. How did you get in here?\u201d Brenda didn\u2019t give either of them a chance to reply. \u201cWaiter. Waiter! Escort these ... people outside.\u201d</p><p>The waiter merely stood there, shifting from one foot to the other, gulping nervously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a member,\u201d Noelle said, at last gaining Brenda\u2019s full attention. They\u2019d never before interacted, never been introduced, but the old bitch had to know who she was. Everyone did. \u201cGetting in wasn\u2019t a problem.\u201d Her gaze scanned the other three women seated at the table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Each female was around the same age: mid fifties, or maybe pushing a hundred and fifty. The number of surgical procedures staring over at her made it hard to tell.</p><p>They wore so much jewelry they could have sunk the Titanic before it ever hit that iceberg. Not a single lock of hair was out of place, their similar bobs cut and sprayed to withstand even tornados and hurricanes. Manicured nails left far too long. Makeup more of a mask than an accessory.</p><p>Oh, yes. They were definitely versions of her mother.</p> <p>\u201cBeat it before I decide to make examples out of you and carve my name into your faces,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cNow!\u201d when they hesitated. And, yes, she flashed her switchblade. Never left home without it.</p><p>Two stood so swiftly their chairs skidded behind them. The third remained in her seat, her lips thinned in a mutinous line. \u201cOur food hasn\u2019t yet arrived, and I\u2019m not leaving until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said now.\u201d Hector tapped two fingers against the handle of the pyre-gun holstered under his arm, and the protestor joined the others. They lined up and marched away, most likely intending to call their husbands. Or attorneys.</p><p>Noelle stuffed her blade back in her pocket and claimed one of the vacant chairs, then motioned for Hector to do the same.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if they\u2019re the law or not. Get rid of these miscreants,\u201d Brenda snarled to the waiter. \u201cThey offend me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, good. Timmy,\u201d Noelle said, reading his nametag. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. We\u2019ll have the eggs benedict, that plate of salmon, like the one over there, a bowl of lobster bisque, and some grapes. Do you have grapes today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss Tremain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. And put a rush on my order.\u201d She rubbed at her (very flat) stomach. \u201cThe baby\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Miss Tremain.\u201d Relieved, he rushed away.</p><p>\u201cWaiter,\u201d Brenda called.</p><p>He ignored her, continuing on.</p> <p>Noelle propped her elbows on the tabletop. \u201cPerhaps you didn\u2019t know, but my family owns this place.\u201d</p><p>Scowling\u2014or, she would have scowled if her features weren\u2019t frozen in a perpetual look of contempt\u2014Brenda tossed her napkin on the table. She patted her too-pretty-to-be-her-natural-color silver bob. Her hazel eyes were more green than brown, her eyebrows thin and shaped into the perfect arch. \u201cI\u2019ll leave, then.\u201d</p><p>As she made to rise, Noelle whipped out an arm and grabbed hold of her wrist, jerking her back down, unconcerned by any brittleness she might have in her bones. Or, you know, initiating contact with one of the undead. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay there, or I\u2019ll do more than carve my name in your face. I\u2019ll bend you over the table and carve it in your fucking ass,\u201d she said in a sweet tone of voice. She even smiled. \u201cThis is a murder investigation, and you will help us.\u201d</p><p>Plastic-looking skin became chalk white. But when Brenda spoke, her voice was strong, dripping with vinegar. \u201cDo you talk to your own mother with that filthy mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. My mouth is a lot filthier when I talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s lips quirked at the corners, his dimples revealed one moment, gone the next.</p><p>Noelle\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Have to stop noticing things like that.</p><p>With her free hand, Brenda grabbed her napkin and slammed the material back into her lap. \u201cFine.\u201d Fury must have been smoldering inside her, because her frail body vibrated like a volcano ready to erupt. \u201cBut this is the last time I shall ever visit this establishment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no. Hector, do you have a tissue to mop up my tears?\u201d Noelle released the woman and reclined in her seat.</p><p>Chin lifting, Brenda snapped, \u201cYour mother will hear about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t forget to tell her I dropped the F-bomb, abused my family\u2019s good name, and\u2014I know this hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it will\u2014danced on the tables. I can have Timmy write everything down if you think you\u2019ll forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as reprehensible as I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>Hector spoke up for the first time since sitting down. \u201cTalk about her like that again, and I\u2019ll haul your ass into lockup on so many charges your attorney will be filing motions to dismiss for a year.\u201d</p><p>Noelle\u2019s eyes widened. He\u2019d just defended her. Hardass Hector who let nothing and no one bother him had just defended her.</p><p>Damn it, he was giving her whiplash with his personality changes.</p><p>\u201cNow then,\u201d she said after clearing her throat. \u201cWhat did Agent Smith ask you? And what were your answers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you know that already?\u201d Brenda huffed.</p><p>\u201cEnough lip. Talk.\u201d</p><p>A beat of silence, a shake of her silver head. \u201cHe asked if Bobby had mentioned what he\u2019d been working on lately. I said no. He asked if Bobby was dating anyone. I said yes, a filthy piece of gold-digging trash. He asked if I knew where the girl was. I said yes, Bobby\u2019s home, since they were living together. And that was it, the entire conversation.\u201d</p><p>Details they\u2019d already possessed, but now the murderer knew them, too. And Noelle was now confident the caller was the murderer, and edging toward confident that the sex ring was at the center of everything.</p><p>\u201cYou had dinner with Bobby the night of his murder,\u201d Hector stated. \u201cWhat did the two of you discuss? Besides your new daughter-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not my daughter-in-law.\u201d Brenda lifted her wineglass, sipped. \u201cBut if you must know ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. First thing he did was introduce me to the girl, as if I would support his choice. As if I would accept her, an alien.\u201d</p><p>Prejudiced bitch. Though Noelle had spent some time with Bobby, she\u2019d had no idea his family-life was as harsh and unforgiving as hers. She could just imagine what the old bat had put Bobby through in his too-short life. The negative comments, the conditional love. If there had been any love at all.</p><p>Perhaps their mothers had been separated at birth. \u201cDid Bobby mention where he met Margarete?\u201d Hector asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d An uncaring shrug. \u201cBut then, I didn\u2019t care to know. I told him to marry that sweet Kerry Jones and finally give me a grandchild. He declined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA travesty. I\u2019m sure you would have been as maternal a grandmother as you were a mother,\u201d Noelle said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Brenda said, deadpan, clearly unused to sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cDid you hate your son?\u201d Maybe she was asking for the case, or maybe she was asking because Brenda\u2019s answer would mirror her own mother\u2019s, and she was curious.</p><p>Another shrug. \u201cI hated what he was doing with his life.\u201d</p><p>Expected, but still disappointing. \u201cEnough to kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt times.\u201d Brenda finished off her wine. \u201cDoes my answer surprise you? Well, it shouldn\u2019t. He was an embarrassment, Miss Tremain, and he did the things he did just to strike at me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. That was why.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Agent Tremain,\u201d Hector snapped.</p><p>I won\u2019t look at him. I won\u2019t be thrilled about his ferocity.</p><p>Brenda paid him no heed. \u201cI\u2019m sure your own mother understands my predicament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby was in love with an otherworlder, Miz Marks. He wasn\u2019t a murderer or a drug addict or a child molester.\u201d She purposely omitted the part about his as yet unproven participation in otherworlder slavery. \u201cWhat did you have to be embarrassed about?\u201d</p><p>Haughty chin lifted, Brenda said, \u201cA child is a reflection of his parents. So what did I have to be embarrassed about? Everything. But did I kill him? No. He cut me a check every month, paid my bills, whatever they happened to be. If I were capable of murder, I would have gotten rid of the alien.\u201d As she spoke, a vein pulsed in her forehead.</p><p>Bitch was too kind a word for her.</p><p>\u201cNow you have access to his entire fortune,\u201d Hector said. \u201cHe left everything to you.\u201d</p><p>A cruel smile flashed, the edges dripping with relish. \u201cI know. And do you know the first thing I plan to do when his home is signed over to me? Take out the trash.\u201d</p><p>The direction of Noelle\u2019s thoughts changed. From forcing herself not to ponder Hector\u2019s appeal to forcing herself not to kill the woman in front of her. \u201cSpeaking of the house, what time did you leave the night of your dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Nine, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your home is within walking distance of Bobby\u2019s?\u201d Hector asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. But I didn\u2019t walk, I drove.\u201d</p><p>Afraid of the dark? Or of the thousands of people who would have loved to gut her and leave her bleeding on a sidewalk? Either way, Noelle knew Hector planned to check the security feed from the neighborhood and see if the timelines added up.</p><p>The waiter arrived with the tray of food Noelle had ordered, but before he could place a single plate on the table, she said, \u201cBox it up for us, Timmy, and have it carried to our car.\u201d No way she could spend another second with her mother\u2019s doppelganger. Their questions had been answered. Time to bail.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Miss Tremain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and add a couple slices of cheesecake to the order before putting everything on Mrs. Marks\u2019s bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Miss Tremain.\u201d</p><p>Brenda hissed, tried to protest, but Timmy had already hurried off, the delicious-smelling goodies disappearing with him.</p><p>Noelle\u2019s stomach rumbled as she pushed to her feet. Hector stood as well, and she moved to his side. Her four-inch heels made her taller than ever, but still he towered over her.</p><p>\u201cThanks for everything,\u201d she said. One little slice across the woman\u2019s throat wouldn\u2019t be so bad, would it? \u201cWe really appreciate the conversation and the meal.\u201d</p><p>The old bat was still floundering to form a protest as Noelle and Hector stalked away.</p><p>Twenty-eight</p><p>HECTOR HUNG UP THE phone and forked another bite of smoked salmon into his mouth. He chewed, all the while watching Noelle. Trying to pretend he wasn\u2019t aroused by her, that he wasn\u2019t remembering every detail he\u2019d confessed about his past.</p><p>His desk created a barrier between them, the food she\u2019d ordered stacked on top of his files, equipment, weapon case, weapon cleaning case, and spread out like a picnic.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d she asked. She looked around, clearly trying to decide what to pick, finally settled on the dessert, and lifted its box and a fork. She snuggled back in her chair, crossing her legs and revealing her shoes.</p><p>And hell, they were bondage lingerie for her feet. Open toed, with diamonds encrusted on the strap around her ankles. Her hair was unbound, flowing down her shoulders, and just a bit mussed.</p><p>That white blouse she wore V\u2019d so deeply he was always surprised she didn\u2019t flash him when she moved. He\u2019d had her lithe body under him, had sucked on her pert little nipples.</p><p>\u201cHector,\u201d she prompted. \u201cMy breasts adore the attention, but if you don\u2019t stop staring, my ass will have to file a complaint. It deserves notice, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>A flippant tone, but he detected a note of sadness. His gaze snapped up to her face as his cheeks heated. Can\u2019t have her. You fucking can\u2019t have her. But oh, the things she said. Her mouth aroused him as much as her body.</p><p>Her mouth ... which she\u2019d once wrapped around his cock ...</p><p>Shit. He buckled down and concentrated on the case before his arms started acting up. \u201cThat was Mia. A few new developments. First, the pin you mentioned before, the one that wipes footprints. They found it.\u201d</p><p>Triumph bathed her features, making her glow. \u201cGod, I\u2019m smart.\u201d</p><p>His chest constricted. \u201cSecond, the witness is now detoxed and has been questioned. He says he never saw the Arcadian\u2019s face, that the otherworlder always had his back to him, but he helped with a sketch of the shooter and the guy who handed him the gun. Those are being emailed to us right now, as well as being run through the database.\u201d Every criminal ID was stored there.</p><p>Suddenly all business, Noelle whipped out her phone, pressed a few buttons, and frowned. \u201cAre you kidding me? The sketch of the shooter is a cartoon superhero.\u201d</p><p>Hector pulled up the sketches on his computer screen. Shooter had blond, wind-blown hair, his face blurred out. And he wore a suit so embellished with muscle ridges and color, the witness had to have been smoking crack when he\u2014</p><p>Yeah. Okay. He had been.</p><p>The second sketch showed a hard, harsh face. Dirty, grungy. Dark hair, high forehead. Narrow eyes. Nose with a bump in the center. Wide cheekbones, a square chin. The kind of face kids probably saw in their nightmares.</p><p>This one was usable, at least.</p><p>\u201cSeems surreal, having evidence finally fall into our hands,\u201d Noelle said. \u201cShould we give the non-cartoon sketch to the media? Someone might recognize him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather wait. I\u2019m too afraid Shooter will cut and run. And if he runs, we won\u2019t find him. He\u2019s managed to hide this long without even trying. He puts any real effort into it, and our case is cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking like a poor man. If Shooter is rich and powerful, and judging by those gold coin buttons on his superhero suit, I\u2019d say he is, he won\u2019t want to start over. He\u2019s killed to protect his empire, or whatever it is, and he\u2019ll kill again rather than leave.\u201d</p><p>Hector didn\u2019t take offense to her \u201cpoor man\u201d comment. To her, he was poor. And she was right. \u201cIf Shooter is willing to kill again, he might just kill Bruiser the moment the sketch goes live to keep us from finding and questioning him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d A moment passed as she pondered their options, her face scrunching adorably. \u201cWhat about leaking word that we\u2019ve got the witness? We can use him as bait as we talked about with Dallas and catch whoever comes for him red-handed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI still think that should be our last resort. Shooter won\u2019t go for the kill himself. He\u2019ll send his Arcadian or Bruiser, and I\u2019d rather not go against the Arcadian just yet. Not until we\u2019ve got precautions in place to counteract any ability he might have. Good news is, we\u2019re close. That handheld I found at Marks\u2019s place? Our tech hacked through the security program and discovered info on the sex ring.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWe were right, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like.\u201d A flicker of rage, quickly contained. Sex crimes pissed him off. Hector had never been raped, but his will had been disregarded countless times. He knew the total devastation of feeling helplessness, the terror of being trapped in your body as other people hurt you. \u201cDevyn was right. Someone will be after Margarete Marks. The guards watching her said there haven\u2019t been any disturbances yet, but Mia\u2019s adding a few more just to be safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, this is bad of me to say, but I really hoped Brenda Marks did it. I would have loved to lock her away. But okay, she didn\u2019t do it. A flesh peddler did. How has he stayed in the shadows so long? Why hasn\u2019t someone talked? Like a resentful wife who\u2019s been cheated on? Or children who walked in on their dad banging the weird chick in chains in the basement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear. Bobby was keeping a journal. He bought Margarete for a limited time. Fell in love with her. Time was running out, so he bought her for a little while longer. He never met with the seller directly, everything was online and by phone. But there\u2019s no website.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s no website, how\u2019d he learn where and how to buy her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom a friend, but he didn\u2019t put the friend\u2019s name in his notes. Maybe to protect him.\u201d</p><p>So that was a dead end. For now. \u201cHow was Margarete delivered to him? She wouldn\u2019t have willingly walked to his door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarks wrote that a tall guy with more muscles than should be legal delivered her. Again, he didn\u2019t mention a name. My guess is he didn\u2019t know it, that the guy was there as more than a deliveryman, but to intimidate the buyer into staying quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, there\u2019s a caveat to every buy. If you want to tell a friend so he can get a female\u2014or male\u2014of his own, you have to get permission. If you tell anyone without permission, or how or where you got your companion, you die. You tell anyone about the transaction, you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s disappeared in the wealthier circles, like that up-and-comer Devyn mentioned? As quiet as this entire operation has been kept, there have to be more than two victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do a search.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeanwhile, let\u2019s deconstruct the night of the murder. No one could teleport into Bobby\u2019s house. So someone had to either come to his door,\u201d Noelle said after swallowing another bite of cheesecake, \u201cor sneak in. Since there\u2019s no sign of a break-in, I\u2019m guessing the door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m with you.\u201d Wrong words, he instantly realized. He gulped, trying to swallow back his sudden rise of renewed desire.</p><p>Oblivious, she licked her fork like it was a lollipop. Or his cock. At the sight of that gorgeous pink tongue, Hector experienced full-on arousal, no more of that almost/maybe/could be shit\u2014and there was no stopping it. That tongue had given him those same kinds of so-delicious strokes, and he wanted to feel all that wet heat between his legs again. And again.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have messed around with her, he thought darkly. Resisting her had become a whole lot harder. In every way.</p><p>Heat sizzled along the veins in his arms, and he set his food aside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked, reading his approaching panic before he did.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Mind, out of gutter. \u201cSo someone comes to Marks\u2019s door and, late as it was, Marks had to know him or he wouldn\u2019t have answered. The journal doesn\u2019t mention an Arcadian, so it had to be Bruiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the Arcadian was with him, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait. Bruiser was waiting with the shooter, remember? So Bruiser couldn\u2019t have been the one to pick Marks up. The Arcadian appeared with Marks, so the Arcadian was the one to go and get him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould this Arcadian be so powerful that he can teleport past Bobby\u2019s shields?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never heard of such a thing, but then, wasn\u2019t he living proof that the impossible was always possible? \u201cI\u2019ll have our techs look into it.\u201d</p><p>A knock hammered at the door.</p><p>Interruptions were standard; someone had something to ask at least once an hour. Hector didn\u2019t bother checking his ID screen. Frowning, he punched the code to allow the intruder inside.</p><p>The block slid open, revealing a smoldering Dallas. The agent didn\u2019t enter. He took in the intimate scene and stiffened.</p><p>Nothing\u2019s happened, Hector tried to project.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a visitor,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to believe who it is.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened. \u201cWho?\u201d He wasn\u2019t expecting anyone.</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d Dallas said, motioning to Noelle.</p><p>\u201cHer.\u201d \u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>A tall otherworlder Hector recognized but had never met stepped beside Dallas. He was eerily handsome, with pale skin and violet eyes. Strength radiated from his leanly muscled body, an electric pulse seeming to waft from him. An Arcadian. A football star.</p><p>Corban Blue.</p><p>Noelle might have claimed to like a man in uniform, but there was no way she would scoff at the perfect lines of the perfect pinstriped suit the perfect bastard wore. I will kill him.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re here to file a complaint about the rumors,\u201d he growled, \u201cyou can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d That violet gaze remained on Noelle, probably memorizing every luscious detail.</p><p>\u201cOh ... shit,\u201d she muttered, sitting up straighter. Hector\u2019s hands curled into fists. Maybe Corban wasn\u2019t here to complain, but he wasn\u2019t here to thank her, either. One harsh word uttered in Noelle\u2019s direction, and Hector would lash out, no matter that he could lose his job. When it came to Noelle\u2019s protection, he was finding that there were no lines he wouldn\u2019t cross.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you again, Elle.\u201d There was so much husky promise in the guy\u2019s voice, the air practically thickened with sensuality.</p><p>\u201cUh, you, too, Blue.\u201d</p><p>See her ... again? When had they last gotten together? And who the fuck did the ball player think he was, using a nickname with her? They were broken up. And why the hell was she uncomfortable? Nothing made Noelle uncomfortable.</p><p>He opened his mouth to question the Arcadian, but when Corban shouldered Dallas aside to crouch just in front of Noelle, Hector\u2019s mouth snapped closed. His questions could wait. Rage blistered through him. He stood, intending to physically force the man to back off. Mine, she\u2019s mine, and I do not share.</p><p>Corban grinned, unconcerned by the animal he\u2019d provoked. \u201cSo. I hear we\u2019re having twins.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-nine</p><p>DALLAS PASSED HECTOR A few fingers of scotch before downing his own. They both needed the alcohol. For different reasons, yeah, but need was need.</p><p>The pair of them sat in a shadowed corner of Wonderland, Hector\u2019s favorite bar. The tables were made of metal, but they were painted to look like tree stumps. Evergreen-scented bubbles sometimes cascaded from the ceiling and floated through the air. Weird music always played in the background, the beat fast and erratic, and when you studied the walls hard enough, you could see little fairies peeping out from lush green bushes. Fairies with fangs, always a nice combo.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think she\u2019s doing?\u201d he asked, miserable in a way he\u2019d never been. And he\u2019d been pretty damn miserable throughout his entire life!</p><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can guess.\u201d Hector slammed his glass on the tabletop with enough strength to crack the iron. Noelle had left AIR with Corban Blue, oh, about six hours ago. No one had heard from her since.</p><p>A soft glow emitted from his bare arms, and the scowl he gave Dallas could have slain an army. \u201cShe better not still be with that Arcadian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, calm down. I\u2019ve never seen you act that way.\u201d</p><p>No one had. Except Noelle. She\u2019d seen every side to him. Harsh, aroused, teasing, cruel. She\u2019d liked him anyway. Until he\u2019d pushed her away that last time. And now that he\u2019d confessed about his past, she wouldn\u2019t want him no matter how hard he tried to win her back.</p><p>Not that he could try to win her back.</p><p>\u201cUsually you\u2019re the guy with complete control of his emotions,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cNow you\u2019re like Dragon Man, able to spew fire and burn an innocent man to ash.\u201d</p><p>Closer to the truth than he probably realized. Hector pulled gloves out of his back pocket and stuffed his hands inside them, hiding his skin, his tats.</p><p>\u201cSo have you slept with her yet?\u201d Dallas asked.</p><p>His scowl returned. \u201cCame close before you told me about ... Anyway, there\u2019s hardly been the time since, has there? We\u2019ve been working a case since the moment we left your place. More than that, I haven\u2019t forgotten Devyn\u2019s threat on her life. And most important, you\u2019ll die, remember?\u201d</p><p>Dallas\u2019s shoulders sagged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I really am. I know you want her.\u201d</p><p>Want. Too tame a word for what he felt for Noelle.</p><p>\u201cWas she any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not go there, Dallas,\u201d Hector said after tossing back the rest of his scotch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Bad form.\u201d</p><p>Possessiveness was like a spiked collar around Hector\u2019s neck. He wanted to hold the memories of what he\u2019d shared with Noelle close. Especially since there could never be a repeat.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your arms?\u201d Dallas asked. \u201cHow\u2019d they react to the stimulation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoorly. Which is why I ditched her the morning after\u201d\u2014this morning, to be exact\u2014\u201cand told her we could never do anything like that again. So I\u2019d ruined things with her even before your little announcement.\u201d</p><p>I blew it. Big time.</p><p>For the best and you know it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d his friend said again.</p><p>\u201cClearly, you\u2019re the better man for her.\u201d He\u2019d thought that very thing before, but saying it aloud rankled. His throat clogged up with a mix of fiery rage and sorrow.</p><p>Dallas heaved a heavy sigh. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not the better man for her. She never wanted me, and that\u2019s a fact. She even tried to set me up with a friend of hers.\u201d</p><p>It was stupid how much delight he took in that. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I want her, but not as intensely as you do. Besides, I\u2019ve never had a relationship last more than a few weeks. Being with her might save my life, but it would ruin yours and probably hers.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, because if Dallas slept with her then tossed her aside, breaking her heart, Hector would probably flip out. Violently.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t touch her,\u201d Dallas added. \u201cYou have my word. I just ... I can\u2019t hurt you like that.\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up. \u201cBut your vision\u2014\u201d</p><p>Electric blues dulled. \u201cIf one vision has to happen, it\u2019s going to be the one of you and Noelle. Hell, maybe that\u2019s the one that will save me.\u201d</p><p>Or maybe not. Guilt ate at him, but he couldn\u2019t deny he experienced a flood of relief. \u201cThank you. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You don\u2019t have to go there. We\u2019re friends. And I\u2019ll take care of Devyn, don\u2019t worry. He won\u2019t go after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but say again. He should let the subject drop at that, but couldn\u2019t. \u201cTell me everything you saw in the vision. Before the waking-up-naked part. Please.\u201d</p><p>A shrug. \u201cNothing else to tell. You were naked, she was naked, and you were both asleep. She woke up, sat up, and said, \u2018Thank God. Not a dream.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Disappointment joined the relief. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>So ... Dallas hadn\u2019t seen the act itself. Which meant, there was a chance the act had never even happened. Maybe, as Hector had previously suspected, he and Noelle had merely fallen asleep beside each other.</p><p>\u201cThen I still can\u2019t be with her.\u201d He worked his jaw back and forth. \u201cI can\u2019t risk harming her.\u201d</p><p>Dallas signaled the waitress for another round. A few minutes later, she delivered.</p><p>She wore a short skirt that stopped just under the curve of her ass and flared out at her hips like a ballerina\u2019s tutu. Her red hair was split down the center and swinging over her ears in pigtails, and there was a heart painted in the center of her lips.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d she asked Dallas with an eagerness that had nothing to do with the tip she hoped to get. Well, not the cash one.</p><p>\u201cHow about your phone number?\u201d the agent asked huskily, as if trying to prove to Hector that he wasn\u2019t going to pursue Noelle.</p><p>She grinned, the heart blooming like the petals of a morning rose. \u201cAlready ahead of you, gorgeous. Check your napkin.\u201d With a wink, she sauntered away.</p><p>\u201cWay to get over your heartbreak,\u201d Hector groused.</p><p>\u201cI know, right. But if everything goes according to plan, I\u2019ll be getting under it.\u201d</p><p>Hector downed one of the shots, emptying the contents in a single gulp.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working with Kyrin, learning how to deal with my own abilities. He says it\u2019s all about control. Mind over matter, that kind of thing. Maybe that\u2019s all you need to do to keep yourself leveled out when you\u2019re with Noelle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mind over matter. As if he hadn\u2019t tried that. \u201cThe danger ...\u201d A flash of Kira, lying naked in his bed, a hole burned in the center of her chest. \u201cIf I were to fail ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how badly do you want her?\u201d</p><p>No need to think it through. \u201cMore than I can even say.\u201d</p> <p>Dallas\u2019s expression was total well, there you go. \u201cStart training. Get yourself hot and bothered and practice touching vegetables or something.\u201d</p><p>An intriguing\u2014if disturbing\u2014thought. \u201cI will.\u201d And that was the God\u2019s honest truth. He\u2019d practice. For however long was necessary.</p><p>Would Noelle want him, though?</p><p>Would she wait for him?</p><p>\u201cI did some digging,\u201d he said. \u201cShe used to date him, you know. More than date him. Live with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho, the waitress? Who\u2019d she date?\u201d</p><p>Another lethal scowl pinned his friend in place. \u201cWill you keep up? Noelle. She used to live with Corban Blue. For a year. Twelve goddamn months, and that\u2019s all that was documented. So they could have been seeing each other long before they were ever caught by the media. And they could be alone right now. Together. Talking about their baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean their babies. Plural. Word is, now she\u2019s having twins.\u201d</p><p>Hector jumped up and pounded the tabletop, ratting glasses, steam rising from the gloves. Calm down. Now.</p><p>Dallas held up his hands, palms out. \u201cMy bad, dude. They\u2019re only having the one kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot his baby. Mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Sure. The imaginary baby is yours. Continue.\u201d</p><p>He did, just kind of falling back into his chair. \u201cI\u2019m nothing like him.\u201d Deep breath in, deep breath out. Gradually the steam dissipated. \u201cI\u2019m not polished, rich, or cuddly. I\u2019ll embarrass her, I know I will.\u201d</p><p>After tossing back two shots of his own, Dallas choked out, \u201cBacktrack a minute. You think Corban Blue is cuddly? The guy\u2019s lean, true, but he\u2019s taller than you are. And I felt the energy kicking off him. Powerful energy. Stronger than Kyrin\u2019s, even.\u201d</p><p>There was no telling what kind of abilities Corban possessed. Because, if Kyrin could control humans with his mind, move faster than a determined vampire, and teleport, Corban could certainly do that and a whole lot more.</p><p>He\u2019d be the perfect one to test the shields in Bobby Marks\u2019s house. If he was still alive in the morning.</p><p>\u201cHe can touch her without worry,\u201d Hector groused. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to break his throwing arm into four pieces. That way, he won\u2019t be able to touch her or a ball.\u201d</p><p>Hector couldn\u2019t have her\u2014yet\u2014but he wasn\u2019t going to let anyone else have her, either, he decided. Whether she still wanted him or not. Whether she would wait for him or not. He\u2019d make her wait.</p><p>Maybe that was the alcohol talking. Then again, maybe it wasn\u2019t. She\u2019s mine.</p> <p>Dallas tried to change the subject. \u201cSo any luck with the sketches? Any possible matches in the database?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was supposed to have dinner with me tonight,\u201d he plowed on, anger morphing into irritation\u2014with her. \u201cBut did she call to cancel? No. Is she answering my calls? No. She just stood me up without a fucking apology.\u201d</p><p>So what that he\u2019d done the same thing to her this morning. So what that he\u2019d told her they were done. She had better manners than he did.</p><p>\u201cI did some digging of my own, just like you asked,\u201d Dallas continued, \u201cand you\u2019ll be highly interested to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that she just accepted my dismissal without a fight is telling, you know?\u201d Pound, pound, pound\u2014metal creaking as it bent. \u201cDoes she think I know how to handle this kind of thing? A relationship, intimacy, acceptance, and rejection, all in one day? Well, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014that a few months ago, a businessman went missing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t want anything from me anymore. Maybe I was a good time, only good enough until someone better came along. Someone more suitable. And now that someone has. Corban Fucking Blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014just up and disappeared, though he left a note behind. Something about taking off to find himself\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hector laughed, but it was an ugly sound. \u201cIf she\u2019s not going to wait for me, I need her to tell me so that I can start with the forcing. Think I\u2019ll begin by killing everyone with a penis.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014but he\u2019s never written another letter, never contacted anyone else and there were also several businessmen who committed suicide supposedly, though their families\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck this,\u201d Hector growled. He drained another shot, and then his beer. \u201cI\u2019m going to her house.\u201d He was on his feet a second later, the table teetering, falling with a crash. \u201cWe\u2019re going to chat. She\u2019s always telling me I need to trust her, I need to open up to her. Well, she\u2019s getting her wish and she better like it.\u201d</p><p>After grabbing for the napkin with the redhead\u2019s phone number, Dallas joined him. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you. Noelle might decide to kick your ass, and after my huge sacrifice, I deserve a little entertainment.\u201d</p><p>To kick his ass, she\u2019d have to put her hands on him. Hector was totally okay with that.</p><p>Dallas laughed. \u201cI wonder if she had any idea what she\u2019d signed up for when she\u2019d picked you.\u201d</p><p>They strode outside, the cool night air wafting between them. Full parking lot. Vehicles in his damn way. \u201cWhat does that mean? I\u2019m a fine choice.\u201d Never mind that he\u2019d said he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a caged bear. A cage she\u2019s somehow opened. Now the bear is on the loose and hungry. If she isn\u2019t careful, she\u2019s going to be the meal.\u201d</p><p>I want her to be the meal.</p><p>\u201cI realize now that you\u2019ve always kept a part of yourself on a tight leash wrapped in an iron fist,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cNoelle has done what no one else has been able and destroyed the leash. Poor girl.\u201d</p><p>When they reached their car, Hector claimed the driver\u2019s side. He punched the coordinates for Noelle\u2019s address, and the thing eased itself into motion, out of the parking lot and onto the road. More civilians than usual were out this time of night, and he felt like someone was watching him.</p><p>Ten minutes in, he was seventy-five percent sure that someone was following him. He disabled autopilot, a steering wheel rising from the car\u2019s front console. Pedals popped up on the floorboard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s doing?\u201d Dallas asked, confused. \u201cThink we\u2019ve got a tail.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he was quite possibly drunk, but other cars were on autopilot and wouldn\u2019t hit him no matter where he swerved. He purposely made some wrong turns, doubled back, circled a few other parking lots, and worked his way behind the vehicle in question. A dark sedan, windows tinted to black, like a thousand others he\u2019d seen on the streets.</p><p>\u201cPhone in the plates,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dallas made the call as the vehicle sped up, skidded around a minivan, tires squealing. \u201cIn pursuit,\u201d he said into the speaker, then rattled off his coordinates.</p><p>Hector couldn\u2019t believe the stupid driver was making him do this. A few seconds later, they were told the vehicle was stolen. Chase on.</p><p>They soared around corners as if they were on rails, sped through lights, nearly hit oncoming traffic. Thank God for sensors that did more than differentiate between green and red. All Hector had to do was stay on the sedan\u2019s tail until reinforcements found them and caged the bastard. Or managed to nail the hood of the guy\u2019s car with a handy little device that would shut off the engine.</p><p>Which happened in three minutes flat. AIR swooped in from every direction, until there was no place for the culprit to go. They also pegged the hood, just in case. Hector parked and stormed outside, pyre-gun already drawn. Dallas did the same, approaching from the other side.</p><p>\u201cOpen the fucking door,\u201d Hector demanded, barrel pointed at the darkened window, his finger on the trigger. Guy had picked the wrong night for this shit. The alcohol had destroyed the rest of Hector\u2019s restraint. \u201cAnd keep your hands in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Dallas shouted.</p><p>A moment passed, then the metal was lifting and moving out of the way. A squat, fat balding man came into view, skin pasty and dotted with sweat. He had his shaky sausage hands in the air, palms out.</p><p>In a trembling voice, he begged, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt me, please.\u201d</p><p>Hector spun him around and pressed him into the car, then patted him down. No weapons. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get the car? It\u2019s not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom my ex-wife. She loaned it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry again. She reported it stolen.\u201d</p><p>The guy attempted to lift his head from the metal. \u201cThat bitch is\u2014\u201d</p><p>A flick of his wrist sent the guy back into position. Bang. \u201cWhy were you following me?\u201d</p><p>A thready pause, beady gaze angling to find Hector\u2019s gun. Then, \u201cThe story. The pregnant Tremain heiress ... I saw her with you earlier, and I ... here, take the cameras, take whatever you want, just don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>A fucking reporter. He\u2019d known this would happen if he hung out with Noelle. Even though they weren\u2019t together\u2014shit!\u2014his face still might be plastered over the news.</p><p>He\u2019d counted on a bone-deep fear to hit him and make him do what needed doing. Instead, he felt numb. Noelle already knew everything about his past. And to be honest, the rest of the world didn\u2019t matter anymore. \u201cWell, this just in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest.\u201d</p><p>Thirty</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING, HECTOR rooted through the cabinets in Noelle\u2019s kitchen, nursing a killer hang-over\u2014and a raging temper he barely had under control. He should go home. His arms were burning and itching, and steam was already rising from his gloves.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going home.</p><p>Noelle had stayed out all night. He knew, because he\u2019d broken into her home. She hadn\u2019t answered his knock. Concern had gotten the better of his drunken mind\u2014fine, jealousy had\u2014so he\u2019d busted in her door. Set off her alarm. Disabled her alarm. And waited.</p><p>He was still waiting.</p><p>Dallas was asleep on the couch.</p><p>When the local PD had arrived to check out the disturbance, he\u2019d flashed his badge and an I\u2019ll-murder-you vibe, so they\u2019d quickly taken off. Noelle should have been alerted; she should have raced back. Clearly she needed better security.</p><p>And where the hell did she keep her painkillers? A couple hundred should do the trick, but though everything from the dishware to the canned food had a place, and a weird one at that\u2014the brownies were next to the peas\u2014he couldn\u2019t find a single medicinal bottle.</p><p>He paused for a moment, stuck on the food placement. Was there a method to her madness? Like Noelle would eat the brownies, and then feel guilty for her lack of nutrition so she\u2019d go for a vegetable next. Hence, the peas.</p><p>Know her so well, do you?</p><p>Well, yeah, he kinda did. In his almost stalkerish watching of her the past few months, he\u2019d noticed she treated rich people the same way she treated poor people when they reached her tolerance for bullshit. She enjoyed comfort in every form. Clothes, food, as well as her living and work spaces. She wouldn\u2019t jog a mile if she could drive it, and she loved pretending the world revolved around her.</p><p>Hell, it probably did.</p><p>He heard a muted \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d and stiffened in relief, pleasure, and a renewal of fury.</p><p>Finally. Noelle had returned.</p><p>She had a shit-ton of explaining to do. \u201cBack here,\u201d he called, careful to keep emotion out of his voice. He might scare her away before he\u2019d had the chance to scream at her.</p><p>As if anything would scare that woman. Except Corban Blue.</p><p>Stomping footsteps, mumbled curses. A moment later, she entered the kitchen, pausing to glare over at him. His jaw nearly unhinged. She looked fucking eatable. Dark hair brushed to a glossy shine, face scrubbed free of makeup and all the more exquisite for it.</p><p>A short, skin-tight black dress molded to each of her curves, shoving those breasts of hers under her chin. Black ribbons wound down her calves, ending in killer five-inch heels.</p><p>Heart slamming against his ribs, Hector decided not to ask her where she\u2019d been. Wasn\u2019t his place. They\u2019d made no promises to each other. That didn\u2019t stop red from dotting his line of vision as he said, \u201cYour security sucks. You had no idea anyone was here.\u201d</p><p>A flick of her wrist sent her hair flinging over one elegantly bared shoulder. \u201cMy system is great. I knew you were here all along.\u201d</p><p>All along? Hardly. \u201cThe PD phone you?\u201d</p><p>She propped a fist on her hip. \u201cMy system is synced to my phone, so I had your name the second you stepped onto my porch. I figured you had rewired the door. What I didn\u2019t know was that you\u2019d ruined it!\u201d</p><p>Wait. Back up. \u201cSo you knew I was here, but you didn\u2019t come back.\u201d Because she\u2019d been in bed with the Arcadian? The red thickened, bleeding into everything he saw.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said haughtily, unaware that she stood in the crosshairs of peril. \u201cI was busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you busy with Corban Blue?\u201d The barely suppressed fury escaped, too big for even his body to contain. You weren\u2019t supposed to ask her about that. Speculating was bad. Having it confirmed was even worse\u2014like the burning and itching in Hector\u2019s arms.</p><p>He needed to leave before he inadvertently torched Noelle\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cIf you must know,\u201d she snipped with her chin in the air, \u201cI went to a dinner party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor two?\u201d Stop.</p><p>Can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDid the party last all night?\u201d You really have to stop this. \u201cDid something happen between you and Corban?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Anger sizzled in those liquid silver eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re too dangerous for me, remember? And I\u2019m too flighty and irresponsible for you. Therefore, if I want to find my pleasure elsewhere, I will.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell, no. He managed to grit out, \u201cI never said you were flighty and irresponsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You thought it. You\u2019re all the same, after all. You think the same, act the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho, men? Did Corban call you those things?\u201d He braced himself against the counter, suspecting he might need the support. Something was wrong with her. Yesterday, before Corban\u2019s arrival, she\u2019d been in a decent mood. Had even teased Hector about staring at her breasts. Now she was easily pricked, defensive and snappy. \u201cYou can tell me. Whatever happened, I can help you.\u201d And kill him.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you help me?\u201d she said, incredulous. \u201cYou and I aren\u2019t dating.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. He hadn\u2019t seen her this worked up, since ... ever. \u201cStop throwing questions at me, and give it to me straight. What happened last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your goddamn business. How\u2019s that for a straight answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it to be my business!\u201d The words exploded from him before he could consider the consequences, the thought of her with someone else destroying him. \u201cI like you. I admire you. I fucking want you, all the damn time. So let me help you with this, Noelle.\u201d</p> <p>Her breathing picked up and her cheeks flushed, but other than that she gave him no other sign that she cared. \u201cHector, you like, admire, and want me, as you\u2019ve told me before, but you don\u2019t have any sticking power. We both know this. And I\u2019m not going to be pushed aside again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle, listen to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You listen. I\u2019m done with you, okay? We\u2019re done. You and Dallas can show yourselves out.\u201d She walked away from him. Not once did she glance back.</p><p>He stood there a moment, his anger rising. Thoughts flashed through his mind like bullet points.</p><p>He was no good for her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t yet tried the mind-over-matter thing.</p> <p>He\u2019d pushed her away time and time again, and probably would again.</p><p>He\u2019d rejected her after they\u2019d pleasured each other. He hadn\u2019t hurt her physically, but he\u2019d hurt her mentally, emotionally.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t given him any true encouragement since.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have come here, and he shouldn\u2019t have asked her about her nocturnal activities.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t climb those stairs and enter her bedroom, either. But after making sure Dallas was still okay with Hector bedding her, then getting rid of the guy, then resealing her broken door, that\u2019s exactly what he did.</p><p>No sticking power? Fuck that. Today he\u2019d be on her like goddamn glue.</p><p>Steam drifted from a crack in the bathroom door, and he pushed his way in. There were two stalls, one for enzyme and one for water. Both had clear glass walls. Noelle occupied the one with water\u2014and she was facing him. Sweet mercy.</p><p>The sight of her utterly undid him.</p> <p>He\u2019d drunk water, of course, had even washed his hands in it a few times, but never had he seen the expensive substance splattered over someone\u2019s naked body. His cock hardened instantly.</p><p>Wet hair was plastered to her neck and shoulders. Water droplets poured over her lush curves, curling around her hard pink nipples, sliding down her flushed skin, then catching in the dark triangle between her legs.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she snapped. No hiding behind a towel or her own hands. She stood straight and tall and glorious.</p><p>He\u2019d come up here to yell at her, to goad her into yelling at him. Seeing her naked and wet, he lost every thought but one: getting inside her.</p><p>Hector whipped his shirt over his head, and she gasped, her gaze falling to his chest, where his pectorals jumped at the thought of her touch. \u201cYou want sticking power, I\u2019ll give you fucking sticking power. But here\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work. You do what I say, when I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ... get out of here, Hector.\u201d The tremor in her voice sucked any heat from her tone.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me before I pushed you away and you want me now. Admit it.\u201d He tore off his boots, then unsnapped his pants and shoved the material to the floor, satisfied to note they now rested beside her discarded dress.</p><p>The water continued to cascade over her as she glared at him, those eyes silver with fury and arousal. \u201cSo? I want you. Big deal. Being with you now won\u2019t change anything. You\u2019ll still consider yourself too dangerous for me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe, maybe not. \u201cNot being with you has been torture. The last few days, my arms have been acting up whether we\u2019re together or parted. That makes me dangerous to everyone, not just you. Coming calms me down. Maybe coming inside you will calm me down for good.\u201d</p><p>Hope in her eyes, quickly dashed. \u201cOr maybe it won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dallas\u2019s vision might not have shown Hector actually pumping inside Noelle, but it had shown him naked with her. \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to find out. So move over, sweetheart. You wanted me, now you\u2019re gonna get me.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-one</p><p>A VERY NAKED, VERY ON edge Hector climbed into the stall, and Noelle could only gape. This was ... this was ... a dream, surely. She\u2019d spent one hour with Corban. Just one, and he\u2019d undone years of hard-won confidence.</p><p>Do you think about anything before you act? No, because you\u2019re too flighty. How could you drag me into this? Because you\u2019re irresponsible.</p><p>After the way he\u2019d smiled at her inside Hector\u2019s office, she\u2019d thought he was amused by the whole situation. But just as before, he\u2019d reeled her in then struck. Emotionally whipped, she\u2019d wanted only to go home and crawl into bed. On the way, she\u2019d gotten the alert about Hector. Seeing him, wanting him, and being rejected by him for the thousandth time had held no appeal, so she\u2019d done the unthinkable. She\u2019d gone to her mother\u2019s to receive a mental shredding she would actually survive.</p><p>Fast forward to Hector in her kitchen, looking sexy and savage and acting jealous. As raw as she\u2019d felt, she hadn\u2019t wanted to see-saw with him. I want you, but I can\u2019t have you. I want you, but we can\u2019t be together. Crap she just couldn\u2019t deal with anymore. So she\u2019d bailed. Shockingly enough, he\u2019d followed her.</p><p>Now he was going to take her. That thrilled her to her soul, delighted her, excited her, telling her without words that he was in this, willing to risk anything to be with her, but, oh, was he furious that he\u2019d been pushed to his point. That didn\u2019t thrill her.</p><p>His nostrils were flaring with the force of his breathing as he backed her into the cool tile. Golden eyes glittered with menace, making his harsh features predator-rough. So beautiful, her Hector. Bronzed skin, dark little nipples, a washboard stomach. Those tattooed arms, so deadly and strong. A huge cock, pointed straight at her, pre-come already seeping from the tip. His testicles were drawn up tight, his legs thick and corded.</p><p>Any thoughts of denying him drained. Despite his fury, he was taking a chance. Did she fear his arms? Yes. Already intense heat wafted from him. Would he end all association if he accidentally harmed her? Yes. But whatever happened, she would deal. They\u2019d been building to this moment for a year. Finally, she would have him. All of him.</p><p>\u201cSay you want me, damn it,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>Arousal slid down her spine and pooled between her legs. This forceful side of him electrified her. \u201cI want you, damn it.\u201d</p><p>His pupils expanded, the air around him becoming charged. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my hands behind my back. You will not forget where they are and reach around me. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now kiss me, Hector, please.\u201d She cupped his cheeks, drawing his lips to hers, but he\u2019d already been headed in that direction.</p><p>Their mouths slammed together with a desire so potent, she could only groan in surrender. He kissed her as if he was dying, and only she held the cure. His tongue thrust against hers, rolled, then thrust again.</p><p>Mindful of his shoulders, she tangled her hands in his hair, loving the silky texture. The water continued to fall, crashing into the porcelain and creating a sultry background music.</p><p>With a groan, Hector jerked from the kiss. Panting, he peered around the stall. When he spotted the large bench at the other end, stretching from one side to the other, he backtracked and sat down, his arms still locked behind him. That luscious blue glow rose from them, as seemingly delicate as angel wings. Dimly she noted that the water hadn\u2019t cooled him down in the slightest.</p><p>His expression was one of pain and pleasure, and she knew he balanced at the razor\u2019s edge of each. His erection stretched between his legs, long and thick and wide. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Her legs nearly buckled as she obeyed.</p><p>\u201cStraddle me, knees at my hips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Again she obeyed. His rock-solid length rubbed against her clitoris, and she moaned at the pleasure.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put me inside you yet.\u201d</p><p>A whimper. \u201cHector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBirth control?\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m clean. Can\u2019t get pregnant. Annual injection.\u201d</p><p>He absorbed her spout of information and nodded. \u201cI want to suck your nipples now. Let me have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Putting her weight on her knees, she lifted until one of her nipples was poised at his mouth. Like a ravenous beast, he feasted on the tiny pink bud. The moment of contact, she cried out. Such an exquisite sensation, the heat of him decadent.</p><p>He sucked and he bit and then he licked away the sting, his mouth growing hotter by the second and all the more arousing because of that. With him, she felt. His intensity, his warmth, they were so all-consuming her long dead nerve endings woke up and took notice.</p><p>\u201cOther one,\u201d she gasped out, kneading the plump flesh so desperate for his attention. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>A popping sound echoed as he released the nipple and switched his focus to the other, laving and nibbling. She reached down, wrapped her fingers around his cock, and stroked.</p><p>He released a hoarse, broken moan, his breath coming harder, faster. \u201cDon\u2019t. Baby, don\u2019t. Let go.\u201d</p><p>Baby rather than sweetheart, a prayer rather than a curse. He\u2019d done that once before, when their hormones were getting the better of them. Love that. Made this particular term more than special. Made it sexual. \u201cBut I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll blow, and I want to be inside you when that happens.\u201d</p><p>His first time, she remembered. As if she could ever forget. This proud, beautiful man was a virgin, and he was gifting that virginity to her. Reluctantly she pried her fingers loose. She couldn\u2019t help but trace a fingertip up the shaft, then swirl around the slit, capturing his taste and bringing it to her mouth, sucking as she would a favorite lollipop.</p><p>Her eyes closed and she gave another moan. \u201cSo good.\u201d</p><p>A growl. \u201cYou are going to be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>I want to be the life of you, she thought, astounding herself. She wanted more than a sexual relationship with him. She wanted everything he had to give. Now ... and for a long time to come.</p><p>\u201cFinger yourself, baby. Pretend its me doing you right.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids cracked open to half-mast, and she watched his face as she glided her finger between her breasts, down her stomach, stopping to dabble at her navel, then swirl at her pubic bone.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he commanded on a rough, ragged breath.</p><p>His eyes were fever bright, his cheeks flushed. His lips were swollen, red from sucking her so forcefully. Knowing he was tortured, she at last slid a finger deep inside herself. Warm wet walls closed around her, and she arched her back to go even deeper.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he hissed. \u201cFuck yes. That\u2019s the way.\u201d</p><p>That azure glow intensified, but she was too lost in the pleasure to care. In and out, in and out, the palm of her hand rubbing at her clit.</p><p>\u201cAdd another finger.\u201d</p><p>She added a second, stretching herself.</p><p>\u201cGod, baby. You\u2019re so beautiful. Nipples puffed up and pink, belly quivering with desire. I want to be in you so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed to see you come first. Add another finger.\u201d</p><p>The third was a tight fit, but she did it, grinding down on herself. The air surrounding her was slick with moisture, a caress against her skin. Up, down, in and out, the pressure building. Her nipples rasped against his chest in that way she adored, the friction cranking her higher ... higher ...</p><p>Higher still ...</p><p>Until she erupted, crying out with the force of her release. Her inner walls clutched at her fingers, but she kept pumping, riding the waves crashing through her. And yet, even with the climax, she wasn\u2019t quite satisfied. Her arousal remained, a sickness in her blood, driving her, making her ache.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, you\u2019re hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant you, Hector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut me in you,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Yes, yes, that\u2019s what she needed. Hector. Deep, so deep. She slid her fingers free and once again wrapped them around Hector\u2019s cock. The tip found her drenched entrance, but she didn\u2019t press down. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The glow pulsed now, causing beads of sweat to form over her flesh. Maybe he needed a moment to calm down, to get control of\u2014</p><p>\u201cDo it!\u201d</p><p>Thank God. She pressed, sliding down ... down ... taking him all the way to the root, impaling herself. Then his hips jerked in reflex, sending him even deeper.</p><p>A spew of dark curses left him, followed by a stream of praise. \u201cFuck, yeah. So good, so damn good, baby, never felt anything better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I\u2019ve never felt anything better, either.\u201d He was so big, he stretched her far more than her fingers, but the burn revved her right back up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMove on me.\u201d</p><p>She flattened her palms on his chest, felt the erratic pound of his heartbeat. A mimic of hers. Again using her knees as leverage, she rose all the way to the tip, then slid back down.</p><p>Another round of curses from him. \u201cI want your fingers in my mouth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Except when she reached up to obey, he shook his head violently.</p><p>\u201cNot those. The ones you had inside you.\u201d</p><p>Oh. He wanted her taste in his mouth. God, that aroused her to the point of pleasure/pain. He licked and sucked her wetness from each, moaning and groaning. And all the while, she rode him, slow, so slowly.</p><p>When there was nothing left on her hand, he popped the fingers out. \u201cFaster,\u201d he snarled. \u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>Not yet, darling. Still moving with tortuous slowness, she worked him. Until he was babbling incoherently. Until he was grinding his hips against her, trying to force her into a swifter rhythm. Until she was practically sobbing from desperation.</p> <p>He\u2019d wanted her enough to push past his fears. He\u2019d waited so long for this moment. She planned to make him come so hard he\u2019d never regret what they\u2019d done\u2014whatever happened afterward.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good. I\u2019m so close. Can\u2019t wait to feel you come inside me. Never had that. Want that. Need that. Need you. Only you. You\u2019re so\u2014\u201d</p><p>A roar of satisfaction parted his lips, and he slapped his hands against the tiled walls at his sides, arching his hips so high he completely cleared the bench. Her, too. Her knees lost their anchor, and she balanced only on Hector, his cock so deep inside her she\u2019d feel him for weeks.</p><p>As he jetted, a hot stream she could actually feel, she propelled over the edge of satisfaction herself. \u201cHector!\u201d Her nails sank past skin and into muscle, beads of blood trickling down his chest.</p><p>White lights sparked behind her eyelids, and she nearly collapsed against him. Even in the furious haze of a pleasure so intense she\u2019d never known its like, she remembered. Dangerous. Have to be careful.</p><p>Good thing, too, because as she floated down from the high, she smelled the smoke, and knew. He\u2019d set her bathroom on fire.</p> <p>Thirty-two</p><p>HECTOR SAT AT THE end of Noelle\u2019s bed, a towel wrapped around his waist. She paced in front of him, but he couldn\u2019t look at her. Not yet. He\u2019d destroyed her bathroom. Would have burned her house down if the fire had started anywhere but the shower. A twist of the nozzle and they\u2019d managed to douse the flames before they could spread.</p><p>By then, the tiles were already charred and black. His first time was probably going to be his last time, he thought darkly. A fact that utterly slayed him.</p><p>What Noelle had made him feel...</p><p>His body had existed for her, and her alone. He\u2019d become her slave\u2014more so than any time before. Whatever she\u2019d wanted, he would have given her. Anything to sink inside that warm, wet sheath. And when he had... god damn. He\u2019d almost come that very second. It had taken every bit of his will power to hold back.</p><p>He wanted that again. Every day, every night. Now he knew. There was nothing better than discovering your woman was drenched with arousal. Because of you. Feeling her pulse with satisfaction. Because of you. Hearing her cry your name. Knowing she was as swept up by the moment as you were.</p><p>How was he supposed to resist her now?</p><p>And he had to resist her. Until he learned to control his ability, he couldn\u2019t let anything like this happen again.</p> <p>You\u2019re a goddamn broken record, you know that?</p><p>Yes. Proof: Would she wait for him? he wondered.</p><p>Hell, no, he decided a heartbeat later. She wouldn\u2019t wait for him. One, he couldn\u2019t give her a guarantee that he\u2019d ever learn to control himself. Two, she was a beautiful woman with needs. Three, she did not handle any type of rejection well and she would consider his backtracking another rejection.</p><p>Fucking hate myself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to tell me we\u2019re going back to being friends and partners and nothing more, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>His stomach churned with sickness. \u201cNoelle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you Noelle me. Ten minutes ago I was baby.\u201d</p><p>And he would have chopped off his arms to be there again. \u201cYour bathroom is toast. I could have hurt you irreparably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh! This shit again? Really? The bathroom\u2019s no big deal. I can have another stall in place within the hour.\u201d</p><p>No big deal. Right. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point, and you know it.\u201d And he\u2019d known better. Had known sex was too hazardous for him.</p><p>Gotta stay strong this time. Can\u2019t cave.</p><p>\u201cYou said coming inside me might calm your arms down, and guess what? It did. You aren\u2019t glowing, and you aren\u2019t radiating any heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean the process won\u2019t start over again if you touch me.\u201d Or if I touch you. Just the thought had his cock twitching. Down boy.</p><p>\u201cSo okay. Fine. What happens next?\u201d She stopped in front of him, her hands on her hips. The scent of soap and orchids wafted from her. She, too, wore a towel. The fluffy material was anchored just above her breasts and fell to just below her ass.</p><p>Gorgeous female. Even then, after the damage he\u2019d caused, as tortured as he was, his body continued to respond to her, craving her. \u201cWhat do you want to happen?\u201d he asked, finally looking up and meeting her gaze.</p><p>Noelle\u2019s heart lurched in her chest. Hector\u2019s expression was one of pain, regret, and soul-wrenching sorrow. Not about the sex. That, she knew he\u2019d enjoyed. But about the danger he\u2019d put her in.</p><p>\u201cI want you to follow me around like a puppy, doing everything I tell you to do,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed. \u201cTell me what you like about me.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, clearly surprised by the topic switch. \u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>There was so much conviction in his tone that he left no room for doubt. \u201cEven if I told you that twice in my life I\u2019ve hacked off Ava\u2019s hair, just because I was mad at her?\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confessing my sins so you can reevaluate what you like about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve also done every drug out there except Onadyn,\u201d she interjected. \u201cAnd the only reason I\u2019ve never done Onadyn is because it turns your skin blue for several hours, and blue isn\u2019t my color. Also, I went through a pyre phase and torched a school, as well as my parents\u2019 summer home. Oh, and I once stole a twenty from a homeless man. \u2019Course, he deserved it for kicking a robo-dog. Machines have feelings too, you know, but I still kept him from eating for God knows how many days.\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s golden gaze no longer crackled with tension, had softened with wariness. \u201cInteresting, but why do you think any of that would make me reevaluate what I like about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her heart fluttered, a thousand tiny butterfly wings in flight. \u201cAll right, then. What would you change about me?\u201d</p><p>Another round of confused blinking. \u201cNot a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>More conviction. Much more. He meant that, liked her just the way she was. Wasn\u2019t judging her. Further proof: he\u2019d never tried to change her. He\u2019d only ever tried to protect her.</p><p>She would have him. Fight for him.</p><p>In her mind, they\u2019d just proven they could be together intimately successfully, but okay. He required more evidence. Problem was, he planned to push her away. Again. For her own good. Well, not this time.</p><p>She would do the pushing. Not away from her, but toward a commitment. She would have him, and that was that.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing happened with Corban. I refused to let him inside my house, so he took me to a restaurant. We talked for an hour before I left his ass there. I went to my mother\u2019s, went to a cocktail party with her, thought briefly about committing a murder/suicide, then stayed the night with her. The reason I was still in a dress was because I refuse to keep clothes at her house and had to buy something for the party. That was all I had to wear home.\u201d</p><p>He listened, his shoulders sagging with relief. \u201cThank you for telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what people in a relationship do.\u201d There. She\u2019d said it, and he could deal.</p><p>He flinched. \u201cWell, now I have to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>Annnd, here it comes. The \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201d speech again.</p><p>\u201cYou know one of the reasons I pushed you away before. My arms. Here\u2019s another. Dallas had a vision of the two of us sleeping together, as well as a vision of the two of you sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>A searing flood of confusion. \u201cA vision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s psychic.\u201d</p><p>Psychic. \u201cOkay.\u201d Once she might have snorted at such a claim. Having worked with otherworlders, having dated one, and seeing their abilities firsthand, she\u2019d pretty much believe anything. \u201cI guess he got it right because I just slept with you.\u201d</p><p>Hector\u2019s nostrils flared. A return of his arousal? \u201cThe problem is, Dallas will either be destroyed or saved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestroyed or saved, because I slept with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will Dallas be destroyed? Or saved?\u201d she added before he could correct her. Just like that, she understood why Dallas and Devyn, Dally\u2019s best friend forever, had acted so strangely around her yesterday.</p><p>A muscle ticked in Hector\u2019s jaw. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cYou just know it\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><p>A stiff, grim nod.</p><p>\u201cBecause I slept with you,\u201d she reiterated. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Dallas gave his permission for us to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, if Dallas gave his permission, then by all means,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cLet\u2019s get married and have a thousand babies.\u201d</p><p>His teeth flashed in a scowl. \u201cLook, I just wanted you to know where my head was at.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d back off and give him some space? Not gonna happen, darling. I\u2019m coming at you guns blazing.</p><p>On her nightstand, her phone beeped, signaling a text had just come in. \u201cGet dressed, and we\u2019ll head to work,\u201d she said, walking over and palming the device.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to decide anything about our definitely committed relationship right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about denying we are involved in a committed relationship, Hector. We are. Well, you are at least. I\u2019m allowed to fool around with other people if I so choose.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Good. Maybe he\u2019d learn he would live a much fuller, richer life if he just sucked it up and gave her what she wanted, when she wanted it.</p><p>\u201cYou are not fooling around with anyone else,\u201d he finally growled. \u201cNot even Don Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But it\u2019s on you if he kills himself over the sorrow of losing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord on the street is, he\u2019s already moved on and is dating someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not. He loves me!\u201d When she reminded herself they were talking about her imaginary lover, she forced herself to utter a put-upon sigh. \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019re proud of yourself. You just got exactly what you wanted. You and I are only seeing each other.\u201d</p><p>As he strode into the bathroom, muttering under his breath about naughty girls who fought dirty, she read what Tits McGee had to say. Guess what? Fangs R in!</p><p>Ava and McKell forever, she thought, a sudden pang in her chest. She replied: Told U! She was happy for the lovebirds, she really was. And she wouldn\u2019t feel sorry for herself, that Hector was intent on resisting her. She was better than that. Sometimes.</p><p>I bet U look hot! U doing well? she typed next.</p><p>Do look hot, but tired w/ a raging thirst.</p><p>Take it out on McKell.</p><p>Already on it!</p><p>Of course she was. Ava liked dishing revenge as much as Noelle did.</p><p>Tits McGee: So... U think anymore bout turning?</p><p>Took her a moment to decide on the proper response. Not yet, got case, miss you tho.</p><p>Miss you 2. BTW, case would B solved already if I were there.</p><p>Brat.</p><p>Slacker.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you grinning?\u201d Hector asked as he exited the bathroom. His pants were in place, and he was tugging his shirt over his head. A shame to cover all that muscled perfection.</p><p>Better question: why wasn\u2019t she jumping all over Ava\u2019s offer? But then, she already knew the answer. Because of him, that\u2019s why. A man who was determined to knock her burgeoning faith in romance down a peg. But he wouldn\u2019t. Not this time.</p><p>\u201cAva just called me a slacker,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that amuses you? If I called you a name like that, you\u2019d knee me in the balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>His phone rang and he whipped the thing from his pocket. \u201cAgent Dean.\u201d A moment of quiet. His cheeks quickly paled, his gaze swinging to Noelle. \u201cMargarete? Calm down. I can\u2019t understand you.\u201d Pause. \u201cStay there. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-three</p><p>HECTOR WALKED THROUGH THE Markses\u2019 residence for the second time in two days. Once pristine, the home was now a wreck. Knickknacks were shattered on the floor. Furniture was overturned. There was a splatter of something wet and golden in the living room. Rakan blood, most likely.</p><p>There was no sign of Margarete, but he knew she was here.</p><p>On his way over, he\u2019d had Noelle call the agents guarding the outside. She\u2019d told them Margarete claimed someone had broken in, someone she\u2019d managed to fight off to lock herself in the hidden safe-room Bobby had built for her.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t seen anyone enter. So either the Arcadian had teleported in despite the wall shields or the guy who\u2019d gotten in was very good at remaining in the shadows. Either way was bad news for the investigation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do a sweep for prints,\u201d Noelle said. The moment he\u2019d explained what was going on, she\u2019d gathered up a shirt, jeans, and boots in record time\u2014and dressed in the car. He\u2019d gotten peek after peek at skin he\u2019d only just licked, breasts he\u2019d sucked on, and a portal to paradise that had welcomed him with wet, greedy heat.</p><p>Mine. And he was hers. She\u2019d said so.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. They only needed one print, even a partial, and they\u2019d have the guy\u2019s identity. If he was human. Some alien races\u2014like the Arcadians\u2014did not have fingerprints.</p> <p>Hector dialed the number Margarete had used to call him. He\u2019d wanted her to stay on the line the entire time, but she\u2019d hung up on him when he\u2019d first entered the house, as if she didn\u2019t want to hear any fight that broke out. She picked up after the third ring. \u201cWhoever broke in is long gone. I\u2019ve checked the entire house. Will you come out for me? You\u2019re safe now, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY\u2014you\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll r\u2014right.\u201d Click.</p><p>A minute passed, then another. Finally she rounded the far corner. Her golden skin was pallid, and there was a bruise on her cheek. The pink dress she wore was torn at the collar and thigh. Tremors rocked her slight frame, and she clutched a black glove to her chest.</p> <p>Shouldn\u2019t have left her here, he thought, pissed at himself. \u201cLet\u2019s get your injuries checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cSit here.\u201d Noelle righted the couch, and clapped her hands in a job well done. \u201cI\u2019ll get one of the medics in here.\u201d They were waiting outside, unable to enter without permission. Off she went. And she knew to threaten whoever she picked with bodily harm if they mentioned the Rakan.</p><p>Margarete padded over and eased down at the far corner. After everything she\u2019d been through, Hector didn\u2019t want to intimidate her, so he claimed the cushion at the other end.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what your attacker looked like?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She gulped, glittery tears cascading down her cheeks. \u201cHe was human. Tall with a body like yours. A crooked nose. Dark hair, dark eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Well, well. She\u2019d just described Bruiser, the guy from the sketch. So the Arcadian hadn\u2019t come. Which most likely meant he couldn\u2019t teleport here. So close. We\u2019re getting there. Going to solve this.</p><p>\u201cDid he say anything to you?\u201d</p><p>Before she could reply, Noelle walked in with a twenty-something medic following her. He was on the short and pudgy side, yet still possessed a brisk, confident stride.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pick up where we left off when you\u2019re done with medical,\u201d he said.</p><p>The medic crouched in front of Margarete, looked her over, and pulled what he needed from his bag. \u201cThis might sting a bit.\u201d</p><p>When he dabbed antiseptic on the cut on her hand, she flinched. That was the only reaction she gave, remaining stoic and silent as he bandaged her up and took her vitals. Entire process only took about twenty minutes, but because Hector wouldn\u2019t discuss case details with someone other than an agent, even a medic, the wait was torturous.</p><p>Finally, though, he, Noelle, and Margarete were alone.</p><p>\u201cDid your attacker say anything?\u201d he asked again.</p> <p>\u201cHe said... he said I belonged to his boss. He tried to inject me with something, like you did, but I kicked him just like Bobby taught me and got away. He... wore gloves. I\u2014I managed to rip one off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the glove now?\u201d he asked, even though he knew it was the one she\u2019d placed in her lap.</p><p>Her arms shook as she extended the material in his direction. Hector motioned to Noelle, who had stayed close. She wore gloves of her own, and confiscated the evidence.</p><p>She\u2019d scrape skin cells from inside and have an identity within the next five minutes, no print necessary now. Urgency rushed through him. So damn close.</p><p>\u201cHe came here before,\u201d Margarete admitted softly. \u201cBefore you. That time, I hid before he spotted me, though, and he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me now how you and Bobby met?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe truth this time.\u201d</p><p>Her lips rolled in, and she gulped. \u201cHe... bought me. The man who came today, he was the one who brought me here.\u201d</p><p>Unnecessary verification, but damn, it felt good. \u201cWhy did you lie before?\u201d</p><p>She looked down, ashamed. \u201cBecause Bobby told me never to tell. He said he would be killed and I would be sent away and given to someone else.\u201d Her chin trembled. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be given to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d A vow. \u201cNever again. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mean to interrupt,\u201d Noelle said, glee bubbling in her tone, \u201cbut we\u2019ve got him. Ruppert Gordman. Thirty-three, human. Picked up a few times for violence. No known address. If he\u2019s got an appointment anywhere and it\u2019s been logged into a computer, I\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>The sense of urgency amplified. \u201cDoes that name mean anything to you?\u201d he asked Margarete.</p><p>A moment of thought, then she shook her head.</p><p>The fine hairs on the back of his neck rose. His brow furrowed as he visually searched a room he\u2019d already physically searched. He felt as if someone were watching him. He found nothing out of place, though. No eyes staring from portraits, no cameras. \u201cI want you to stay at AIR,\u201d Hector said.</p><p>When she gave another shake of her head and opened her mouth to issue a denial, he held up a hand to silence her. \u201cThere are two other women there, and they\u2019ve gone through the same thing you have. They were picked up by the guys who abducted you, and drugged. They were going to be sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014no.\u201d The glittery tears sprang forth anew, tracking down her cheeks. \u201cI want to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he said, using a tougher voice. \u201cBobby didn\u2019t change his will. Which means you aren\u2019t in it. Sometime this week, his mother is going to take over the deed, and she\u2019s going to kick you out. You\u2019ll have no place to go. No protection. This way, you\u2019ll be able to take what you want with you, and we can help you find a place when the one who wants to sell you is locked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about anything,\u201d Noelle added gently. \u201cI know a girl, who knows a girl, yada yada, and you\u2019d be doing her a favor, watching over her house while she\u2019s off planet. It\u2019s a very safe place. I\u2019ve been there myself.\u201d</p><p>He seriously doubted she knew a girl who knew a girl off planet. Ava was her closest\u2014and perhaps only\u2014friend. Which meant Noelle was planning to pay for everything herself.</p><p>Sweet of her, and for most people, probably bewildering. Nearly everyone at AIR had called her spoiled at some point. Even when she was merely a trainee, she\u2019d had food delivered to her desk\u2014and she had only shared with Ava, no matter how much bitching people did. She went through cars like some men went through condoms. She drank champagne and ate expensive chocolate treats and sometimes left the office in a formal gown.</p><p>He thought back, some things about her finally adding up. No one had seemed to notice that when their computers broke down, they were somehow fixed the next day. Or when an agent\u2019s kid got sick, she suddenly didn\u2019t feel well so maybe her doctor should check them both out, make sure the brat hasn\u2019t\u2014and couldn\u2019t\u2014give her anything. The faker, saving everyone\u2019s pride by making herself seem silly.</p><p>Bottom line, when something mattered, she took care of it. He realized that now. She just didn\u2019t want anyone to know she\u2019d helped.</p><p>Why? he wondered. Because people would expect more from her? Because they would realize she wasn\u2019t... what had she called herself? A flake. Irresponsible.</p><p>Yeah, he thought. That was it exactly. She strove so hard to project that kind of image, then hated that people couldn\u2019t see through it. But then, she also held most people at a distance; that way, they couldn\u2019t hurt her if they didn\u2019t like her.</p><p>He did the same thing. He kept people at a distance so that they wouldn\u2019t like him. So that he wouldn\u2019t hurt them.</p><p>Remember that.</p><p>\u201cGordman has an appointment at Cirque du Culotte tomorrow,\u201d Noelle said, her relish back full force. \u201cTen in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Circus of the Panties? Shit. Hector was ashamed to note he knew the place. Located in the center of Whore\u2019s Corner, the worst the city had to offer. \u201cIt\u2019s a... massage parlor that specializes in, uh, happy endings,\u201d he said, having heard the question in her tone.</p><p>Her lips curled in disgust. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s just gross.\u201d</p><p>He ignored the sudden surge of bile rising up his chest. What would she say if she learned he\u2019d been in that particular shop?</p><p>\u201cMargarete?\u201d he said, returning his attention to the Rakan. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p><p>Her golden head bowed. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll go to AIR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d No reason to mention he would have had her carted there with or without her consent. He pushed to his feet. \u201cGrab some things, and we\u2019ll escort you there now.\u201d He and Noelle had a thousand things to do\u2014and only until ten tomorrow morning to do them.</p><p>Thirty-four</p><p>HECTOR DIDN\u2019T SPEND THE night with Noelle, but he did pick her up the next morning, as promised. Sweet progress, she thought. I\u2019ll have him bagged and tagged by week\u2019s end.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t yet experienced the full measure of a Noelle Tremain seduction. No man had. Too potent. Of course. But Hector was about to be the first. He\u2019d addicted her to the goods, and now he would supply her with more. It was as simple as that.</p><p>He\u2019d nearly popped his zipper when he had first spotted her outfit. Another deeply V\u2019d top\u2014why mess with what worked?\u2014paired with a tight black skirt. Both allowed for easy access to her fun zones. Not to mention, the skirt barely covered her underwear when she sat down. And they had a thirty-minute car ride to enjoy.</p><p>Which they did. At first. He continued to move his gaze up and down her legs, his lips parted as he struggled to draw in enough oxygen. Until fifteen minutes in, when his entire demeanor changed. He began shifting nervously in his seat, avoiding looking in her direction entirely.</p><p>Twenty minutes in, the silence was making her crazy and Hector looked ready to vomit. What the hell was going on with him? This was more than simply trying to keep her at a distance. This was abject terror.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, she studied the area. For a moment, she felt as if someone other than Hector was watching her, her skin prickling with unease, but she didn\u2019t see any signs of a tailing car. The sky was overcast and gray, mist saturating the air so thickly their windshield appeared to be having an allergic reaction; clear little welts bubbled everywhere. The buildings lining both sides of the sidewalk were dilapidated and covered with graffiti. Some had huge front windows with naked otherworlder men and women dancing just beyond the transparent shield armor.</p><p>The dancers had to be drugged. Their faces were expressionless, their movements halting. Noelle wasn\u2019t sure how some of them remained on their feet. Not a one of them smiled or waved people inside. And when they brushed against each other sexually, they didn\u2019t seem to enjoy it. They just... tolerated it.</p><p>On the sidewalk, bums stumbled into the buildings, prostitutes shouted at drivers, and trash tumbled in every direction.</p><p>Last night Noelle had dug up Gordman\u2019s financials. He was paid very well for a job he hadn\u2019t yet listed in his employment file, but he was paid in cash, so there was no paper trail at any bank.</p><p>She\u2019d also gone through the parlor\u2019s financials, and wow. Despite its piss-poor location, the place was a money flood. People really liked having their, uh, backs loosened. Most paid in cash, but Gordman\u2019s sessions were always comped.</p><p>Made her wonder. Could Gordman\u2019s boss own the panty circus? Or rather, run the corporation that owned it and that\u2019s why Gordman got in and out so easily? More digging to do later.</p><p>Finally the car parked itself at the corner of Derelict Drive. Noelle\u2019s name for it, at least. The massage parlor was a building over, on the right. The bricks were streaked with dirt and the singe of acid rain.</p><p>\u201cGordman\u2019s appointment isn\u2019t for another thirty-eight minutes,\u201d she said after checking the clock. \u201cDo we just sit out here and wait, hoping we\u2019re not shanked for our car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Nothing more than a snarl.</p><p>O-kay. Hector was more pissy than before. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not touching anything outside. This is a Petri dish of STDs, I just know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you toughen up, little girl?\u201d he snapped. \u201cThis is where I grew up.\u201d</p><p>Ahh. A lightbulb switched on inside her head. He was ashamed, didn\u2019t want her to see his roots, even though he\u2019d told her all about them. Well, news flash. Ava had grown up here, too. This only made Noelle like him more. He\u2019d pulled himself out. Made something of himself.</p><p>Not that she\u2019d tell him that right now. In his current mood, he\u2019d rip everything she said to shreds.</p><p>Noelle twisted in her seat, facing him. He wore a long-sleeved button-up shirt, white, his jacket tossed to the backseat. The cuffs were undone and rolled to just under his elbows, revealing that beautifully bronzed tattooed skin.</p><p>Darker ink today, with a slight azure glow. He was big-time worked up.</p><p>\u201cYou need gloves.\u201d She dug a pair out of the console and tossed them on his lap.</p><p>A scowl marred his face as he jerked them on.</p><p>\u201cYou also need to come,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou offering to suck me off?\u201d He leered over at her, hatred in his eyes, but there was no doubt in her mind that the hatred was self-directed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without a word, she leaned over and pressed the series of buttons necessary for darkening the tint on the windows. A black film thickened over each one, until no one could see inside. They still had a view of the outside world. Not as clear, but Hector would soon be grateful for the privacy.</p><p>Full-on seduction would have to wait. He needed something else right now. Tough love. The same thing he\u2019d given her the day of Ava\u2019s wedding. Knowing him better now, she was absolutely certain that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cI know you grew up here, but once a gutter rat always a gutter rat,\u201d she sneered. \u201cAs if perfect, amazing, and, it can\u2019t be denied, gorgeous Noelle Tremain would ever offer to suck you off again, now that she\u2019s seen where you used to live.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fucking gutter rat.\u201d He threw the words at her, each one like a baseball.</p><p>That\u2019s it, darling. \u201cYou sure? What would you call this place and the people who live in it, then?\u201d</p><p>Golden eyes sizzled. \u201cYou better watch yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you\u2019ll what?\u201d Pretending to ponder the answer, she tapped two nails against her chin. \u201cWait. I can guess. Nothing, that\u2019s what. Because you don\u2019t have the balls to take what you want. If you did, you would have grabbed me the moment I got into the car and screwed me brainless. You wanted to, I could tell, but you didn\u2019t. You just sat there stewing about where you used to live, condemning me for condemning you. You\u2019re a pussy, Hector Dean, and I do not suck on\u2014\u201d</p><p>His roar filled the interior as he slapped his big hands against her hips and dragged her onto his lap. For a moment, she had no anchor. Then his mouth was on hers, his tongue thrusting deep, and her blood thrilled with sensation.</p> <p>The taste of mint hit her, and she moaned. His cock was a steel pipe between her legs, and the thought of taking him inside her made her instantly wet.</p><p>The vise grip on her hips tightened further, and he rammed her forward, against him, then shoved her back, then forward again. She loved every second, but if he accidentally hurt her, he would never forgive himself.</p><p>\u201cPut your arms behind the back of the seat.\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cShit!\u201d As he panted, his head fell back against the neck rest, his eyes simmering with horror. \u201cMy arms are hot, and I touched you. Are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. Put your arms behind the seat. Now. I need this as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>Though his expression didn\u2019t change, he obeyed.</p> <p>Noelle shoved aside the V of her blouse, letting the material catch on the sides of her bare breasts. \u201cFlick your tongue over my nipples,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hector fit his lips over her berry pink nipple and bit down, tugging the bud, making it swell with a rush of achy blood. Licking away the sting was one of his new favorite things to do.</p><p>He should stop this. He knew he should stop. He\u2019d touched her with hands that could have blistered her. Only reason she wasn\u2019t injured was because he wore the gloves, and she wore that sinful skirt. Had she been naked...</p><p>Oh, God. He\u2019d lost control, wanting her so desperately he throbbed, ashamed about who and what he was, who and what he\u2019d been\u2014who and what he would always be.</p><p>As she\u2019d shouted at him for being a pussy, she\u2019d razed him with the disgust he\u2019d expected\u2014but that disgust had been directed at his behavior, at his resistance to her. Not at his past. She\u2019d goaded him, and he\u2019d let her. Now he was on fire for her. Had to see this through. Couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>When she reached between their bodies and unzipped his pants, he anticipated her next sinking down on him, taking him all the way inside. Instead, she let him go, licked the palm of her hand, wetting the skin, and oh, damn, he\u2019d never seen anything sexier.</p><p>Silver eyes flashed brightly as she fisted his cock. A heated breath whooshed from between clenched teeth. Up and down she caressed, his hips arching into the touch.</p><p>\u201cI want this,\u201d she whispered raggedly. \u201cCan I have it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d A tortured cry.</p><p>She released him, and he groaned at the loss of contact. He didn\u2019t mourn for long, though. She shoved aside her panties, giving him the briefest glimpse of pink and wet, and set herself at his tip.</p><p>Fingers shifted through his hair, and she tilted his head back for a drugging kiss. Down... down... she slid, taking him all the way in, just as he\u2019d longed for. She swallowed his every groan of passion.</p><p>\u201cLove this,\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cLove.\u201d His thoughts short-circuited. There was only here, now, this moment. This woman. Her intoxicating flavor in his mouth, a sweetness only Noelle possessed.</p><p>Her nipples rubbed at his shirt, but he wanted them on his skin.</p><p>\u201cLean back,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>At first she didn\u2019t seem to hear him, so he growled the words at her. Her eyelids blinked open, and she tilted, resting her back against the driver\u2019s console. The new angle gave his pleasure a sharper edge, and he gritted his teeth to stop himself from coming.</p><p>With shaky fingers, he ripped the buttons down his shirt, causing the fabric to gap open and revealing his chest. \u201cUp,\u201d he commanded now.</p><p>This time there was no hesitation, and she pressed against him. Skin to heated skin, and hell, the most delicious torture. She rode him, slamming down, faster and faster, until she was clamping down tight, shouting his name, tugging at his hair.</p><p>Just like that, tingles of sensation sparked in his balls and shot up his length, and he jetted inside her. He had to grip the rim of the seat to stop himself from grabbing hold of her. Already he could smell smoke.</p><p>When she stilled, collapsing against his chest, his muscles tensed and he tried to buck her off. \u201cNoelle, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go again?\u201d she asked with a wicked smile.</p><p>\u201cYou have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right. I know the drill.\u201d Frowning now, she wiggled to her seat, ending the connection.</p><p>He looked his arms over. Holes in the material, but smoke no longer wafted through them, and there was no longer any hint of the glow. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Like she\u2019d really admit the truth, though. \u201cLet me see your hips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She fisted her hands over the waist of the skirt, but not before he spotted the charred waistline.</p><p>He had burned her. Had probably blistered her.</p><p>She must have read the horror on his face. \u201cHector, I can\u2019t feel them. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>No, it fucking wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe are not doing that again,\u201d he said. And he meant it this time.</p><p>An innocent smile. \u201cWhatever you say, darling.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-five</p><p>SIDE BY SIDE, HECTOR and Noelle entered the dirty building.</p><p>He\u2019d donned his jacket to hide his decimated shirt, but a patch of skin was visible between the lapels. Gorgeous, Noelle thought, already hungry for him again.</p><p>Eyes ahead. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to field this one solo?\u201d she asked with a shudder. Threadbare carpeting snagged on her boots. A different porno played on each of the walls, moans and groans echoing from speakers placed throughout the lobby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Once again with the snappy answers. Fabulous. \u201cOne hundred percent sure or is there a way I can talk you into changing your mind? Because I\u2019m pretty confident I came into contact with a flesh-eating bacteria when I opened the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHundred percent.\u201d</p><p>Anyone else would have pretended not to notice the grimness of their surroundings, thinking to spare his feelings. But he would have seen through the pretence, and that would have made everything worse. He didn\u2019t need coddling. He needed someone to prove he was better than the location of his birth. \u201cLittle tip for you. Now that you\u2019re blissed out,\u201d she said, \u201cyou should be nicer to me. Otherwise I might start to think you\u2019re serious about never again getting busy with me.\u201d</p><p>He scowled at her. She smiled.</p><p>Several men sat on well-used couches, each of them eyeing her like a slab of ribs as she passed. Feel so special.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re actually making me do my job,\u201d she said to Hector, pausing a moment to let him pipe in that yeah, okay, she could head back to the car. He didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ll handle this first part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t laugh. At the reception desk, Noelle propped her elbows on the counter, just in front of a girl who reminded her of the AIR agent, Kitten... whatever. A Teran, only this one was mocha everywhere but her hands. Those were white, as if she were wearing mittens. Her outfit consisted of an ill-fitting black bra, wrinkled black-and-white panties, and fishnet stockings with a run in the thigh.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Purring tone, probably seductive to most humans, but Noelle heard the boredom laced through it.</p><p>\u201cYou sure can. You can listen. One way or another me and my guy are getting back there. I\u2019ll let you pick the way we handle things. Easy way or the hard way?\u201d</p><p>A flash of irritation in that feline face. \u201cFuck you, bitch. Only one rule here and that\u2019s customer privacy. Now if you wanna book a session, be my guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy way, then.\u201d In less than a second, Noelle had her pyre-gun palmed, aimed, and the trigger squeezed. A blaze of blue, and the otherworlder was stunned, unable to move or speak.</p><p>Behind her, curses and footsteps resounded as the men on the couches beat feet outta there.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the easy way?\u201d Hector asked, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Now she can\u2019t fight us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we need her print to open the back room doors. What the hell are we supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello. Cut off her hand.\u201d Problem meet solution. Practically skipping, Noelle rounded the desk, pushed the girl out of the way, and did a little typing on the computer. \u201cOur guy\u2019s in room six. With Olga. A very popular girl, our Olga. I wonder if she\u2019d be willing to share trade secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s another idea. I\u2019ll just carry our key. Though this seems like the hard way.\u201d He did, hefting the Teran\u2019s body over his shoulder. He carted her to the side door, then motioned Noelle over. \u201cPlace her hand in the ID box and hold it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve realized this yet, but had you not utilized my services in the car, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle her. Think about that and get back to me with an apology for your attitude, then a poem of your own creation about my amazing thoughtfulness.\u201d As she spoke, she did as commanded, and a flash of yellow light descended over the girl\u2019s palm.</p><p>Beep. The door slid open, and they strode into the hallway. Several otherworlders strode this way and that, hustling in and out of rooms. The moment Noelle and Hector were spotted, the \u201cmasseuses\u201d took off running in the same direction. Outside.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to give me a complex,\u201d she sniffed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>What do you know. His tenor had actually lightened.</p><p>At room six, they repeated the process with the Teran and that door slid open, too.</p><p>Hector eased his bundle to the floor and palmed a weapon.</p><p>Gordman was lying on a long table, face up, his clothes on but open, a naked Delesean giving him a blow job, while at the same time her six arms caressed his body. He had his hands in her hair, forcing her to take him deeper and harder than she probably wanted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the way,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight want to stop,\u201d Noelle said, her own gun aimed and set to kill this time.</p><p>Gasping, the otherworlder jerked upright.</p><p>Gordman\u2019s eyes popped open and his dark eyes flashed daggers. \u201cGet out before I fucking gut you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOriginal,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Ignoring her, Hector flashed his badge. \u201cThreatening an agent. Not wise.\u201d</p><p>Noelle anticipated paling, stuttering, even the emptying of bowels. A nice way of saying Gordman should be shitting himself from fear. I\u2019m so classy! But the big brute pushed the otherworlder toward the door and sat up to right his clothing. The moment the three of them were alone, Hector reached back and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cSo, agent, mind telling me what this is about?\u201d Gordman asked, all smooth and suave now. \u201cI\u2019m human. You have no jurisdiction with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure we do. But let\u2019s disarm you before we get to that, hmm.\u201d Hector closed the distance and flipped Gordman to his stomach, patting him down, tossing a pyre-gun and three blades to the floor. No protest from Gordman, no aggressive moves.</p><p>After toeing the blades as far away as possible\u2014to be bagged and tagged later\u2014Noelle used the hem of her shirt to pick up and shove the gun into the waist of her skirt. They couldn\u2019t match the crystal to the burn marks found in Bobby\u2019s chest, one of the disadvantages of using a pyre, but they could test to see how many times the weapon had been fired recently.</p><p>When Hector finished, he backtracked to her side and rapid-fired questions at their suspect.</p><p>\u201cWho do you work for?\u201d</p><p>One shoulder lifted in a negligent shrug. \u201cMyself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis and that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing inside Bobby Marks\u2019s home yesterday evening?\u201d</p><p>A flicker of surprise passed over Gordman\u2019s rough features, then anger, both swiftly masked with indifference. \u201cWe were friends. I was visiting. Paying respects to his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you knock on the door?\u201d</p><p>Gordman next unveiled a cocky grin. \u201cMaybe he\u2019d given me a key. Maybe he told me to enter any time I felt like it.\u201d</p><p>Noelle so wanted to squeeze the trigger of her gun. Smug bastard. \u201cLet\u2019s see that key.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry. Lost it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d the stupid shit asked, brushing an invisible piece of lint off his shirt. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve wasted enough of my time.\u201d</p> <p>Add arrogant to the list. \u201cYou were spotted at a murder scene, so no, that isn\u2019t all. You\u2019re under arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never kid,\u201d Hector said. \u201cTurn around and put your arms behind your head.\u201d</p><p>Finally, panic. Gordman erupted into motion, a blur Noelle couldn\u2019t lock on. Which was probably a good thing. They needed to question him further, and because humans couldn\u2019t be stunned, the only thing her pyre-gun would do was kill him.</p><p>He threw himself at Hector, and the pair crashed into the wall, a tangle of hammering fists and kicking legs. They\u2019d both lived on the streets, and it showed. They went for the throat, the groin, nothing held back.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going in!\u201d Gordman shouted.</p><p>Because his boss would never trust him again? Because his boss would kill him to eliminate a potential witness to past crimes?</p><p>\u201cThe hell you aren\u2019t,\u201d Hector shouted back.</p><p>Noelle would have sat on the table and watched from there, but... ick. So she stood off to the side and allowed Hector to impress her with his savage skill. And oh, did he impress her.</p><p>Every time Gordman dove for one of the discarded blades, Hector was there, kicking him in the head and sending him flying, blood spraying. Bastard always got right back up, though, barely winded, as if he had a steel plate in his head. Hell, maybe he did.</p><p>Then Hector palmed one of his own blades, and got down to business. How sexy he was, a bit battered, golden eyes glittering with purpose.</p> <p>\u201cSlice and dice him, baby!\u201d Noelle cheered.</p><p>Hector threw out an arm, but Gordman blocked with an upraised knee. A fast spin, Hector going low, and he nailed his opponent in the thigh. Another howl from Gordman as Hector straightened and swung a fist into his cheek.</p><p>The impact sent Gordman flying to the side, the blade jerking out of his leg. Hector followed him, going lower still, and stabbing Gordman in the ankle before he could leap out of the way.</p><p>Gordman fell to his knees, no longer able to support his weight. Merciless Hector wasn\u2019t done. He barreled into Gordman, sending him propelling to his back. With barely a pause to gain his bearings, he turned the blade, hilt protruding from his fist, and slammed the hard, rounded surface into Gordman\u2019s temple.</p><p>Gordman\u2019s body sagged on the dirty floor.</p><p>Hector, being Hector, straightened and kicked him in the stomach. No gasp of pain, no flinching. Gordman was well and truly out.</p><p>Panting, sweating, Hector picked him up fireman style. Keeping his back to her, he said, \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your timing needs a little work, but your level of vicious is off the charts and highly\u2014\u201d</p> <p>A low, rumbling growl erupted from his throat. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking for a critique. I was saying that now that I\u2019ve done all the work, aren\u2019t you going to get the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. No. I told you. I\u2019m not touching anything, and that includes the ID panel. And your hands will need a through enzyme wash before they are allowed anywhere near me again.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, the sound rusty, and yet the tension drained out of him.</p><p>I did that, she marveled, utterly awed. I amused him. Pride swept through her.</p><p>\u201cSpoiled,\u201d he muttered. With affection?</p><p>\u201cI prefer the word intelligent.\u201d She was getting through to him. Despite his fears, she was cracking through his resistance. I\u2019ll have you yet, Hector Dean.</p><p>Outside, the storm had at last burst through the clouds. Rain had sent everyone scurrying for shelter and now beat against the concrete.</p><p>When Hector started to make a dash for their car, Noelle stopped him with a shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s find out which car belongs to Gordman. I have an idea.\u201d</p><p>Without asking any questions, he pressed the bruiser\u2019s limp hand into every ID panel on every car parked on the street. Took ten minutes, and they were soaked to the bone, but finally their efforts paid off. The locks to a black BMW automatically unlatched.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Noelle said, sliding inside. Dirty water pooled around her, probably staining the seat, definitely leaving a ring. Hector couldn\u2019t say he was sorry. The stupid bastard had cracked one of his ribs. He deserved this and more. \u201cYou can lock him in our car now.\u201d</p><p>He did, with no finesse whatsoever, and returned to Noelle. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already ripped the console apart, hooked her cell phone to the appropriate wire, and was currently scrolling through... something. \u201cI\u2019m checking his GPS. He has no known address, and I\u2019ll bet that means he\u2019s been living with his boss. Neither of them would have wanted that on the record, you know. Anyway, that\u2019s the address he would have visited the most.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence as Hector absorbed her words. \u201cSmart.\u201d And damned impressive.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. Adrenaline still pumped through his veins, but his arms were chilled out, and that was good. Being worked over by Noelle before the fight had probably saved that building and everyone in it. Not that he could ever let something like that happen again.</p><p>His grin faded. \u201cCan you record every address he\u2019s visited in the past year?\u201d His voice was harsher than he\u2019d intended. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll find where other women are being kept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s the smart one? I\u2019ll send each one to Mia.\u201d</p><p>A few more minutes passed, the rain hammering at his bruised body. Damn, but Gordman had iron in his knuckles. Worth it, though. Had the guy gone for Noelle, Hector wasn\u2019t sure what he would have done or how he would have reacted. He\u2019d had only one thought: protect her. And he\u2019d been willing to kill\u2014and die\u2014to do so.</p><p>\u201cMost visited place is indeed a residence,\u201d she said. \u201cWealthy side of town, two streets over from my mother.\u201d</p><p>One step closer to the truth, to closing this case successfully. Saving lives. \u201cCheck and find out who owns the house\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d Silver eyes sparkled with glee as she whistled. \u201cWe have a name. Xavier Phillips. I\u2019ve never met him, but I\u2019ve seen him around and I know his reputation. He\u2019s respected, a real hardass in the import/export business. Blond... like the superhero sketch.\u201d</p><p>And yet another step, because of Noelle. He couldn\u2019t believe that he\u2019d once thought she would ruin every case she worked. Without her, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten far. He owed her, in more ways than one.</p><p>Thirty-six</p><p>XAVIER PHILLIPS. SHIT.\u201d</p><p>Hector and Noelle sat in Mia\u2019s office. Biggest office in AIR HQ, but small nonetheless. The ceiling was painted to look like a bright morning sky. Her desk was cluttered with equipment and weapons. A holoboard consumed one entire wall, photos and notes from all ongoing cases like tiny neon signs throughout.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s as rich as I am,\u201d Noelle said, \u201cand we won\u2019t be able to book an appointment to see him. Well, we will, we just won\u2019t see him. We\u2019ll flash our badges and his employees will pretend to cooperate. His attorneys will call us back\u2014they\u2019re always on site, guaranteed\u2014and inform us that Phillips is out of town. An emergency. We\u2019ll make another appointment, but there will always be something keeping him away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus, we don\u2019t exactly have any hard evidence against him,\u201d Hector said. And he doubted Gordman, who was currently in lockup, sealed tight and being kept unconscious\u2014just in case he had a cyanide pill they hadn\u2019t found or had a way of contacting his boss\u2014would give them anything.</p><p>The GPS from the car was considered circumstantial. Gordman could have been threatening Phillips, an attorney would say, visiting his property without permission. Or even that Gordman had been working on his own, without Phillips\u2019s knowledge.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want me to do?\u201d Mia leaned back in her chair and folded her arms over her middle. She\u2019d pulled her hair into a high ponytail and looked as young and innocent as kindergartener, not at all like the stone-cold killer she was.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a charity gala this weekend, and I\u2019m betting he\u2019ll be there,\u201d Noelle said. \u201cTickets are two thousand a pop, and I have two.\u201d</p><p>The reminder of her status made him uncomfortable, but nothing like before. She\u2019d made her feelings for him clear. Respect. Desire. She was, by far, the world\u2019s most amazing woman.</p><p>Mine. I want her to be mine. Only, ever mine.</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cWe can question him there. Try to trip him up, maybe get him to say something stupid that we can use against him later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too smart for that,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>\u201cWe have to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But around a crowd of rich people? I don\u2019t like it.\u201d The head of AIR frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s a ruthless murderer, and if he strikes there...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Gordman under arrest, and our agents raiding his warehouses\u201d\u2014already eight otherworlder females had been found, drugged out and awaiting auction, but they still couldn\u2019t prove Phillips had anything to do with it yet\u2014\u201che\u2019ll know we\u2019re hot on his trail,\u201d Hector said. \u201cWe have to strike now.\u201d</p><p>Heavy silence. A heavier sigh. \u201cI had a holophoto of Phillips the moment you gave me his name. We showed it to each of tonight\u2019s girls. Nothing. Gordman, on the other hand... they went hysterical at the sight of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to nail the man who put such a tool in charge?\u201d Noelle asked, sly, so sly. \u201cThe party will allow us to gift-wrap him for you. But, okay, fine. You\u2019d rather wait, give him time to hide evidence and kidnap more girls, that way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re annoying.\u201d Mia waved a hand through the air. \u201cFine. Go to the charity thing. Talk to Phillips, but no casualities or I swear to God you\u2019re both fired.\u201d</p><p>Noelle blinked innocently, and Hector had to stifle a laugh. No one mentioned her taking someone else, and for that he was grateful. He knew Dallas would have been a better choice. Smoother, able to suck up with a smile. Hector would be prickly and out of place, but no way in hell would he let Noelle go in without him.</p><p>\u201cBy the way. My anonymous tipster contacted me again. He said he\u2019s helped us out so much, it\u2019s our turn to help him. He wants to know the name and description of every female we find. I think someone he knows was taken, and he\u2019s searching for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have no idea who he is?\u201d Hector asked. \u201cOr how he knew what we\u2019d found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>Another round of silence. Mia splayed her arms in a what the hell are you waiting for gesture. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Dismissed.\u201d</p><p>For Hector, the rest of the week ticked by torturously, every second agony. Not just because he foamed at the mouth to confront Phillips, a man he knew was responsible, but because of Noelle. Every day she grew bolder, said something naughtier, wore something more provocative. He\u2019d thought resisting her before was tough.</p><p>This was tough; this was hell.</p><p>He would walk by, and she would make sure to brush against some part of him. He\u2019d sit next to her, and she would play with a strand of his hair. He\u2019d decide to snack, and she would decide to feed him by hand.</p><p>His resistance was crumbling. He yearned to take her up on her nightly offer and stay over. Quite simply, he wanted to be with her, whether he could touch her or not. He wanted to breathe her in, laugh at her smart-ass remarks. And they were funny as hell. A guy never knew what she\u2019d say next.</p><p>Like the time he told her to stop dressing like she was asking for it, and she said, \u201cWait until you see the outfit that begs for it.\u201d</p><p>The next day she\u2019d examined her red satin sandals and with a frown said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about buying two snakes.\u201d</p><p>His are you kidding me \u201cWhy?\u201d had caused her to shrug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d name them Leftie and Rightie and when they were big enough, they\u2019d become Mamma\u2019s boots.\u201d</p><p>Dallas had heard Hector\u2019s laughter as he\u2019d passed by his office. The agent had stopped, looked inside, and though he\u2019d smiled at them both, there\u2019d been fear in his eyes.</p><p>His vision hadn\u2019t yet happened. Hector hadn\u2019t woken up naked next to Noelle, but if this kept up...</p><p>He had used every spare moment of his time trying to control his ability. So far, no luck. He\u2019d scorched dozens of vegetables and nearly burned his house down. Now sexual frustration was a constant knot in his gut. In fact, his arms were currently itching, and his fucking tux offered very little relief.</p><p>None of that. He stood in Noelle\u2019s foyer, waiting for her to come down. Tonight was the night they would nail the slaver\u2019s ass to the wall.</p><p>No other enslaved women had been found, but no one else had been abducted or killed, so, gold star on that front. As Hector had figured, Gordman had refused to talk. Now it was time to see if Phillips would slip up and\u2014</p><p>Noelle glided down her staircase, and Hector\u2019s mind simply stopped working. His heart stopped beating. Her lips were plumped and glistening, color high in her cheeks. Her eyes were heavy-lidded, almost slumberous. Silky brown hair cascaded in luscious waves.</p><p>Her dress glimmered against her body like violets trapped in sunlight, one creamy shoulder left bare. The material flowed over her curves, molding to her like a second skin.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. I do look good in a variation of blue.\u201d</p><p>A slit rode the length of her legs, revealing a mouth-watering glimpse of thigh with every step she made. But the best part? A studded amethyst choker wrapped around her neck. Bondage and seduction at once. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019ve tasted her. Been inside her. \u201cI thought you said this thing was black and white,\u201d he managed to croak. Have to get inside her again. Soon.</p><p>Have to make it safe for her first.</p><p>A wanton smile that started his heart back up, but it was jacked into an unsteady rhythm. \u201cIt is.\u201d That silver gaze swept over him when she paused on the last step. \u201cYou look... amazing.\u201d There was reverence in her tone.</p> <p>He actually felt himself blush like some stupid kid. \u201cI won\u2019t embarrass you?\u201d He\u2019d rather die.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I might embarrass you.\u201d She closed the rest of the distance to trace her polished fingernails up the lapels of his jacket. The scent of jasmine and honeysuckle accompanied her, his favorite, as sultry and drugging as a moonlit night, and his stomach tightened. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to keep my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>Then she stepped back, ending the connection. Her expression cleared, and he had to fight the urge to return her to where he wished she could stay forever. In his arms.</p><p>Noelle had known Hector would look amazing in a tailored tux, but nothing could have prepared her for this. He was perfection personified. Sexy and devilish and utterly irresistible. Jacket, vest, tie\u2014no bowtie for him\u2014in black Italian silk, and he wore every piece with confidence.</p><p>During the entire twenty-minute drive to the old Glassky mansion where the party was being held, she stared at him, craving. He hadn\u2019t bothered to style his hair, yet the results were stunning. Those dark strands were exquisitely disheveled, the locks of flax like moon-kissed highlights. The hard gleam in his eyes gave him a don\u2019t-mess-with-me vibe, especially since one of those eyes had been blackened during his fight with Gordman and had only just now begun to fade.</p> <p>She wanted him in her bed. Wanted to fall asleep in his arms every night, and wake up to him every morning. There was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do to make that happen, either.</p><p>This past week, he\u2019d managed to keep his distance. But every morning at the office, when he\u2019d first spotted her, he\u2019d looked a little more despondent for not having locked their relationship down, his temper sharpened another degree. Any day he would break. And when he did, she would make sure he never regretted it.</p><p>Their car stopped at the base of a hill. Just outside her passenger door was a pier of steps that led to the front doors of the home. A red carpet had been rolled out, and reporters consumed both sides, holocameras flashing bright lights in the darkness.</p><p>The mansion itself was red and white brick, with multiple rectangular windows. The sides stretched wide and wrapped backward, as if hugging the jewel-toned gardens just beyond. Steepled layer after steepled layer made up the roof, with eight different chimneys adding to the height.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready\u2014\u201d She stopped. Hector had turned an unpleasant shade of green. She leaned over, making sure to brush her lips against his ear, and whispered, \u201cI want you so much, it\u2019s like a fever in my blood. Now get out of the car and come get me. Also, I forgot to wear any panties.\u201d</p><p>He nearly tore the door of the hinges during his hasty exit, but when he reached her side of the vehicle and helped her out with a gloved hand, he was steady as a rock, his expression blank, even bored. Good boy.</p> <p>The night was colder than usual, and he wrapped an arm around her waist to keep her warm. Voices called out to them. \u201cWho are you wearing, Noelle?\u201d \u201cAre the two of you dating?\u201d \u201cHow\u2019s the baby?\u201d \u201cWhat does Corban Blue think of you seeing another man?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Hector tossed his remote for the car to the valet. A remote that would bypass the voice and fingerprint controls, allowing someone who wasn\u2019t programmed in to operate the panels.</p><p>They ascended the steps, and Noelle tossed an easy smile this way and that. She made a mental note to download every newspaper in the city tomorrow morning. A little computer magic, and she\u2019d replace Hector\u2019s tux with a bunny suit and her dress with skin, and tease him, make him laugh.</p><p>God, she adored his laugh. The undertones were still rusty, still gravelly, but much easier to evoke now than when she\u2019d first met him.</p><p>When they entered the foyer, Noelle claimed a glass of bubbly from the waiting waiter\u2014a Mec whose skin pulsed with the happy glow of pink\u2014uncaring what anyone thought about her feeding alcohol to her bun in the oven. She scanned, but caught no hint of Phillips.</p><p>The crowded ballroom was something out of a fairy tale. A domed ceiling seemingly carved from solid gold, with intricate symbols framing the sides. The chandelier in the center was tiered, each tier wider than the one above, thousands of crystal teardrops cascading into a shimmery waterfall.</p><p>Alabaster columns opened into separate rooms, some with tables of food, some with artwork on display, some with lush, fragrant gardens. No matter where you stepped, soft music played in the background, blending with the sound of idle chatter and clinking glasses.</p><p>\u201cAva\u2019s happy I dragged you to this rather than her,\u201d she said to Hector. \u201cShe always hated these things.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted, relaxing into the conversation. \u201cI more than hate it.\u201d</p><p>To be honest, Noelle would rather be at home with the man she adored, snuggled up, watching TV, making love. Would that stun Hector? Horrify him? Or actually tempt him? \u201cSo ... what if our guy doesn\u2019t show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will. AIR hasn\u2019t approached him, so he\u2019s probably relaxed, thinking Gordman hasn\u2019t given us his name. And won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but\u2014\u201d From the corner of her eye, she spotted her mother and brothers making a beeline for her. Damn it, they\u2019d told her they weren\u2019t coming because they were too embarrassed by her disgraceful pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cWill you excuse me, Hector?\u201d Heart drumming, stomach clenching, she looked back and forth between her man and her family. \u201cI\u2019m going to run to the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her, didn\u2019t appear to believe her, but all he said was, \u201cDon\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo commanding,\u201d she tsked under her tongue and took off like her heels were on fire. After placing her empty glass on a passing tray, she made sure her family noticed her change of location and followed her.</p><p>As she prepared herself for war, she led them to the far end of the room. Double doors opened into a gorgeous marble statue garden. No one meandered about, the air perhaps too cold and damp. Hadn\u2019t stopped the vultures out front.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>The unfamiliar male voice came from behind her, and she whirled. Someone had shut the doors before her family had reached her. From the shadows of one of the statues stepped the handsome guy she\u2019d seen in Alfonzo\u2019s, when she and Hector had interrogated Brenda Marks.</p><p>He wore an expensively cut tux, polished loafers. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d She didn\u2019t see a weapon on him, but she wasn\u2019t taking any chances. Her fingers reached past the side-slit in her dress and closed around the butt of her pyre.</p><p>The moment she touched the handle, he disappeared from view\u2014only to materialize behind her and grab onto her wrist, shocking the hell out of her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cNo weapons.\u201d</p><p>Threat! Throwing her head back, she nailed him in the chin and he released her.</p><p>She spun, aimed\u2014only to watch him disappear once again. \u201cCoward,\u201d she growled. \u201cYou want to play, because I\u2019ll play. Prison rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, woman. I\u2019m not going to hurt you. Had I wanted to do so, I would have. I\u2019ve had numerous opportunities.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d spoken from her left, but when she turned, he\u2019d already moved on. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she demanded, still not seeing him.</p><p>\u201cMia Snow\u2019s informer. For now, you can call me Anonymous.\u201d</p><p>His voice had come from the right this time, but again, when she turned he was nowhere to be seen. Her heart thundered in her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re also an otherworlder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart Arcadian, to be exact. Now, then. I\u2019m going to appear in front of you, and if you fire at me, I\u2019ll dodge, easily, and take off. You won\u2019t get to hear the tidbit I\u2019ve got for you.\u201d</p><p>Indecision battled with curiosity inside her, but in the end the curiosity won. She lowered her gun to her side. \u201cStart talking. If I don\u2019t like what you\u2019re saying, bad things are going to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>A warm chuckle rose. As promised, he appeared in front of her. She studied him anew, noting details she\u2019d missed at first glance. His eyes were the same electric blue as Mia\u2019s. In fact, Noelle thought, frowning, the two shared similar facial features, too. The same sloped nose, the same cut cheekbones, the same full lips. It was like looking at a taller, penis-toting version of the AIR captain.</p><p>Were they... could they be... related?</p><p>No way, she decided next. He\u2019d said he was Arcadian. Had proven it with his abilities. Mia was human. Right?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m emailing you an address,\u201d he said. \u201cThere you\u2019ll find another of Phillips\u2019s victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the vic is... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis competition. A year ago, he treated Gerard Hendrick to the same pyre-fire as Bobby Marks. I watched him.\u201d</p><p>Was that so? \u201cAnd you never reported it, even though you\u2019ve been helping us? Why would you omit a detail like that?\u201d Their investigation would have gone a lot smoother and a lot faster.</p><p>\u201cBecause Phillips is mine.\u201d Hard tone, determined. \u201cI don\u2019t like him, and I don\u2019t like what he\u2019s doing. When I see an opportunity to cut at him, I take it, as long as I know he won\u2019t be captured.\u201d</p><p>She recalled the theory she\u2019d batted around with Hector. \u201cHe took a woman from you? Someone you love? You\u2019re searching for her.\u201d</p><p>The blue in his eyes darkened to black as he nodded. \u201cIf he\u2019s dead, I\u2019ll never find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s locked up, you can talk to him any time you want.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his mouth lifted with condescension. \u201cYou\u2019ll never lock him up. Anyone who tries to take him in will die. But let\u2019s say a miracle happens, because I can practically hear your thoughts and know you think it\u2019s possible to catch him. He\u2019d just escape. Believe me, I know. I\u2019ve been watching and studying him for over a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t yet had a crack at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t make a difference. He\u2019s always a few steps ahead of you, keeping tabs on your progress.\u201d</p><p>The words left him so easily, and yet each was like a rock slamming into her skull. \u201cHow? Do we have a mole in AIR?\u201d If so...</p><p>\u201cNot to my knowledge, but then, watching AIR isn\u2019t hard to do. Anyway, right now Phillips isn\u2019t sure whether you have his identity or not. He\u2019s content, still doing business as usual. You approach, and that ends. He\u2019ll want to know what you know, who you\u2019ve told, and he\u2019ll do anything to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven kill us all, yeah, yeah, you informed me of that already.\u201d</p><p>Her flippancy irritated him and he scowled. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll simply interfere with your investigation by getting rid of you and your partner and making everyone else too afraid to take on the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda like what he does with his customers, huh?\u201d As if she and Hector couldn\u2019t handle themselves.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d His eyes narrowed, his gaze lasering into her. \u201cSo listen up. I know you\u2019re planning to do something stupid tonight, like talk to him. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Trying to tie their hands, hold them back. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of him, Mr. Anonymous. Someone has to take him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and that someone will be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a year,\u201d she reminded him. Merciless, like Hector. \u201cMaybe longer. You haven\u2019t exactly succeeded, now have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a better job than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Was she this annoying when telling people how much better she was? \u201cWe\u2019ve had a week. Give us another, and Phillips will be behind bars and Big Daddy\u2019s bitch.\u201d</p><p>His fingers flexed before curling into fists. \u201cYou have no idea the shit storm you will unleash if you continue on this path.\u201d</p><p>Whatever. Nothing she couldn\u2019t handle. \u201cWhy not tell all of this to Mia? Why come to me directly?\u201d</p><p>White teeth flashed in a sudden grin. \u201cBig scary tattoo guy is more likely to listen to you than to her. And now, enough questions. I told you what I wanted to tell you. You tell Mia I want that list of names and descriptions of every female you\u2019ve found.\u201d The smile faded, leaving an expression of pain. \u201cAnd tell her... tell her that Dare is back.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-seven</p><p>BY THE TIME NOELLE returned to Hector\u2019s side, the guy\u2014Dare?\u2014had indeed emailed her an address, which she forwarded to Mia with a note about what had been said. No reply had come in, but then, she hadn\u2019t expected one. Mia wouldn\u2019t contact her until she\u2019d verified the information.</p><p>Frown fierce, Hector eyed her up and down. \u201cI was about to start a search and rescue. Where were you?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed another glass of champagne. \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d her mother huffed from her left, cutting her off.</p><p>Damn it! Her family may not have followed her outside, but they\u2019d sure as hell waited for her return, hadn\u2019t they. And they were about to pounce, fangs and claws probably bared.</p><p>A quick glance, and she spotted her mother decked out in a regal black dress, diamonds glittering at her neck and fingers, her hair upswept. All three of Noelle\u2019s brothers trailed behind her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIncoming,\u201d she muttered. \u201cThere will be bloodshed. There will be casualties.\u201d Before, she\u2019d hoped to warn her brothers. Threaten or insult Hector and suffer. Too late. Her mother was a lost cause.</p><p>\u201cPhillips?\u201d he asked, on alert.</p><p>\u201cWorse.\u201d</p> <p>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse arrived, forming a half circle around her and Hector. Carter, Anthony, and Tyler were taller than she was, but not taller than Hector, and that made her grin.</p><p>All three possessed the same shade of milk chocolate hair, but only Carter, the oldest, had Noelle\u2019s gray eyes. Anthony and Tyler had brown. Like mud, she thought with a snicker.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you out in public,\u201d her mother said, chin in the air. \u201cIn your condition and drinking alcohol no less.\u201d</p><p>Maybe this conversation wouldn\u2019t be such a trial after all. Fighting a grin, Noelle drained her glass. \u201cThis is my baby we\u2019re talking about. She\u2019s been ready to party since the moment of conception. Maybe even before.\u201d</p><p>Gasps of outrage, twitters of embarrassment.</p> <p>\u201cI should have put you over my knee a long time ago. Maybe then you wouldn\u2019t enjoy hurting others quite so much.\u201d Carter, the eldest and the Tremain heir, glared up at Hector. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy who will punch your fucking nose into your brain if you talk to her like that again.\u201d Hector spoke without any menace, and that made the threat all the more real.</p><p>Carter paled.</p><p>Noelle stopped fighting and grinned. My man deserves a reward for that.</p><p>She made the introductions, and her mother\u2014the warden of the Tremain household\u2014gave him a look that said she\u2019d seen better things on the bottom of her shoes.</p><p>\u201cI always have the people hanging around my daughter investigated, Mr. Dean. Your yearly income is laughable, and you spend most of it on... on...\u201d Madam Tremain lowered her voice, whispered disgustedly, \u201cprofessionals. Who do you think you are, bringing that kind of filth around someone of Noelle\u2019s pedigree?\u201d</p> <p>Going straight for the heart. Or groin. Wonderful. And the longer they hung around, the worse it would get.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the best man I know,\u201d she interjected, praying Hector believed her. Because it was true! \u201cBetter than the bastards you raised.\u201d When her brothers sputtered in offense, she glared them into silence. \u201cYou know you are. And guess what, Mother. Hector\u2019s better than you. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse us... I see guests in need of a good flashing.\u201d</p><p>Noelle gave her glass to a slack-jawed Anthony and dragged Hector to the other side of the doorway. His gloves were still in place, so she didn\u2019t worry about being burned.</p><p>Concern for Hector\u2019s feelings nearly overwhelmed her as she whirled to face him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Their differing social status had always bothered him. To be reminded so brutally, and in front of witlessness... \u201cShe\u2019s a snob and I meant what I said. You are my favorite man.\u201d</p><p>His expression remained blank. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. She didn\u2019t tell you anything that wasn\u2019t true. Didn\u2019t say anything other people aren\u2019t saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector\u2014\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in his body stiffened, stopping her. \u201cGame face on,\u201d he said. Determination radiated from him. \u201cMr. Phillips just walked in.\u201d</p><p>Noelle paled. \u201cWait. Before we approach him, I have to tell you what happened when I left you.\u201d</p> <p>The story she next told him made Hector\u2019s blood run cold. Noelle was a capable agent, and he hadn\u2019t been apprehensive about her safety. Much. Fine, he\u2019d been apprehensive. But as her words played through his head, he realized she could have been shot, stabbed, abducted, and he wouldn\u2019t have known until too late.</p><p>That was a quandary for another night, though.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Hector took one look at Xavier Phillips and knew Dare\u2014tell Mia that Dare is back, he\u2019d said. Dare, Mia\u2019s missing younger brother?\u2014had told the God\u2019s honest truth. Nothing Hector said would get Phillips to talk. Nothing would trip him up. Too much confidence radiated from him. He was too at ease. Too... perfect.</p><p>Phillips was tall and lean with coiffed blond hair and flawlessly tanned skin. Two Arcadians flanked his sides, guarding him as they would a national treasure. He stopped to shake hands with people, conversed, laughed, but never stuck around, and the guards never allowed anyone to get too close. He made the rounds, socializing. Acting friendly, charming females, and it was clear almost everyone liked him.</p><p>Only a few men revealed their fear around him. Their laughter was forced, their expressions frozen. Clients, definitely, who knew a ruthless side to the man that the others did not. A man who had abducted and sold countless women, as if they were no more important that sweaters. Strange, though, that Phillips had shared his identity with them rather than use a middleman. Made Hector wonder if Phillips had had to threaten them a time or two.</p><p>Things had worked out for Margarete Marks, but Hector doubted many others had come to enjoy their circumstances. Fury rose inside him, sparking the heat and the itch in his arms.</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d he said, purposely not glancing at her. \u201cI need you to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>So eager to please, he thought. She assumed her family had hurt him when, in fact, the opposite was true. She\u2019d rushed to his defense. Had called him the best man she knew. Her favorite. For a moment, he\u2019d felt like king of the world. He couldn\u2019t let her know, not while they were here. She\u2019d stop being so eager to please. \u201cStay by my side and stay quiet.\u201d</p><p>Dare wanted him to walk away, but he couldn\u2019t do that. Wouldn\u2019t do that.</p><p>\u201cUh, okay. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not staying quiet.\u201d</p><p>A pause. A clink of her teeth as she gnashed her jaw. \u201cCome on.\u201d He kicked into motion, and as promised, Noelle stayed by his side. Shockingly, she stayed quiet, too.</p><p>When they reached Phillips\u2019s crowd, Hector shoved his way to the front, earning a few grunts, groans, and several protests\u2014at least until his determination and savagery were realized, then everyone quickly backed away.</p><p>The Arcadians stepped in front of Phillips to shield him, but the confident businessman waved them back and frowned at Hector. \u201cI hope you have a reason for such a rude display.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. My name is Hector Dean, and I\u2019m with AIR. I know what you\u2019ve done, what you\u2019re doing, and I\u2019m coming after you with everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Hector stalked away, a gaping Noelle still at his side and still silent.</p><p>\u201cYou made yourself a target,\u201d Noelle seethed the second they were in the car and speeding along the highway. She hadn\u2019t known what to expect as she\u2019d followed him through the ballroom, but that short and sweet conversation wouldn\u2019t have entered the realm of possibilities. \u201cAfter that Dare guy told us to stay away from him.\u201d Not that she\u2019d planned to do so, but still!</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. And Dare is the name of Mia\u2019s missing brother. I don\u2019t know if the guy you talked to is legit or not, but her brother was once under the influence of a very powerful Arcadian female. A very evil Arcadian female, and he can\u2019t be trusted. So I did what I thought was right.\u201d</p><p>Putting himself in danger, and Noelle out of it. Placing focus on him and him alone. Such a Hector thing to do and something she should have anticipated. Well, now he would just have to deal with the consequences.</p><p>\u201cDoes your home have shields to protect against teleportation?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re staying with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI want the Arcadians to come for me.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did. \u201cSo you can, what? Be hauled to Phillips\u2019s lair and burn everyone to ash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, his tone dripping with relish.</p><p>Damn you, Hector Dean. \u201cWhat if they shoot you in the head rather than take you to Phillips?\u201d</p><p>A heartbeat of silence, then a shake of his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not his MO. Phillips likes to make the kill himself. He likes to prove his power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat happened once, you idiot! Twice if Maybe Dare Maybe Not Dare can be believed. And twice does not a pattern make. Therefore, you\u2019re going to stay with me. But go ahead. Argue with me. See what it gets you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector.\u201d</p><p>That golden gaze flipped to her, tortured. \u201cI\u2019m too volatile right now.\u201d</p><p>Her voice dipped huskily when she said, \u201cAnd I know exactly how to calm you down.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared with his sharp inhalation of breath. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t risk you. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Think again. \u201cPhillips saw me with you, and I\u2019m very well known. He might try to get to you through me.\u201d She wasn\u2019t above a little manipulation of her own.</p><p>F-bomb after f-bomb filled the car. \u201cAll right,\u201d he finally growled. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>So gracious.</p><p>As excited as she was by the thought of having her man in her house, in her bed, all night long, she was also scared for him. He already battled a ton of shame over his past, and the number of people he\u2019d burned. Did he really think he would suffer no mental anguish this time around?</p><p>Afterward, he would remember the screams, the smells, and his fear for hurting Noelle would increase. All the progress she\u2019d made with him would be defeated in a single night.</p><p>\u201cNoelle,\u201d he said, suddenly grave.</p><p>Suspicion arose, and her heart skipped a beat. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t ever touch you freely, as you need?\u201d Suspicion confirmed. He\u2019d already jumped to that thought path. Mouth drying, she peered over at him. He\u2019d successfully cleared his features of any emotion, and she couldn\u2019t read him. \u201cHector,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a conversation with you than have sex with someone else.\u201d Truth.</p><p>His jaw clenched, as if he were biting down, but he didn\u2019t say another word and neither did she.</p><p>Thirty-eight</p><p>HECTOR KNEW BETTER THAN to stay the night with Noelle. Did he have the will to resist her? Probably not. Knowing her, she\u2019d come on strong. She always did, and that was just the way he liked her. Definitely not.</p><p>But then all she had to do was breathe and he\u2019d grow hard for her. He craved her more than... hell, anything. And he loved her. Damn, did he love her.</p><p>His eyes widened. He did, he realized. He fucking loved her with every fiber of his being.</p><p>She was the loveliest woman he\u2019d ever seen. She had a big heart, a smart mouth. She challenged him, lied to entertain herself, could be violent when the occasion called for it, but she was also fun, sparkling, and as vibrant as the summer sun.</p><p>The fact that she threw no judgment his way\u2014for anything\u2014still managed to baffle him. The fact that she sought to comfort and reassure him any time he panicked, more so.</p><p>He\u2019d fallen for her, all the way, and knew she was more than an obsession now. She was his life. Her body was a perfect fit to his. Soft, warm, and wet. Her taste and scent were aphrodisiacs, her cries of passion a siren\u2019s song. Uninhibited as she was, she would try anything he asked. And she would like it. Beg for more. And yet...</p><p>I\u2019m so bad for her. In every way. So yes. He would resist her tonight. No matter how greatly his body suffered.</p><p>Come morning, she\u2019d probably hate him. Another rejection would be more than she could endure. The way her family had spoken to her... When this case was closed, Hector would be paying her brothers a little visit, and they\u2019d receive the same intensive care treatment Barry had. But no wonder Noelle was so insecure about how people viewed her.</p><p>Hector could deal with her hatred, though. He\u2019d rather she loathed his very existence than feel the sting of his arms.</p><p>And if she hated him, she would avoid him. She would treat him like she treated most everyone else. As if he were unworthy of her time. Which he was. Wasn\u2019t that what he\u2019d pushed for since the beginning?</p><p>Yeah, but he\u2019d kinda gotten used to her showing up wherever he was, throwing out come and get me glances, wearing scanty clothing, seducing him, saying outrageous things, making him laugh, never judging him, always defending him.</p><p>What if I never have that again?</p><p>Sweat beaded on his brow, panic for an altogether different reason pummeling him. Shit, he had to get himself together. Had to stay focused. He\u2019d crumble before they even reached her house.</p><p>He\u2019d guard her tonight, and that was all. In the morning they would visit the crime scene Dare had mentioned. Hector might even show up at Phillips\u2019s office in a bid to spur the guy into action faster. That might earn him a bullet in the brain, as Noelle had suggested, but that was okay.</p><p>If Hector had to die taking Phillips down, so be it. No more abducted women. No more otherworlders sold into slavery. No more threats to Noelle.</p><p>The car eased to a stop, and Hector emerged but remained in his open doorway, performing a swift, visual perimeter check. Front door, shut. Porch lights, on. Windows, closed. No one hovered on the property, no suspicious shadows lurked about.</p><p>Noelle commanded her door to open, then exited, quiet and withdrawn. Why? He hadn\u2019t even told her\u2014</p><p>A menacing growl rang through the night. Hector shifted his attention just fast enough to see one of the Arcadians from the party appear out of nowhere, still in his tux, already barreling toward Noelle, something silver in his hand. Silver and sharp, glinting in the light seeping from her porch.</p><p>Oh, fuck no. With a roar, Hector dove over the hood of the car, sliding... sliding... praying he was able to shove her out of harm\u2019s way, even if he had to take a killing blow himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The otherworlder reached her a split second before Hector did. Her instincts were well honed, and when the guy slammed into her, knocking her down, attempting to sink the blade into her kidney\u2014a kill shot\u2014she twisted and rolled, and Hector soared over them both.</p><p>He popped to his feet a heartbeat later, whipping around, rage red flickering in his line of vision. Rage red, and blood. Despite Noelle\u2019s maneuver, the tip of the blade must have slicked over her dress and into her, because there were splatters of blood soaking the material to her waist. She held her side with one hand as she unfolded to a stand. In the other, she clutched a dagger of her own. It, too, was bloody.</p><p>She\u2019d managed to stab the guy, and maybe that was why he hadn\u2019t yet teleported away... why he was lumbering to a stand, stumbling from her, escaping the old-fashioned way.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Hector demanded, so damn furious he felt engulfed by flames. He hadn\u2019t gotten to his woman in time. If she hadn\u2019t reacted as she had, she would be dead. Could still die... that blood... his burning, itching hands began to singe through the material covering them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, I swear,\u201d she said with surprising force. \u201cNow go get him.\u201d</p><p>Hector needed no other prompting. He propelled into motion, giving chase. This man. Had hurt. Noelle.</p><p>This man would die.</p><p>Didn\u2019t take Hector long to catch up. He dove a second time, made contact. Both of them were flung into the huge oak in Noelle\u2019s front yard before rolling to the ground.</p> <p>Hector grabbed the guy by his jacket. Or tried to. His hands destroyed the rest of the gloves and ghosted straight through the man\u2019s body, hitting the cold slab of dirt beneath him. The otherworlder spasmed once\u2014then never moved again.</p><p>Against his forearm, Hector felt the sizzling of the guy\u2019s heart. Knew the organ was in the process of cooking. He jerked free, the guy burning to ashes and scattering in the wind. That quickly.</p><p>Not sorry. Anyone who hurt Noelle deserved what they got.</p><p>Noelle!</p><p>Fear and fury battled for supremacy as Hector straightened the rest of the way. At the same time, flames sparked in the grass, where the body had been, catching, growing, then reaching the flowers, catching, growing, then slithering toward Noelle\u2019s house. Shit!</p><p>Hector swung around, searching for any other threat against his woman. No one else stepped from the shadows. He focused on Noelle. She held a phone to her ear with one hand, was still clutching her side with the other.</p> <p>Pale and shaky, she disconnected from the call and took a step toward him. \u201cWhole crew is on the way. Firemen, medics, AIR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay back, sweetheart. I don\u2019t want you burned.\u201d He held out an arm to ward her off, saw a mist of crackling blue, glowing so brightly his eyes teared. His jacket, gone. His shirt, vaporized. Skin, muscle, bone, vanished. Only that mist remained.</p><p>He\u2019d completely atomized. Anything he touched would be razed the very instant of contact.</p><p>Horror swept through him, but he didn\u2019t give in to that emotion, either. Behind him, the fire continued to grow and rage. He could hear the crackle of flames, feel the smoldering of the bricks.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you,\u201d Noelle said, silver gaze on him rather than her ruined home.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, sweetheart.\u201d Smoke wafted around him, thick and black, and he coughed. \u201cYou can\u2019t get close to me. Not right now.\u201d</p><p>Though she looked like she wanted to argue, she leaned against the car, maintaining distance. Was his proud, strong girl trembling?</p><p>\u201cHow bad are you?\u201d he demanded. Stay calm. Don\u2019t make things worse.</p> <p>\u201cNot very. A few stitches and I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Stitches, a needle being threaded through her precious skin. Another spark of anger caused the azure to pulse. He grit his molars.</p><p>Finally, the medics arrived and converged on Noelle to patch her up. When one of them tried to approach him, shock and terror in his eyes, Hector issued a harsh threat that kept him and everyone else at bay.</p><p>The firemen arrived next, bustling around to douse the flames with whatever enzyme spray they used. They even sprayed him, but the blue didn\u2019t dissipate in the slightest.</p><p>He could have run, could have tried to keep his identity under wraps, but he wasn\u2019t leaving until someone he trusted stood next to Noelle.</p><p>As if summoned from Hector\u2019s thoughts alone, Dallas arrived, sprinting onto the scene like the hero he was. He checked on Noelle, who erupted into a speech Hector couldn\u2019t hear over the chaos of the sirens.</p><p>Hector turned to view the charred remains of Noelle\u2019s home. Nothing would be salvaged, he realized, fucking hating himself. His chest hollowed out, his fears flooding him. He could have torched Noelle, could have done that to Noelle.</p><p>That easily, he made a decision. They were done. In every way. No waiting to see if he could learn to control himself. No working together. No back and forth seduction. No hoping he would change. He\u2019d just proven to himself that he could never be trusted around her.</p><p>A frowning Dallas approached him slowly. \u201cWhat can I do to help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot me with the strongest damn tranq the medics have. Twice.\u201d Without his emotions to fuel him, his arms would go back to normal. \u201cThen take me home and make sure no one\u2014fucking no one\u2014comes over.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-nine</p><p>FUCKING DALLAS, HECTOR THOUGHT two days later as he strode through AIR. Conversations tapered off. Eyes of every color watched him warily. No one said a word to him. He didn\u2019t care.</p><p>The tranq had worked, returning his arms to normal and knocking him out all night and most of the next day. Except the bastard hadn\u2019t taken Hector home. He\u2019d woken up in the hospital, tubes and electrodes hooked to practically every inch of him.</p><p>He\u2019d been utterly shocked that no government officials were waiting to bag and tag him. Shocked that reporters hadn\u2019t swarmed the place.</p><p>Shocked that a bandaged Noelle lay in the bed next to him, sleeping peacefully, lovely and alive, and breaking his goddamn heart because he couldn\u2019t hold her. He\u2019d checked her file\u2014thirty-eight stitches in her side, a small blood transfusion\u2014and left her there.</p><p>A very worried\u2014and very pale, befanged, and pissed off\u2014Ava had been in the hallway, talking to Dallas, who\u2019d been giving her the scoop. They\u2019d tried to stop him, launched questions at him, but he\u2019d kept going, hadn\u2019t looked back.</p><p>Now ...</p><p>You know what you have to do.</p><p>He found Mia in her office, the door open. She sat at her desk, her dark head bent over an electronic file. A soft rap of his knuckles against the frame, and her attention snapped up.</p><p>Astonishment filled her baby blues, followed by concern and resolve. \u201cDidn\u2019t expect you in until tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, okay, we can do this now. Sit down.\u201d She motioned to the chair in front of her desk with an imperial wave of her hand.</p><p>After closing the door with the press of a button, he plopped down. \u201cWanted to give you my report.\u201d</p><p>One brow arched as she studied him. Leaning back, she crossed her arms over her middle. Same pose she\u2019d adapted when he and Noelle had been here last, requesting permission to attend the party. I don\u2019t like it, she\u2019d said then. Now he got, \u201cOkay, then, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Phillips I was coming after him. He sent an Arcadian assassin to Noelle\u2019s home. That Arcadian stabbed her, and I gave chase. I caught him and killed him with my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHands that glowed a bright blue,\u201d she said.</p><p>A jerky nod. No reason to deny it. People had seen. People had to be talking.</p><p>\u201cThose hands of yours also turned Tremain\u2019s house into a bonfire, without the use of a match.\u201d</p><p>Another nod. He didn\u2019t wait for the questions, just tossed out the answers. \u201cAny time my emotions get too volatile, my arms react. They heat. They burn things. Anything. Anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplains a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cSo ... are you an otherworlder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m human. A mistake.\u201d A mistake that had ruined Noelle\u2019s life.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit self-deprecating, don\u2019t you think? We all have things we have to deal with. Look at me. I\u2019m half Arcadian.\u201d</p><p>Took a moment for her words to sink in. \u201cImpossible.\u201d Half-breeds, hybrids, whatever scientist wanted to call them, were ... entirely possible, he decided. In this day and age, anything was. He\u2019d even suspected\u2014hoped\u2014that\u2019s what he was, though he now knew better. He was a mistake, plain and simple.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, we aren\u2019t here to talk about me,\u201d she went on blithely. \u201cYou went too far the other night.\u201d</p><p>Understatement of the century, but okay. Like he\u2019d really correct her. \u201cYes. I did.\u201d</p><p>She arched a brow, the picture of curiosity and pique. \u201cIs that something you\u2019re going to do again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. If you ever feel yourself nearing the danger zone, come to me. Talk to me, and we\u2019ll take measures to ensure you get back on track safely. And just so you know, everyone who was there that night thinks you were doused with a toxic chemical, and that\u2019s why you were glowing. It\u2019s a miracle you survived, yada yada. Only you, me, Dallas, and Tremain know the truth. Also, Tremain claimed the Arcadian started the fire. I only know the truth because Dallas filled me in.\u201d</p><p>Just before passing out, he remembered telling Dallas to talk to Mia, to explain. He should have said something to Noelle, too. He despised the fact that she\u2019d been put in a position to lie for him. He appreciated what she\u2019d done, yeah, but he just wished she hadn\u2019t been backed into that corner.</p><p>\u201cCasewise, Dare was right. If the guy Noelle spoke to was indeed Dare.\u201d Mia\u2019s eyes glassed over, as if she were fighting a sudden bout of tears. A second later, the glassiness vanished and she continued, her tone brisk. \u201cWe found bones at the location he gave us. Another abandoned field. Gerard Hendrick. Buried there for a little over a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you prove Phillips was responsible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And we can\u2019t prove the Arcadian who attacked you was one of the ones with Phillips at the party, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was. I made a positive ID.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t prove it. He\u2019s been burned beyond recognition.\u201d</p><p>Anger had his hands fisting. Calm. \u201cSo Phillips gets away with having an agent stabbed?\u201d My agent.</p><p>No, not yours. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ll get him. The problem is, humans, wealthy humans, surrounded him at the time of the stabbing. We\u2019re asking around, hoping someone heard him order the hit, or saw the Arcadian leave, but so far no luck. And it doesn\u2019t help that he acted so quickly against your threat, or that Arcadians can only teleport to places they\u2019ve previously been. The one who stabbed Tremain couldn\u2019t have followed you, or known you were going to her place\u2014in theory.\u201d</p><p>So the bastard had been to her place before.</p><p>\u201cDare told Tremain that Phillips had you guys looked into the moment you were assigned to the Marks case, that he was watching your progress.\u201d</p><p>So Noelle was still in danger. Would be in constant danger until this was done. Until Phillips was dead.</p><p>\u201cI quit,\u201d he said. He\u2019d thought about this since the moment he\u2019d woken up, and had planned to quit after closing the case\u2014if Mia hadn\u2019t fired him first. Even though Mia seemed to accept him, seemed to think he could do a decent job from now on, he wasn\u2019t taking a chance.</p><p>As soon as he took care of the Phillips problem, Hector was leaving New Chicago.</p><p>As long as he remained near Noelle, he was a hazard to her continued health. That\u2019s where the true danger lay with her\u2014the temptation of being with her. He\u2019d known it, had fought against it, but now there was no denying it. His desires were his downfall. He wanted her more than he\u2019d ever wanted anyone else.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t control his passion, and he couldn\u2019t control his fury. So he was disappearing.</p><p>Several minutes passed in stunned silence. \u201cNo,\u201d Mia said, shaking her head to emphasize her denial. \u201cUnacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a menace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quit, Mia.\u201d He wasn\u2019t working with the law on this one. He was going to kill the bastard in cold blood and end this. Today. Nothing and no one would convince him otherwise.</p><p>He stood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you a few days to think this through,\u201d Mia gritted out. She wasn\u2019t used to flat-out refusal.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need them. I quit, effective immediately.\u201d Next up: Phillips.</p><p>Forty</p><p>NOELLE LEANED AGAINST THE side of Hector\u2019s Jag, waiting for him. Since her arrival in the parking garage, several agents had checked in and several agents had checked out. Each had wanted to speak to her, but she\u2019d waved them on their way, not willing to deal with any distractions.</p><p>Hector had bailed on her at the hospital, while she was too drugged to notice. Bastard! He should have considered the possibility that Ava would wake her up, they would hack into the AIR GPS, and drive to wherever he was.</p><p>Ava, who made one hell of a gorgeous vampiress. A little paler, but all the lovelier for it, with sharp, white fangs and adorable claw-tipped nails.</p><p>Upon seeing her, Noelle had groggily said, \u201cYou\u2019re so cute, I want to stuff you in my pocket and carry you around forever.\u201d</p><p>Ava had replied, \u201cAfter the scare you just gave me, the only thing likely to be stuffed is your face\u2014with my fist!\u201d And miracle of miracles, she hadn\u2019t had a lisp.</p><p>Then they\u2019d hugged and if they\u2019d been emotional pansies, they would have cried. Noelle had had something in her eye, that was all. They\u2019d talked about Noelle\u2019s decision not to turn into a vampire herself, and Ava had understood. That didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d been gracious, but she had understood. Noelle\u2019s heart belonged to Hector. She had to remain human, no matter what happened between them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now Ava sat in Noelle\u2019s car at the other end of the parking garage. Shadows enveloped her. The sun shone through the open pockets of concrete, lighting up the area behind and beside her, but even if a stray ray of light managed to sneak all the way to the car, the windows were completely tinted, as capable of blocking UVA as curtains. Which was necessary. As the books stated, vampires possessed very sensitive skin, and blistered easily.</p><p>After busting Noelle out of the hospital, Ava had refused to leave her side, keeping guard, ensuring Noelle remained conscious. So she\u2019d lost a little blood. Big deal. She was on the mend and steady on her feet. For the most part. And the cut in her side? Whatever. Had worse.</p><p>Where are you, Hector?</p> <p>The conversation she and Ava had had just before she\u2019d exited played through her mind.</p><p>\u201cSure you want to do this?\u201d Ava had asked. \u201cBecause if you want to break up with him, I\u2019ve got a wicked cool speech, only six words, and he\u2019ll leave you alone forever.\u201d</p><p>Breaking up wasn\u2019t on the menu, but she\u2019d had to hear her friend\u2019s guaranteed relationship ender. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust say: I will finance your penile enlargement.\u201d</p><p>Noelle had nearly choked on her own laughter. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be without him. He\u2019s mine. My McKell. I have to try and win him.\u201d One last time, she had to try to convince him they belonged together. No matter what.</p> <p>The look he\u2019d given her just before Dallas pegged him with the tranq ... hard, determined, unwavering. He meant to end things.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to say I\u2019m dismayed that you picked a human torch,\u201d Ava had said, \u201cbut honestly? I expected worse.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Noelle had spilled about Hector\u2019s ability. He\u2019d kinda let the rabbit out of the hat on that one, anyway. Although things really were contained, the truth buried.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think your likelihood of success is?\u201d Ava had asked next.</p><p>\u201cDarling, this is in the bag.\u201d Bravado, pure and simple. She\u2019d never been so unsure. With his spine of iron, Hector rarely backed down from a decision.</p><p>The parking garage\u2019s only elevator, the one that led to and from AIR offices, dinged, opened, and out he strode. She straightened. He stopped short when he spotted her, then squared his shoulders, pasted a scowl on his face, and kicked back into motion.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing up?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cChasing you. You should feel proud. I\u2019ve never done this for anyone else, but you\u2019ve made me do it for you over and over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have stayed in bed, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Her heart drummed unsteadily. They were off to a bad start. He\u2019d just ignored her confession. Well, she\u2019d just have to up the stakes. \u201cI came here to tell you that I want you. I love you, and you need to deal with it.\u201d There. Out in the open.</p><p>She loved him. All that he was, all that he would be. Every obstinate, protective inch of him. His power, his passion, his drive. She loved him.</p><p>Stunned disbelief, then a furious shake of his head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t need to deal with anything. I quit AIR. I\u2019m leaving New Chicago. I\u2019m leaving you.\u201d</p><p>A move she hadn\u2019t predicted. Sickness churned in her stomach. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the house. I don\u2019t care about what was in it. Don\u2019t do this because you feel guilty. Don\u2019t do this because you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>He gave a bitter laugh as he scrubbed an ungloved hand over his face. He\u2019d taken the time to tattoo himself, the symbols dark and glossy. \u201cScared doesn\u2019t even begin to describe what I feel, Noelle. If you had been near me, you would have died. Do you understand that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been over this. You could have, but you didn\u2019t. I could have, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>Here she was, fighting for him, for them, and he oh, so casually dismissed her. She reached out to flatten her palms on his chest, needing contact with him, any kind of contact, but he stepped away, out of reach.</p><p>\u201cHector,\u201d she shouted, stomping her foot in frustration. \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could feed you some bullshit line about not thinking I\u2019m enough for you, say I\u2019m still concerned about my past, or even tell you all the things I want to change about you,\u201d he said, broken, \u201cbut I won\u2019t. Even though I know you\u2019d haul ass and never look back. Thing is, I love you. I love you so goddamn much, I\u2019m a mess. I\u2019m leaving you anyway. Nothing will change that. Nothing. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He loved her. He loved her. Only that knowledge beat through her dread and rallied her. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Hector. Give us a chance. Please.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re begging? Yes, and she didn\u2019t care. She just wanted him.</p><p>His jaw clenched, as if he were fighting with the need to accept. \u201cGo back to the hospital, Noelle. There\u2019s nothing more for us to say to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d he shouted, at last killing the distance and getting in her face. \u201cJust stop. Do I need to feed you the bullshit? Is that what it\u2019s going to take? We are done. Do you understand? Done.\u201d</p><p>In and out she breathed, the air like fire in her lungs, scorching. As she\u2019d feared, he wouldn\u2019t back down. He was ending things, and that was that. He wasn\u2019t going to try, wasn\u2019t going to give her a chance. Even though he loved her.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, tears falling freely. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never looked more upset, but he said, \u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>A shudder rippled along her vertebrae, vibrating through the rest of her. \u201cI\u2019m through chasing you. I\u2019m through seducing you for your own good. I\u2019m through!\u201d She gave another stomp of her foot, emotion giving her strength.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he croaked. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. Don\u2019t cry anymore. Don\u2019t you dare fucking cry anymore. \u201cIf you learn to control your ability, don\u2019t come back for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Bastard! \u201cYou should have wanted me enough to fight for me. The way I was willing to fight for you. I mean, I convinced myself you were different than everyone else, that you really saw me, and maybe you really did, but that still wasn\u2019t enough, was it.\u201d A statement, not a question. \u201cI was never enough.\u201d</p><p>He took a step closer to her now, as if her pain had reached him as nothing else could have. \u201cNoelle, don\u2019t say that about yourself. You are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She flattened herself against the Jag, was shaking her head. Dizziness hit her, but she didn\u2019t shut up. \u201cYou had your chance. You wanted to push me away, well, congratulations. You\u2019ve now succeeded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for your own good,\u201d he shouted, beside her and banging a fist into the metal, shaking the entire vehicle. \u201cI\u2019m always on edge with you. I can\u2019t lower my guard for a second. If I do, I could kill you, and I couldn\u2019t live with myself if that happened. You deserve better. You deserve a man who can touch you. A man who can give you everything you need.\u201d</p><p>You were that man. He would never think so, though. \u201cYou know what? One day I\u2019ll get over you and move on.\u201d A lie, such a terrible lie. \u201cOne day I\u2019ll find a man who actually enjoys spending time with me, who thinks I\u2019m worth any risk, even a risk to myself. But you ... you\u2019ll never get over me. I\u2019m it for you and without me, you might as well curl up and die.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled his eyes, the gold shimmering. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You are it for me. I know there will never be anyone else. And I don\u2019t want anyone\u2014\u201d Suddenly his mouth sagged open, strange sounds escaping, and then his knees buckled.</p><p>\u201cHector, what\u2019s\u2014\u201d That\u2019s when she saw the Arcadian standing behind him\u2014the Arcadian who had teleported in, stabbing a needle into Hector\u2019s neck. And now hers. A sting of pain, a flood of warmth.</p><p>In the background, she heard Ava\u2019s scream of rage, heard the pound of booted footsteps, then her entire world went black.</p><p>Forty-one</p><p>HECTOR FOUGHT HIS WAY through a thick, cloying fog. He\u2019d been shouting at Noelle, desperate to make her understand, aching for her, wanting to soothe the pain in her eyes, knowing he couldn\u2019t, when ... something happened.</p><p>A sharp tingle in his neck, a total wipeout of the mind. What the hell had happened?</p><p>He blinked open his eyes, and several moments passed before he was able to focus. He was sitting in a chair, upright though he couldn\u2019t support his own weight. He was shirtless. And his\u2014Oh, fuck no!</p><p>His bare hands were taped around Noelle\u2019s neck, her skin warm and soft beneath his palms, her pulse racing.</p><p>Horror lit a match of understanding in his brain. Teleported out of AIR. Strapped to a chair, Noelle strapped to a chair in front of him. All of his fears manifested, right here, right now. He\u2019d been so careful never to touch her. And now ... now ... He wanted to hack off both of his arms. Wished he had. They wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.</p><p>Her hands were cuffed to the arms of her chair, her ankles cuffed to its legs. His gaze met hers. Rather than fear or pain, he saw anger in those silver depths.</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said without any emotion.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. Everyone\u2019s awake.\u201d Xavier Phillips stepped into Hector\u2019s line of sight, his expression smug, gleeful, his pale hair smoothed into place. Every inch of his gray business suit proved flawless, not a single wrinkle. He looked as if he were attending a meeting with the board rather than an execution.</p><p>And that\u2019s what he had planned, no question. He\u2019d watch as Hector burned his woman to death. Afterward, he\u2019d shoot Hector in the head. Or maybe he\u2019d just let Hector go, let him live with the awfulness of what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cPays to have Arcadians in your employ.\u201d Phillips dusted an invisible piece of lint from his shoulder. \u201cMakes gathering your enemies so very, very easy.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, Hector stealthily catalogued his surroundings. They were in a warehouse of some sort, emptied out but for the chairs they were perched on. Besides Phillips, there were two other threats. The Arcadian who\u2019d grabbed them and a dark-haired, blue-eyed man Hector had once seen ... when? Where?</p><p>He slashed through the lingering mental fog, scenes forming, vanishing, and realized he\u2019d seen the guy walking a dog outside of Bobby Marks\u2019s home. And then again at the restaurant with Brenda Marks, which he hadn\u2019t thought anything about at the time. Rich people lived in the same neighborhoods and frequented the same places.</p><p>Now, up close like this, he realized exactly who he was dealing with, and wanted to curse. Dare Snow. Noelle had noticed him at the restaurant, too, had said he was the one who\u2019d approached her at the ball, but Hector hadn\u2019t noticed the resemblance to Mia until now.</p><p>An interesting development, but not one that would help him. Dare, undercover with his own goal, wouldn\u2019t blow everything he\u2019d worked for to save Hector and Noelle. In fact, the guy might kill them before Phillips could, simply to keep his secret.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know we\u2019d be there, in the garage?\u201d Hector croaked to Phillips, desperate to buy time, to think. He had to keep his emotions under wraps. Had to remain numbed out. Meanwhile, he also had to come up with a way to get Noelle the fuck out of there!</p><p>\u201cOne of my Arcadians stayed at Bobby\u2019s crime scene and followed you home. The next day you switched cars with a female agent, the head of AIR, and he placed a tracker on yours. I knew where you were every minute of every day.\u201d</p><p>Hector had felt eyes watching him so many times, but he\u2019d never thought ... never known. Some agent he was.</p><p>\u201cI was content to leave you alone as you played at your investigation because I didn\u2019t expect you to get very far. When you took Gordman\u201d\u2014the barest hint of anger\u2014\u201cI experienced a moment of panic, but you never came for me, never approached me, and I figured he had kept his mouth closed. Now I can only assume he gave you my name?\u201d A question, rather than a statement.</p><p>Hector would not admit they\u2019d stolen information from Gordman\u2019s car. He didn\u2019t want the guy forewarned for the future, taking precautions. Just in case Hector failed in his current mission. \u201cExactly right.\u201d Gordman was slime, but he was currently under AIR protection, so he\u2019d\u2014maybe\u2014be okay. No guilt.</p><p>\u201cMy mistake, then.\u201d Phillips reached out, dug his fingers into Hector\u2019s scalp, and forced him to face Noelle. \u201cWhen my prized Arcadian failed to return the night of the party, I knew something was wrong and sent another. I was told your arms glowed blue and burned everything they touched.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry, sweetheart, he tried to project.</p><p>She seemed to look past him. \u201cSo why are we here?\u201d she snapped. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a nuisance, and I\u2019m tired of waiting for you to go away. Now you\u2019ll share information with me or you\u2019ll suffer. And I don\u2019t think I need to tell you that you\u2019re going to die today, no matter what. It\u2019s how you die that\u2019s up for negotiation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d she prompted. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, how did you know where I kept some of those women? Not Gordman. You raided several warehouses before you captured him.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>Damn it! Don\u2019t poke the bear.</p><p>Phillips smiled fondly. \u201cI must say, I enjoy bantering with you, Miss Tremain. In fact, I\u2019ve wanted to meet you for a while. You\u2019re very beautiful, elegant, if a bit of a wild card.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t deny it. But if you\u2019d bothered to check my dating profile\u2014currently single,\u201d she added with a dignified sniff despite her bindings, \u201cyou would have found out that I think slavers are pretty much the scum of the earth.\u201d</p><p>Hector didn\u2019t mean to, but he squeezed her neck in a bid to quiet her.</p><p>Phillips laughed, the sound as chic as the man himself. \u201cAll right, enough pleasantries. Let\u2019s get this interrogation started.\u201d When he extended his arm, palm out, the white-haired Arcadian gave him a syringe. \u201cThis is adrenaline\u201d\u2014a dramatic pause to ensure he had their attention\u2014\u201camong other things. You see, I did a little research on you, Miss Tremain, and discovered interesting facts about your father and what was done to you. What?\u201d he said when she balked. \u201cYou thought that was a secret? Sorry to disappoint you, but acquiring information is a hobby of mine. Anyway, I found the methods for keeping you awake during your surgery quite interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Hector gulped, struggled in his chair, but all he managed to do was shake Noelle around, and he stilled. Sweat beaded on his forehead. He could guess where this was headed.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what is going to happen,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask a question. One of you will answer. When you don\u2019t, I will inject Agent Dean straight in the heart. And just so you know how serious I am, he\u2019ll get his first injection now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d Noelle growled in her first true surge of emotion. A potent mix of rage and fear Hector knew intimately.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll dare.\u201d</p><p>Hector tried to scoot out of the way, and Noelle tried to shove him out of the way, but even with their joint efforts, Phillips reached between them and slammed the needle deep in his chest without any problems.</p> <p>Instantly, Hector\u2019s blood heated and his heartbeat quickened. Tingles erupted in his shoulders and flowed down his arms, catching in his fingertips. A slight glow seeped through his pores, causing his fresh tattoos to crackle. All over, sweat began to pour from him.</p><p>\u201cFascinating,\u201d Phillips said, watching him closely.</p><p>Noelle didn\u2019t seem to notice. But then, her pain receptors were fried, so she wouldn\u2019t know if she were nearing decapitation.</p><p>Fear and more of the horror blended inside him, the adrenaline or whatever it was cranking them up, magnifying both until he could barely breathe. Shit, shit, shit! Concentrate. Protect Noelle. Must protect Noelle.</p><p>Dallas had said it was all about restraint. Mind over mind. Mind over fucking matter.</p><p>\u201cYou were about to tell me how you knew where my otherworlders were being kept,\u201d Phillips stated calmly.</p> <p>Both guards flanked his side, glaring down at Hector. His skin itched, heated another degree. He closed his eyes. Calm. \u201cLucky guess, that\u2019s all.\u201d Keep the focus on himself, away from Noelle.</p><p>\u201cAnother injection already?\u201d Phillips grinned, held out his hand. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnonymous source,\u201d Noelle rushed out. \u201cAnd no, we don\u2019t know who it is.\u201d</p><p>Truth mixed with a lie. Smart. How would Dare react? Hector looked the white-haired Arcadian over first, not wanting to be obvious, then Dare. Still glaring, no hint of fear. All the while, sweat continued to pour off Hector, his heart a maddened fist in his chest.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but you\u2019ll have to do better than that.\u201d Phillips curled his fingers around a new syringe but didn\u2019t use it. Yet. \u201cAIR is a well-oiled machine. Inquiries would have been made. Calls and emails would have been traced. Anonymous would not have remained a mystery for long.\u201d</p><p>Silence. He and Noelle stared at each other, worried, unsure. So far, Hector had things under control. But\u2014</p><p>\u201cAll right. You only have yourself to blame for this,\u201d Phillips said. A second needle jabbed into Hector\u2019s heart.</p><p>The flood of heat was instant, the organ hammering against his ribs so hard the beat soon became warped. His horror intensified. His fear intensified. The itching and burning in his arms intensified. The glow in his shoulders and forearms intensified.</p> <p>Smoke curled from his skin, thickening with every second that passed.</p><p>No. No! Air hissed through his teeth. Couldn\u2019t burn Noelle. Must remain calm.</p><p>\u201cHector,\u201d Noelle said, her tone gentle. \u201cLook at me. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hurt her. He couldn\u2019t. He would rather die. Mind over matter. MIND OVER MATTER.</p><p>The glow continued to brighten ... brighten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cAnd I want a name,\u201d Phillips said smoothly.</p><p>Both voices were a blur of noise inside Hector\u2019s head. Mind over matter. He chanted the phrase over and over. He would not hurt Noelle. She was his love, his life. HE WOULD NOT HURT HER.</p><p>Every muscle he possessed bunched and strained. He would not hurt her. He would not fucking hurt her. More sweat poured from him, little rivers all over his body. Okay, okay. So he couldn\u2019t control his emotions or his body\u2019s reactions. But maybe he could move them. He attempted to channel all the heat into his chest, away from Noelle, imagining sucking it there like a vacuum.</p><p>To his amazement, the itching in his arms just ... stopped. The heat even muted. His chest was a different story. The itching and the heating erupted there.</p><p>Noelle blinked in astonishment. She felt it, then; it wasn\u2019t just his imagination. She felt the ease from fire pit to over-warm bath.</p><p>Hector kept sucking on the heat, letting it pool around his heart, burning and crackling there. I can do this, he realized. And if he could redirect the burn ...</p><p>Phillips said something else. When there was no reply, he held out his hand for another syringe. Frowning, saying something else, he slammed that third syringe home.</p><p>Hector released an animalistic roar\u2014and channeled the heat into the needle, into the hand holding it. Shoving, shoving desperately, pushing every ember out of him, holding nothing inside.</p><p>Whether the act would work, he didn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>Phillips released his own roar as the plastic syringe instantly melded to his hand. Eyes wide with pain, rasping shallowly, trembling, he stumbled away, fell to his ass. He issued commands, or tried to, his words jumbled. His guards scrambled to him, trying to help him rather than ensuring the captives remained in place.</p><p>A new tidal wave of adrenaline filled Hector. His sweating increased yet again, and so did the burn. But so did his strength. A side effect Phillips probably hadn\u2019t considered. As he drew the heat into his chest, he gritted his teeth and ripped at the thick adhesive holding him to Noelle. Weakened from the extreme temperatures, the tape split apart, and suddenly Hector was free.</p><p>He allowed himself a brief look at Noelle\u2019s neck\u2014red, blistered, but otherwise fine\u2014before he shoved the guards out of the way and leapt on top of Phillips, grabbing him by the neck. Hector released the mental bonds on the fury and the heat, and his arms lit up, two inextinguishable bonfires.</p><p>Phillips struggled against him, mouth flailing open and closed, eyes tearing\u2014until his head detached from his body. Both his head and his body erupted into flames a second later. Burning ... burning ...</p><p>Dare punted Hector in the side, trying to force him off the bastard, but it was too late. Satisfaction washed through Hector. Phillips would never abduct or sell another female, and Noelle would be safe now. Even from him. Hector hadn\u2019t hurt her, even while jacked up on emotion. Even with his hands shackled around her neck.</p><p>Suddenly the side door burst open and armed AIR agents flooded inside. People were shouting commands, but Hector still couldn\u2019t make out individual words.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t quite catch his breath and his arms were still blue and glowing. He scooted back, out of Noelle\u2019s path so that the agents could get to her. The white-haired Arcadian vanished in one blink, and Dare in the next. Now that Phillips was dead, the Arcadian would be Dare\u2019s only link to whomever he searched for.</p><p>Concentrating with everything he had, Hector willed his arms back to normal, channeling the heat through his entire being, spreading it out, letting it seep through his pores like mist. Took several minutes, but the glow finally began to fade, the burn to subside.</p><p>Even though he\u2019d been controlling the ability for several minutes, an eternity surely, his success still managed to shock him. He\u2019d never dreamed ... had always hoped ... yet had always found disappointment. Now ... he could trust himself around Noelle. Beyond a doubt, he could be with her safely.</p><p>Joy ripped through him, as unstoppable as an avalanche.</p><p>Whatever she wanted from him, he would give her. An apology? Begging? Whatever she needed, he would supply. They would be together. Yes, she\u2019d told him they were done if he pushed her away. But that was before this, before he\u2019d proven himself. And she loved him. Just as he was, she loved him. Noelle was not a woman to love lightly.</p><p>He dragged himself to his feet. His clothes were singed and still smoking. His muscles twitched with energy, his heart beating so swiftly and with such force he feared it would burst through his chest at any second. \u201cNoelle.\u201d Where was\u2014</p><p>There. She had her back to him and her arms around Ava.</p><p>\u201cNoelle.\u201d</p><p>Twisting, she met his gaze. Her expression was blank, and he experienced a kernel of unease. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He closed the distance between them, so desperate to touch her, to finally hold her as he\u2019d always fantasized about, he could barely contain himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. And hey, thanks for not killing me,\u201d she said with a bland smile. Then she returned her attention to Ava and the pair strutted out of the warehouse.</p><p>Forty-two</p><p>NO MATTER WHAT HECTOR did or said the next few weeks, Noelle wanted nothing to do with him. She never gave him anything more than that bland smile. Once, she\u2019d even patted him on the top of his head and pinched his cheek like she\u2019d done to Dallas that first day of camp.</p><p>A lesser man would have given up. There was stubborn, and then there was I\u2019d rather die. Noelle bypassed even that. But Hector wasn\u2019t a lesser man. Noelle had chased him, and now he was chasing her. That was only fair.</p><p>For too long, he\u2019d just accepted the fact that he couldn\u2019t be with anyone. Then she\u2019d come along and screwed with his head, his body (thank God for that!), and his heart. Now she had to live with the consequences. Because bottom line? He wouldn\u2019t live without her.</p><p>He was from the streets, something he\u2019d once considered a stumbling block between them. Well, no more. Over the years he\u2019d learned how to break the rules, and that\u2019s exactly what he planned to do with her.</p><p>Noelle spent all of her time furnishing her new home, as well as recovering from the stitches in her side and minor burns on her neck. Though she\u2019d told only Ava her new address, Hector had found her and had showed up the very day she\u2019d moved in.</p><p>After discovering out how he\u2019d done it\u2014AIR had pegged them both with the isotope tracker while they were laid flat in the hospital, which was how they\u2019d come to the \u201crescue\u201d that day in the warehouse\u2014she\u2019d shut the door in his face.</p><p>Same thing the next night, and the next. Seeing him hurt her soul-deep. So talk to him? Hell, no.</p><p>She had warned him. Let her go again, and lose her forever. At the time, he\u2019d been okay with that. Just because he\u2019d changed his mind didn\u2019t mean she would change hers.</p><p>He\u2019d proven to himself that he wouldn\u2019t hurt her. So what. He could touch her without fear now. So what, she thought as longing swept through her. He\u2019d pushed her away one too many times. Had broken her heart into a thousand pieces he could never hope to patch up.</p><p>And any time she thought she would cave, she just reminded herself that he could change his mind yet again. He could decide he was still too dangerous and leave her. Not going through this again.</p><p>She climbed the steps of her new porch, used the ID pad to let herself in. Night had fallen, and she\u2019d forgotten to program the lights to switch on automatically. She\u2019d spent the day with Ava, who\u2019d kicked McKell out of their apartment and to his man cave so that Noelle could be pampered in peace.</p><p>In her living room, she patted the walls until she found the light switch. Took her forever, because she hadn\u2019t yet learned the layout of the place. Hadn\u2019t had voice recognition software installed, either, so that she would only have to speak a command for things to happen. Finally, her finger caught on the switch and light chased all the shadows away.</p><p>Hector sat on her new couch, gorgeous as always. Black hair unkempt, shirt wrinkled and rolled up to his elbows, his pants dirt-stained. His arms were bared, without gloves. His tattoos were dark, freshly applied\u2014but those tattoos weren\u2019t symbols for peace. Her name was scripted on every inch of visible skin, from fingertips to elbow. Her heart gave a leap. Stay strong. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Golden eyes pierced her. \u201cForcing you to listen to me. I\u2019m sorry. I am so sorry for nearly leaving you.\u201d</p><p>Another leap. \u201cNearly leaving me? Ha! You did. Your apology is too late. I\u2019ve moved on.\u201d</p><p>He flinched, then quickly rallied. Determination wafted from him.</p><p>\u201cI heard you quit AIR,\u201d she said, trying for a breezy tone. When she returned to work, she and Ava would be partners. They would work the night shift. Together, as they\u2019d always dreamed.</p><p>As thrilled as Noelle was, she hated the thought of working without Hector.</p><p>\u201cMia hired me back,\u201d he said. \u201cPaired me with Dallas. We\u2019ll be working the night shift, too.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d checked up on her. I will stay strong, damn it. \u201cThat\u2019s cool. Whatever. I\u2019m sure Ava and me will be kicking so much ass, we\u2019ll never be in the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPredators should be afraid.\u201d His features softened. \u201cI also came to tell you that I love you. With everything that I am, I love you. Just the way you are. I don\u2019t want you to change. I just want you to be with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And yet another leap in her chest. Strong. \u201cLike I said, you\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you really need to go.\u201d Before she broke down in front of him.</p> <p>Hands fisted, he stood. \u201cYou were always enough for me, but I was never enough for you, and I know that. I\u2019m not talking about my past, either. Because I\u2019m the best man you know. You said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat just means I have the chance to change it back. Just give me a chance. Please.\u201d</p><p>Strong, strong, strong. \u201cI told you nothing you said would make a difference, that if you pushed me away you\u2019d lose me. You pushed me away. We\u2019re done, that\u2019s what you said.\u201d</p><p>Shame fell over his face, a curtain. \u201cI will never forgive myself for that. I was stupid and afraid, thinking to protect you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInstead, you broke my heart. Hurt me worse than anyone ever has.\u201d Tears burned the back of her eyes. \u201cAnd one day you\u2019ll be stupid and afraid again. You\u2019ll accidentally burn me and the risk will be too much for you.\u201d She spun around, facing the foyer before those damn tears started falling. She\u2019d cried in front of him once; she wouldn\u2019t do it a second time. \u201cGood-bye, Hector. You can see yourself out.\u201d</p><p>Just as she\u2019d done in the warehouse, she walked away from him without ever looking back. She pounded up the stairs, her heart breaking all over again. He\u2019d just offered her the world, everything she\u2019d ever wanted, and she\u2019d basically said no thanks.</p><p>Had to be this way.</p><p>A tear at last fell, followed quickly by another. When she reached her bedroom, she flipped on the light. There was her new bed, an oversize king with the softest cotton sheets. Red, one of her best colors. Hector would never enjoy her there. She would never enjoy him there. Never\u2014</p><p>A pound of furious footsteps behind her. A gasp catching in her throat, she swung around. A scowling Hector rounded the corner. Without a word, he increased his speed, picked her up and launched her backward. She bounced on the mattress. Before she could right herself, he had her pinned.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he snarled down at her, \u201cand I\u2019m not letting you go again. Ever. For any reason. Not even your reasons. I should have listened to you, and you can forever hold that over my head. You can remind me at every holiday and every time I leave my socks on the floor. I\u2019ll deserve it. I should have stuck around, rather than giving in to my fears. But now you\u2019re doing the same thing. Cutting and running because you\u2019re afraid. I understand, I do, but you better listen up, baby. You once had to chase and seduce me. Now I\u2019m chasing and seducing you. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing, but clearly I need to step up my game the way you stepped up yours.\u201d</p> <p>His lips smashed into hers, and his tongue swept inside her mouth. He tasted of mint, just like before, and she moaned as desire began to burn through her sorrow.</p><p>His hands ... his hands stripped her, stripped himself, and then caressed her everywhere. He left no place untouched, was worshipping her. His fingertips learned her face. Kneaded her breasts. Traced over her stomach, her legs, even her feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do this since the moment I met you,\u201d he whispered fiercely. \u201cYou\u2019re so soft, so warm. So sweet. Spread for me, baby. Please. I need to put my fingers in you.\u201d</p><p>Passion fogged her brain, and she obeyed without thought, needing him, loving him.</p><p>One thick finger slid inside her. \u201cOh, damn, baby. You feel so good. Better than I imagined. And I imagined doing this to you every damn night.\u201d Another thick finger entered her.</p><p>Groaning at the erotic sensation, she arched her hips, sending him deeper. A third finger joined the others. His skin was hotter than a normal man\u2019s, but that\u2019s what she needed. She felt him there, so wonderfully deep, arousing her in the most beautiful way.</p><p>\u201cI want to do this to you every night, want to wake you up this way every morning. And if not with my fingers, with my mouth. I want you all over me, in me. You were right, baby. You\u2019re it for me. There\u2019s no one else. There\u2019s never been anyone else and there will never be anyone else. Just you. Only you.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, he rocked those wanton fingers inside her, surging in, pulling out, until she was sobbing, desperate for relief. Then he scissored them, stretching her, and the sensation was so strong, so amazing, she had to grip his shoulders to keep herself from flying off the bed.</p> <p>\u201cI want to feel you this way,\u201d he rasped, \u201ccoming on my fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>In, out, slow, so slow, then faster, faster. Then his thumb brushed over her clit, and she shot off like a rocket, spasming around those fingers still pumping in her, sending her over a second time. She cried out at the bliss, the utter rightness.</p><p>\u201cHector! More, give me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d He moved on top of her, his cock sinking inside her, his chest pressing against hers. Her legs wrapped around his waist. His mouth returned to hers, his kiss now slow and drugging. He tangled his fingers in her hair, angling her head. Touching her, always touching her.</p><p>He made love to her as if he needed to savor her. As if he didn\u2019t want to move too quickly for fear of scaring her away or ending things before he\u2019d gotten enough. As if she were everything to him.</p><p>One of his hands moved down, down, plucked at her nipple, making her shiver, then slid between their bodies and found her most sensitive place. He rubbed as he continued stroking in and out, finally picking up the pace, just a little faster ... faster.</p><p>Her muscles clenched, readying for another release. He pressed harder, and she shot off again, this climax so intense she left claw marks in his back. \u201cHector!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoelle, my Noelle.\u201d Just like that, he erupted, her name roaring from his mouth, his hot seed shooting inside her.</p><p>When he collapsed on top of her, he immediately rolled to the side so that she could breathe, but he didn\u2019t allow any separation between their bodies. He held her tightly, panting, sweat sheening them both.</p><p>\u201cBaby, please. Tell me you still love me.\u201d He cupped her cheek, his thumb tracing the rise of the bone. \u201cTell me you\u2019ll give me another chance, just one more, and I\u2019ll do everything in my power to make you happy. I swear I will. And I will never leave you, never change my mind,\u201d he added in a rush before she could reply. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be without you. I can deal with anything but that.\u201d</p><p>She felt his heart beating against her ear, pounding in an uncontrolled rhythm.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t done. \u201cI\u2019ve been working with my arms, and I\u2019ve got control. It\u2019s all about channeling the heat. I can atomize my entire body now, keeping the flames inside. I can also release the heat in continuous, manageable streams, all the time, so that I never overheat and catch fire if I don\u2019t want. Am I still a little scared I\u2019ll hurt you? Yes. And if I accidentally burn you, I\u2019ll be even more scared, but we\u2019ll work through it together.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>She traced her fingertip along the letters of her name, the one on the top of his palm. \u201cI meant what I said. You really hurt me, Hector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said sadly. \u201cOf all the things I\u2019ve done in my life, that\u2019s the one I would change first. You are everything to me.\u201d When she remained quiet, he added, \u201cI will never try to change you. I love you exactly how you are. You\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she said, her heart singing. She could forgive him and have this, she thought, weighing her options. Could have him and his body and his intensity now and forever. Or, she could send him away, unable to get past what he\u2019d done, and go to bed cold and alone. Again, forever.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t run if things got bad with his arms; she believed him about that. He\u2019d always told her the truth; even when he\u2019d broken things off, he\u2019d told her the real reason, refusing to \u201cfeed her bullshit.\u201d So ... was there really a need to think things through?</p><p>\u201cHow about this?\u201d he said, clearly about to do a little manipulating. \u201cBe with me, if only to convince everyone at AIR that I\u2019m not gay. Did you know everyone thought that? The other day, Phoenix tried to set me up with one of her boyfriend\u2019s friends. Also, you took my virginity. If you dump me, I\u2019ll have to tell everyone you\u2019re a skeevy user.\u201d</p><p>Holding in her giggles proved to be a struggle. \u201cAll right. But only to convince everyone of your straightness. And you\u2019ll have to marry me,\u201d she said. \u201cI want a legal right to boss you around. And you\u2019ll sign an agreement stating that if you ever want to end things, I get custody of your soul. That is nonnegotiable. Actually, go ahead and just hand over your soul right now. I get it no matter what.\u201d</p><p>He jerked upright and peered down at her, hope making him radiant. \u201cYou mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A wave of tenderness swept through her. He\u2019d never looked so happy, so relaxed. \u201cI am going to boss you around, no question.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked at the corners. \u201cNot about that. I know that. About marriage.\u201d</p><p>Trembling, she reached up and cupped his jaw. \u201cYes. I think Hector Tremain has a nice ring to it, don\u2019t you? Besides, it\u2019s time you made an honest woman of me and supported your fake kid.\u201d</p><p>A bark of laughter as he swooped down for another kiss. \u201cTwins, baby. We\u2019re having twins. And I knew those kids were mine. By the way, there\u2019s a ring in my pants pocket.\u201d</p><p>Rusty as his laughter was, it delighted her. Noelle didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever been this happy before. She was loved, cherished, accepted, adored. But the best part? She was understood. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I was going to chase you around like a puppy until you caved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see it.\u201d</p><p>Another kiss, one that turned so heated they began grinding together, making love again, his hands all over her, relearning her, worshipping her as she had always deserved\u2014Hector would be the first to declare how true that was, she was just sure of it\u2014and finally climaxing together.</p><p>Afterward, she wondered if, when she and Hector woke up the next morning, because he was staying the night, damn it, and he was going to snuggle the hell out of her, if that would mean Dallas\u2019s vision had finally come true. If the countdown to his salvation\u2014or damnation\u2014would begin.</p><p>They\u2019d soon find out.</p><p>Hector finally made it to his pants and grabbed the ring. When he returned to the bed, watching her with such loving adoration and longing that her chest ached in the best way possible, she couldn\u2019t keep her hands off him and had to climb into his lap.</p><p>\u201cShow me!\u201d she demanded greedily.</p><p>He rested against the headboard, the ring enclosed in his fist. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, I can always exchange it.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he opened his fingers. A skull and crossbones with diamonds for eyes rested in his palm, and she utterly melted. \u201cOh, Hector. My mother is going to have a heart attack when she sees this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I can exchange\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare! I love it! It\u2019s the most perfect ring ever. Put it on me right now, now, now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the bossiness has begun.\u201d Grinning, he slid the ring into place and she admired it in the light. What other man would have given her such an exquisite piece? He knew her. He really knew her, saw the true Noelle, and he loved her anyway. \u201cI wanted to buy you other things, too, but I wasn\u2019t sure what to get the girl who has everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she whispered, those silly tears returning for an altogether different reason. \u201cI only ever want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me.\u201d He squeezed her tight. \u201cNow and always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, twisting and throwing her arms around his neck. \u201cNow let\u2019s have sex again!\u201d</p><p>He was laughing as he tossed her down on the mattress, and Noelle knew they were both happier than they\u2019d ever been or had known they could ever be. No matter what happened next, they were together. They would always be together.</p><p>And now, if she and Ava ever got into trouble\u2014let\u2019s face it, they totally would\u2014Hector could burn away the evidence. No need to mention that would be one of his husbandly duties, though. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cI love that you aren\u2019t afraid to speak your mind,\u201d he said, kissing his way down her body.</p><p>\u201cYou love everything about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So very true.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
