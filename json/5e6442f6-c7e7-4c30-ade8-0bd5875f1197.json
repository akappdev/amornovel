Club Shadowlands. Kari Wagner shook her head at the intimidating sight, at the thought of what the evening might hold.</p><p>Beginners lessons at a private BDSM club. She\u2019d gone insane. Really. Her mind had rotted completely away. Teaching high school, that\u2019s what had caused her lapse in sanity. All those teenagers...</p><p>Her date, Brian\u2014or Buck, as he liked to be called\u2014grabbed Kari\u2019s arm and pulled her through the front door. She slipped a little, and his grip hardened. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re slow.\u201d</p><p>In the small entry room, a huge security guard stood behind a table, looking so ogrelike he was almost cute. \u201cGood evening, sir, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d Kari closed her mouth before she called him Shrek.</p><p>He held out his hand. \u201cPapers, please?\u201d</p><p>As Buck handed over the doctor\u2019s certificates and money, Kari eased her arm away. She\u2019d been attracted to his authoritative personality\u2014so different from the usual men she dated\u2014but he\u2019d never been rough before. Then again, he didn\u2019t know how to do this domination stuff any more than she did.</p><p>The guard finished looking at the papers and handed them off to another man before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take your jacket, sir. And miss? Please leave your shoes with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy shoes?\u201d After a glance at the guy to see if he was serious\u2014he was\u2014Kari slipped off her orange sneakers.</p><p>The guard patiently kept his hand outstretched until she handed over her Tigger-decorated socks also. A little snort of laughter escaped him. \u201cThank you, miss.\u201d</p><p>Buck\u2019s pale brows drew together at the sight of the socks. \u201cWhat the hell are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>Kari glanced down at her ankle-length denim dress. \u201cSorry. It was parent-teacher day, and my last set of parents arrived a half hour late. I didn\u2019t have time to go home and change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Kari, you dress like a five-year-old.\u201d He straightened the lapels of his black suit.</p><p>\u201cWell, I used to teach kindergarten after all.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut my high-school students like my clothes too.\u201d Besides, even if she\u2019d had time to change, what would she have worn to a BDSM club? Some weird lacy corset thing? Surely they\u2019d dated long enough for him to know her better than that.</p><p>\u201cWell, folks, have a pleasant evening.\u201d Smiling, the guard pointed them toward a door on the right wall.</p><p>Wait a minute. Kari frowned at her bare feet, then looked at the man. \u201cExcuse me, but why is Buck allowed to keep his shoes on?\u201d</p><p>The guard blinked. \u201cDid I make a mistake? Which one of you is the Dom or Domme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Buck gave her a disgusted look. \u201cJust be quiet, Kari. Don\u2019t talk at all.\u201d</p><p>She bit back her first response\u2014and the second\u2014and settled for a nod. Buck might look like Prince Charming\u2014tall, slim, blond\u2014but his manners needed a little work. Still, she should give him a break. If he wasn\u2019t Mr. Perfect Dominating Man, she wasn\u2019t exactly a ten on the Gorgeous Submissive Woman scale, right? In fact, considering her conservative upbringing, this whole evening was probably doomed to failure.</p><p>Before they reached the door, Buck yanked her to his side, his fingers digging into her skin. \u201cThere will be other Doms here and other beginners. Remember you\u2019re with me. Don\u2019t talk to anyone else. Don\u2019t look at anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. Now let go of me.\u201d With an exasperated sigh, she pried his hand from her arm, then followed him into a large office with lush dark brown carpeting and creamy white walls. An antique desk and office equipment took up the far side of the room. In the right corner, several big men and two women, all dressed in gold-trimmed leather clothing, eyed her and Buck before returning to quiet conversation.</p><p>The center of the room held a sitting area occupied by two men. One was a tall, broad-shouldered man with silvering dark hair wearing European-tailored black slacks and a black silk shirt. His dark gray eyes had focused on her and Buck the minute they walked through the door. Now, he tilted his head toward the couch across from him.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s got to be Master Z,\u201d Buck hissed as they crossed the room. \u201cAll this is his. You watch your mouth and don\u2019t speak unless I give you permission.\u201d</p><p>She did exactly that, closing her mouth over her impulse to tell him where to go. He meant well, and she wasn\u2019t going to leave before she found out more about this bondage stuff and why it excited her so much.</p><p>In black leathers, the other man looked downright dangerous: hard-faced with an equally hard body, open vest stretching over broad shoulders. Black hair slightly curling to the nape of his neck, potent brown eyes, the shadow of a beard along a stern jaw. If Buck was the golden prince, this man was the dark one.</p><p>When the men rose, Kari froze, feeling like a mouse confronted by lions. Mouth dry, she managed to move forward and smile.</p><p>\u201cBuck,\u201d the gray-eyed one said in a smooth, deep voice. \u201cWelcome to the Shadowlands. I am Master Z.\u201d He shook hands with Buck and then Kari. His warm hand engulfed her cold fingers as he studied her for a moment. \u201cWelcome, Kari.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, remembered not to speak, and smiled instead.</p><p>Master Z nodded to the other man. \u201cThis is Master Dan.\u201d</p><p>The man nodded, shook hands with Buck, and then took Kari\u2019s hand, his grip much gentler than she\u2019d expected. When she looked up, his dark brown eyes trapped hers. He didn\u2019t leer or do anything other than look at her, yet she felt a flush rise into her face. She pulled her hand back and looked down. She could still feel his penetrating gaze.</p><p>\u201cPlease be seated,\u201d Master Z said. He waited for everyone to sit, then resumed his seat. He tapped the coffee table where their medical records and questionnaires were spread. \u201cYour papers are in order. You\u2019re both free of any disease.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her and Buck. \u201cThe rules of the Shadowlands are simple. Don\u2019t touch anything or anyone that doesn\u2019t belong to you without permission. Do not interfere in someone else\u2019s scene. The equipment is here for your use, and after your introductory class tonight, there are private rooms upstairs, also for your use.\u201d He nodded to the men in the corner. \u201cDungeon monitors\u2014DMs\u2014supervise activities and are available to answer questions or even to help as needed. Watch for the gold trim or an orange badge.\u201d</p><p>His gaze turned to Kari. \u201cHere at the Shadowlands, use the term \u2018Master\u2019 for those in authority over you: me, the DMs, and possibly, your Dom. When in doubt, address any Dom as Sir or Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Thank you,\u201d she said without thinking and winced at Buck\u2019s glare.</p><p>Dan Sawyer half listened to Master Z while he sized up the two people who would be in his charge. The bland-faced man with pale blond hair and blue eyes. About five-eleven and a lanky one-seventy in a black suit. He had a narrow mouth with more frown lines than laugh lines and checked his date frequently as if afraid she\u2019d disappear.</p><p>The woman wasn\u2019t beautiful, but compellingly pretty. Midtwenties. Wide blue eyes and hair the rich brown color of Guinness. A soft pink mouth bracketed by faint lines, showing she knew how to laugh and did it often. She was little, about five-four, and definitely not slender. Her long dress couldn\u2019t conceal her very lush curves despite being buttoned right up to the top.</p><p>Interesting choice of attire for the club. Was she modest? Probably. He studied the way she\u2019d pulled her hair into a tight French braid. Modest and conservative. Huh.</p><p>He rubbed his chin and studied her further. Had she wanted to be in a BDSM club, or had her date dragged her? Maybe he had, considering the way she was rubbing her arm.</p><p>Shaking his head, Dan leaned back in his chair. Looked like this couple would bear watching.</p><p>She\u2019d be a pleasure to watch. To see tremble. To see helpless need in those big eyes. To see... He set his imagination aside. Wherever those thoughts had come from, they were out of place. He was a teacher tonight.</p><p>A roar of laughter from the corner caught his attention, and he glanced at the other DMs for beginners\u2019 nights. All had been Dominants for years, all trustworthy men and women. Some with their own submissives, some, like Dan, without. A few were looking for a new sub to train. Dan wasn\u2019t.</p><p>There were plenty of subs begging for his use, and he frequently enjoyed one for an evening, but his interest in long-term commitments had died with his wife three years ago. No one could replace his Marion.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re ready to start.\u201d Master Z\u2019s voice broke into Dan\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>Lecture was over; time to get the puppies moving. Dan rose. \u201cCome with me. I\u2019ll show you around the club and answer questions until your class begins.\u201d</p><p>And like puppies, they followed him across the room, obediently at first. Then Dan heard the man whispering and turned. He caught a few words: \u201c...stay right beside...guys trying to grab themselves a woman...saw how he looked at you. You belong to me...I\u2019m in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d The woman rolled her eyes and tried to move away.</p><p>Buck grabbed her arm hard enough that she winced. His voice rose. \u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>Having once been married, Dan could have told him those were fighting words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And yes, Kari\u2019s face turned pink with anger. She yanked her arm away and stepped back. \u201cYes, I\u2019m listening, and I don\u2019t like what I hear. I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>Buck\u2019s face darkened. \u201cDon\u2019t be childish. You knew this was going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She spun on her heel, headed for the door.</p><p>He grabbed her wrist. \u201cLook, honey, I\u2019m sorry. Maybe I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d She tried to pry his hand off and failed.</p><p>Oh, hell, Dan thought. The guy apparently didn\u2019t understand the basic fuck off! she\u2019d put so politely.</p><p>\u201cLet her go.\u201d Dan set his hand on the wannabe Dom\u2019s shoulder, tightening his fingers until the man flinched and released her.</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want to continue, you can\u2019t force her,\u201d Dan said. He glanced at the girl. \u201cKari, do you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I do,\u201d she said. From the pissed-off look in her big blue eyes, she\u2019d crossed the dude off her date list. Smart move, sweetie. Did she have a ride home? \u201cDid you come together or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeparately,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll walk you to your car.\u201d And prevent any altercations in the parking lot. \u201cBuck, if you want to continue, go on in.\u201d</p><p>The man stood there for a minute, then scowled at his date. \u201cFine. I\u2019m going to take the class, since I already put out the money. I\u2019ll call you later, and we\u2019ll talk. I would have taken good care of you. You\u2019re not being reasonable at all.\u201d Straightening his suit coat, he headed for the door to the main club room.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Dan looked down at his charge. She was rubbing her arm again. \u201cAre you all right, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Startled, she looked up and he caught his breath at the hint of pain in her eyes, at the vulnerability. The need. His body responded as if she\u2019d been stripped and tied to his bed. Damn.</p><p>\u201cUm. Yes, thank you very much. I\u2019m sorry about this,\u201d she said, her voice was melodic, a little husky. And so very polite. What would it take to break through the politeness to the woman beneath?</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He nodded toward the front door.</p><p>But as they passed the sitting area, Z lifted a hand, stopping them. \u201cKari, sit down, please.\u201d</p><p>She took a seat and folded her hands in her lap, all prim and proper except for the pink toes peeking out from under her dress.</p><p>\u201cI see you and your date have parted ways,\u201d Z said. \u201cBut you obviously had an interest in this lifestyle or you would not be here. Am I correct?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dropped, and she nodded slightly.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Master Z continued, \u201cSince that is the case, Master Dan, could you secure her a drink and see if she would like to continue tonight\u2019s class with you?\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s head jerked up. \u201cContinue? But...\u201d</p><p>Z\u2019s glance at Dan was filled with amusement before he said, \u201cIndeed, continue. Master Dan has far more experience and is far more gentle than your...other choice.\u201d Z\u2019s voice lowered, commanded, \u201cLook at him now.\u201d</p> <p>Instant compliance. Submissive. Innocent. Temptingly lovely. Before he could stop himself, Dan held his hand out. \u201cWe\u2019ll go discuss it, Kari. Come.\u201d</p><p>Again, that appealing obedience.</p><p>As he curled his fingers around the cold little hand, he could only think about the next time he would order her to come. With his fingers inside her and his mouth on her clit, yes, she would most surely come.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Oh God, what was she doing?</p><p>The man\u2019s grasp enfolded her hand. Master Dan. She didn\u2019t even know his last name.</p><p>They crossed the room, heading toward a heavy wooden door. She halted abruptly.</p><p>\u201cKari?\u201d</p><p>She looked up. Good grief, he was even bigger than Buck. Somewhere over six feet, but when you\u2019re short, anything over six feet was hard to judge. His shoulders were beyond broad. Like the other men in the room, his gold-trimmed black leather vest had nothing under it. Well, nothing except muscles and more muscles and a sprinkling of black chest hair.</p><p>His biceps bulged, and his forearms appeared almost as thick. The leathers he wore for pants were\u2014wow, really tight.</p><p>When her gaze managed to move back up to his face, he smiled, laugh lines crinkling around his eyes. Her face heated, and she knew her pale skin reddened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re allowed to look, sweetheart,\u201d he murmured, running a finger down her hot cheek. \u201cI enjoy having your eyes on me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were a dark, dark brown, his face tanned and hard looking until he smiled. But when he didn\u2019t... She remembered the hard look on his face when he had grabbed Buck. She bit her lip. Go home, she told herself. Now.</p><p>He started to push the door open.</p><p>\u201cNo. Wait, please.\u201d She held up her hand. \u201cIf it wouldn\u2019t inconvenience you, might I take a minute to think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake all the time you need.\u201d Crossing his arms, he leaned one shoulder against the wall, amusement in his eyes.</p><p>Just standing here beside him wasn\u2019t going to work. Shoot, even Madame Curie wouldn\u2019t be able to think with that man looking at her. Kari turned her back and paced across the room.</p><p>Stay or not? That was the basic question for tonight. So check the facts.</p><p>If she simply went home, nothing would change. Her life would go on. She\u2019d never know if she might have learned something that would make a difference in her sex life. Nothing else had. How many relationships had failed due to her lack of interest in sex? She\u2019d thought her basic personality or body created the problem. But the excitement she felt hearing about domination\u2014heck, just the word itself\u2014had been amazing. A revelation in a way.</p><p>She could definitely get aroused.</p><p>But this BDSM stuff appeared very, very strange. Kinky. And she wasn\u2019t a kinky person in the least. Shoot, the school nuns had used her as an example of model behavior. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be more like Kari? She\u2019s polite. She follows the rules.\u201d</p><p>Well, following the rules in the bedroom wasn\u2019t working too well for her, now was it?</p><p>She reached the end of the room and turned around. Master Dan hadn\u2019t moved, his patience apparently inexhaustible. Nonetheless, she needed to figure this out, pros and cons, and reach a decision.</p><p>In the Go Home column: First, she didn\u2019t know nearly enough about this stuff. She scowled as she paced back. Her home computer had died last month\u2014stupid technology\u2014and she couldn\u2019t afford to replace it yet. She sure couldn\u2019t research BDSM on the school computer. So she only knew the tidbits Buck had doled out. Her mouth tightened. She hated being ignorant.</p><p>Second: She didn\u2019t know this man at all. How dangerous was that? She could just imagine, all her friends and family mourning around her grave. The tombstone would read Kari Wagner, Died of Sheer Stupidity.</p><p>In the Stay Here column: It would be almost as bad to have her grave marker read Died of Terminal Bedroom Boredom. Unmarried and childless. There was a darned good reason she wanted to try this stuff, after all.</p><p>As for knowing the man? She glanced at Master Z. The owner had leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled, watching her pace. He was no dummy, and he\u2019d basically recommended Master Dan.</p><p>And Master Dan sure wasn\u2019t anything like Buck. She pursed her lips. She considered that a major bonus, right there.</p><p>What about being ignorant? Well, she might be, but she had a feeling that Master Dan knew all about the subject of domination.</p><p>She stopped in front of the door to the bar, could hear the sounds of classical music and muted conversation. If she left now, she\u2019d never have the courage to return. Her head said no. Her heart said go for it.</p><p>Master Dan straightened.</p><p>She placed her hand in his. Go it was.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d No point in hiding the truth. Considering her heart was trying to pound through her chest, he could probably hear the noise.</p><p>\u201cLet me make it easier. Right now, all we will do is go into the club room and talk. Can you trust me that far?\u201d</p><p>Just talk in a bar. She could handle that. \u201cOkay. The bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d His eyes softened.</p><p>Opening the door, he escorted her through, setting a warm hand low on her back.</p><p>Once inside, Kari paused to look around. The huge room boasted a circular bar in the center, and wrought iron circular stairs in the corners. Groups of plants sectioned the tables and overstuffed couches into secluded sitting areas. Flickering wall sconces and glass chandeliers hanging from low rafters provided shadowy light and made the hardwood floor gleam.</p><p>A scattering of people occupied the couches and bar stools. To Kari\u2019s relief, no one was doing weird things or having sex on the floor. Leathers, latex, and skimpy dresses seemed the attire of choice\u2014nothing too outlandish.</p><p>He followed her gaze. \u201cBeginners tend to dress conservatively. You\u2019ll see a big difference when the regular club members are here on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>As they crossed the room, Kari spotted Buck at the bar. Her step faltered.</p><p>He noticed her, and his face lit up. Then he saw Master Dan with his arm around her, and his mouth compressed so hard his lips disappeared.</p><p>To her relief, he didn\u2019t approach. She would hate to be the cause of a scene, or even the center of attention.</p><p>Without speaking, Master Dan slid his hand up to her waist and moved her closer, his nearness comforting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once past the bar, he found an unoccupied sitting area. Taking the very center of the couch, he pulled her down beside him. He smelled of subtly dark cologne, of soap...of man. And she was way too close. She tried to shift away, only to realize he\u2019d wedged her between him and the arm of the couch.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you to sit beside me?\u201d he asked, leaning back and studying her. His leg against her thigh was hard, ungiving.</p><p>Did he expect her to be rude? \u201cUm, no, of course not.\u201d Trying to ignore the feeling of being crowded, she tipped her foot up, wiggled her toes. Why was she barefoot anyway?</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d He put gentle fingers under her chin, forcing her to meet his level gaze.</p><p>\u201cKari, part of the adventure is being honest with each other. When I ask you a question, I want an honest answer, not a polite one.\u201d He smiled slightly. His fingers were warm as his thumb traced little circles on her cheek. \u201cLet me show you what I\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>He pitched his voice a little higher and said, \u201cMaster Dan, when I realized I was between you and the couch arm, I felt trapped. Like I can\u2019t retreat if I want to.\u201d His voice returned to its natural subterranean deepness. \u201cIs that about right?\u201d</p><p>How did he know that?</p><p>He kept watching her with those intent eyes, and each stroke of his thumb across her skin left heat in its wake. He lifted his dark brows. \u201cKari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said almost inaudibly. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel.\u201d The admission left her feeling as if she\u2019d undressed in front of him, and she tried to look away. He tipped her head back, let her see the pleasure on his face.</p><p>\u201cGood girl. I can tell that wasn\u2019t easy for you.\u201d He brushed a kiss across her lips.</p><p>Her lips tingled although the touch had been fleeting, a tiny hint of pleasure.</p><p>Dan studied the little newbie. Nervous as a burglar who\u2019d tripped an alarm. And so polite. Her hands lay in her lap, laced together.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask you some questions?\u201d He massaged her cold little fingers as he waited for her reply.</p><p>\u201cOf course. May I ask questions also?\u201d She fidgeted. He watched her fidget. His deliberate intrusion into her personal space definitely set her off balance.</p><p>\u201cI hope you will since that\u2019s my job tonight, being an instructor. So what do you do when you\u2019re not in a wicked house of sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a\u2014\u201d She hesitated, stiffening a little.</p><p>Smart girl, not blurting out too much personal information. Caution wasn\u2019t a bad thing. \u201cAh. Never mind that. Why don\u2019t you tell me about the assh\u2014about Buck? I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s not your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Obviously horrified, she frowned at him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have gone with you if I were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear. Just a boyfriend, then?\u201d And hadn\u2019t the man looked steamed there at the bar. Dan automatically checked his surroundings. All clear.</p><p>\u201cI was dating him.\u201d She studied her fingers. \u201cHe\u2019s usually a nice man. I\u2019m not sure why he was like that tonight.\u201d</p><p>The idea of dominance brought out more than just true Dominants. Perverts, control freaks, and general assholes were plentiful. \u201cYou need to be careful about who you trust when you\u2019re getting into any kind of power exchange. That\u2019s why the class is restricted to this room tonight. No one goes anywhere private.\u201d He put his arm across her shoulders, pulling her closer. Curves and softness. Delightful. \u201cHave you ever been married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Engaged once, but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d The muscles around her eyes tightened...a past hurt? Before he could quiz her, she asked hastily, \u201cHow about you? Are you married or involved?\u201d</p><p>The unexpected question stabbed through him, and he forced his voice to stay even. \u201cNo. My wife died a few years ago. A car accident.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She laid her hand on his cheek. \u201cDo you have children?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe wanted to wait. She said she was having too much fun to want to slow down.\u201d At times, he could be grateful he wasn\u2019t responsible for a child; other times, he ached for someone to love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her sympathy touched him inside, lightened the heavy feeling in his gut. He took her hand and pressed a kiss to the center.</p><p>She smiled at him, her eyes gentle...and pulled her hand back.</p><p>Her retreat returned him to the present. So the little miss might be shy, but not when someone needed comfort.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014Mas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many worries. If \u2018Master Dan\u2019 feels awkward, call me Sir. Any other designation here will get you in trouble.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cAll right, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted, taking her hand. \u201cSo, Kari. We get a variety of people on beginners\u2019 nights. Some have used bondage and such at home, sometimes for years. Do you have any experience at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I...we...Buck wanted to tie my hands, and I wouldn\u2019t let him.\u201d Her muscles tensed, and she tugged at her hand. \u201cI probably don\u2019t belong here. Not really. I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>He chuckled but didn\u2019t release her hand or move his arm from her shoulders. \u201cYou know, if someone like Buck tried to tie me up, I\u2019d run for the hills. All that shows is your body has better taste in men than your mind.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Relaxed a little.</p><p>\u201cWhat does your body say about being with me?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you feel safe?\u201d</p><p>Glancing away from him, she considered, and her brows drew together. \u201cPretty much. Yes.\u201d She sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cAll right then. Now tell me about your fianc\u00e9. Did you two try anything?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved up. \u201cOh, no. The thought would have appalled him.\u201d</p><p>He traced a finger over her plump lips, and her gaze darted to him. \u201cSo no experience at all. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>She looked down, pulled in a long breath, and raised those gorgeous eyes back to his. \u201cBuck told me about domination and bondage, and I didn\u2019t realize real people do...it. I\u2019ve never been that interested in sex, but when I heard about this, I was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurned on?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut honestly, I don\u2019t think this will work for me. I\u2019m very... I\u2019m not the type of person who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re modest. Polite. Obey the rules.\u201d</p><p>Relief at being understood showed in her eyes. \u201cYes. Exactly. My father was quite devout and very strict with my sister and me. Catholic girls\u2019 school, no dating in high school, no makeup. She rebelled; I was the good daughter.\u201d She gave him a sidelong look. \u201cI\u2019m very repressed.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. Not so repressed that she\u2019d lost her sense of humor. Still, that explained a lot. Dan fingered her tight French braid, glanced at the dress buttoned to her neck. She wouldn\u2019t find this easy.</p><p>\u201cSo you see, I\u2019m probably wasting your time. I\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</p><p>Now he knew about her background, he thought she\u2019d been brave just to come here. Should he let her go? He thought about the way her eyes had heated at just a simple command. \u201cLet\u2019s talk a little longer and see.\u201d</p><p>Her foot pointed to the door, but her fingers still gripped his hand. She wanted and didn\u2019t want. Did she have any idea how that type of dichotomy could entice a Dom?</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She raised her chin.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he echoed. \u201cWe\u2019ve established you have no experience. How about fantasies?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Kari felt herself turn red.</p><p>\u201cWell, she has fantasies.\u201d He grinned. \u201cGood. A gorgeous barbarian chasing you down and taking you against your will? Have you had that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She bit her lower lip. Was she wearing an I-have-kinky-dreams brand or something?</p><p>\u201cI would enjoy chasing you; I wonder if you\u2019d enjoy being caught?\u201d His hand cupped her cheek, turning her head so he could kiss her. Ever so lightly, his mouth teased hers, coaxing her to respond. He had firm lips, but smooth, and she moved closer, wanting more. He traced her lips with his tongue, nibbled on her bottom lip, and when she opened for him, he swept inside, sending her senses reeling.</p><p>When he pulled back, her fingers were clamped on his upper arms. She fought to catch her breath. A furnace seemed to have started in her body. God, she wanted to kiss him some more.</p><p>He smiled and traced her wet lips with his finger. \u201cSave our place,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Kari blinked, realized a woman stood beside the couch, her gaze on the floor. She wore a red latex corset, a short black skirt, and wrist cuffs. How long had she been standing there?</p><p>\u201cTabitha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Dan, may I bring you and your companion something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKari, what would you like? No, let me see how close I can get.\u201d He studied her, and a crease appeared in his cheek with his smile. \u201cIt would have to be like you. Sweet. Not exotic, but straightforward. Honest. A screwdriver or perhaps rum and Coke?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cRum and Diet Coke. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>He nodded at Tabitha, and the young woman disappeared. \u201cYes, let\u2019s talk about that. Part of a Dominant-submissive relationship is\u2014\u201d His eyes glinted with amusement. \u201cAh, even the words make you blush. Such a lovely pink.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she could feel her face turning redder with the compliment, darn him. She\u2019d taken her turn at teaching sex education classes and never blushed once. Why now?</p><p>\u201cDominant. Submissive,\u201d he said clearly. \u201cSay the words for me, Kari.\u201d</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t asking too much, considering where she was. \u201cDominant. Submissive,\u201d she said, managing to speak a little louder than a whisper\u2014maybe not much.</p><p>His smile was like a reward. \u201cGood. Shall I give you a harder assignment? I am a Dominant.\u201d He tilted his head at her to finish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d But she wasn\u2019t. Not really... Was she? It was one thing to be thinking about being, well, controlled in bed, and quite another to apply an actual label to herself. Labels had meaning. And made everything far too real. This was just supposed to be...an experiment.</p><p>\u201cMmmph, that is a hard admission, not one you are ready for. Let\u2019s put a limit on it then. For the next hour, until nine o\u2019clock, I am a Dominant.\u201d</p><p>She could do an hour. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what she wanted to do. \u201cFor the next hour, until nine o\u2019clock, I am a submissive,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>And she shivered.</p><p>That smile again. \u201cBrave girl.\u201d</p><p>Tabitha arrived with their drinks, set them on the table quietly, and departed without a word. \u201cIs she a submissive?\u201d</p><p>He handed over her drink, took his. \u201cYes. In training here.\u201d</p><p>Training. You had to train to be ordered around?</p><p>The skin around his eyes crinkled with humor. \u201cYou\u2019re here for three evenings of classes.\u201d He stroked his knuckles along her jaw. \u201cTraining is for those wanting to go deeper into the lifestyle, not something you need to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Good.\u201d She sipped her drink, blinked at the strength, and sipped again. \u201cHow many people end up drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d He drank some of his, clear as water, and set it back on the table. \u201cMaster Z limits everyone to two drinks.\u201d</p><p>Now how could they enforce that? Then she remembered how Sir\u2019s big hand had gripped Buck\u2019s shoulder, and she felt a tickle of laughter. Enforcement obviously wasn\u2019t a problem. And she should pay for her own drink. She fumbled at the pocket of her dress where she\u2019d tucked her key and some money. \u201cThe barmaid didn\u2019t say what my rum and Coke cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo cost. Drinks are included in membership fees, or for you, the price of the class.\u201d</p><p>Oh. She put her hands back in her lap. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we simply talk about what suits your needs.\u201d</p><p>She stared down into her drink, watching the bubbles. His silence had her looking up, right into his observant eyes.</p><p>\u201cNeeds is another word that bothers you,\u201d he said. \u201cTalking about sex isn\u2019t something you do, is it?\u201d</p><p>What, did he have some sort of view into her head? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an acceptable topic of conversation when I was growing up, no.\u201d Her father could expound for hours on purity and innocence without ever saying the sex word.</p><p>\u201cMmmph, in that case, let me run through some options, and we\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d</p> <p>Options sounded good. Were there options that were the equivalent of sticking one toe in the water? She took another sip of her drink. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have one request first.\u201d</p><p>A request in this place might involve just about anything. She eyed him warily. Nodded.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you to sit on my lap while we talk?\u201d He ran a finger over her lower lip, slowly, and she grew aware of how soft her own lips were. His mouth curved up in a wicked smile. \u201cI promise not to put my hands anywhere you don\u2019t want them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would I sit on your lap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, it will make it easier for you; sex isn\u2019t something to be discussed at arm\u2019s length, now is it?\u201d</p><p>Sex. With him. She might consider this evening an experiment, but sex wasn\u2019t that way. It was personal. He\u2019d be touching her. Intimately. But she wanted this; she really did. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>She set her drink on the table and rose to her feet, smoothing her dress down. He slid into her place. Reclining back against the armrest, he put his legs up and pulled her into his lap.</p><p>With her feet still on the floor, she sat stiffly until he laughed and pulled her down against his chest, her head in the hollow of his shoulder. Sit on his lap? This was more like snuggling...and pretty nice. After a moment, she let her hand rest on his bare chest where the vest had fallen away. She ruffled the crisp hair, tracing her fingers over the hard contours of his chest. He was so darned big, she actually felt tiny next to him\u2014well, on top of him\u2014like her weight was nothing to him.</p><p>His voice rumbled through his chest. \u201cThere we go. You fit into my arms very nicely\u2014a nice, soft armful.\u201d</p><p>His obvious enjoyment warmed her, made her feel feminine and attractive, something she\u2019d been missing for a while now. For two years, actually, since Curt had left her for some hot, skinny artist.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that thought?\u201d Dan asked. She could feel his fingers in her hair, unpinning the French braid.</p><p>\u201cNoth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKari.\u201d</p><p>She could hear the warning in his voice, and somehow she didn\u2019t want to disappoint him. \u201cI was thinking about my ex-fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how fat and frigid he made me feel, okay?\u201d she snapped and tried to sit up, but he tucked an arm across her waist and held her in place. Easily.</p><p>\u201cStay here, little one.\u201d He laughed, a low, growling sound. \u201cYou have a temper buried under all that politeness. I wonder what else is buried down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He\u2019d only been nice to her, and she\u2019d lashed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. You know, with both the temper and the worries about your size, you remind me of Z\u2019s sub. Personally I like women with some padding. I like lush.\u201d He stroked up to just under her breasts, and she froze.</p><p>\u201cAnd curvy.\u201d He ran his hand across her hip, squeezed her bottom, continued down her thigh. Everywhere his hand touched, her skin wakened like spring after a hard winter, and warmth washed through her.</p><p>\u201cYou have the loveliest fair skin,\u201d he murmured, trailing his fingers down her arm. \u201cSoft and creamy, and those pillowy lips of yours would tempt an angel to sin. I\u2019m no angel.\u201d His hand tangled in her loose hair, tipping her head back, and his mouth settled on hers. His lips were firm, demanding, opening hers and taking possession without mercy.</p><p>When he pulled back, she was breathing hard, her hand fisted in his vest. God, the man could kiss.</p><p>\u201cAnd only an idiot would call you cold,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNow, back to business. First of all, I need to find out what kind of a submissive you might be. I think I know, but let\u2019s be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubmissives come in different types?\u201d How could she know so little? When she got home, she was going to take a hammer to that stupid dead computer. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Can we try multiple choice?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAll right. A: You want to serve a master, making him meals, doing whatever he wants, around the house or in bed. B: You want to play a role for a short time, be a schoolgirl or a secretary, but you\u2019d set up your own rules with your top\u2014ah, the person in charge. C: You want to give up control for sex but not especially for anything else. D: You like pain and want someone to deal it out.\u201d</p><p>That was quite a list. \u201cPeople really want all those different things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely. That was just the short list.\u201d He tugged on her hair. \u201cGive me a letter, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Well, she knew what she wanted. Why the heck couldn\u2019t she be as blas\u00e9 about sex as her friends were? She wet her lips. \u201cC. We\u2014I came here\u2014\u201d She sighed. \u201cC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d he said easily. \u201cChoice C for sex.\u201d</p><p>At least he hadn\u2019t jumped up and yelled, You want what? in horror. She realized her fingernails were digging into his side and made her hand relax.</p><p>Taking hold of her hips, he moved her lower on his lap and slid his arm tighter around her until his hand settled under her breasts. His other hand stroked her neck, her collarbone. She sighed in pleasure, squirming a little to get even closer, and froze when she realized what she was squirming on. He was not only hard; he was huge.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry about giving someone pleasure, sweetling.\u201d His fingers played with her hair that spilled down her front. Somehow several buttons on her dress had come undone, and his hand dropped to rest on the beginning swell of her breast with his other hand just below. One above, one below, like he was holding her breasts captive between the two. Why did that seem erotic?</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about being told what to do in bed?\u201d</p><p>She caught her breath as the image sent a wave of heat through her. \u201cUm.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t wait for her answer, just murmured, \u201cThat\u2019s a go.\u201d</p><p>A second later, he moved his hand from below her breasts and slid it into her dress where more buttons had come undone. His hand settled back to where it had been before, only now his warm palm lay directly on her naked skin, grazing the lower edge of her breasts. She stiffened and then forced herself to relax. She was here for sex, right? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSome people like being tied down, kept from moving while their partner pleasures them.\u201d</p><p>She managed not to squeak.</p><p>\u201cYour body likes that idea.\u201d</p><p>Another pause and she realized she was rubbing her thighs together and stopped immediately. Tied up for sex. Being ordered around was one thing, but restrained with ropes or handcuffs? Too much. She hadn\u2019t liked the idea at all when Buck had tried it. \u201cNo,\u201d she said shakily. \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d He touched his lips to hers, kissed her sweetly, thoroughly, his tongue tangling with hers. When he drew back, she smiled with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s called vanilla sex,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Suddenly he gripped her wrists with hard hands, holding her so she couldn\u2019t move. \u201cAnd this is nonvanilla sex.\u201d He took her mouth again, plunging deeply, possessing her ruthlessly. When she tried to move, his grip tightened on her arms, holding her in place.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move. Every nerve in her body shocked to life as if lightning struck her. Arousal seared through her. She bit back a moan.</p><p>He released her, quirking a cynical eyebrow.</p><p>Deep inside, her body shook like a palm tree in a tropical storm. What was happening to her? She pulled in a breath. \u201cThat didn\u2019t...\u201d Her voice trailed off. She was lying to herself and to him. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your honesty.\u201d Wrapping his arms around her again, he stroked her back. Her cheek rested on his bare chest. His heart beat in a slow, relaxing rhythm, and her own pulse slowed as the claws of desire unhooked from her.</p><p>\u201cOn your last night, you\u2019ll have to take a look at the costumes the members wear,\u201d he said conversationally. It\u2019s pretty amazing some of the things people put on. Of course, since it\u2019s beginners\u2019 night, tonight\u2019s attire is pretty sedate.\u201d As he talked, he slid one hand into her dress again, nestling up against her breasts, the other resuming its place just under her collarbone.</p><p>\u201cYou know, some people like a little pain now and then: spanking, pinching, tiny punishments.\u201d</p><p>It was as if he were having this conversation with himself, except the images he was putting into her head were just... A man spanking her bare bottom? Jeez, no. And yet, she actually felt herself dampen.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm, yes, I think you\u2019ll need a little reprimand now and then.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched. He wouldn\u2019t really, now would he?</p><p>He rubbed his chin against the top of her head. \u201cYou smell good, little sub. Like soap and flowers and...woman. And your hair is as long and silky as any man could want.\u201d</p><p>Okay, she\u2019d just lie here all night, snuggled into his naked chest, and let him talk to her with that low, low voice. Listening to him was better than having sex with\u2014with anyone she\u2019d ever been with before.</p><p>\u201cYou know, some people like more pain: being whipped hard, pins inserted under their skin, hot wax dripped on them.\u201d</p><p>She froze. That... He wouldn\u2019t. She shoved against his chest, tried to get free.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not for you. Definitely not.\u201d</p><p>Body stiff, she tried to slide off him.</p><p>One arm held her tight against him as his other hand stroked her hair as if he were petting a cat, settling her down. \u201cTruthfully, Kari, I don\u2019t like the hardcore S and M either. Real pain doesn\u2019t turn me on, and I can see you feel the same.\u201d</p> <p>She took a breath and let herself relax. A little. \u201cDo people really do that? Here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ll see some of that, maybe on Wednesday, definitely on Saturday. It\u2019s not something you need to do if you\u2019re not into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good. Thank you.\u201d He was so warm and his arms so comforting that when he tilted her head back for another kiss, she didn\u2019t resist at all.</p><p>Pulling back, he looked her in the eyes and said, \u201cIf anytime, anything I do or we do goes beyond what you can stand, then you say \u2018red,\u2019 and everything stops. That\u2019s your safe word, sweetheart. Red. Make sense?\u201d</p><p>Cool. She could stop everything when she wanted. The sense of relief mingled with confusion. That didn\u2019t seem like she was giving up much control.</p><p>He kissed her again, and his big hand slid up to cover her breast, his thumb brushing across her nipple. Each touch sent zings of intense sensation spearing through her until she was squirming again.</p><p>\u201cKari, the safe word is for pain. Or something you absolutely can\u2019t stand. You use it for anything less, and the night is over. I pack you up, and you go home.\u201d His intent gaze trapped hers. \u201cI am going to give you what you want, not what your mama told you is proper. I\u2019m going to push your limits, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her until his lips were against her ear. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to scream as you come over and over again.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, could feel her nipples harden, and so could he, considering his hand was right there on her breast. He chuckled, sucked on her earlobe, and sent chills chasing across her skin.</p><p>\u201cAhem.\u201d Behind them, a woman cleared her throat. Kari jerked to a sitting position, embarrassed at her behavior in public. What had she been thinking?</p><p>A DM in a gold-trimmed black bustier and black latex leggings stood by the couch. \u201cSorry to interrupt,\u201d she said, her lips curving up.</p><p>Sir sighed. \u201cOlivia. You, as always, have a crappy sense of timing. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZ said you are to participate in the newbie class. Both of you. Raoul\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell. We\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Sir looked at Kari. \u201cUp you go,\u201d he said briskly, pushing her to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019ll enjoy this, I think. At least the last part of the class.\u201d He buttoned her dress, his fingers sliding into the gaps, teasing her sensitive skin, making her regret the interruption.</p><p>When he was finished, he ran his knuckles across her breasts, up and down over her jutting nipples. He grinned and murmured, \u201cGuess you\u2019re just cold, huh?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t keep the laugh bottled up.</p><p>They joined the thirty-or-so beginners milling around at the end of the bar. To Kari\u2019s surprise, the couples included not only male-female, but also gays and lesbians. With one heterosexual couple, the man wore cuffs and a collar. So men could be submissive? Too strange.</p><p>Then a gleam of blond hair caught Kari\u2019s gaze, and her eyes met Buck\u2019s. Grinning, he started toward her and then spotted Master Dan. A scowl darkened his long face, but he stopped.</p><p>Even as Kari breathed a sigh of relief, guilt welled within her. She\u2019d arrived with him; she should still be with him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, people, let\u2019s get started.\u201d The dungeon monitor teaching the class was an inch or two shorter than Sir, but so thickly muscled he looked like he could pick up her car without breaking a sweat. \u201cMaster Dan,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a shy crowd here, and I want to run through some basic bondage. Bring your sub up here.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Sir\u2019s arm tightened, and he swept her along, despite her attempt at planting her feet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetling. This is show-and-tell with all your clothes on and no sex.\u201d</p><p>Well, she was used to being in front of people, if teenage students counted as people, something she rather doubted. She shouldn\u2019t have a problem with this.</p><p>Master Dan nodded at the teacher. \u201cKari, this is Master Raoul.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the man. Was she permitted to talk? Sir hadn\u2019t said.</p><p>As if he\u2019d read her mind, he murmured, \u201cSay hello, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased to meet you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHello, Kari.\u201d The DM gave her a slow, appreciative look before frowning at Sir. \u201cYou always were Z\u2019s favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Master Dan flashed a wicked grin. \u201cSo get moving. I have other things to do tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet.\u201d Turning back to the class, Master Raoul picked up a pair of metal handcuffs from the bar top. \u201cThis is the basic handcuff. Adequate, but if you get your sub excited and she yanks on them, she\u2019ll have nasty bruises for a few days. And it\u2019s easy to get them too tight. With these, as with all restraints, be sure you check the circulation frequently. Doms, this is a biggie; if you restrain someone, you never leave them alone.\u201d</p><p>He set the handcuffs down and held up leather wrist cuffs with buckles. \u201cMuch more comfortable and safer for circulation. If your sub deserves it, you can even buy lined ones. Master Dan, if you would demonstrate.\u201d</p><p>Master Dan took the cuffs and held out one hand. \u201cGive me your wrist, Kari,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her heart gave a hard thud, and she hesitated.</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cNow, Kari.\u201d</p><p>Her hand plopped into his before she\u2019d come up with all the reasons she should say no.</p><p>He buckled first one, then the other cuff on, running a finger under to be certain they were snug but not tight. Pulling her wrists in front of her, he hooked the cuffs together. The commanding look in his eyes and the feel of his firm hands on her arms made her stomach quiver and heat pool in her lower half.</p><p>When he finished, he stepped back, studying her face. His lips curved in a hard smile.</p><p>Trying to ignore the dampness seeping between her thighs, she yanked at the cuffs. She definitely couldn\u2019t get free of them, but still, this wasn\u2019t all that scary. Her hands were in front of her; she could defend herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Master Raoul nodded. \u201cBasic restraint. Hands in front, but not very intimidating. Leaves a lot of room for evasion. Dan?\u201d</p><p>To Kari\u2019s shock, Master Dan set his hand on one breast, cupping her firmly. Even as a thrill rushed through her, she instinctively knocked his fingers off with her cuffed hands and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cNot a very obedient sub you have there,\u201d Master Raoul commented dryly as the group laughed.</p><p>Oh, heavens, had she embarrassed him? She shouldn\u2019t have reacted without thinking. Kari risked a glance.</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t smile, his cheek creased, and his eyes were amused as he unclipped her wrists.</p><p>\u201cHands behind the back will help solve that little aggression problem,\u201d Master Raoul said.</p><p>Master Dan stepped behind Kari and clipped the cuffs together at the small of her back. This time, she yanked at them unsuccessfully, and a shiver ran through her at the helpless feeling. With her hands behind her back, she could do nothing to\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd as you see, your sub is much more manageable,\u201d Master Raoul said.</p><p>Master Dan\u2019s hard chest pressed against her back as he reached around her, one arm securing her waist. His other hand closed on her breast. She jumped, squeaked, and couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t get free as he caressed her, his fingers sending erotic sensations swirling through her.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Dan felt Kari\u2019s heart pound as his fingers stroked her full breasts. He could also feel the way her nipples tightened. Arousal flushed her neck. No question, the little miss was submissive.</p><p>But so new. Just as well she had no idea how much control it took to not open those tiny buttons, slide his hand under her bra, stroke her soft skin, and roll her nipples between his fingers. And that would be just the beginning. Bending her over one of the couches, exposing her ass, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a small problem with this type of bondage, however,\u201d Master Raoul stated.</p><p>Wrenching his mind back to business, Dan responded to the cue. He scooped Kari off her feet, enjoying the tiny squeal she gave. Kneeling, he laid her on her back on the floor and straddled her thighs. Her eyes were huge as she stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see, she\u2019s lying on her arms, an uncomfortable position for a sub, especially if you plan to be on top of her.\u201d Raoul grinned.</p><p>Dan rose and set Kari back on her feet. The deep breath of relief she took made him chuckle.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Kari and Master Dan,\u201d Raoul said. \u201cNow someone may volunteer for the next demonstration, or I will pick two people myself.\u201d A middle-aged couple stepped forward, and Raoul talked them through leg restraints.</p><p>Dan put his arm around Kari, enjoying her tiny squirms as she tested the cuffs every few seconds.</p><p>\u201cYou can take these off now,\u201d she whispered, giving him an annoyed look.</p><p>Those flashes of temper could drive a Dom crazy thinking of the various enjoyable ways to punish them. Again, she was too new, no serious disciplining allowed. But since she was still frowning up at him, her mouth was perfectly positioned, and he didn\u2019t resist. Tightening his grip on her waist, he kissed her. After a second of resistance, her lips softened, and his tongue plunged inside. He took her mouth thoroughly, as he wished he could take the rest of her before the night ended. Her quivering response made his blood boil and his cock strain to be set free.</p><p>With a regretful sigh, he pulled back, moving to stand beside her. One hand rested on her shoulder, strategically placed to feel her body\u2019s responses to the rest of the toys Raoul brought out. By the time Raoul finished the lesson, every beginner Dom had restrained a sub in one way or another, and Dan had discovered Kari was turned on by leg restraints also. Good to know.</p><p>Now the single students paired off, and everyone wandered through the club to practice what they\u2019d learned. With beginners locked out of the private rooms upstairs, he and Kari were stuck down here too.</p><p>He remembered a relatively isolated area, though, near the back of the room and well hidden behind a bunch of foliage. He beckoned to a trainee. \u201cSally, run over and put a RESERVED sign on the sitting area to the left of the theme rooms.\u201d</p> <p>The trainee laughed as she shook her head in disapproval. \u201cShame on you. That\u2019s cheati\u2014\u201d She shut her mouth quickly, several words too late.</p><p>Kari frowned as the barmaid dropped to her knees before Master Dan. The pretty brunette looked mortified and a bit frightened as she whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master Dan.\u201d</p><p>Master Dan\u2019s expression hardened into stone. \u201cI\u2019ve lost patience with your lack of control over your tongue. Show me your bands,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Sally held out her arms. Each wrist held a narrow leather cuff wrapped with yellow, blue, and green ribbons.</p><p>\u201cFirst, do as I asked. Then report to Master Cullen and inform him you are to be given to a DM for spanking and his use. Are my instructions clear?\u201d</p><p>Sally\u2019s eyes widened, and her outstretched hands trembled. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>After pushing to her feet, the brunette escaped, almost tripping in her haste to get away.</p><p>Kari stared up at Master Dan, horror chilling her body. \u201cDid you just give her to a stranger? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>He turned. The coldness disappeared from his expression as if it had never been. \u201cAh, Kari. Sally is another sub in training. This is part of her instruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a spanking? And...use?\u201d She had a pretty good idea what use meant. Dear God. Kari stepped back. She really didn\u2019t know this man at all.</p><p>Her hands were still cuffed, she realized with a jolt of fear.</p><p>\u201cDan\u2014oops\u2014Master Dan, I mean.\u201d A pretty blonde in tight jeans and an emerald green, low-cut blouse hurried up. \u201cZ wants you to join him for a few minutes, if you could. Something about a club membership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Master Dan turned to Kari, and she took another step back. His eyes narrowed before he turned to the blonde. \u201cJessica, I disciplined Sally for mouthing off, and now Kari\u2019s terrified. She\u2019s probably convinced I\u2019m a white slave trader. Can you stay with her and reassure her while I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll agree to join us for supper next Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me. Sure.\u201d Pinning Kari in place with a hard look, he closed the distance between them. He stroked a finger down her cheek, sending a thrill through her.</p><p>She swallowed hard, unable to look away from his penetrating gaze. The man had just scared her spitless, so why did his touch still make her all quivery inside?</p><p>He smiled, as if he could feel her response. After unhooking her hands from behind her back, he strode off toward the front of the room. Tall, straight shouldered, gorgeous\u2014and more frightening than Hannibal Lector. She was in way over her head here.</p><p>\u201cReady for some female company?\u201d the blonde asked, following her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI would be very grateful.\u201d Kari stuck a hand out. \u201cI\u2019m Kari, and what you\u2019d call a newbie, I guess.\u201d</p><p>The woman took her hand, gave a strong squeeze. Like Sally, she wore leather cuffs. Fur-lined, but lacking any ribbons. \u201cI\u2019m Jessica, and I\u2019m past newbie status, but I haven\u2019t been in the scene very long. Let\u2019s have a drink and talk.\u201d</p><p>The circular bar was nearly deserted with only two beginners hovering at one end, and three dungeon monitors at the other. Kari slid onto a wooden stool beside Jessica.</p><p>In the center, the giant bartender concocted a fancy drink, humming to the soft music of Pachelbel\u2019s \u201cCanon.\u201d In dark brown leathers that matched his thick hair, he had a rough face of blunt angles and a solid jaw. After delivering the drink to a newbie, he sauntered over to Kari and Jessica.</p><p>Leaning a big arm on the bar top, he gave Kari a long, slow look that made heat rise in her cheeks. \u201cLittle subbie, do you want another rum and Diet Coke?\u201d</p><p>Would speaking get her in the same kind of trouble as Sally? What were the darned rules in this place? \u201cJust Coke, please.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t yell at her. Instead, he turned to Jessica. \u201cMargarita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you, Master Cullen.\u201d</p><p>His laugh boomed through the bar. \u201cSo formal. Setting a good example for your friend?\u201d</p><p>Jessica grinned.</p><p>Master Cullen set the drinks in front of them, gave Kari another of those looks, and left to take another order. Her face heated. Jeez. With a rueful smile, she glanced at Jessica. \u201cI swear, I\u2019ve spent most of my time here blushing. And sometimes I\u2019m not even sure why.\u201d</p><p>Jessica laughed. \u201cIf you mean Cullen, some of the more powerful Doms can make you turn red just by looking at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no wonder then.\u201d This place was obviously littered with strong Doms. Her mind turned back to what had caused the worry gnawing away in her stomach. \u201cTell me about Sally. When she messed up, Master Dan gave her to some Dom\u2014any Dom\u2014to use. That seems like almost rape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not.\u201d Jessica held up her wrist. \u201cDid you see the ribbons on her cuffs?\u201d</p><p>Kari nodded.</p><p>\u201cThey show what kind of activities a trainee is into. Red for serious sadomasochism, yellow for milder pain like spankings, blue for bondage, and green for sex. If she had a green ribbon, she was all right with being given to any Dom here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Wow. What would that be like, to be just handed over to someone? Kari took a hefty gulp of her drink, wondering if she should have had the rum. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis place can be overwhelming. The first time I was here, I just wanted shelter during a storm. I didn\u2019t know it was a BDSM club. There was all this stuff going on.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cI got in so much trouble...\u201d</p><p>Kari grinned. \u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext class, I\u2019ll give you the full story. For now, how do I convince you that Master Dan\u2019s not a white slave trader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. It helps knowing he didn\u2019t do something that Sally wasn\u2019t expecting, I guess.\u201d Kari frowned. But now that he wasn\u2019t touching her, looking at her, she was starting to have second thoughts. Did she really want to continue? All the other beginners were off in dark corners practicing that bondage stuff, and Master Dan would be expecting to do that with her. And he wasn\u2019t any beginner. A little thrill ran through her at the thought of his big hands on her, and she squashed it down. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know him, and to let him tie me up or something seems insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand completely. What can I tell you about him...\u201d Jessica tapped a finger against her chin as she thought. \u201cHe and Master Z are friends, and he\u2019s been a club member for years. He used to come with his wife, but she died, and he hasn\u2019t been seriously involved with anyone since. Z said he\u2019s changed; apparently he used to laugh a lot more. He helps with the beginners, and you certainly aren\u2019t the first new sub he\u2019s taken under command. Oh, and the subs say he\u2019s one of the best Doms in the place.\u201d</p><p>Kari breathed out. Was she pleased or unhappy with this information? Knowing he was a respectable Dom\u2014and didn\u2019t that sound like a contradiction in terms\u2014meant she had no excuse to back out. And she both wanted to and didn\u2019t want to stop, before anything got more intense. She sighed and finished her drink.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s scary stuff when you\u2019re not used to it.\u201d Jessica pursed her lips and gave Kari a wry look. \u201cAnd even when you are used to it. If you have a good Dom, that sense of uneasiness can be pretty exciting.\u201d</p><p>Kari glanced toward the front and saw the group of dungeon monitors reentering the room. Master Dan\u2019s gaze scanned the room. When his eyes came to rest on her, the floor seemed to drop a few inches, leaving her dizzy. Apparently, his look was even more potent than the other Doms.</p><p>He strode over to the bar, his gait long and powerful, and stood so close she could feel the heat radiate off his body. He smiled at Jessica. \u201cThank you for staying with her,\u201d he said. \u201cKari, did she answer your questions?\u201d</p><p>Kari nodded.</p><p>His hand tilted her chin up so he could look directly in her eyes. \u201cDo I have your trust? Do you want to continue?\u201d</p><p>She bit back the yes that wanted to escape from her lips. Think, Kari. But she knew the answer, and it wasn\u2019t changing. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best,\u201d Jessica said. That must be better than blundering around with beginners. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cContinue.\u201d Oh God, was she insane?</p><p>She glanced at Jessica, and her uncertainty must have shown.</p><p>Jessica gave her a sympathetic look. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to Z then.\u201d She shook her finger at Master Dan. \u201cYou be nice to her.\u201d</p><p>Master Dan frowned. \u201cIf you were mine, I\u2019d beat you more often.\u201d</p><p>Appalled, Kari sucked in a breath and then saw a smile pull at his lips, the gleam of laughter in his eyes.</p><p>And Jessica only laughed as she slid off the stool and moved away.</p><p>Grasping Kari around the waist with hard hands, Master Dan lifted her off the stool and set her on her feet. Startled, she clung to his arms for a second, getting her balance. \u201cAll right, Kari. Here are the rules for the rest of the evening. You do what I say. Immediately. Without arguing. You don\u2019t speak unless I ask you a question. If you say anything, it had better be \u2018yes, Sir.\u2019 You will address me as either Sir or Master Dan.\u201d</p><p>His voice roughened. \u201cWhat do you say to me, little sub?\u201d</p><p>Startled, she jerked, then bit her lip before answering slowly, \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice. Now let\u2019s see if I remember where we were before the lessons started.\u201d He pulled her closer. And closer until she was plastered against his body, her breasts flattened on his wide chest. He bent, taking her mouth gently, tipping her back until she grabbed his shoulders for balance. He held her easily while he plundered her lips, his tongue plunging into her mouth until her head swam. When he pulled back, her hands were buried in his hair. With a laugh, he set a hand on her bottom to press her against a hard erection. \u201cThis is what that soft, hot mouth of yours does to me,\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p><p>Her insides flared with heat.</p><p>Clamping an arm around her waist, he led her to the back of the room. They passed roped-off areas along the wall, each with a different piece of ominous-looking equipment: benches, something that looked like a sawhorse with a shelf on each side, a massive wooden X against the wall. Some had shackles and cuffs, and Kari\u2019s eyes widened as she tried to imagine how a person would be attached.</p> <p>Master Dan smiled slowly. \u201cNext time, you will see more of the equipment. And use some of it.\u201d</p><p>Oh...my. She imagined herself cuffed to the bench or on that thing against the wall, and her lower regions actually tingled. \u201cUm. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>They went past a small island of plants, and he turned into a sitting area with a couch and chairs. A coffee table had the requested RESERVED sign on it. \u201cRight here. This is as private as we\u2019re going to get tonight.\u201d He pulled her down onto the couch beside him and gripped her shoulders. \u201cAll right, Kari. What\u2019s your safe word?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Kari looked up at him. His face was serious, the humor gone. And she was alone with him.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Dan smiled as she looked at him with wide eyes. She had no idea how those helpless looks could affect a Dom.</p><p>\u201cRed,\u201d she whispered. She bit her lip again, and he couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone nibbles those lips, it will be me,\u201d he murmured, licking over the plump bottom one. He tilted his head and took her mouth, then delved deep inside. She tasted of rum and Coke and something that was essentially Kari.</p><p>She sighed, her muscles softening as need overcame her fears.</p><p>She was a challenge, and he hadn\u2019t enjoyed anyone so much in ages. He could see the passion in her, locked deep inside all those habits and rules. Even more, he could see she was sweet down to the bone, much like Marion had been. But different. Marion had enjoyed her passions; this little sub had definitely been raised by nuns.</p><p>Enfolding her in his arms, he pressed her back onto the couch. Her arms wrapped around his neck, pulling his lips back to hers. He nuzzled her neck, enjoying the light fragrance\u2014softly floral with a woman\u2019s subtle musk beneath. He wanted to explore further, to find all the places on her body where her scent was strongest.</p><p>He would get there, step-by-step.</p><p>As he deepened the kiss, she gave him anything he asked for, sucking his tongue into her mouth, giving him hers in return.</p><p>When he drew back to lean on his elbow, she made a little sound of disappointment. He studied her for a moment. A pulse beat fast in her neck; her lips were appealingly swollen and red, and her eyes heavy lidded with passion.</p><p>She was ready for more. Keeping his gaze on her, he set his hand under her long dress, slowly stroking up and down her leg, ever more upward, until he could set his palm on her crotch. She jumped a little, but he didn\u2019t move. He could feel the warmth from her pussy radiating outward. Her panties were damp, and he had to smother the urge to strip them off and bury himself inside her heat.</p><p>First things first. He wondered if she\u2019d ever remember the hour limit they\u2019d started with. Nine o\u2019clock was long past.</p><p>He caught her gaze\u2014a little dazed, fully aroused. But if he didn\u2019t keep her off balance and moving forward, all that modesty and restraint would return. Time to let her discover the joy\u2014and anxiety\u2014of vulnerability. \u201cLower the top of your dress.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched, and she tried to look around, but he caught her chin and lifted his eyebrows. \u201cWhat do you say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d Her delicate fingers undid the buttons down to the waist. He watched with a steady gaze as she glanced at him before sitting up and pulling her arms out of the dress.</p><p>He enjoyed the sight of her, his pleasure increasing as she flushed. So modest. Stripping would be one of the hardest tasks he could set her. But well worth it for him. She was a visual treat with her breasts almost overflowing the lacy white bra.</p><p>\u201cYou have lovely shoulders, Kari.\u201d He leaned forward so he could kiss his way across the pale white skin. She had little freckles scattered across her shoulders. He licked them and could swear they tasted like sugar. Since he was in the right place, he obligingly undid her bra. \u201cRemove this.\u201d</p><p>She slid it from her arms and leaned forward to place it, neatly folded, on the coffee table.</p><p>There were reasons he loved women who were bigger than stick figures, and here were two of the finest reasons: abundant, lovely breasts with pale pink nipples. Under his gaze, those nipples contracted. He touched them with just his fingertips, watched them tighten even further. \u201cWhen I\u2019m through tasting these, they will be as hard as pencil erasers and a lovely dark red.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He waited for her blush, grinned, and stroked her heated cheek.</p><p>\u201cYes, exactly that color.\u201d He let his hand slide down\u2014not like he was able to stop it\u2014under one breast, savoring the heaviness. With his fingers, he swept in a circle around one breast, then the other, never touching either nipple, tormenting until she arched her chest forward for more.</p><p>\u201cYou are still overdressed, sweetheart. Remove your panties.\u201d</p><p>This time the hesitation was longer. He lifted her chin with one finger and gave her a firm look. \u201cWhat do you say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she whispered and stood. Her fingers trembled as she pulled up the dress. Her briefs were white, but low cut and lacy. Soft and innocent and sexy like Kari herself.</p><p>He knew she was no virgin, but she might as well be, given that her deeper passions had never been explored.</p><p>She pushed her panties to the floor, stepped out. The folded panties joined her bra on the coffee table. Tidy little sub.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He grabbed a fistful of the dress she still wore and pulled her between his knees. Trembling and soft, lush, and sweet. Submissive.</p><p>And all his for the moment.</p><p>Kari shook inside, feeling far too vulnerable. He was still dressed; she was half-naked. Yet every time he ordered her to do something with a voice that would accept only compliance, she got more excited. Wetter.</p><p>Now his knees pinned her in place as he gazed at her body. His eyes were so hot, so hungry, that she brought her hands up to cover her breasts.</p><p>He caught her arms, gave her a disapproving look, and pulled her hands down. \u201cThis is my body to play with this evening, little sub. Keep your hands down at your sides. In fact, put them behind your back and lace your fingers together.\u201d His rich baritone deepened. \u201cWhat do you say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d She complied. Her hands behind her back made her breasts arch forward, almost right in his face.</p><p>He hummed in pleasure, leaned forward, and took one nipple into his mouth. His mouth was hot, lips firm, and as his tongue swirled around the nipple, she moaned, shocking herself.</p><p>When she tried to move back, he put an arm behind her. Fastening his grip over her laced fingers, he pulled her closer. His mouth tightened and his tongue rubbed her nipple against the roof of his mouth. Heat stabbed straight down to her core.</p><p>Then his free hand possessed her other breast, rolling the nipple between firm fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d Her vision blurred. She needed to move, to do something as an ache of longing burst in her lower body.</p><p>His grip tightened.</p><p>\u201cYou have magnificent breasts, Kari. I\u2019m going to enjoy them tonight.\u201d His dark brown eyes looked at her, studied her.</p><p>She looked away. This was a bar room, not a bedroom. No doors, no bed. That just wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>Even worse, she was taking a man\u2019s orders and...she liked it. Oh, she did. Each time he set those dark eyes on her, her insides softened until now her lower half felt like warm Jell-O. She didn\u2019t seem to have any control over her own body.</p><p>Releasing her, he moved to the chair. \u201cCome and sit on my lap. You look like you need a hug,\u201d he said softly. He pulled her onto his lap and leaned her against his big chest. His heart thudded beneath her ear, slow and steady, as his arms snuggled her tighter. His hands were gentle as he stroked her back and arms until she relaxed against him, feeling like a pampered pet. She rubbed her forehead against his chest with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cNot so bad, is it?\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>\u201cGuess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then we\u2019ll continue.\u201d Before she could respond, he tilted her back until her shoulders rested on the chair arm with her bottom on his lap.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She struggled to sit up, but he set a hand between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou stay where I put you, little sub,\u201d he growled, mouth flattening.</p><p>She froze. Her heart sped up as she got that strange, melting feeling again.</p><p>The corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cYou like being bossed around, don\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question and required no answer, thank heavens.</p><p>His eyes glinted with amusement. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that later. For now, you are in a very nice position.\u201d He set his hands on her breasts, stroking and massaging, teasing her nipples until they were tight and swollen and aching.</p><p>And that was before he put his mouth on her. He sucked on each nipple, rolling the peaks. He nipped one, and she gasped as a current of heat shot from her breast to her groin. Her private areas were wet, embarrassingly wet, and throbbing.</p><p>\u201cYou taste sweet,\u201d he murmured, then shook his head. \u201cAnd you\u2019re making me forget my job here. Give me your wrists.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thudded hard. Setting her cuffed wrists into his broad palm was exceedingly difficult, but she managed. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a two-foot length of chain, and snapped each end to the cuffs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being gentle with you, little sub,\u201d he said. \u201cYour hands can be in front as long as they stay where I put them.\u201d He took her arms and pushed them over her head, making her back arch. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>Why was her body almost shaking with need? \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>He played with her breasts for a few more minutes until she had to press her lips together to keep from begging him for more.</p><p>Then he ran his fingers up under her dress. She gave him a wary look even as her core heated in anticipation of his touch. His hand felt huge, pushing her legs apart as his fingers teased her pubic hair, never quite touching her mound.</p><p>She stiffened as footsteps approached their sitting area. Three men walked around the corner. A DM and two newbies.</p><p>One was Buck. Oh, no no no! Her breasts bare, his hand under her skirt... What had she done? Kari made a grab for the top of her dress.</p><p>Master Dan glanced over at the men, then said to her, \u201cPut your arms back where I placed them, sub.\u201d</p><p>He pinned her with his gaze, and she couldn\u2019t keep her arms from moving back over the arm of the chair. Her breath almost sobbed.</p><p>His gaze softened slightly. \u201cBetter.\u201d He looked at the men again and deliberately cupped her breast with his free hand. She stiffened, bit her lip to keep from moving.</p><p>Buck\u2019s hands clenched into fists, and he took a step forward. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The DM grabbed his arm. \u201cBuck, did I explain about interfering between a Dom and his sub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d The DM pushed the other two back around the plants and paused long enough to smile. \u201cPretty sub, Dan. Doesn\u2019t look like she enjoys being displayed.\u201d</p><p>Master Dan shook his head. \u201cNot this time, not with the asshole here.\u201d A grin flashed over his face. \u201cNext time, though...\u201d</p><p>With a snort of laughter, the DM followed after the men.</p><p>Sir\u2019s gaze returned to Kari, and he stroked her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, little sub,\u201d he said, his eyes as warm now as they had been cold before. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like being exposed like that.\u201d</p><p>The approval warmed her inside, at least until she remembered the shock on Buck\u2019s face. How the men had looked at her, and Sir had let them. \u201cYou should have covered me, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>His jaw hardened. \u201cNo, Kari. We discussed your interests earlier. Now that we\u2019ve started, as your Dom, I decide what is correct or proper or desired. Aside from your safe word, you have no say, no opinions, no control.\u201d</p><p>Her mind seemed to split, one part going, No, that\u2019s wrong. The other half whispering, Yes, this is what I want.</p><p>He waited quietly, his fingers playing with the curls in her long hair.</p><p>Finally she sighed.</p><p>His lips turned up. \u201cCome to any conclusions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer for a beginner.\u201d He kissed her, taking his time, nibbling on her lips, sucking her tongue into his mouth, giving her his. His hand circled her breast, his fingers toying with her nipples until heat spread through her again, and she arched uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNow, I want you to stand up for me.\u201d He helped her to her feet and turned her to face him. \u201cSit down. Ride my legs.\u201d</p><p>As he lifted her dress, she lowered herself so she straddled his knees. The dress bunched around her legs. What was he going to do?</p><p>\u201cGood. Now put your arms around me.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, she dropped her cuffed wrists over his head, sliding her arms down until her hands rested on his ribs. Her face was almost even with his, her breasts jutting toward his chest. When he cupped one of her breasts, she inhaled sharply at the heady feeling, the punch of increasing need. Could he tell how wet she was? The thought sat uneasy in her chest, and she tried to pull back, but the chain between her wrists was behind his back. Her heart gave a thud. Then she realized if she lifted her arms, she\u2019d be free. Okay, she was good. She settled a little more comfortably and looked at him.</p><p>He smiled at her slowly. \u201cGive me your right foot.\u201d He held his hand out.</p><p>She frowned. Lifting her foot that far would be really indiscreet considering she wore no panties.</p><p>\u201cKari,\u201d he growled, and her foot rose before she could tell it no. He grasped it in a callused hand and pushed it down between the seat cushion and the arm of the chair. \u201cNow\u2014\u201d He gave her a hard look. \u201cIf that foot moves from where I put it, I\u2019ll tie it in place. Is that understood?\u201d He waited. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The warning sent a rush of arousal through her, fully as intense as when he was touching her. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>She frowned as cool air touched her private areas. But the dress still covered her adequately. Thank goodness she\u2019d worn a long one today.</p><p>Watching her intently, he leaned back and slid his left hand under her skirt to press against her mound.</p><p>Startled, she jumped and tried to lift her chained wrists back over his head. She couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d trapped her chain behind his back. She tugged at her hands, and her breath sped up. She couldn\u2019t move her hands, couldn\u2019t do anything, and he had his hand between her legs. Fear shot through her, followed by a disconcerting wave of heat.</p><p>He still watched her. Now he smiled slowly and pulled his hand out from under her dress. \u201cYou like being restrained,\u201d he said softly. He showed her the wetness glistening on his fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re aroused, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She blushed from her breasts to her forehead, and he chuckled.</p><p>As he slid his hand back under her dress, she tugged again, feeling the world tilt at her helplessness, at the carnal feel of his fingers between her legs.</p><p>At knowing she couldn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>His free hand wrapped around the nape of her neck, pulling her forward. His mouth settled on hers, hot and demanding, and as his tongue took possession, he slid one hard finger into her. She inhaled sharply, tried to pull back, but his hand behind her head didn\u2019t release its hold.</p><p>His kiss deepened. Down below, his finger slid in and out, and she felt hot, needy, out of control. Exposed. She started to move her foot, to bring her legs together.</p><p>He lifted his head and gave her a hard look. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that, Kari.\u201d</p><p>She left her foot in place, her breathing heavy. His finger never stopped, and her vagina tightened around the invasion. Her raised leg trembled. And then his finger slicked out and up over her clitoris.</p><p>Her hips jerked uncontrollably. \u201cUhhhh.\u201d She bit down on her lip to keep from more betraying noises.</p><p>He stroked over the sensitive nub, spreading her slickness around her folds until her entire center tingled with need.</p><p>\u201cOpen more,\u201d he said and moved his legs apart, spreading her, exposing her further to his touch. \u201cYou have a soft pussy, sweetheart. And you\u2019re very tight.\u201d With his words, he slid his finger back up inside her, making her insides clench. When his thumb circled and stroked her clit, her hands curled helplessly against his sides.</p><p>With a low laugh, he pulled her forward, pushing her forehead against his hard chest. She needed the support as he stroked inside her, curling and hitting a sensitive spot, one that sent blood roaring through her veins like hot lava.</p><p>She could hear herself panting. Her hands closed into fists, unable to move from where they were pinned against his sides. She could only take what he was doing to her. His free hand stroked across her breasts, sending sharp, spiking lines of heat through her as he rolled her nipples between his fingers.</p><p>Her thighs quivered uncontrollably. Everything tightened inside her. Each stroke inside and each flick of his thumb on her clit sent her closer, until her breathing stopped and the pressure built. Waiting, waiting... He pulled his hand back and then pushed two fingers into her, the thickness stunning, and she broke as devastating pleasure burst inside her, as her vagina convulsed around his impaling fingers, as her hips bucked to his thrusts, over and over.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>She was absolutely beautiful when she came, Dan thought. Her lips parted, cheeks flushed pink. Her chest heaved as she panted, jostling those luscious breasts. Her response was so honest.</p><p>After he\u2019d induced the last few spasms, he removed his hand, enjoying the heady fragrance of her arousal. Releasing her wrists, he repositioned her so she could rest in his arms. He could feel her heart pounding when he cupped a breast.</p><p>Exhausted, she lay against his chest, limp as overcooked spaghetti. Damn, she was a comfortable armful. Little and round, fragrant and responsive. And sweet. He kissed the top of her head.</p><p>When her breathing slowed, she lifted her head. \u201cUm...I...well...thank you.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. Her cheeks were even pinker now than when she\u2019d come. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, little sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about you? You didn\u2019t...\u201d Her whispered words were muffled, her face pressed against his chest.</p><p>Sweet. \u201cI\u2019ll survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>He tilted her chin up so she had to look at him. \u201cYou know, I would like nothing better than to tie you down, open you up, and bury my cock in that wet pussy.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled sharply and quivered.</p><p>He stroked her cheek with his thumb. Silky smooth. \u201cAnd you would like it too, little sub, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Another wash of red across her face. Her pulse picked back up. She was unable to meet his eyes as she nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t ready for that tonight, sweetie, and the time for your beginner class ends about now. I don\u2019t think you want to have a dungeon monitor find you with your legs over my shoulders and me deep inside you.\u201d The thought made him harden. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>Her spine straightened. She shook her head. \u201cI think I\u2019d better go now.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her breasts, watched the nipples move from after-climax softness to hard points again. He hadn\u2019t had enough time with those breasts; they weren\u2019t nearly pink enough. But hell, it really was time to stop.</p><p>With a sigh, he grabbed her bra and helped her into it, covering the dual temptations. He buttoned her dress, nudging her hands out of the way when she tried to help. \u201cI enjoy dressing you,\u201d he murmured and grinned. \u201cOf course, I enjoyed undressing you more.\u201d</p><p>Having her entirely naked would be even better. An image of her in bed, arms chained over her head, squirming under his mouth, his fingers, his cock, made him harden even further, as if he hadn\u2019t already been in pain since the moment his fingers touched her damp panties.</p><p>But a beginner deserved a gentle first experience, just enough to learn what being restrained felt like, but not enough to scare her.</p><p>With one hand along her jaw, he held her for his kiss, his grip tight enough she could feel his strength and her helplessness. Reminding her of what domination meant. When he released her, that succulent little body trembled.</p><p>\u201cNow, you have an idea of what submission means,\u201d he whispered. Was there anything headier than a woman quivering in his arms? Knowing he could take her in any way he wanted. Knowing he could make her come, over and over, by his touch.</p><p>And knowing his words alone could send her into total confusion. \u201cDid you like being restrained, Kari?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to shout at him. The man knew full well how embarrassed talking about sex made her, and he asked her that deliberately. Shoot, every time he held her in place, her insides went all soft and liquid, and he knew that too. Annoyance flared inside her.</p><p>\u201cKari. I asked you a question.\u201d His voice had that edge of command. Deeper, harder.</p><p>\u201cYes, dammit.\u201d He\u2019d made her swear. She glared at him. And what kind of slutty woman was she to like being cuffed and ordered around and... Her body remembered the overwhelming feel of his fingers moving in her, on her, and she clenched inside. She wasn\u2019t going to get into a discussion about this. Absolutely not. \u201cI liked it. Okay?\u201d</p><p>One eyebrow raised, and his lips flattened into a hard line. He tilted her suddenly, back against his left arm, pinning her right side up against his chest. He secured her left wrist with one hand. As his arm tightened around her, his right hand slid under her skirt, between her legs, and he pushed a finger right into her.</p><p>She gasped, struggled. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe silent.\u201d He set his thumb on her still-sensitive clit, pressing firmly.</p><p>She gasped against the shock of awakening need.</p><p>\u201cNow, I can keep you here, just like this, finger-fucking you until you\u2019re screaming for release, until the entire club can hear you.\u201d</p><p>His graphic words widened her eyes with horror.</p><p>\u201cOr you can apologize and remember how a sub addresses a Dom in this club.\u201d His finger started moving in and out, his thumb making circles on her clit, and she realized he could easily make her lose control. She pulled at her hand and got nowhere; his grip was tighter than the cuffs, and the feeling of helplessness sent arousal soaring within her.</p><p>His finger moved within her, slow and sure, then fast and hard, circles and strokes. She burned, her hips rising into his hand. He stopped suddenly, leaving her throbbing, his dark eyes on her face.</p><p>She realized she was breathing hard and pressed her lips together. Okay, so no problem. She\u2019d cool down and\u2014</p><p>He started again, plunging in and out, and she let out a cry, her hips thrashing uncontrollably. Oh, God, he could do just what he\u2019d said. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, Sir. I\u2019ll be more careful. Please\u2014\u201d</p><p>His grin was a flash of white, then gone. \u201cApology accepted.\u201d When he removed his hand, her whole lower half ached with need. \u201cAnd how you feel now will remind of you this lesson in the future.\u201d</p><p>She started to glare at him, got a level look, and managed to give him a tight-lipped smile.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSweetheart, I hope you don\u2019t play poker.\u201d</p><p>With his hand\u2014she could smell herself on his fingers\u2014he turned her head and took her lips. She tried to push him away, realized her hand was still gripped in his, and again the heat rose within her. His kiss was hard, thorough, and long. It left her head spinning and her body aching even more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he lifted his head, she couldn\u2019t move, could only manage a shuddery breath. With a soft chuckle, he kissed her cheek and cuddled her against his big chest. She rolled her head against him, contented and a little confused.</p><p>When he held her, controlled her, she got so aroused, but when Buck did almost exactly the same things\u2014ordering her, wanting to restrain her\u2014she felt repelled. That didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>Of course, any woman with a functioning ovary would see Sir and want him. Oh, yes. But it was more than that. Part of what made her so hot and needy was the aura of power around him. No, more than that...controlled power.</p><p>He didn\u2019t let his body lead him around. He didn\u2019t let her lead him around either. And he was honest. She didn\u2019t have to guess if she did something right. If he wasn\u2019t happy, she found out right away. If he wanted her to do something, he said so.</p><p>And he liked her body. Liked her. She really liked him too. Especially right now. Getting off\u2014when she did\u2014always left her feeling a little lost. Vulnerable. But the way he held her so firmly against him made her feel safe. Cherished, even.</p><p>Even if she had more questions about herself than when she started, he\u2019d given her an evening to remember.</p><p>She set her hand on his cheek, feeling the roughness of beard shadow. \u201cSir,\u201d she whispered and pulled his head down so she could kiss him and show him how much she appreciated his consideration.</p><p>When they broke this time, his eyes were soft as he looked down at her. \u201cKari,\u201d he murmured. He pulled her tighter against him, his hand stroking her shoulder. \u201cSweetheart, you are...\u201d</p><p>He stopped, and his hand froze against her arm. For a moment, he looked at her as if he didn\u2019t know who she was.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together, and his arms loosened. Then he pushed her to her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s time you went home.\u201d</p><p>When he stood, she lifted a hand toward him but let it drop. \u201cAre you mad? Did I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>His mouth smiled, but his eyes didn\u2019t. \u201cNo, you did nothing wrong. You\u2019re a very nice woman, Kari.\u201d</p><p>Well, talk about damned with faint praise.</p><p>Silently, he walked her back to where the DMs had herded the beginners into a group. Master Raoul appeared to check if anyone had questions and remind them the second beginners\u2019 class was Wednesday.</p><p>As the others dispersed, Kari turned to Master Dan. \u201cThank you for the...um, lesson.\u201d How awkward this was. She wanted to touch him, but he looked so cold.</p><p>He nodded, his face unreadable, his eyes without warmth. It was as if he\u2019d pulled himself behind some impenetrable wall. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came, Kari. I hope you enjoy the next couple of lessons. Be careful with your next choice of Dom.\u201d He nodded to her and walked toward the exit.</p><p>Staring after him, she rubbed her hands over her arms, feeling a distinct chill. What had she done wrong? She had smarted off earlier, but he\u2019d obtained his revenge for that.</p><p>She\u2019d kissed him. Was that against the rules? Shoot, whatever she\u2019d done, he obviously wasn\u2019t going to have anything to do with her in the future. But he could have been a little nicer about it.</p><p>She tried to work up a good anger instead of feeling lost. What a jerk, walking off like that. \u201cFine then,\u201d she muttered to his back. \u201cYou have a nice life too.\u201d Turning, she almost ran into Sally.</p><p>The trainee had obviously overheard everything. Her gaze was full of sympathy.</p><p>\u201cSo what was that all about? Did I do something wrong?\u201d Kari asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, girlfriend. That\u2019s just Master Dan; only he\u2019s not usually that abrupt.\u201d Sally stared after him, her brows together. \u201cBut it\u2019s not you. He never uses a sub more than one night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d The unhappy lump in Kari\u2019s stomach grew bigger. So she was just another submissive to him. Here she\u2019d thought there was more than that between them. God, she could be stupid about men. \u201cGot it. Thanks, Sally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. We subs stick together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Kari?\u201d</p><p>Kari turned to see the security guard. Oh, great, had she done something else wrong? \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ben. Master Dan asked me to walk you to your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need an escort,\u201d she said, then hesitated. Buck lingered near the room exit. \u201cThen again, I\u2019d love the company. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>As they walked past Buck, he gave her a sheepish smile. \u201cKari, I wanted to apologize. I was nervous and took it out on you.\u201d He glanced at the guard. \u201cI don\u2019t want to keep you from leaving. How about I call you later this week and we\u2019ll talk? I hope you can forgive me.\u201d</p><p>What could she say? After the way Master Dan had brushed her off like a nasty bug that had gotten into his soup, Buck\u2019s eagerness to be with her was comforting. She moved her shoulders and gave him a weak smile. \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing to forgive. We\u2019ll talk later this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He nodded at Ben and strode away, his step with a bounce in it.</p><p>Well, at least one person thought she was nice. A shame Master Dan didn\u2019t feel the same.</p><p>Dan stalked into his apartment, stripping off his leathers on the way to the bedroom. He threw them into the corner. What a crappy evening.</p><p>In the kitchen, he grabbed a beer and sucked half of it down before dropping into his chair in the living room. The cold brew helped, but he was still pissed, and he thumped his head against the back of the chair. What the hell was wrong with him, anyway?</p><p>Like he didn\u2019t know. He saw her again, like he\u2019d been seeing her every few minutes on the drive home: Kari soft and round in his arms, her eyes glazed with passion, her lips swollen from his mouth. He hardened further, if that could be possible. Hell, he\u2019d been hard all night.</p><p>He should have grabbed Sally or one of the other trainees and obtained some relief before leaving. So why the hell hadn\u2019t he? Because Kari would have felt betrayed? He wasn\u2019t married to her, involved with her; why should her feelings matter?</p><p>And there... That was the problem, the reason he felt like shit right now. The little sub had gotten to him. She didn\u2019t look like Marion, and her personality was very different, but she sure as hell brought out his possessive nature. She\u2019s mine, her body is mine, that laugh is mine. That swollen mouth is mine, and I made it look like that.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t Marion. No one could be.</p><p>He opened his eyes, his gaze falling to the photograph sitting on an end table. Marion on a spanking bench, leaning so far forward her lovely breasts spilled out of the black corset. Laughter filled her face as she dared him to take her.</p><p>She was dead. All that life, that passion gone.</p><p>His fault, dammit. After being called back to the station that night, he\u2019d canceled the evening they\u2019d planned. She\u2019d yelled at him and then gone out to party without him. It had been raining...</p><p>Too much alcohol, too fast, too wet.</p><p>The highway patrol had called him at the station that night. He hadn\u2019t believed them. Fuck, he hadn\u2019t accepted her death for a good year after.</p><p>If he\u2019d stayed home, she wouldn\u2019t have died. He knew that. Even though his grief had finally eased, the guilt had become part of him. Sometimes he felt as if he\u2019d already joined her, become just another cold, gray body in the morgue.</p><p>He studied the photo. She\u2019d loved him, truly loved him; he\u2019d always known that. But she would have moved on by now.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. And so, no matter how that little sub made him feel, he wouldn\u2019t see her again.</p><p>Tipping his head back, he finished the beer. Considering how rude he\u2019d been when he left her, she\u2019d undoubtedly gotten the message that she was on her own. Why didn\u2019t that make him feel better?</p><p>Dressed in her robe and pajamas, Kari picked up the cup of herbal tea and took it out to her small backyard patio. The wide swing rocked gently as she curled up and leaned her head back on the cushions. What a very strange night.</p><p>The phone had been ringing as she walked in the door. Buck, calling to check that she got home safely. He\u2019d apologized again before hanging up. She frowned. Sometime in the next day or so, she\u2019d have to decide if she wanted to see him again. Her first few dates with him had been fun, so maybe she was being oversensitive about his behavior at the club. He\u2019d probably been nervous, and some people became hypercritical when stressed.</p><p>Then again, he hadn\u2019t been stressed last week. She giggled, remembering how he\u2019d instructed her on the proper way to fold hand towels. Talk about nitpicky. Perhaps this would be a good time to call it quits.</p><p>She took a sip of tea. The chamomile scent drifted up from the cup and mingled with the fragrance of her roses. Her tiny tiered fountain gurgled pleasantly, the water glinting in the moonlight. A breeze rustled through the bushes and flowers, lifting the muggy heat.</p><p>As she rocked the swing, the soft pajamas chafed her breasts, her nipples so tender the thin cotton fabric felt like sandpaper. Her thoughts drifted back to the club. How could she ever process all her impressions?</p><p>That BDSM stuff had put her into a constant state of arousal, and everything Master Dan had done only increased it. From holding her arms down and kissing her, to the helplessness of having her hands cuffed together, to being pinned in the chair with his fingers\u2014his fingers\u2014inside her. That memory made her entire private area ache and dampen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d called that area her pussy. Since starting to teach high school, she\u2019d heard the oddly descriptive term a time or two, but it certainly never appeared in any biology textbook</p><p>She set the swing to rocking again. Although his fingers, his mouth\u2014heck, everything he\u2019d done had been stimulating\u2014the huge difference had come from feeling helpless, from having no control.</p><p>She\u2019d never been so excited in her life. Had never had an orgasm like that...ever. And God, she wanted to do it all over again.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t have Master Dan with her next time. The thought made her stomach twist, so she sipped more tea. He had been...overwhelming. She couldn\u2019t get him out of her mind, how his face had looked when he\u2019d touched her. The way he\u2019d watched her so intently. How he\u2019d pushed her, controlled her.</p> <p>Jessica said there were other experienced Doms. Would she feel the same with one of them? Would they have the same deep laugh, firm hands...? She sighed, remembering the hard, clean line of his jaw, the corded muscles in his neck. Would they have those?</p><p>No, probably not. But she\u2019d discovered something about herself tonight. The way her body reacted to domination was what she\u2019d been looking for all her life. Master Dan\u2019s control had filled a need inside her. Scary as the thought of returning to the club alone might be, she wasn\u2019t going to stop now.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>The warm tropical breeze lifted Kari\u2019s hair as she hurried up to the Shadowlands on Wednesday evening. She scowled at the setting sun. She was late. The stupid car had overheated, forcing her to drive slower. She really needed to get it to the repair shop.</p><p>She\u2019d always hated being tardy, but it was far, far worse tonight. Her stomach churned, like she\u2019d eaten worms for lunch instead of her usual tuna sandwich. And she probably should have eaten supper instead of changing clothes fifteen times; she still had not found anything appropriate.</p> <p>What if everyone was here already? This was just so not like her, going someplace alone. At least Buck had accompanied her on Monday, even if that hadn\u2019t lasted long. She grinned briefly.</p><p>Her smile faded as she remembered who had taken his place. And how unhappily the evening had ended.</p><p>But if she didn\u2019t attend this class, she\u2019d feel like a coward, like Master Dan had driven her away. She wiped her damp hands on her dress and raised her chin. To heck with Sir anyway; she\u2019d darned well have fun with someone else.</p><p>The tall oak doors were open. Sucking in a breath, she walked inside. Behind the desk, the big guard rose, and a smile lightened his battered face. \u201cWelcome back, Miss Kari.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ben.\u201d</p><p>He flipped through the file box on the desk, found her name, made a check on the card. \u201cGive me your shoes and socks; then you can go right in.\u201d He pointed to the door on the far wall, not the one that led to Master Z\u2019s office. Apparently she didn\u2019t have to go through the screening process again.</p> <p>After setting her blue-striped sneakers and pink socks on his desk, she looked at the door and hesitated. Last chance to escape. Her feet didn\u2019t want to move. After a minute, she glanced at the guard.</p><p>His brows drew together, making him look just plain mean. \u201cDid you have trouble here last time?\u201d he growled. \u201cSomething I should know about?\u201d</p><p>Oh heavens. \u201cNo, not at all. Everyone was very nice.\u201d Did putting cuffs on a woman fall into the nice category? \u201cI\u2019m just...\u201d She sighed and confessed, \u201cI\u2019m working up my nerve. I\u2019m not used to going places like this by myself, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d Ben grinned at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the look of a loner. Hang on just a sec.\u201d He pressed a button on his desk.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait!\u201d Too late.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The bartender\u2019s voice barked out of the intercom.</p><p>\u201cIf Jessie\u2019s in there, can you ask if she\u2019d escort one of the newbie subs inside? She\u2019s feelin\u2019 a little lonely.\u201d</p><p>A snort. \u201cIf she\u2019s a sub, she won\u2019t be lonely long.\u201d A pause. \u201cShe\u2019s on her way out.\u201d</p> <p>Kari felt like a kindergartner refusing to walk into school on the first day. \u201cI would have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d Ben sat back down at the desk. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019re not the first novice to get scared, won\u2019t be the last.\u201d</p><p>The inner door opened, and the woman who Kari had met on Monday trotted out, her blonde hair bouncing. \u201cHey, I was hoping you\u2019d be back.\u201d</p><p>Kari smiled, pleasure mingling with relief. \u201cThanks for rescuing me. I\u2019m not sure why I froze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen there, done that.\u201d Jessica grinned at the guard. \u201cRight, Ben?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou were trouble from the beginning. Get a move on. I think she\u2019s the last to arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, let\u2019s get you in before Raoul gets all huffy.\u201d Jessica pushed Kari through the doors and into the club room.</p><p>Trying not to be obvious, Kari looked around for Master Dan. His tall figure didn\u2019t appear, and disappointment grew inside her, making her chest ache.</p><p>As they passed the bar, the bartender, Master Cullen, grinned at Kari. \u201cNow if I\u2019d known it was you, I\u2019d have gone out myself to hold your hand.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a tentative smile, unsure if he was joking or not.</p><p>At the end of the room, they found the class. Jessica patted her shoulder, whispered, \u201cSee you later,\u201d and headed away.</p><p>\u201cWell, everyone has returned for more. I\u2019m pleased.\u201d Master Raoul rested his hip on the back of the couch. \u201cOn Monday, we covered safe words, basic restraints, and safety issues. Now you\u2019ve had a chance to practice, does anyone have questions?\u201d</p><p>As the students shook their heads, Kari took the time to look them over. About half were obviously couples, standing beside each other, holding hands, mostly man-woman sets, with an occasional guy-guy or woman-woman. The singles divided fairly evenly between the two sexes.</p><p>\u201cYou came back.\u201d A whisper behind her and she thrilled, thinking Sir had found her. She felt his breath on her neck and glanced over her shoulder. Buck. Oh joy. He stood too close, his thighs brushing against her bottom.</p><p>\u201cHi, Buck.\u201d She hadn\u2019t returned his message on her answering machine. She tried to edge away without being too blatant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed seeing you,\u201d he whispered. He ran his hand down her arm, then turned his attention to the instructor. She let out a relieved sigh.</p><p>Raoul went through the basics of domination and then talked a woman named Linda through a slave posture. Kari winced. Slave didn\u2019t sound as harmless as sub, somehow. He explained the club dress code and about the \u201cprivate play\u201d rooms upstairs. The penalties for interrupting a scene. Cleaning the equipment.</p><p>And then he started on a tour of the room, explaining the furniture in each of the roped-off areas. He shackled one of the gay men to a big wooden X called a St. Andrew\u2019s cross. Then came a spanking bench, a bondage table, an exotic lacing table, a sawhorse, a whipping post, two cages in a corner, a spiderweb thing, a stockade. He used a different sub to demonstrate each piece of equipment.</p><p>\u201cKari, your turn,\u201d he called, motioning to something called a bondage chair.</p><p>She swallowed and moved forward. At least he didn\u2019t strip anyone, just demonstrated the various restraints and how each piece could be used. She seated herself on the chair. After Master Raoul fastened her ankles to the chair legs, her wrists to the chair arms, she realized the center of the seat was cut out, leaving just her buttocks perched on the edge. With legs shackled open, and the missing chair bottom, a naked person\u2019s private parts would be on display. She shivered, relieved when the instructor unfastened her.</p><p>After two more pieces of equipment, Master Raoul said, \u201cThat\u2019s it for the formal lesson. All the equipment down here is duplicated in various upstairs rooms if you prefer private play. Remember that gags are forbidden at this point in your classes. DMs will be in the hallways upstairs and down here to answer questions or intervene if there\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>He looked at each sub in turn, his expression serious. \u201cSubs, no matter what safe word you agree on between your partner, the club safe word is red. If you shout that out, a DM will come to see if everything is all right. Remember, \u2018safe, sane, and consensual\u2019 are the operative words here. Got that, everyone?\u201d</p><p>People nodded.</p><p>\u201cRemember, you discuss what you will be doing first and reach an agreement. Establish trust before you jump in. Class is dismissed. Pair up as you wish.\u201d He frowned as he counted the single newbies. \u201cAnyone left without a partner talk to me over at the bar.\u201d</p><p>As he walked away, the singles began talking. One couple headed out, then another. Kari saw two men watching her, one with a cruel look in his eyes that made her stomach twist, and the other would probably run if she said boo. She thought about what Master Dan had done to her, tried to imagine letting either of the men do anything with her, and couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cKari, honey. How about we try using that spiderweb?\u201d An easy smile on his face, Buck approached and set his hand on her shoulder.</p><p>Without thinking, she stepped back and shook her head. Her instinctive reaction reminded her of Master Dan asking how her body felt about something. Maybe she\u2019d listen to her body for once. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Buck. I don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d Let you have any control over me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That would be rude. Oh, she just wasn\u2019t comfortable saying no to people or hurting their feelings. She glanced at the diminishing group of singles and realized she didn\u2019t want to be with any of them. That solved her problem nicely. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not staying for the practice part. But thank you for the offer.\u201d</p><p>Nolan strolled into the club room and smiled at the underlying scent of sweat, fear, pain, and sex that Z\u2019s fancy cleaning crew could never remove. Muscles he didn\u2019t know had been tight started to loosen.</p><p>As he crossed to the bar, he checked out the changes. A few new pieces of equipment\u2014a lacing table, a spiderweb. There\u2019d probably be a few other things in the theme rooms. Z liked toys.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nolan, welcome home!\u201d Rising from a bar stool, Raoul shook Nolan\u2019s hand, a grin on his swarthy face. He glanced at Nolan\u2019s gold-trimmed vest. \u201cI see Z already tagged you for DM duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan!\u201d Cullen\u2019s yell set his ears ringing as the bartender leaned across the bar to thump his shoulder. \u201cDamn, dude, where have you been?\u201d</p><p>Nolan thought on it for a minute. \u201cHere and there. Mostly Baghdad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo alcohol there, I bet.\u201d Cullen slid a cold Corona over.</p><p>Nolan stared at it. Nobody else drank Corona around here. \u201cThat beer over a year old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Z told me you were back. I stocked up,\u201d Cullen said.</p><p>The welcome made Nolan\u2019s chest tighten. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still look like a nasty bastard,\u201d Cullen commented, ignoring a couple of newbies signaling for his attention. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have the subs all scared and clamoring for your attention. How\u2019s your pretty slave doing, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI uncollared Felicia before I deployed,\u201d Nolan said. And although he\u2019d missed her, he hadn\u2019t realized how much of a strain being a master twenty-four/seven was until she was gone. \u201cSo it\u2019s been a while. I\u2019m looking forward to playing again.\u201d He sucked down half the brew, something else he\u2019d missed. \u201cAnything new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZ has a sub now, a cutie. Grabbed her before she even made it through the door,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cHell, he had her before she even knew she was submissive, but she hooked him right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZ? Hooked?\u201d Nolan set his beer down. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like. Good match,\u201d Raoul said. \u201cI thought for a minute Dan was going to follow in his footsteps. He took on a beginner Monday, a sweet little sub, and looked pretty involved, but he chilled out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the pretty sub Jessica was talking to? Kari?\u201d Cullen asked.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Raoul nodded toward the group of beginners. \u201cLittle, round, really polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her.\u201d Cullen scratched his cheek. \u201cAnd Dan needs someone to kick him out of his rut. When Marion died, seems like she took him with her. The asshole hardly laughs anymore.\u201d He studied the beginner class. \u201cYeah, she might be good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZ must have thought so. He asked Dan to take her on.\u201d</p><p>Nolan listened idly. Dan\u2019d had a rough time there, losing his wife like that. It was time he came out of that dark shell. Turning, he checked out the class. The singles had dwindled until only a few remained. He identified the sub whom Raoul and Cullen had mentioned, watched a wannabe Dom brace her, try for her. She not only turned the guy down but left the group entirely, heading toward the bar. Very pretty, short, and curvy like he preferred.</p><p>\u201cHeads up,\u201d he warned Raoul. \u201cIncoming.\u201d</p><p>Kari walked away from the other newbies, feeling like a failure. She\u2019d made it here, attended the class, but she\u2019d basically blown the final by not practicing what she\u2019d learned. But she just couldn\u2019t. Not with them. Face it, she\u2019d been hoping Master Dan would be here, would have changed his mind. Dumb, Kari. He\u2019d made himself quite clear.</p><p>She started toward the door and then stopped. She should be polite and tell Master Raoul she was leaving. For all she knew, he might do a head count at the end of the night.</p> <p>Master Raoul was at the bar like he\u2019d said, talking with Cullen. Next to Raoul, another DM, a big, darkly tanned man around forty, leaned on the bar, listening. With a white scar across one cheekbone and cold black eyes, the man just plain looked dangerous. She gave him a wide berth and stopped on Raoul\u2019s other side.</p><p>Cullen broke off in midsentence and smiled at her. \u201cLittle Kari, how are you?\u201d The look he gave her warmed her right to her toes.</p><p>Ignoring the quiver in her stomach, she nodded back. \u201cI\u2019m fine. And how are you?\u201d Oops. \u201cAh...Sir.\u201d</p><p>Cullen and Raoul chuckled. The other man didn\u2019t even smile.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cCan I get you something to drink, or is someone waiting for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d She turned to Master Raoul. \u201cI\u2019m going to call it an early night, but I enjoyed your class very much. Thank you.\u201d She nodded and moved toward the door.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Master Raoul\u2019s command had a snap in it.</p><p>Kari\u2019s feet froze before her brain had processed the word. She turned.</p><p>\u201cAre you having a problem with one of the other beginners?\u201d Master Raoul\u2019s eyes narrowed as he inspected the class.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. I just am not\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t think of a way to say this politely. \u201cI feel uncomfortable with\u2014\u201d With beginners. She shrugged rather than finish. \u201cI see no need to practice, so I\u2019ll head out. I appreciate your concern.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been studying her face. \u201cGoing from Master Dan to a beginner... I see the problem. I\u2019ll find you an experienced Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve had a little experience,\u201d Master Cullen said mildly.</p><p>Raoul snorted. \u201cLike fifteen years or so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that.\u201d Cullen lifted his head and shouted toward the front of the room, \u201cDan! Man the bar. I\u2019m taking some playtime.\u201d He ducked under the bar and towered over Kari. \u201cI\u2019ll top you tonight.\u201d</p><p>She managed to close her mouth. \u201cWell...\u201d Experienced, for sure. More easygoing than Sir\u2014or at least more talkative. The set of his jaw, the way he watched her expressions made her think he might be as intimidating as Sir.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t the same sense of connection with him or the trust she\u2019d felt with Master Dan. But so what. Her reasons for being here were still valid. \u201cThank you. I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Kari heard footsteps behind her, then Master Dan\u2019s voice with a hint of laughter. \u201cYou and your damned playtimes. I\u2019ll babysit the bar for a couple hours, but that\u2019s it, Cullen.\u201d</p><p>Sir\u2019s deep, rough voice singed through every pathway in Kari\u2019s body, and her insides melted like a sun-warmed chocolate bar. She stiffened but didn\u2019t turn around. Cowardly, but she didn\u2019t want to see his face turn cold again.</p><p>Cullen looked down at her, and a smile flickered over his hard-hewn face. He put a heavy arm across her shoulders and mashed her against his side. And then, hand gripping her shoulder so she couldn\u2019t escape, he turned them both to face Master Dan.</p><p>\u201cWell, Dan, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to want to stop at two hours.\u201d Cullen rubbed his knuckles gently across her cheek. \u201cLittle Kari looks like she\u2019s got more stamina than that.\u201d</p><p>Master Dan saw her, and his face turned to stone. Even as his gaze dissected her like a bug, his mouth thinned. His anger hit her like a fist to the chest.</p><p>Kari pulled in a shaky breath and tried to back away, despite the restraining arm around her shoulders. What had she done to make him so mad at her?</p><p>\u201cDan, buddy, you got a problem?\u201d Cullen asked, his voice as easy as if Sir didn\u2019t look murderous. Raoul\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Sir\u2019s gaze never left Kari as his jaw tightened. He inhaled slowly as his iron will imposed control. When his eyes released Kari, she almost staggered.</p><p>Sir\u2019s gaze rested on the bartender and then a corner of his mouth curved upward. \u201cYou asshole. Your fucking sense of humor is going to get you killed one of these days. Maybe today.\u201d</p><p>Kari wrapped her arms around herself. She\u2019d seen quite a bit of fighting in the schools, but these two guys were huge. They\u2019d destroy the whole bar.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t enjoyed anything so much in days.\u201d Cullen\u2019s laugh boomed in the quiet room. \u201cBut you know, you\u2019re scaring my sub.\u201d His hand squeezed her shoulder, pulled her a little closer.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Dan\u2019s hands fisted as possessiveness burned through him in a red-tinged wave. One more word and he\u2019d knock his fucking friend across the room. \u201cDon\u2019t push me.\u201d</p><p>Cullen grinned.</p><p>Dan moved closer. When Kari\u2019s big blue eyes lifted to meet his, his breath was sucked away. He couldn\u2019t keep from touching her long, wavy hair, running his fingers down her soft cheek. She trembled. He\u2019d scared her, dammit.</p><p>Cullen cleared his throat. \u201cDan, I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dan kept his eyes on Kari. \u201cGo away, Cullen. Playtime\u2019s over. She\u2019s mine.\u201d He sucked in a breath and corrected himself. \u201cMine for this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should make you work a little harder, but okay.\u201d Cullen dropped his arm. \u201cKari, I\u2019ll be here if you need me.\u201d He moved away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dan held out his hand.

She couldn\u2019t possibly understand his behavior, considering he didn\u2019t understand it himself. \u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes wary, she chewed on her lip, and he hardened at the memory of how soft those lips had been. She shook her head, and his mouth tightened. He\u2019d never forgive himself for\u2014</p><p>\u201cI must be crazy,\u201d she muttered and set her hand in his.</p><p>The relief almost swamped him. He led her to a nearby couch and pulled her down beside him. She wore another long dress, but this one was silky and a true blue color that matched her eyes. The top dipped low enough to display the beginning curve of her breasts, and with her full figure, it was provocative as hell.</p><p>His plans had definitely changed for the night, from wanting to avoid her to wanting to strip her naked. If he could talk her into it.</p><p>Having regained her composure, she tapped a finger on his arm. \u201cI got the impression that you were a one-night stand sort of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He laid his hand over her delicate fingers, realized her hands were chilled, and clasped them in his. \u201cTo be honest, Kari, I don\u2019t get involved with anyone. I\u2019ve found that if I keep encounters to one night, there\u2019re no hurt feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you take me from\u2014\u201d She glanced toward the bar and Cullen.</p><p>A flare of jealousy bit into his stomach like acid for the second time in five minutes. Dammit. \u201cI\u2019m here; you\u2019re here,\u201d he said, keeping his tone light.</p><p>He paused. Honesty was essential between a Dom and sub; if he wasn\u2019t willing to bare his thoughts, how could he demand the same from her?</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s more than that,\u201d he said. He pulled her closer, slid an arm behind her back. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on between you and me, but it\u2019s not finished yet.\u201d He looked away from her, and Marion\u2019s face rose in his mind, more shadowy than normal. \u201cWhen I lost my wife, I lost everything. I don\u2019t have anything to give. Only sex for a night.\u201d He didn\u2019t have more. He didn\u2019t deserve more. \u201cSo I can\u2019t offer you a commitment other than I want you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no commitment at all.\u201d She stared across the room, her gaze on someone using the bondage table. After a minute, she shook her head like a dog shedding water. \u201cBut it\u2019s enough. That\u2019s all I want too. Just sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that I can give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said under her breath, then looked at him with a smile. \u201cI was looking forward to exploring more of this BDSM stuff, but the other beginners...\u201d She frowned, obviously searching for the right words. \u201cIt seemed too much like the blind leading the blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that would be frightening.\u201d He took her chin, looked into her eyes. \u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cNot...exactly. I trust you, but I\u2019m a little scared of what you might do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, little sub, that is the point. Do you remember your safe word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He unclipped something from a metal ring on his left side. \u201cI almost forgot your jewelry. Give me your wrists.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then laid her wrists into his hand.</p><p>He buckled on fleece-lined leather cuffs. \u201cWhat the well-dressed sub wears in the Shadowlands. Master Z would have been displeased if he\u2019d seen your wrists naked.\u201d</p><p>As she frowned at them, he pulled her onto his lap, his arms holding her against his big chest. She felt just right. \u201cNow, let\u2019s run through what might happen here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Dropping her cuffed wrists to her lap, Kari leaned her head against his shoulder. Cullen probably would have been nice, but he wasn\u2019t Master Dan. She really did trust Sir to keep her safe. His solid arms felt good\u2014just right\u2014around her.</p> <p>At least until his fingers pulled down the zipper on the front of her dress. His hand slid under her bra and closed over her left breast.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She tried to pull away, but his other hand gripped her hip, holding her in place. God, she\u2019d forgotten how strong he was, how big. Her insides quivered as her breathing increased.</p><p>\u201cThe restrictions for a beginner\u2019s first night are gone, Kari,\u201d he murmured, his thumb stroking her nipple to a hard peak, the controlled power of his grip making her shake. \u201cTonight, I can\u2014and I will\u2014take you, with my hands. My mouth. My cock. Any way I want. As many times as I want.\u201d</p><p>With his hand on her breast, he could undoubtedly feel her breathing increase, her pulse speed up. \u201cYour body likes that idea,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYour body is mine to play with, to restrain, to show off. Your only response to anything I want will be, \u2018yes, Sir.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Need clawed into her as her insides turned liquid. She dampened.</p><p>As if he could tell\u2014and he probably could, the jerk\u2014he whispered, \u201cAre you wet for me now, little sub?\u201d</p><p>Her body didn\u2019t feel like her own anymore. Yes, she\u2019d wanted to explore sex here, but this was too fast. Too much.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, he removed his hand from her hip and tilted her head to meet his gaze. His eyes crinkled as he studied her face. \u201cYou\u2019re flushed. Your pulse is hammering. Your breathing is fast. Kari, either answer my question, or I will check for myself. Right here.\u201d</p><p>She gasped and closed her legs tightly at the thought of his hand under her skirt, right in the center of the room. This wasn\u2019t at all like that isolated spot he\u2019d found for them last time. Didn\u2019t he understand anything about privacy? Discretion? Politeness? She pushed at his hand and gritted out, \u201cFine. I\u2019m wet. Okay?\u201d</p><p>The minute the words left her mouth, she remembered his response the last time she\u2019d snapped at him, and her world tipped sideways.</p><p>His eyes went cold. \u201cNo, that answer is as far from okay as it can get. Open your legs for me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not.\u201d She tried to move from his lap, and his grip tightened.</p><p>\u201cSince you like multiple choice, here you go. A: You can be an example for the other subs when I drag you to the bondage table, strap you down, and let everyone see how wet you are.\u201d</p><p>Her breath choked in her throat as horror filled her.</p><p>\u201cOr B: You may apologize for your tone, and I\u2019ll let you open your legs for me here.\u201d He gave her a hard look, and she knew he\u2019d do just what he said. \u201cWhich is it, little sub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir. Please stay here.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her dress up to her knees, set a hand on her bare leg, and waited.</p><p>She tried to look around, to see if anyone could see her.</p><p>\u201cDo it now, sub, and keep your eyes on me,\u201d he ordered in a glacial voice. His command sent disconcerting heat washing through her.</p><p>Biting her lips, she eased her legs apart. His right hand stroked up between her thighs, forcing her to open farther until his palm pressed against her mound. She glanced down and turned red. Her dress was pushed up, barely covering her, and anyone could see the location of his hand.</p><p>People walked past the couch. A woman in a black bustier, fishnet stockings, and high heels glanced over and grinned. Over by the spanking bench, Buck stared at Sir, his mouth twisting into an ugly line. Then there were Master Raoul and Master Cullen at the bar...</p><p>With a low moan, Kari shoved at her skirt.</p><p>Master Dan sighed, lifted his left hand from her hip. \u201cGive me that hand.\u201d</p><p>Darn it, she knew what he planned\u2014one arm pinned against his chest, the other in his grip. She\u2019d have no choice but to let him do what he wanted.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cAnd that just made you wetter.\u201d Oh, God, he had his fingers pressed into her crotch.</p><p>\u201cHand, Kari.\u201d</p><p>Giving up, she set her hand in his. He closed his fingers around her wrist and set both their hands against her hip, holding her wedged in one place. She had a moment to feel her helplessness, and then he slid under the edge of her panties and pushed a finger inside her. Her hips jerked at the suddenness of the entry, at the flaring arousal that soared through her.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re very wet.\u201d His finger moved inside her, sent jolts of sensation through her. \u201cMakes me want to bend you over the couch and bury myself in you.\u201d</p><p>He could undoubtedly feel the way her vagina clamped down as well as she could. Oh, God.</p><p>\u201cBut I think we\u2019ll go upstairs so I can take my time exploring your body.\u201d His eyes crinkled. \u201cYou like that idea too, don\u2019t you? Answer me, sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d His finger moved, stroked the walls of her vagina in erotic circles.</p><p>\u201cAfterwards, I\u2019ll bring you back down here.\u201d He glanced at the St. Andrew\u2019s cross. \u201cI could strip you and bind you up there.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, the thought exciting. Appalling.</p><p>\u201cAh, not quite ready for that yet, are you?\u201d He nibbled on her ear. \u201cEven if I left your clothes on, I could put you in the stockade, lift your skirt, and take you there.\u201d</p><p>His finger moved within her. \u201cNot that yet, either, although the interest is there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She had no answer for him, confusion and fear and arousal so mingled inside her that she couldn\u2019t think at all. The way he had her restrained with just his body, his hands, made her feel so strange. So needy. She looked at him, unable to speak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His smile was hard, satisfied. \u201cI like that look on your face.\u201d He bent his head and took her lips ruthlessly, satisfying himself. His finger thrust in and out of her below, the twin assaults swamping her mind in desire. She trembled as urgent need coursed through her.</p><p>When he pulled away, his eyes were heavy lidded with passion, dark with promise. \u201cLet\u2019s go, sub. I have things I want to do to you.\u201d</p><p>He gave a low laugh, and she knew he\u2019d felt the clench of her insides around his finger.</p><p>He removed his finger, making her jerk, leaving her throbbing. Pushing her to her feet, he wrapped a hard arm around her waist. \u201cIf you talk fast, I\u2019ll let you choose the room.\u201d</p><p>He kept her hand firmly in his as he led her up the spiral stairs in the front corner of the room. At the top, at the sight of doors running down a long hallway, she pulled back. Sex. She was going to have sex this time. This was\u2014</p><p>\u201cLittle sub, you worry so much your head must ache.\u201d He pulled her into his arms, and his embrace turned comforting. Warm. \u201cYou\u2019re aroused. And scared.\u201d He nibbled on her neck, then kissed her until her knees sagged and the world spun.</p><p>Pulling back, he looked at her. \u201cBlue is definitely your color. Let\u2019s go with that.\u201d</p><p>Halfway down the hall, he opened a door to a small room. Candles in sconces on the gray-blue walls provided a soft, flickering light. Classical music came from speakers somewhere in the room. The room had a bed with a dark red velvet cover and a big armoire. Velvet ropes dangled from the headboard; more ropes with leather cuffs were tied to the foot of the bed. A chill crept up Kari\u2019s spine, followed by excitement. Would he really use those on her?</p><p>Placing his hands on her shoulders, he steered her to stand beside the bed. Running a hand down her front, he chuckled, realizing she\u2019d raised the zipper. With a firm hand, he pulled it all the way down. As her dress gaped open and the air hit her overheated skin, she shivered and her nipples peaked, showing through her thin lacy bra.</p><p>He touched one breast, stroking over the hard bud. His gentle finger sent little ripples of need through her.</p><p>After a second, he nudged her dress off, letting it pool at her feet, leaving her in her white bra and panties.</p><p>\u201cYour underwear is very much like you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe white for sweet, sheer lace for sexy.\u201d One hard hand held her upper arm as he ran a finger across the top of her bra, his finger warm, slightly abrasive, the touch sensitizing her skin. There was something erotic about being forced to stand still, not being able to move as a man played with her body, pleasing himself.</p><p>\u201cRemove your bra, Kari,\u201d he said, stepping back and watching her with narrowed eyes.</p><p>She fumbled with the catch, embarrassed, yet wanting his hands on her so badly her mouth was dry. The flickering lights weren\u2019t bright, but she still felt awfully exposed as her breasts spilled free. He cupped his hands under them, squeezing slightly, enough to make her suck in a breath. Enough for heat to flow through her. \u201cNow the panties can go.\u201d</p><p>Feeling awkward, she pushed them off and let them slide to the floor. His eyes on her felt hot. He smiled slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely woman, Kari. I\u2019m going to enjoy taking you.\u201d</p><p>The blunt words, so openly carnal, thrilled her. Confused her.</p><p>Gripping her upper arms, he raised her onto her toes and took her lips in a hot, wet kiss, exploring her mouth until her hands fisted with the need to touch him. He drew back and traced her swollen lips with his finger.</p><p>\u201cUp on the bed with you.\u201d He patted behind him.</p><p>Oh, God, she really was going to do this.</p><p>As she crawled up onto the bed and turned to sit, he tossed his vest on the ground, opened his leathers. Oh heavens, he was even more muscled than she\u2019d realized, and he was...huge, his erection past his belly button. Thick and hard and... \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014um\u2014You\u2019re awfully big,\u201d she ventured.</p><p>He grinned as he sheathed himself in a condom. \u201cWe\u2019ll fit, sweetie.\u201d Joining her on the bed, he pressed her down onto her back and covered her with his body, his heat unbelievable. She ran her hands over his shoulders, amazed at the contoured muscles of his back, how they tightened to rock hard with each movement.</p><p>He bit her neck, licked the spot, bit again, the pain sharp and erotic.</p><p>\u201cOpen your legs for me.\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated despite the arousal urging her on. He was so big...</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, by the time I enter that sweet pussy, you\u2019ll be begging me.\u201d He kissed her hard, forcefully. \u201cOpen your legs, Kari.\u201d</p><p>She parted her legs, and he slid between them. She could feel his penis against her entrance, the feeling exciting. Making her shiver.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I wasn\u2019t planning to do this until later, but I tire of repeating each command,\u201d he murmured, and he kissed her again, taking her mouth deeply. When he pulled back, she realized her right arm was fastened above her head, a thick rope securing her cuff to the headboard.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>He lifted her other arm and secured the wrist cuff to a rope before she\u2019d gotten past the surprise of the first.</p><p>\u201cWait. I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>One knee on each side of her hips, he sat up. His balls bumped against her pussy, making her jump. As his weight on her legs pinned her to the bed, she pulled on the ropes; her breathing increased. She was tied to the bed. Tied. Before, she could at least move; now her cuffs were fastened to something. She couldn\u2019t even run.</p><p>He tilted his head, studied her as she pulled at the ropes. Leaning forward, he held her face between his two hands, his eyes a rich brown. She stilled, feeling like a trapped animal, a shivering mouse held in someone\u2019s grip.</p><p>His rough voice was quiet. \u201cAre you in pain, Kari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t serious, was he? She was tied up, and he was sitting on her. And yet, she was horrified to feel herself getting wetter and wetter.</p><p>His hands left her face to stroke her breasts, circling the sensitive nipples until she pressed up for his touch. \u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>His hands lifted, waited.</p><p>She was breathing hard and her answer huffed between her lips. \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d His fingers closed on her nipples, pulling, rolling, each movement just one tiny step short of real pain, each squeeze sending zings of sensation straight to her groin. \u201cSuch sensitive breasts.\u201d He bent to suck one nipple into his mouth, working it, the feeling so intensely pleasurable, she cried out. He switched to the other.</p><p>\u201cLook, Kari,\u201d he said, his fingers pulling gently. \u201cSee how beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her breasts were swollen, tight with the nipples darkened to deep rose and spiking upward like tiny pencils. \u201cSay, \u2018My breasts are beautiful.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy breasts are beautiful.\u201d And they were too.</p><p>His eyes warmed with approval before he slid down her body, pressing kisses to the undersides of her breasts, nuzzling her stomach. He nipped next to her belly button, making her squeak with surprise. And then he was there. Just looking at her most private of places. Her pussy.</p><p>Totally embarrassed, she tried to close her legs.</p><p>He pushed back to lean on his heels and narrowed a gaze at her. \u201cMy body to play with,\u201d he repeated. \u201cOpen your legs for me.\u201d</p><p>She slid them out, feeling the flush working its way up her chest. She was so wet, he\u2019d see, know she was\u2014</p><p>\u201cFarther.\u201d And he just sat there, waiting. In charge. Dominant.</p><p>She slid her legs farther apart, feeling her...her everything open. Totally exposed.</p><p>\u201cVery nice. You have a lovely pussy, no matter how you try to conceal it. And I\u2019m going to enjoy it in so many ways.\u201d He pressed his hand to her there, right between her legs. \u201cI\u2019m going to lick it all over.\u201d</p><p>She could feel herself dampen and so could he. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll use a vibrator, pushing it deep inside you.\u201d Her vagina actually clenched, and he grinned wickedly, his eyes crinkling. He felt every little involuntary movement she made.</p><p>He positioned himself between her legs, his shoulders between her knees. She could feel his breath on her inner thighs, and her legs started to close against the intimacy.</p><p>\u201cKeep them open, Kari, or I will tie them open.\u201d And they both felt her wetness increase.</p><p>\u201cYou are a surprising woman, little sub.\u201d He chuckled as he rolled off the bed, one ankle already in his hand. Grabbing the fleece-lined cuff roped to the footboard, he buckled it on and tightened the rope, imprisoning her leg at an angle. He snatched her other ankle as she was trying to decide if she should fight, and there she was, spread-eagled. Just like her fantasies, only this was real. Maybe too real.</p><p>The instinctive need to be free had her pulling at the ropes holding her wrists. Her chest squeezed with fear as she tried to kick her legs, and the restraints held. He stood at the foot of the bed and watched silently. Waited until she stopped.</p><p>He lay down between her legs. With her legs pulled outward, everything was open for him.</p><p>\u201cYou have a pretty, pretty pussy, Kari. Hidden within those little brown curls\u201d\u2014he pulled her pubic hair lightly, tantalizingly\u2014\u201ceverything is pink.\u201d One finger slowly slid down the outer labia. \u201cYou\u2019re very wet for me, can you tell?\u201d He touched her right over the entrance, swirled a finger inside just long enough to make her squirm with pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he took his fingers away, leaving her aching, she whined like a child.</p><p>\u201cWe have time, sweetheart, and I\u2019m going to take my time.\u201d</p><p>She almost blurted out a protest. Take me now; put your hands on me now. She managed to close her lips.</p><p>He stroked down her thigh, his hand so big that his fingers could curl underneath. His knuckles traced the path back up, across her tender, sensitive inner thigh, lightly over her pubis, and down the other leg. Almost to the right spot. Exquisite torture. Her fingernails dug into her palms as he stroked her legs, the curls on her pubis, the soft crease where her hip met her leg.</p><p>Her clitoris throbbed more with each pass, with each time he didn\u2019t touch her where she so needed to be touched. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, aching with longing.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call me?\u201d he asked, touching her with just one finger, so close, edging so close.</p><p>She arched up. \u201cPlease, Sir, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicely said, sweetheart,\u201d he murmured approval. And he slid the finger right into her.</p><p>\u201cAaah.\u201d The nerves inside her vagina flared to life with the intimate invasion.</p><p>He lowered his mouth to her clit, a touch like butterfly wings. She arched again, tightening around his finger, needing more than the light flicks on her clit. She was so close. The world narrowed to just the feel of his hands, his mouth. One more touch...</p><p>He pulled his finger out, emptying her, and lifted his head.</p><p>Nooo. She whimpered a protest.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have permission to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered shakily.</p><p>\u201cYou come when I say, not before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKari,\u201d he warned in a hard voice. \u201cI\u2019ve been patient, but my patience is at an end. Did you get taught about punishment in your class?\u201d</p><p>Not really. But the way he\u2019d sent Sally off to be punished... She didn\u2019t want anything like that to happen to her. Her thighs shook with her need. \u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice.\u201d He lowered his head, licked up her labia, sucking one into his mouth, then the other, the sensation like hot velvet. His tongue laved right there in the center. Oh God, almost. Not far enough, she needed more.</p><p>Then one finger opened her, sliding in ever so slowly and back out. She tightened around him, her legs quivering uncontrollably. In again, his finger large, pressing down to add friction, out.</p><p>Two fingers. She moaned at the added sensation as his fingers drove into her, faster, harder. Her whole pussy was afire, wanton hunger burning through her. She strained against the restraints as his mouth came down on her. His tongue slid over her clitoris and around it, swirling and rubbing as his fingers plunged in and out.</p><p>She panted, her bottom pushing off the bed, closer, closer. \u201cAh, ah\u2014\u201d</p><p>And he stopped, took his hands away. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d</p><p>Her groan came from deep within her, her entire lower half too tight. Throbbing with need. She\u2019d never felt so out of control. Never begged before. She hurt.</p><p>He licked the tender skin of her inner thigh, and she shuddered. His shoulders rubbed against her legs, and she trembled against the restraints.</p><p>She pulled at her wrists, wanting to touch him, to force him to touch her; she\u2019d even touch herself if she had to. Over her head, her hands closed into fists as the feeling of helplessness roused her further, making everything worse.</p><p>He slid a finger into her again, shooting urgency through her, her arousal higher and harder than before. She moaned, her head rolling from side to side. When her hips lifted, he ruthlessly pressed her back down, holding her for his use.</p><p>He pushed his finger in, pulled out, and added another finger. Her tissues were so swollen each thrust shoved her closer and closer. His tongue flicked across her clit, and she went rigid as her muscles tightened, as her vagina clenched around his fingers. She neared the peak, held there...</p><p>\u201cCome now, Kari,\u201d he ordered, his voice deep. Sucking her clitoris into his mouth, his tongue rubbed it hard and fast.</p><p>Her world flashed white, splintering around her, and she shattered with it. Spasms in her vagina rippled against the hard fingers impaling her, and her hips jerked uncontrollably. Her legs thrashed against the restraints, her arms pulled against the ropes, and the sensations went on and on.</p><p>When her climax started to slow, he\u2019d move his fingers, slide his tongue across her again, and she\u2019d arch back up as the exquisite tremors shuddered through her again. And again.</p><p>Finally, she lay limp, drenched in sweat, her heart pounding so hard her ribs must be bruised. \u201cMy God, no wonder people like being tied up,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>His hand slapped her thigh hard enough to sting.</p><p>She jumped. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you speak, little sub?\u201d He lifted his head, his stern eyes holding a warning.</p><p>She started to say something, thought better of it. \u201cSir. I\u2019m sorry, Sir. I thought we were done. Sir.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. Then he rose onto his knees, his big hands roved up her thighs, massaging the cramped muscles. He slid his hands up her stomach, and with a smile, cupped her breasts, squeezing just hard enough to make her breath hitch. His fingers lightly pinched her softening nipples back into attention.</p><p>\u201cKari, sweet, we\u2019re just getting started. In fact, I think you should come again before we move on.\u201d</p><p>No. Wait.</p><p>And he slid back down. With fingers and mouth and tongue\u2014and teeth this time\u2014he brought her to another orgasm. A screaming one.</p><p>Oh God, oh God, oh God. Her heart was thudding so fast it felt like a galloping horse, and her lungs labored to find enough air.</p><p>He moved back and unfastened her ankles. \u201cKari.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>He gently pushed the sweaty strands of hair off her face and then moved on top of her, holding his weight on his elbows. \u201cBring your legs up,\u201d he whispered before he took her mouth, plunging his tongue in.</p><p>She could taste herself, another shock in itself. Managed\u2014eventually\u2014to remember what he\u2019d said. Legs up. Her legs were free, and she slid them up to settle beside his hips. His penis slid in the wetness of her folds; each brush against the swollen, sensitive tissues sent tremors through her.</p><p>When his hand dropped down and pressed the head of his penis to her entrance, she moaned, shivered.</p><p>Without any more warning, he drove into her, all the way to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Impaled on him, she tried to jerk away. \u201cOooh...\u201d Her insides pulsed around his intrusion, and her arms futilely yanked at the restraints.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart, you feel good,\u201d Dan murmured, taking her mouth again for a kiss. So good she was liable to kill him dead as her pussy squeezed his cock like a hot, pulsing fist. She was tight, slick with her own juices.</p><p>From the tightening of her muscles, the slight cringing away, he was bigger than she was used to. He got a deplorable sense of satisfaction from knowing that.</p><p>He kissed her while he waited for her body to adjust, plunging his tongue into her mouth in slow strokes, imitating what he\u2019d be doing to her shortly. With one hand, he toyed with those sensitive nipples. The little whimpers she made could harden a dead man.</p><p>When he felt her hips start to move upward in response, he grinned and slid out\u2014in\u2014her moans as addictive to him as gin to an alcoholic. As he increased the speed, he released her wrists from the restraints. Her arms wrapped around him convulsively before her hands started stroking his back, adding to his pleasure.</p><p>He surged deeper, and her silken pussy contracted around him. With every hard thrust, his balls slapped against her soft buttocks, sending an inflaming vibration through him. He could feel her thigh muscles tremble as she awoke again to pleasure and moved right into true need.</p><p>What idiot could have possibly thought she was cold? Gripping her hips, he yanked her up against him with each stroke and then rubbed his pelvis down her clitoris as he withdrew. Her moans transformed into hard panting, and her fingers clenched his shoulders like miniature vises. Her little fingernails dug into his skin, arousing pinpricks of pain.</p><p>Faster, harder\u2014she was almost there. He could feel his cock swell as he kept himself from coming. Reaching down between them, he swirled his fingers in the wetness from her pussy, then stroked up and over her clit.</p><p>She broke with a scream, spasming around him so hard his own climax engulfed him. With a roaring growl of pleasure, he buried his length within her and let her milk him dry.</p><p>Kari was still shuddering from the shock waves of pleasure when Master Dan rolled them over and nestled her to his side, her head on his chest. She could hear his heart drumming under all that muscle. His arms kept her against him, and she\u2014she needed that right now, somehow.</p><p>He\u2019d tied her up.</p><p>And she\u2019d not only let him but had enjoyed everything he\u2019d done. What was happening to her?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking again, little sub,\u201d he murmured, kissing the top of her head. \u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d be doing a lot of thinking, she had a feeling. Instead of answering him, she ran her fingers over his rock-hard biceps. \u201cYou\u2019re so strong,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so soft,\u201d he whispered back. His fingers slid down her waist to squeeze and stroke her bottom.</p><p>\u201cI should be all muscular like you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou sound just like Z\u2019s sub. Listen, sweetling, and I\u2019ll tell you again. I know it\u2019s not politically correct, but I like my women soft.\u201d He pulled her closer. \u201cAnd curvy.\u201d He skimmed a hand over her waist and then teased her breast until she sighed with pleasure. \u201cAnd responsive. I love your body, little sub.\u201d He pressed a kiss to her fingers.</p><p>His women\u2014and she was one of them? The thought made her warm inside.</p><p>And he liked her the way she was\u2014God, how awesome was that\u2014someone who looked like him lusted after her body. Tilting her head, she watched him fondle her breasts, his lips curved in a smile, his eyes half-lidded.</p><p>She really did have nice breasts, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>And if he kept up his attentions, she was going to get all turned on again. How did he do that? She ran her fingers down his neck, tracing along his jaw.</p><p>Cupping one breast, he rubbed his thumb over the nipple. \u201cNow tell me\u201d\u2014his voice changed from lazy indulgence to a deeper, firmer timbre\u2014\u201chow did you feel when you were tied and opened for my pleasure?\u201d</p><p>Her hand stopped midstroke. Talk about it? He wanted to talk about...that? Men weren\u2019t supposed to be so verbal, were they?</p><p>\u201cShy, little sub? After all that I\u2019ve done to you? I\u2019ve had my fingers buried in your pussy, my mouth on your clit, my cock rammed inside you. If you can let me do that, surely you can talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Heat seared her cheeks, and he chuckled. \u201cDid being tied up scare you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, turned to hide her face in his shoulder.</p><p>He rose on one elbow. Grasping her shoulder, he pressed her flat, securing her even further with a leg across her hips. \u201cYou don\u2019t hide your feelings from yourself or from me. Tell me how you felt when you were tied up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVulnerable,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLike I couldn\u2019t help what you were going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it aroused you even more.\u201d His hand played with her breasts, circling the tightening nipples. \u201cKari? Did being so securely restrained arouse you? Did you like it?\u201d He pinched one nipple, a tiny flash of pain-pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked away from him, her face hot. \u201cYes, darn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir. I liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave girl.\u201d He kissed her gently, nibbling on her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to admit enjoying something so different from what our mamas said we should enjoy. Why they think everyone should be alike in making love when no one can even agree on what ice cream they like, I\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>He rose, disappearing into the tiny bathroom in the corner. When he returned, he brought back a warm washcloth. Standing beside the bed, he wiped the sweat from her face.</p><p>\u201cThank you. That feels good.\u201d It also felt strange to have this giant guy being so nurturing. Especially since his leathers were still open and displaying everything.</p><p>He put his knee on the bed and leaned forward. What was he...? He parted her thighs, stroking between them to clean her...there.</p><p>Blushing furiously, she tried to close her legs. \u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoy doing this sometimes.\u201d His knee settled on her ankle to keep her legs apart. He was very thorough. She was squirming and everything down there tingled before he was done.</p><p>As he walked into the bathroom, the leathers molded to him, showing every hard curve of his butt and thighs.</p> <p>She pushed herself up and sat on the side of the bed, her head whirling. How very different this was from anything she\u2019d done before. His control of her was what she\u2019d wanted, and so far past what she\u2019d expected that it scared her. Had she really begged? Screamed? Come over and over?</p><p>He returned with another warm washcloth and handed it to her. \u201cSince you feel left out, you can join in. Wash me, Kari.\u201d He stood in front of her, totally unselfconscious, totally gorgeous, his sex framed in the V of the opened front.</p><p>Wash him. She could do that. Would even enjoy doing that. Kneeling on the bed, she started with his testicles, so soft, so heavy in her hands. When done, she moved forward. His penis, even nonerect and wrinkly, was still huge. Thick. And under her fingers and the washcloth, it started to grow.</p><p>\u201cYour hands feel good on me, little sub,\u201d he said. He lifted her chin and gazed down into her eyes, and his voice changed, deepened and hardened, much like his penis was hardening in her hand. \u201cPut your mouth on me now.\u201d His master voice. \u201cWhat do you say to me?\u201d</p><p>He wanted her to\u2014well, okay\u2014she\u2019d done it before. In bed. In the dark. He\u2019d be able to see her. Watch her. Oh God.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the washcloth onto the floor and then took his penis into her hands. Even as she held it, it hardened, lengthened. Wow.</p><p>\u201cSee what just your hands can do to me?\u201d he murmured. \u201cMy body wants yours. My cock wants those sweet lips around it, your mouth sucking on it.\u201d</p><p>The thought was empowering. Exciting. Hauling in a breath, she licked up his erection like an ice-cream cone, letting her tongue trace the big veins running along the outside. The skin was all softness wrapped over an iron bar. She slid her lips over the velvety-soft head. He growled in pleasure when her tongue swirled around its edge, so she concentrated there for a while. Then she moved on, trying stuff, seeing what reactions she could get.</p><p>When she sucked all of him into her mouth, his breath stopped.</p><p>Her tongue up the underside of his penis made his stomach muscles jerk.</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cYou are very good at this, sweetie.</p><p>Pride surged through her. Sex. She could do it.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cTighten your lips just a little\u2014no teeth, please. Now, up and down, fast, and hard.\u201d</p><p>She did, and did it darned well, she knew, as his hand closed convulsively in her hair.</p><p>\u201cDamn, but you have a wonderful mouth.\u201d A minute later, he said, \u201cStop now.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him in surprise. He smiled down at her, traced her wet lips with his finger. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart, we\u2019ll finish later. For now, it\u2019s time to return downstairs. Master Z asked a few of the regulars in to demonstrate the equipment. Of course, compared to a normal bondage night, the scenes will be relatively mild.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cGo use the bathroom while I pick out your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Him pick out her clothing? No way. She\u2019d seen pictures of what people wore in fetish clubs. \u201cNo. I have clothes here, and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d At the sight of his darkening eyes, she stopped, closed her mouth. Too late. She\u2019d seen that look on his face with Sally, with herself.</p><p>\u201cLittle sub, you have exceeded my patience. Five swats.\u201d Gripping her wrists, he pulled her off the bed and took her place. He didn\u2019t release her. \u201cBend over my knees.\u201d</p><p>She tried to back away and got nowhere. \u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head frantically, her heart starting to hammer in her chest.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He lifted his brows in surprise. \u201cSeven swats.\u201d His mouth set in a straight line, and the humor and gentleness disappeared from his face.</p><p>\u201cSir, please. No. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can. Ten.\u201d</p><p>No. She didn\u2019t resist\u2014much\u2014as he positioned her beside his knees. His grip unyielding, he laid her across his lap until her top half dangled on one side, her legs on the other. Her head spun, and she gasped. This wasn\u2019t happening, couldn\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>\u201cFarther, little sub,\u201d he said and shifted her until her bottom stuck up in the air. One of his legs pinned hers, and his left hand pressed her shoulders down. Trying to squirm, she realized she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She felt his warm hand on her bare bottom, massaging, stroking. This wasn\u2019t a spanking, she thought, confusion running through her as her skin grew more sensitive to his touch. She felt the reawakening of desire.</p><p>And then he spanked her.</p><p>The first slap stung, and she jolted in disbelief. \u201cNo!\u201d She wiggled, trying to escape.</p><p>He held her in place easily. \u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>Another slap. The sound echoed in the room as she jerked, the burning on her bottom intense and painful. \u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>The third and fourth came almost together, hard and fast. Then slower, alternating cheeks. By eight, tears dripped from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTen. There, little sub, all done.\u201d He didn\u2019t release her as he stroked her stinging cheeks. His hand was cool against the heat, bringing pain\u2014and unexpected pleasure.</p><p>She lay limp, head hanging down, letting him pet her. Soothing her, she thought.</p><p>Slowly the strokes became longer. His hand cupped her cheeks, delving between her buttocks. One finger slid down into the crack, then farther, and animal hunger roused within her.</p><p>\u201cWa\u2014\u201d She clamped her mouth tight, her hands fisting in the carpet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re learning, little sub, you\u2019re learning.\u201d He sounded infuriatingly amused.</p><p>Then he slid her legs apart, opening her to his touch, and his fingers moved through her tender, sensitive folds, swirling over her clitoris. His fingers slid easily\u2014she was very wet\u2014awakening every nerve ending to a burning arousal.</p><p>She moaned. The stinging pain of her bottom somehow increased the need flaring in her.</p><p>As she squirmed under the onslaught, he chuckled and, pinning her hips with one hand, plunged two fingers inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d An unbearable storm of sensation exploded inside her, and she came hard, bucking uncontrollably against his thrusts.</p><p>Before she had recovered, he picked her up off his knees and turned her into his embrace, handling her as if she weighed nothing.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he murmured, his cheek pressed to her hair. He kissed her wet cheeks and took her mouth so gently and sweetly that she started crying again. Not speaking, he just held her, stroking her with the same hand that had spanked her and then given her an incredible orgasm.</p><p>Exhaustion claimed her. Her muscles went limp. He held her firmly against his chest, and there was a strange security in his powerful arms.</p><p>She finally pulled in a shuddering breath. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cLearn to think before you speak, little sub. Not every Dom is as easygoing as I am.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. Easygoing?</p><p>He chuckled and stroked her hair. \u201cOf course, some subs mouth off just to get punished. Amazing how much fun a good spanking can be, isn\u2019t it? I sure don\u2019t remember that being covered in my college classes.\u201d</p><p>A gulping laugh broke from her, and she took a breath as the world returned to normal. \u201cUm, Sir? What do you do for a living? You never said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did you.\u201d</p><p>Well, they were definitely better acquainted today. \u201cI\u2019m a biology teacher. High school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky kids. I\u2019m a cop. A detective, actually. Want to see my handcuffs?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head no and then rubbed her cheek over the springy hair on his chest. \u201cNo wonder you intimidated Buck so easily.\u201d</p><p>A growl rumbled through him. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky he got off so lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm-hmm?\u201d</p><p>His arms never loosened, she was still snuggled up against him, held so firmly she couldn\u2019t move. The fact she found that reassuring was a little frightening. \u201cWhen Buck grabbed me, you told him it was my choice whether to leave or not. But you didn\u2019t give me a choice now. You grabbed me...and spanked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He rubbed his chin on the top of her head. \u201cYour wannabe Dom lost his temper and tried to make you do something you didn\u2019t want. You didn\u2019t have a safe word arranged, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I could be mistaken, but on your first night, we talked about what you might enjoy. Did I mention spanking? Punishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, sweetie, what I heard was that you didn\u2019t say no.\u201d His fingers cupped her cheek, raised her face to look at him. His brown eyes seemed to bore right into her. \u201cI felt your body\u2019s response. First in the bar and again here. Was I mistaken?\u201d</p><p>Heat flooded her cheeks. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. He\u2019d barely touched her down below and she\u2019d climaxed. Hard.</p> <p>\u201cBrave girl.\u201d His voice was warm, lazy, as comforting as his hands stroking her shoulders. \u201cOne other thing. Did I lose my temper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He\u2019d been...displeased, definitely. But his voice and actions had been carefully controlled, she realized with surprise. Her lesson had been very deliberate. \u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He ran his fingers down her arm to her hand, massaged her palm. \u201cBeing under someone\u2019s control and punished... Some people find that very erotic, especially if you\u2019re already aroused.\u201d He lifted her hand, sucked on a finger, and the feeling of his mouth anywhere on her body made her womb clench. \u201cYou are one of those people who find it erotic, Kari. If you didn\u2019t, you\u2019d have used your safe word.\u201d</p><p>She stayed silent. Nothing in her life was ever going to be quite the same again, was it? What she\u2019d found out about herself these two evenings... She had some hard thinking to do. Soon.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer, he hugged her tightly, then set her on her feet. He steadied her as her knees wobbled. When his hands rubbed across her still-stinging bottom, she hissed.</p><p>He actually chuckled, the jerk. \u201cYou won\u2019t forget again, now will you? Because I could grow fond of seeing your pretty ass turn red under my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir, I won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d His eyes roamed over her body. From the heavy-lidded stare, the flush on his skin, and the thick wedge of flesh bulging under his leathers, she could tell he had enjoyed punishing her.</p><p>He moved a little closer. He was close, very close. His vest hung open, exposing a hard six-pack of abdominal muscles. \u201cI could easily... No, I better not. Use the bathroom and take a quick shower.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou need it now, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019ll pick out your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened, closed quickly, and she just nodded.</p><p>Pleased, he pressed a quick kiss to each breast, making her breath catch. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Dan listened to the shower as he opened the armoire door and surveyed his choices. Z kept a nice variety of fetish wear in each room. He eyed a French corset and then shook his head. She wasn\u2019t ready for that one\u2014not yet\u2014although those breasts would look sensational pushed up and overflowing. His cock twitched in agreement.</p><p>Maybe a maid\u2019s outfit? No. She was a modest woman, and he\u2019d pushed her hard. He could relent with the clothing. A bit.</p><p>He pulled a dress out, soft and clinging, with a halter top that tied behind the neck. Anything that tied was fun. And the midthigh length was long enough to give her a sense of security. He grinned. That wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>Perhaps he should keep her up here? But no. She\u2019d come to the Shadowlands for an introduction to the lifestyle, so she really should see some of the regulars play. Considering how she\u2019d reacted so far, it might be interesting.</p><p>She was so sweet.</p><p>He smiled, remembering her wide-eyed look when he told her to suck him, the tears on her cheeks after her spanking. Sweet. Innocent. Some men liked battling with sarcastic, angry subs. He wasn\u2019t one of them. Although he appreciated her courage and sparking temper, her modesty and nurturing nature drew him even more.</p><p>Her responses were so compelling, so honest, that he found himself wanting to wring more from her. But he needed to control himself to keep from pushing her too fast and far. She wouldn\u2019t stop with this visit. She might retreat after this, but her true nature was submissive. Now that she\u2019d discovered the depth of passion inside her, vanilla sex would be even more tasteless to her.</p><p>She stepped out of the shower, rosy pink from the heat, her shoulders a confection above the blue towel. Yum. Crossing the room, he bent his head to nibble the curve where her neck met her shoulder. He tilted her head back and kissed the softness of her neck. \u201cYou taste wonderful and smell divine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. She\u2019d obviously recovered her composure in the shower, and her little shivers were gone completely.</p><p>Back in control, was she? Hmmm.</p><p>\u201cI found something you\u2019ll like,\u201d he said, stripping the towel from her. \u201cIt slides right over your head.\u201d</p><p>Kari paused at the top of the stairs. The noise from the bar washed over her, bringing back a semblance of reality.</p><p>Why was she still here? She\u2019d achieved her goal, to see what this BDSM stuff was all about. Now she really wanted to think about what had happened, what she\u2019d done\u2014what he\u2019d done\u2014for a while. A long while. She needed to be away from here to do that.</p><p>Time to go home. Her body was satisfied. Oh yes, more satisfied than ever in her life.</p><p>She turned to look at Master Dan and caught her breath when the soft material of the dress rubbed against her tender nipples.</p><p>No bra. No panties. She would have horrified the nuns. Then again, considering the other clothing in the armoire, she should be grateful this dress covered her fully. She\u2019d seen a sheer lacy gown in there with the breasts and groin cut out. Good grief.</p><p>Yes, she appreciated this dress. This amount of indecency was enough for her. And Master Dan had refused to allow her underwear. She\u2019d never gone\u2014what did they call it?\u2014commando before, and the cold air touching her nether regions made her feel very naked down there.</p><p>A little excited too, but she\u2019d die before admitting that.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go home now,\u201d she said as he moved closer and tucked a firm arm around her waist.</p><p>He tilted his head and studied her silently. Unexpectedly, his fingers stroked across her breasts, and she sucked in a breath at the tingling, inside and out.</p><p>\u201cNo, little sub, your body isn\u2019t ready to leave yet.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cTake my hand.\u201d</p><p>It was an order, and her fingers were in his grip before she thought about saying no.</p><p>His eyes softened, and when he smiled approval, she had to smile back. He was right, darn him. The part of her that knew better, that followed the rules, wanted to leave. All the rest of her wanted to stay, to have his arm around her waist, to do what he ordered her to do.</p><p>He led her downstairs to the bar. Boy, things had livened up. Men and women nodded at him, greeted him by name. Not all of them, though. Where there were couples, only one would speak. The dominant one, whether man or woman. A few people were at the bar; others occupied the couches, occasionally with a man or woman at their feet. An older woman in an evening gown sat at a table with a male sub kneeling beside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She noticed the roped-off areas near the walls had been brightly lit, standing out in the shadowy room. She frowned and tugged him in the direction of one. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d At his narrowed gaze, she gulped. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood catch.\u201d And when he grinned, the flash of white in his tanned face was mesmerizing. \u201cYou have questions for me, Kari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk.\u201d</p><p>But her questions disappeared right out of her mind when the roped-off area came into sight.</p><p>A naked woman squirmed on the St. Andrew\u2019s cross.</p><p>Kari\u2019s mouth dropped open. Good God. In the class, Master Raoul had put a clothed man up there; this was so very different. She took a step back, came up against Master Dan\u2019s hard frame.</p><p>His arm came around her, his hand just under her breast. He whispered in her ear, \u201cImagine yourself up there, unable to cover yourself, open to every man\u2019s gaze, available to every man\u2019s touch.\u201d</p><p>She could...she could see herself, and the thought was terrifying. Erotic. Her pussy dampened, and he rumbled a laugh in her ear. \u201cYes, the thought excites you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>No way, no way would she let herself be put in that position. She shivered as he set his hand almost on her pubis, pressing her back against his erection.</p><p>\u201cI would like to see you there too. But not yet, my sweet.\u201d</p><p>Hand against her back, he moved through the room. They passed a naked woman on the spiderweb, and then a man on the bondage table. A hooded Domme in a red latex corset stood beside him, wielding a switch.</p><p>When they reached the back wall, Kari stopped again. Her hands closed convulsively on Sir\u2019s hard biceps.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they...she...?\u201d But she could see. A woman lay on her stomach across the sawhorse, her wrists cuffed to the front legs. Her bent knees were strapped to the short cushions on each side, and she showed...everything, even more than the woman on the wall frame.</p><p>A man stood behind her, his jeans open, fully erect. He thrust into the woman with one stroke, and she screamed in pleasure.</p><p>Master Dan had to pull Kari away, she was so outraged. \u201cSir, he just took her right there. In front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, lifted her chin, and looked her right in the eyes. \u201cCall me Master Dan or Master. I tire of being nameless. I want to hear my name and my title from your soft lips, little sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBu\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened, his mouth tight. He was really, really serious. Call him Master. To actually say that aloud felt like she\u2019d be giving him too much power over her.</p><p>He waited, fingers unyielding, his other hand clamped on her shoulder. People swirled past around them. A woman somewhere broke into a cry of rapture, a man shouted in pain.</p><p>She had let him tie her and take her, punish her. Her body recognized his title, even if she didn\u2019t want to admit it. \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Dan.\u201d As she feared, saying the words relinquished something inside her, some control she\u2019d still been holding on to.</p> <p>\u201cSweetly done, little Kari.\u201d He took her lips gently, lovingly even, his tongue rubbing against hers, slow and sensuous, until she was pressing up against him for more. His arms tightened around her. He was hard and ready, and she wanted him again. When she rubbed her breasts against his chest in invitation, he growled a laugh, and his hands reached under her skirt to massage her bottom.</p><p>The air on her butt hit her like a cold shower; she pushed away and opened her mouth to scold him. Shut her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNice save.\u201d He held her against her chest, stroking her hair. \u201cWhat should you see next?\u201d He glanced over at the other side of the room and shook his head. \u201cMmmph, not that.\u201d</p><p>She stood on tiptoe and still couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps next time.\u201d He stroked her cheek and smiled down into her eyes. \u201cThere will be a next time, will there not?\u201d</p><p>Oh my God. Come back? This was so much more intense than just that first lesson. And seeing the equipment in use... Just look at what might be done to her. \u201cUh\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows drew together. \u201cThe answer is, \u2018yes, Sir.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d He wanted her to come back. More. Oh God.</p><p>\u201cI think we both deserve a drink, don\u2019t you?\u201d he murmured and pulled her to the bar.</p><p>\u201cDaniel, how\u2019re things at the station?\u201d A white-haired man, his hands knotty with arthritis, nodded at Sir. \u201cDid I hear Bonner is retiring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnd of next year, he says.\u201d Sir shook the old man\u2019s hand with obvious care. \u201cMaster Gerald, this is Kari, here for the newbie classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you, Kari.\u201d Gerald wrapped an arm around the tiny woman standing next to him. \u201cThis is my wife, Martha.\u201d</p><p>Probably in her seventies, Martha wore a collar and cuffs that matched her bright pink bustier. Her long black skirt had pink studs along the waist and hem. She nodded at Kari, her aged eyes dancing with humor. \u201cMaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d the old man said.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the club, Kari. We enjoy seeing young faces.\u201d</p><p>Was she allowed to talk? Kari glanced up at Sir, received a nod. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKari, you\u2019re still here!\u201d</p><p>Kari turned to see Jessica break away from a group of people. \u201cMay I borrow your sub for a moment, Master Dan?\u201d she asked, taking Kari\u2019s hand.</p><p>Sir frowned, pointed to a spot about ten feet away. \u201cGo no farther than that.\u201d</p><p>Jessica dragged her over to the spot. \u201cHow on earth did you end up with Master Dan again? I heard what happened Monday when you left.\u201d</p><p>Gossip. Like cockroaches, it survived in any climate and apparently any kink. Kari grinned. \u201cHe decided he wanted another night. Go figure.\u201d</p><p>Jessica pulled at her lip and watched Sir talk to the old man for a moment before turning her gaze back to Kari. \u201cWell, that\u2019s interesting. Are you doing all right?\u201d</p><p>Kari sucked in a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s so different. I like it and I don\u2019t want to like it, and I feel like I\u2019m going straight to hell, you know?\u201d</p><p>Jessica laughed. \u201cI doubt we\u2019ll get a chance to chat tonight. Your last class is Saturday, right? Why don\u2019t you come early, and we\u2019ll have time to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d Jessica grinned and darted away, heading for the front of the room.</p><p>As Kari rejoined Sir, Cullen walked over, his grin breaking the hardness of his face. \u201cHow\u2019s your sub, Dan?\u201d</p><p>Master Dan stroked his hand down her cheek, his approval of her so obvious that she unconsciously leaned into his hand. Both men smiled. \u201cHow do you think?\u201d</p><p>Master Cullen studied her, his eyes lingering on her mouth, and she realized her lips were swollen from Master Dan\u2019s kisses, from sucking on his... She flushed hot.</p><p>\u201cShe looks nicely used.\u201d He set two drinks on the bar top, and Master Dan handed her one.</p><p>She sipped. Rum and Diet Coke.</p><p>\u201cMaster Cullen never forgets a drink.\u201d Sir\u2019s finger traced over her wet lips. When she closed her lips around his finger and sucked, he chuckled, though his eyes heated. \u201cHe rarely forgets a sub\u2019s reaction or needs; he\u2019s very popular.\u201d He tapped her drink. \u201cEnjoy it while you can.\u201d</p><p>That sounded ominous, and she edged away from him as she sipped. The strong drink gave her a slight buzz. No supper. Oops.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished about half, Master Dan smiled at her and pulled her a little closer. She realized his eyes weren\u2019t smiling... No, he had that look in his eyes, the one that made her quiver inside. \u201cI have decided your lessons are not over for the night.\u201d</p><p>She froze, then remembered to swallow.</p><p>\u201cYour body is mine for tonight. Is that what we agreed, little sub?\u201d He waited. \u201cKari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, M-Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI use your body as I please.\u201d He waited for her nod, then leaned forward and whispered, \u201cAnd give it where I please.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, but he already had her hands in his. \u201cOne of the reasons that subs wear cuffs in here is this\u2014\u201d He hooked the cuffs together, then pulled a chain down from the low rafter over the bar area. Lifting her arms up, he hooked the cuffs to the chain. And stepped back.</p><p>Her arms were fastened straight over her head. She yanked, couldn\u2019t move. Her breath came fast, and her heart pounded. \u201cMaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, very good.\u201d He smiled, nuzzled her face, his jaw abrasive with a day\u2019s whiskers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKari, a few minutes ago, you showed me that being looked at by strangers is arousing to you. Even being touched...\u201d He tugged on the strings holding her halter top up.</p><p>The top dropped, leaving her naked above the waist. In a roomful of people. Many\u2014heck, most\u2014of whom were men. Cool air wafted across her breasts, and she shivered.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMaster Dan. No. Please, no,\u201d she whispered frantically. She pulled again at the chain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only hurt your wrists,\u201d Master Dan murmured and bit her chin, the little nip almost painful. \u201cIf you damage those pretty wrists, I\u2019ll punish you.\u201d His hand reached under her skirt, right in front of everyone, and rubbed her naked bottom as a reminder. \u201cI think you should stop pulling.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stopped, hoping he\u2019d take his hand away, but he continued to play with her butt, sliding his finger into the crack, squeezing her sore cheeks. At his teasing touches, pain, then pleasure surged through her.</p><p>Her nipples tightened, attracting his attention. He moved his hands up to fondle them, pulling gently, pinching until the nipples stood erect. Embarrassment vied with growing arousal within her.</p><p>\u201cThere. I think you\u2019re ready for visitors, don\u2019t you?\u201d He turned her so she faced the room rather than the bar. Her legs shook, and the chains chimed softly over her head. He exchanged a look with the bartender.</p><p>\u201cI do enjoy that sound,\u201d the bartender commented. \u201cShe has gorgeous breasts; you must be pleased.\u201d</p><p>Master Dan nodded. \u201cI am. She\u2019s incredibly responsive.\u201d He rubbed his knuckles over one breast, and it tightened again to a hard, almost painful nub.</p><p>As Kari felt heat rush into her face, Master Cullen laughed. \u201cA beautiful reaction. Love the way she turns red.\u201d</p><p>After kissing the top of her head, Master Dan moved a couple of feet away to sit on a bar stool, leaving her standing by herself. When he turned his head to talk with a friend, she tried to shift around to face the bar.</p><p>\u201cStay where I put you, little sub.\u201d</p><p>She did. Even when a man walked right up to her. He wore black leathers with gold trim like Sir\u2019s\u2014another dungeon monitor. He glanced at Master Dan.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you, Sam.\u201d Sir nodded at him. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the beginners.\u201d</p><p>Despite his silvery gray hair, the man had muscles like a young man. He looked at her and his eyes were pale blue in a stern, leathery face. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but admire your tits. What\u2019s your name, girl?\u201d</p><p>If she didn\u2019t look at him, didn\u2019t answer, maybe he\u2019d go away. Instead he caught her chin just like Master Dan and leaned down. His eyes were piercing. Unforgiving. \u201cSubs answer questions put to them. What is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKari. Sir,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Without releasing her chin, he stroked one hand over a breast, squeezing it, pulling on the nipple hard enough that she had to catch her breath. She didn\u2019t know him at all, and he was playing with her. He could do anything to her right now, and he knew it. The thought was horrifying. Exciting. She felt herself moisten down below and pressed her thighs together. Oh God.</p><p>He\u2019d watched her face as he touched her, and now he smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s a good girl.\u201d Running a finger down her cheek, he walked away, leaving her confused. Needy.</p><p>Master Dan studied her, and his hard lips curved in a faint smile. His gaze softened, but when she looked at him in appeal, he shook his head. \u201cNot yet, Kari.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to his conversation. She closed her eyes, felt the trickle of her own arousal down her leg. This was so... She couldn\u2019t...</p><p>A hand grabbed her breast, and she gasped and opened her eyes. A man her age dressed in a black suit, the cruel-eyed beginner. His fingers twisted her breast.</p><p>Biting back a cry, Kari tried to pull back.</p><p>She heard a low growl, and Sir ripped the man away from her.</p><p>Hands fisted in the man\u2019s suit, Master Dan held him up in the air as if he were a child. Sir\u2019s face was furious. Terrifying. \u201cDid you ask permission to touch my sub?\u201d</p><p>Not waiting for an answer, he shook the man. Hard. The man\u2019s head bobbled as he gasped, \u201cSorry, sorry. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>With a snarl of disgust, Master Dan dropped him onto the floor. A DM ran up, and Sir scowled at him.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Dan. He got away from me while I dealt with another newbie.\u201d Grabbing the suited man by the scruff of his neck, the DM pulled him away. Quickly.</p><p>Kari didn\u2019t blame him. When Master Dan turned to her, she cringed at the look in his eyes, the threat in his pose.</p><p>He stopped. Taking a deep breath, he visibly relaxed his muscles. She could see the violence flow out of him. Suddenly he was back to the Master Dan she knew\u2014well, didn\u2019t know\u2014but at least he didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d tear people apart anymore.</p><p>Very gently, he unhooked her from the chain and wrapped his arms around her. She nestled there, feeling small, scared. Comforted. He simply held her, not moving, just letting her quiver in his arms.</p><p>When she stopped shaking, he ran his hands up and down her back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetie. Some beginners don\u2019t remember the rule that no one touches a sub without their Dom\u2019s permission.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face, his gaze intent. \u201cI should have been more careful with you. Can you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>The man took her breath away. Did he know how rare it was to hear an honest admission of fault and apology? \u201cI forgive you, Master.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a warm smile, but his eyes still held remorse. He felt horrible about what had happened, and that just seemed wrong. He\u2019d grabbed the man within a second. He shouldn\u2019t feel so bad.</p><p>She put her hand on his and wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cBut I forgive only if I get a kiss to make it all better, Sir.\u201d</p><p>The remorse lifted from his eyes like fog from a mountain. Mischief took its place, and he grinned.</p><p>She gave him a wary glance. He had an appalling habit of ignoring respectable behavior.</p><p>His hand traced across her breast. \u201cHe touched you here, I think.\u201d He bent to kiss the spot. His lips feathered against her skin. \u201cAnd here.\u201d He lifted the other breast for his lips to nuzzle.</p><p>Her nipples tightened into hard points as she started the slow glide back into need.</p><p>He touched her lower, cupping her mound. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to regret he didn\u2019t lay a hand elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Right there in front of everyone, he had his hands on her...her private parts. But even as she flushed and scowled at him, her pelvis tilted into his hand.</p><p>His brows lowered, his mouth flattened. \u201cDid you just frown at me?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>She froze. Oh no no no.</p><p>He waited, tilted his head.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master. I\u2019m sorry, Master. Very sorry, Master.\u201d</p><p>Amusement glittered in his eyes, even though his face remained stern. \u201cWell, now, I can\u2019t have a sub giving me frowns. My reputation will be ruined.\u201d His hands closed around her wrists, and a second later, he\u2019d hooked her cuffs to the overhead chains. Again.</p><p>She barely kept the scowl from reappearing on her face, and he could tell. The jerk.</p><p>He chuckled, then hauled her into his arms long enough to take her lips so thoroughly she sagged from the chains when he released her. \u201cAh, now that\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>He resumed his seat, but he didn\u2019t take his eyes off her this time. No one was going to sneak up again without him noticing. And somehow, that just wasn\u2019t helping her feel much better. People stared at her, much like she\u2019d looked at the woman on the cross. The men\u2019s eyes ranged down her body, lingering on her breasts.</p><p>She tried to keep her attention on Sir, watching as he talked quietly with the club members and other DMs. He discussed sports with one, advised another on disciplining a sub, argued politics. Everyone liked him, obviously, although he certainly wasn\u2019t as gregarious as Cullen or Raoul.</p><p>No one came over until... Her eyes widened.</p><p>The owner of the Shadowlands, Master Z, approached, strolling through the crowd like a lion walking through a forest of prey. Shoot, all the dungeon monitors moved like that, had that aura of power and self-confidence. And Master Z was coming here.</p><p>Her breath hitched. She was all but naked.</p><p>He stopped beside Master Dan. \u201cYou didn\u2019t break him into pieces, Daniel. I appreciate your restraint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCame close.\u201d Master Dan\u2019s frown was intense. \u201cMy fault. I should have been more aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. A lesson for all concerned.\u201d Master Z\u2019s gaze turned to Kari, and she felt a flush sweep all the way from her breasts to her face. He glanced at Master Dan.</p><p>Sir not only nodded, he actually grinned.</p><p>Master Z moved close enough she could feel his warmth, see the pleasure in his silvery eyes when he looked at her. \u201cYou are as lovely as I had thought, Kari.\u201d His smile made her feel warm, welcome. Beautiful.</p><p>\u201cAnd I see you have found favor with our Master Dan.\u201d He stroked a hand down her cheek. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know it, but he has been looking for a gentle heart, a caring spirit, one who needed his control to discover the full depth of her passion. You are well suited.\u201d</p><p>Her head spun as she tried to comprehend his words, but when he rubbed his knuckles over each breast in turn, studied the way they hardened, he derailed her thoughts completely. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the envy of the Doms, Dan,\u201d he said. With another smile for her, he strolled back into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cBloody matchmaker,\u201d the bartender said with a grin, refilling Master Dan\u2019s glass from a bottle of spring water.</p><p>Two lines appeared between Master Dan\u2019s brows, and his mouth tightened. \u201cHe\u2019s full of it and wasting his time to boot. I\u2019m not looking for any matches.\u201d His mouth thinned when he looked at Kari.</p><p>Kari felt cold creeping into her. Even though he was still right there, the man she\u2019d been with earlier had disappeared. She felt abandoned and very vulnerable with her hands chained over her head. She bit her lip and looked down, away, anywhere but at his cold eyes.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Something thumped on the bar, and then boots appeared in her line of sight. A hand lifted her chin, warm against her skin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetie. I might be annoyed with Z, but that has nothing to do with you.\u201d He kissed her gently, and tears burned her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve brought me only pleasure tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she whispered. He hadn\u2019t frowned at Master Z, only at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a cold bastard inside.\u201d He ran a finger down her cheek, his eyes crinkling at the corners when he smiled. \u201cAnd you\u2019re very warm. Yes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d His hand stroked down her body to circle her breast, lower still to cup her mound. With his other hand, he raised her skirt and touched her intimately, sliding his fingers through her wet folds. She gasped as pleasure surged through her. He kissed her neck, then bit her sharply. His finger pressed against her pussy, undoubtedly feeling it clench in reaction to the erotic thrill. \u201cDefinitely warm,\u201d he murmured, licking the bite. \u201cHot might be a better word.\u201d</p><p>She flushed. Although it was a heady feeling being called hot, she knew everyone could see where his hand lingered. To her relief and disappointment, he kissed her nose and settled himself back on the bar stool. \u201cI\u2019ll finish my drink and then let you down.\u201d He took a small sip\u2014way too small; they\u2019d be here all night\u2014and smiled at her.</p><p>She managed, barely, not to glare at him.</p><p>He lifted his eyebrows, lips quirking in amusement, then turned as another man in gold-trimmed leathers walked up. The mean-looking one she\u2019d seen with Raoul earlier. \u201cDan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNolan, I heard you were back. Welcome home,\u201d Master Dan said, shaking the man\u2019s hand. \u201cThe place wasn\u2019t the same without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be back in the States.\u201d The stranger tilted his head at Kari, and Sir nodded permission.</p><p>Nolan approached and looked down at her. Did all these dungeon monitor guys have to be so big? Black hair and black eyes as if he had Hispanic or Native American ancestry. His cold, hard gaze and the threatening set of his mouth made her want to flee. Involuntarily, she yanked on her restraints, tried to back up.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, just watched her futile struggles. Her breath kept getting faster.</p><p>\u201cDo you like being touched?\u201d His voice was low and harsh with a hint of a Texan accent.</p><p>Her hands clenched on the chains. She couldn\u2019t answer that, not out loud. She licked her lips, glanced sideways at Sir.</p><p>Master Dan\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cAnswer the question, Kari. Honestly.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes were so scary that she dropped her gaze to the floor. \u201cYes, Sir, I do,\u201d she whispered miserably. How could she want Master Dan\u2019s hands on her so badly and still be turned on by someone else\u2019s touch?</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d hate to disappoint such an honest sub,\u201d the man drawled. She looked up. His mouth curved slightly, amusement in his eyes. Maybe, maybe he wouldn\u2019t hurt her\u2014</p><p>He did worse. He tormented her, fondling her breasts with callused hands, circling around the edges of her nipples until the nubs burned with need. He finally relented and expertly squeezed each nipple to just the edge of pain and pleasure.</p><p>Her back arched, and she couldn\u2019t muffle a moan.</p><p>At that, the man actually smiled. He tapped her on the cheek with a scarred finger, slapped Master Dan on the shoulder, and walked away.</p><p>To her horror, Kari felt wetness running down her inner thighs, and she pressed her legs together.</p><p>Master Dan studied her. Nodded. \u201cLooks like we need to go upstairs again.\u201d</p><p>He released her hands with a quick twist, and she staggered against him. Her lower half actually ached with need.</p><p>But rather than walking toward the steps they\u2019d used before, he headed toward the back. Past the sawhorses.</p><p>A new woman was on one, her bottom poking up and out. Kari slowed, inhaled sharply. The woman\u2019s crotch had been completely shaved. Oh my.</p><p>Master Dan wrapped his arms around Kari from behind, held her in place when she would have hurried to get past. He set his chin on her shoulder, seeing everything she was seeing. \u201cShaving your pussy makes it more sensitive. To everything,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cAnd the spanking bench puts that little pussy where all of it can be reached. Touched. Played with.\u201d</p> <p>His hand dipped down, stroked her folds right through her dress, his fingers knowledgeable. Between his seductive words and his penetrating fingers, she couldn\u2019t control the tremor of arousal that ran through her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think you would like that position, little sub.\u201d</p><p>Her breath stopped entirely. No\u2014not in front of people.</p><p>Just then, a man walked up to the woman on the sawhorse. He pulled her cheeks apart farther, slid two well-lubricated fingers into her anus, in and out, and everyone in the area heard the woman\u2019s moan.</p><p>Kari\u2019s knees gave out, and Master Dan swooped her up with a laugh. \u201cUpstairs for you.\u201d</p><p>And without even breathing hard, he carried her upstairs and into a different room. Candlelight flickered over dark gray walls and black carpeting. No bed, only an armoire in the corner and a big easy chair in the other corner.</p><p>Still carrying her, Master Dan turned a little farther.</p><p>Kari stiffened in his arms. A sawhorse. Straps everywhere.</p><p>\u201cYou enjoyed looking; let\u2019s see if you enjoy riding.\u201d He put her on her feet and wrapped an arm around her, setting his big hand on her stomach to steady her. Grabbing her dress with one hand, he yanked it over her head, leaving her naked.</p><p>Her anxiety increased as his hot gaze slid down her body. \u201cSpread your legs, Kari.\u201d</p><p>Staring into his eyes, she eased her legs apart.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d When she complied, he anchored her in place with a firm hand on her bottom, then touched her intimately, sliding his fingers through her wetness, caressing her clitoris with long, slow strokes. She grabbed his arms, her fingers digging into his skin as he drove her higher and higher, until her anxiety disappeared under the surging need.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d he murmured. He turned her to face the sawhorse. Pressing her hips into the edge, he ordered in her ear, \u201cBend over.\u201d His erection pressed into her buttocks as she bent, and she shivered, wanting him inside, thrusting...</p><p>His chest hard against her back, he flattened her onto the bench. The cold leather chilled her bare stomach, shocking her back to reality. When he clipped her wrist cuffs to the rings on the front legs, she felt like a trapped animal. Panicking, she jerked at the restraints.</p><p>He closed his hands on her arms, holding her firmly. \u201cStop now, sweetie. Are you in pain? Use the safe word if you need to.\u201d</p><p>She panted, pulled at her wrists.</p><p>\u201cKari, answer me.\u201d</p><p>His words finally registered. Safe word. She could make him stop anytime. The reminder helped, and she hauled in a slower breath. \u201cI-I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d Releasing her arms, he eased back. His hands settled on her back, warm against her cold skin. Gently, he massaged her shoulders until she sighed and relaxed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better, little sub,\u201d he murmured and kissed her cheek. \u201cI like you a little anxious, but not scared.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d barely decided she wasn\u2019t too anxious. Then he set her knee on the attached padded bench and strapped it down. Then the other leg, securing her in an almost doggy position. With her knees set more forward, more of her showed.</p><p>When air slid like chilled fingers against her moist private places, she tried to move her legs. Nothing happened. Everything was on display, and she couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>As if he could read her mind, he said in a low, husky voice, \u201cNow you\u2019re open to me. Fully. To my eyes, my fingers, my lips.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, and yet the burn of arousal inside her heightened.</p><p>He was behind her, and she couldn\u2019t see what he was doing, no matter how she twisted. A door creaked open.</p><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cAre you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Kari. I\u2019ll never leave you alone if you\u2019re restrained.\u201d Something rustled, and she realized the creaking sound had been the armoire door.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if I can\u2019t get your mind off all these worries.\u201d He knelt behind her, his hands rough on her bottom, spreading her as his thumbs roamed up and down her labia. She squirmed, made a noise, and he laughed.</p><p>And set his mouth on her.</p><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d She jumped, her legs wrenching against the straps.</p><p>Rubbing her folds gently between his fingers, he exposed her clitoris completely. He swirled his tongue around it so hard and quickly, she cried out again.</p><p>\u201cYou feeling a little warmer?\u201d He inserted a finger, and her tissues were so swollen from his previous use, she could feel every inch going in. She clenched around him.</p><p>\u201cI like how my finger feels inside you,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut I know you\u2019ll enjoy something longer. This should fit about right.\u201d</p><p>She felt so vulnerable, unable to see or move, as he pushed something into her. Not his cock; this thing was cold. Her vagina spasmed around it, tried to push it out. He held it in place and then moved it slowly in and out. She was so wet, it glided easily.</p><p>All the way out, then back in, filling her fully until she moaned. But it wasn\u2019t enough, not quite. When he took it out, her legs quivered uncontrollably.</p><p>He chuckled, and then she felt his tongue lick up and over her clitoris, over and over. He lapped at her like a dog, his tongue flat. Her insides tightened; her clit hardened. Every little cell in her waited, waited for each excruciatingly arousing slide of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she moaned. \u201cPlease, Master.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if in response, she heard a click and a buzzing sound. When he touched the vibrator to her swollen labia, she gasped.</p><p>With a firm stroke, he slid it all the way into her vagina, and everything inside her burst into fiery pleasure. And then he pulled her clitoris into his mouth, rubbing it firmly with his tongue. With her legs strapped down, she couldn\u2019t move her hips, and the exquisite sensations grew even stronger, building into a fireball of ecstasy exploding out from her center. She screamed as the convulsions engulfed her.</p><p>When he wiggled the vibrator inside her, another climax rolled over her before the first was even done.</p><p>With a sensual hum of satisfaction, he removed the vibrator, making her vagina spasm again and her legs jerk.</p><p>He stepped away, and she heard the crinkle of foil as he sheathed himself. She tried to tip her head to see but couldn\u2019t. Her wrists and legs were still shackled. His hands on her bottom made her jump. Rubbing her buttocks, he murmured, \u201cStill a little pink from your punishment. Such a pretty ass. And your pussy is wet and pink and ready for me.\u201d</p><p>Before she realized what he intended, he thrust into her, thick and hard. She felt herself stretching inside as he speared all the way to her cervix.</p><p>She yelped, pulling against the straps, the cuffs. \u201cToo big, Master. Please...\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cCompliments from my sub?\u201d His shaft moved inside her. Painfully. He pressed one hard hand down on her bottom, holding her in place. \u201cDon\u2019t move, sweetling; your body will adjust.\u201d</p><p>Her whole lower half throbbed as if he\u2019d shoved all her insides over for his possession, filled her to bursting.</p><p>Ignoring her little whimpers, he leaned over, his chest hard and hot against her back as his hands cupped her dangling breasts. \u201cThey just fall into my hands like ripe fruit,\u201d he murmured, squeezing gently, and she shivered.</p><p>Strapped, impaled, flattened from his weight, and now her breasts pressed upward from his hard hands. Surrounded entirely. Something opened in her mind. As she surrendered completely to his will, brutal arousal shocked through her and every nerve in her body violently awakened. \u201cMaster.\u201d She panted. \u201cMaster, I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. Soon, little sub.\u201d His breath seared her shoulder as his rough fingers abraded her sensitive nipples. When he pinched the points between his fingers, jolts seared through her until she squirmed uncontrollably, trying to rub her clit against the table. More, please, more. She rolled her forehead on the leather.</p><p>Murmuring something against her back, he bit the nape of her neck, holding it between his teeth, sending chills down her arms.</p><p>And then he finally, finally started to move, sliding his cock out of her so gradually, it seemed to take forever, then back in, an excruciatingly slow, circular motion. Her hands fisted on the straps as her body shook with unfulfilled need. Moaning, wanting more, faster, harder. She wiggled uncontrollably.</p><p>He pressed an unyielding hand against her butt, holding her in place and eliminating even the tiny movements she could make. \u201cLittle sub, you\u2019re so tight and slick, you\u2019re threatening my control.\u201d</p><p>His speed increased slowly, too slowly, and she tried to raise her butt, but she couldn\u2019t do anything. Whatever he wanted to do to her, she had to take it.</p><p>The thought sent her over, and she came with a fast rush, writhing against the leather of the sawhorse.</p><p>His hand stroked down her back as he straightened a little. \u201cNo, that was an inadequate climax, sweetie,\u201d he said, massaging her buttocks.</p><p>He wanted more from her. She wasn\u2019t sure whether to cheer or cry.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll give me a better one,\u201d he said with certainty. Then he pressed his hips against her, thrusting deeply, and she moaned, his size no longer painful, just incredibly pleasurable.</p><p>With a low laugh, he pulled out, then rammed into her and continued, withdrawing, then burying himself. Hard, fast. His balls slapped against her swollen labia. His thickness inside her was thrilling. Sensation built on sensation until her vagina tightened around him.</p><p>He shifted slightly, and suddenly his fingers were on her, sliding in her wetness all over her oversensitized clitoris. The overload was too much and everything contracted and convulsed inside her, and she was coming so violently that she screamed over and over.</p><p>With a final thrust so hard that he actually moved the sawhorse, he came too, and the hot jerks of his penis spasmed against her insides again and again until only twitches remained.</p> <p>He rested against her, his breathing controlled and hard. She could feel his heart pounding against her back.</p><p>\u201cNow that was a worthy climax,\u201d he said, his voice even deeper than normal. He kissed her shoulders, her neck, before pulling back.</p><p>As he withdrew, sliding out of her acutely sensitive tissues, she shuddered. After disappearing into the bathroom briefly, he undid her restraints, then removed her wrist cuffs. With careful hands, he helped her dismount and held her up when her legs wouldn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cThere now,\u201d he murmured in his rough voice. A soothing voice. Why did she feel so...so vulnerable now, like she\u2019d break into tears any minute?</p><p>Cupping her chin with his hand, he tilted her face up. She blinked frantically against the burning in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAh, baby.\u201d He picked her up, cradling her like a child, and oh, she needed that so badly. Cuddling her close, he sat down in the chair with her pressed against his chest.</p><p>She let her head drop onto his shoulder. Heard her breath hitch as she tried not to cry.</p><p>Holding her firmly, he rocked the chair and talked to her, his voice a low, soothing murmur, filling the empty spaces that had opened inside her. \u201cYou are a beautiful woman, Kari... I love that soft, rosy body of yours... You have such a gentle spirit... I am grateful that you trusted me enough to give in to what was inside you. All that passion, sweetheart, you shared with me... Do you know how beautiful you are when you show me your need and when you come without hiding anything?\u201d</p><p>Not asking her for any response, he just continued talking, telling her of his pleasure, his pride in her, until the horrible feeling of vulnerability dissipated and she felt like she was herself again.</p><p>When she sighed, his arms tightened around her, and he kissed the top of her head. They rocked quietly for a few minutes, the silence warm. She\u2019d never felt so close to anyone in her life.</p><p>Eventually her brain turned back on with an almost audible click.</p><p>Her brain wasn\u2019t happy.</p><p>She felt...funny. Like too much had happened, like the world wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d thought. She wasn\u2019t who she thought.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said quietly, cupping her face. He kissed her temple, ruffling the tiny hairs with his breath. He snuggled her closer, his body warm where she was starting to feel cold. \u201cKari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a teacher. I\u2019m educated and smart. People don\u2019t boss me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that. Being smart, educated, even having authority at work has nothing to do with what you like to do in private or in bed, sweetheart.\u201d He stroked her cheek, tucked her hair out of her sweat-streaked face. Wiped the tears running down her cheeks. She was crying?</p><p>\u201cIn your case, I figure you have three reasons that vanilla sex doesn\u2019t work for you. First, you really are submissive, for whatever reason. Some think it\u2019s just part of a person\u2019s personality, like being an introvert or extrovert. Others say it\u2019s upbringing. Doesn\u2019t really matter. You are what you are; you need what you need.\u201d</p><p>His words hit her almost like a sentence of doom: You\u2019re submissive. There\u2019s no escape. Live with it.</p><p>\u201cSecond, you, little nun, have guilt added into the mix. Your father\u2019s lectures, your religion disapproving of anything carnal\u2014all inside you.\u201d He put his big hand between her breasts. \u201cRight there.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on top of his, could almost feel the big lump of judgments, criticism, scorn right under her ribs.</p><p>\u201cAnd third, since you\u2019re an intelligent woman, your body wants to enjoy sex, but your brain never stops working and worrying.\u201d He rubbed her shoulder, stroked down her arm to take her hand. His fingers rubbed her knuckles. \u201cIs that true, Kari?\u201d</p><p>So true it was frightening. She could never stop thinking about what she should do, what he could do better, how hot the room was, what music was playing...</p><p>His dark brown eyes studied her face. When she sighed, he nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for an educated woman to turn her head off. That\u2019s part of the joy of being a submissive. None of the decisions are yours. When you can\u2019t refuse anything and can\u2019t even move, those voices in your head go silent. All you can do, and all you are permitted to do, is feel. And you felt everything, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but he didn\u2019t need her answer. He\u2019d known every little twitch she gave. She rubbed her cheek on his chest gratefully. Understanding why she\u2019d reacted so strongly helped a little. A little.</p><p>She listened to the slow beat of his heart. Surrounded by his arms, his scent, her body relaxed into him. Something about his strength, his understanding, his concentrated focus on her and her needs, was almost too overwhelming. Refusing to think further, she burrowed closer and let herself float away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sometime later, a chime sounded. Master Dan shook her gently. \u201cIt\u2019s midnight, Cinderella, and the dance is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She blinked at him.</p><p>He helped her to her feet. Her legs shook. She looked up at him, feeling lost. His eyes softened, and he hugged her, kissing her deeply. Gently.</p><p>\u201cI wish we had more time,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut the DMs will be around soon to drag slowpokes out.\u201d He kissed her again, this time with his hand curled around the nape of her neck, holding her in place. \u201cI\u2019m going to go find your clothes. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>By the time she\u2019d used the bathroom to freshen up, he had returned. After she dressed, he escorted her down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dan!\u201d Standing by the front door, a familiar-looking woman in a black bustier and leggings waved them over. Kari recognized the DM from Monday.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d Master Dan said.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you using the private rooms again.\u201d Olivia gave Kari a disconcertingly slow and appreciative look before she turned back to Dan. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested, I\u2019m throwing a dungeon party Sunday afternoon. Bring your pretty sub and come play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d Sir started.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say no. It\u2019s been far too long since you partied with us,\u201d the DM said. \u201cWe miss you.\u201d</p><p>Kari looked up. Surprise and what looked like guilt flickered in Master Dan\u2019s eyes. His muscular arm went rigid, then dropped away from her waist.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make it. Sorry.\u201d His voice sounded as if the life had drained out of it.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I\u2019m sorry too.\u201d Olivia patted Sir\u2019s arm gently and moved away.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Master Dan said to Kari.</p><p>As she stepped out into the night, the humid air blanketed her, the scent of tropical flowers and swamp almost overpowering. The loss of Sir\u2019s touch created an ache inside her as he silently walked beside her to the tree-lined parking lot. Others were leaving also, faceless figures in the shadows and moonlight. Cars moved down the drive in a slow string of lights.</p><p>Taking her keys, he unlocked her car and opened the door. She looked up, hoping for a kiss, a hug...something...but his gaze was as remote as the distant moon.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the evening, Kari.\u201d His fingertips brushed her cheek, featherlight.</p><p>Her lips tightened. No more sweetheart from him. The ache increased, and she tightened her lips against a betraying quiver. He had only promised an evening. The evening was over, and she never caused scenes. All those etiquette lessons from the nuns hadn\u2019t gone to waste. She slid into the car, then forced a smile and a cool tone, \u201cThank you for the lesson, Master Dan. I do appreciate the time you\u2019ve spent with me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were distant, but sadness lingered in the lines of his face. \u201cDrive carefully.\u201d He put her keys into her hand and closed the door softly.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Dan\u2019s chest ached like he\u2019d cracked all his ribs. He rubbed his sternum as he walked back to the Shadowlands. Why Olivia\u2019s invitation had hit him so hard, he didn\u2019t know; after all, he\u2019d been fending off well-meaning friends for three years now.</p><p>Fending off subs too. He remembered Kari\u2019s expression a minute ago, how her big eyes had filled with confusion, then hurt. His mouth tightened, and the frozen feeling inside him increased. Being with her a second time had been a mistake. For both of them. It wouldn\u2019t happen again.</p><p>Not bothering to knock, Dan walked into Z\u2019s office. \u201cGot a minute?\u201d</p> <p>Z set down the paper he\u2019d been reading. \u201cDaniel. Did you have a good evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Dan raised his hand to run it through his hair, stopped halfway, and lowered his arm. Subs weren\u2019t the only people who Z could read like a grade-school primer. \u201cJust wanted to give you a heads-up. I won\u2019t be able to make the dinner on Friday or be here on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The terse answer with no explanation was rude, but he had no damned explanation. Just that he needed to not be here for a while.</p><p>Z studied him for a minute before asking, \u201cWas little Kari a disappointment to you?\u201d</p><p>Damned mind-reading psychologist could be like a cat with a cornered mouse. \u201cShe\u2019ll make someone a wonderful sub, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m not in the market for one, though, and you fucking well know it.\u201d He winced at the raw sound of his own voice.</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d Z said mildly. \u201cWell, then. I\u2019ll tell Jessica about Friday. We\u2019ll miss you on Saturday, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Mouth set tight, Daniel headed out, resisting the urge to slam the door behind him.</p><p>Outside, he scowled up at the moon, remembering how Kari\u2019s pale skin had glowed in its light. He shook his head. Real fucking romantic. He pulled his keys out, headed for his truck. No traffic, he\u2019d be home soon enough.</p><p>Home. He sighed, rubbed his face. The thought of his cold, empty apartment made his guts twist. Fine then. He\u2019d hit the station instead, put in some time on his unsolved cases stack.</p><p>Early Thursday morning, Kari wandered through her quiet neighborhood, a basket of warm muffins over her arm. Around five in the morning, she\u2019d finally given up on any sleep and put the time to good use.</p><p>Tail waving in the air, her German shepherd, Prince, trotted in front of her, guarding her from evil field mice, stray cats, and other dogs. Especially the aggressive poodle that lived three houses down. A cool breeze brushed against her skin and sent droplets from last night\u2019s rain pattering off the leaves onto the pavement.</p><p>After getting home last night, she\u2019d sat out on the patio, trying to come to terms with Master Dan\u2019s behavior. She\u2019d felt so close to him, and he\u2019d acted like he\u2019d felt the same, and then he\u2019d just shut down. But he\u2019d warned her, after all, said he didn\u2019t have anything to give. She shook her head. He\u2019d given her more than any man before, but apparently she wasn\u2019t enough for him, not compared to his dead wife.</p><p>Kari stopped, closed her eyes at the despondency the thought created. But she couldn\u2019t see a way to fight a dead wife\u2019s memory. She opened her eyes and took a deep breath of the clean air. Life was what it was; she\u2019d just have to move on and cherish the wonderful things she\u2019d learned from him.</p><p>She walked up to the Jernigans\u2019 porch and left the basket of blueberry muffins on the table beside the mail slot, knowing Mr. Jernigan would find it when he went to get the newspaper. His elderly wife had been discharged from the hospital yesterday, and everyone knew Mr. Jernigan could burn canned soup.</p><p>Back on the sidewalk, Kari trailed after Prince, who knew the route as well as she did. Her sneakers slapped against the pavement, reminding her of the sound of flesh against flesh...of Master Dan plunging into her. Lordy. She shook her head, trying to forget that image before she got all heated up again. Impossible task. Too many parts of her ached: her pussy; her swollen mouth; her breasts, almost too sensitive to tolerate her softest bra; her wrists, sore despite the lined cuffs he\u2019d used. She had scrapes on her legs from the straps and a bite mark on her stomach.</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d been used and used well. She tried to frown, but her arms wrapped around herself in a do-it-yourself hug, and she laughed instead. Hadn\u2019t it just been great?</p><p>She danced two steps, then stopped to push little Annie\u2019s skates and tricycle off the sidewalk into the grass. Some of those joggers just didn\u2019t watch where they were going even in the daylight, let alone at night.</p><p>At night...last night, she\u2019d been so aroused that she\u2019d screamed...actually screamed when she came. So many times too. That was just... Wow.</p><p>From across the street, a bird warbled a spring song and received an answer from Debra\u2019s yard. For the birds, it was nesting season; for her, it was a time to reexamine her life. She wasn\u2019t some frigid, passionless person after all; she just needed something more than other people. Something different. Exotic\u2014she\u2019d call it that, since kinky didn\u2019t sound very respectable.</p><p>Seeing Mrs. Jones hadn\u2019t retrieved her newspaper, Kari left it on the cushioned chair next to the front door. The frail woman pushed her walker as incompetently as she drove her old Suburban. An accident waiting to happen.</p><p>Prince waited for her on the sidewalk and gave her his humans-are-so-slow look before continuing on. Didn\u2019t he realize she had thinking to do?</p><p>Last night, Master Dan had changed something in her. Her inability to control what happened and his sure knowledge of how far to push her had broken through some barrier she hadn\u2019t known was there. She felt like a beginner\u2019s chemistry experiment. Add a little sodium bicarb to vinegar and suddenly she bubbled and fizzed with the best of them. Wasn\u2019t that just awesome?</p><p>Prince trotted back. She stopped to pet him and frowned at the ugly gray sleeve of her sweatshirt. As a new fizzy person, she really should shine up her test tube. She looked down at herself and her baggy gray sweats, then thought about the ankle-length dress lying on the bed for school. Pretty pathetic. Maybe if she didn\u2019t dress like an escapee from a nunnery, she would stop thinking of herself that way. Time to go shopping.</p><p>On Friday evening, Kari picked up the ringing phone. \u201cHello.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKari, this is Buck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um. Hi.\u201d She sighed. There must be people who enjoyed going out on Friday evenings, but all she wanted to do was curl up in jammies, eat popcorn, and enjoy a mindless movie. After a week of attempting to teach teenagers, the last thing she wanted was to have a conversation, especially an awkward one. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never had that talk you promised,\u201d he said. \u201cHow about I come over? We can discuss what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that won\u2019t work, Buck. I\u2019m beat.\u201d All right, the polite thing would be to say she was sorry, but she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>A pause. \u201cAre you still mad at me for Monday? I said I was sorry.\u201d</p><p>Apparently the discussion would be now. She sat down at the kitchen table and tried to prepare herself. \u201cI\u2019m not mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good. Then I\u2019ll pick you up for the last class tomorrow around eight.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she needed to learn to be less polite. Submissive to one man didn\u2019t mean that everyone else could walk all over her. \u201cNo. Um. I like you, Buck, but I don\u2019t want to date anymore.\u201d There. That was plenty blunt. She immediately felt guilty.</p><p>\u201cAre you dating that Dom from the club? Is that why you don\u2019t want to see me anymore?\u201d His voice held a thread of bitterness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s not your business,\u201d she said, striving for the gentle-but-firm tone she used with nosy students who wanted to know about her personal life.</p><p>\u201cKari, that guy\u2019s not good for you. I can tell,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way he\u2019s got you behaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your concern, but it really is my business.\u201d There had to be a way to get off the phone. Lie. \u201cSorry, Buck, but I\u2019ve got another call coming in. I have to go. Bye.\u201d</p><p>She punched the End button. Hopefully, he\u2019d never remember that she didn\u2019t have call waiting. Bad, bad Kari.</p><p>Saturday evening, Kari set the phone down with a loud sigh. Darn it. No\u2014damn it! The auto mechanic had been very apologetic, but the part for her car wouldn\u2019t be in until Monday morning. No car till then.</p><p>She dropped onto her comfy floral couch and leaned her head back. It wasn\u2019t a total disaster. Carol could take her to school on Monday, and she didn\u2019t have any place she needed to be this weekend.</p><p>Except the Shadowlands.</p><p>\u201cWell, Prince, looks like it\u2019s you and me tonight.\u201d</p><p>Setting his head on her knees, the shepherd looked up at her with big brown eyes, perfectly content to have her at home. She stroked his soft ears and sighed. She\u2019d been off and on about returning to the Shadowlands, but now that she couldn\u2019t go, she felt a definite letdown. No BDSM stuff. No Master Dan.</p><p>Rising, she paced across her living room. She looked at her wrists, remembering the weight of the cuffs and the erotic feeling of helplessness when Sir had strapped her onto that sawhorse thing. How he\u2019d pinned her hips down as he thrust into her, so big and hard... She shivered as her body roused, craving that sensation again. All those sensations.</p><p>Still, she needed to be practical. Over the past couple of days, reality had slowly crept back. Although bondage might be interesting, it wasn\u2019t exactly something a person did forever...was it?</p><p>She reached the end of the room and turned. How long could a person indulge in...exotic sex? Hmm. When Jessica had talked about Master Dan being a member of the club, she\u2019d said years. And that older couple, Martha and Gerald, had been together for twenty years. They looked perfectly content. Not depraved or anything. So, people could do it for years.</p><p>Would she want to? Heat ran through her at the thought. What would it be like to be actively interested in sex instead of putting up with it? What if, after an evening of reading or watching TV, her man ordered her to strip and bend over the arm of the couch for his use? Would that change her life? The instant dampness of her pussy gave her the answer.</p><p>Master Dan said she was wired to need domination for true satisfaction. A sexual submissive. She wrinkled her nose. That submissive word still sounded awfully distasteful. But facts were facts. She\u2019d gone to the Shadowlands to test the hypothesis that bondage and domination aroused her. Her experiment, although not done to anything resembling scientific standards, had proven exactly that.</p> <p>Knowledge gained, new problems discovered. Did she want to pursue this further?</p><p>She snorted. Darned right. Not that she could do anything about it tonight.</p><p>Ruffling Prince\u2019s fur on the way past, she kept pacing. Couldn\u2019t do anything about Master Dan either, now could she? Her introduction to the lifestyle might have been completely different if she\u2019d had a different instructor. Sir was...something. All those muscles to run her hands over, the firmness of his grip on her body, the assured authority. His deep, rough voice. Just thinking of him made her burn.</p><p>Would he wonder why she wasn\u2019t there tonight? Would he miss her? She shook her head and sighed. Doubtful. With all those subs around, he didn\u2019t lack for female attention. Yeah, he wouldn\u2019t give her a second thought when she didn\u2019t show. Even if she had been able to attend the last class tonight, he\u2019d made it clear their time together was over. The jerk.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want anything permanent; he wanted his dead wife. So it was just as well that her car was hospitalized. Really.</p><p>Darn it.</p><p>Look on the bright side. By staying home, she wouldn\u2019t run into Buck.</p><p>Prince whined, reminding her of her petting duties, and she slipped to the floor to hug him. \u201cBuck won\u2019t be coming back here again.\u201d Prince hadn\u2019t liked Buck at all. \u201cI should have listened to you about him, huh?\u201d</p><p>In total agreement, Prince licked her face and leaned against her, leaving hair all over her new red tank top and jeans.</p><p>She planted a kiss on top of his furry head. \u201cSo did you notice? I\u2019ve got cleavage. And my legs are pretty good too, for that matter.\u201d Instead of trying to hide her body, she was finding ways to showcase it and enjoy it. Yesterday, the other teachers had been surprised, then effusive with compliments over her new look. Thank you, Master.</p><p>\u201cWell, buddy, let me get you some supper and\u2014\u201d Kari stopped. Oh, heck, how could she have forgotten? Jessica expected her to show up early so they could chat. Sir might not miss her, but Jessica would. Kari grabbed the phone again and carried it to her desk. Pulling out a copy of the Shadowlands forms, she found the phone number. Would someone be in the office now?</p><p>\u201cShadowlands.\u201d A man\u2019s voice. Low. Familiar. One of the DMs?</p><p>\u201cUm. This is Kari Wagner. I was supposed to meet Jessica there tonight. Is there any way I can get a message to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is here, Kari. Allow me to call her to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need. Can you just tell her that I won\u2019t be able to make it?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cIs there a problem, little one? Can I help?\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. This was no DM; it was Master Z. \u201cNo. No, really. My car\u2019s in the shop, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is your lack of transportation good...or bad?\u201d</p><p>The insightful question silenced her. \u201cI...\u201d She sighed. \u201cA little of both, I guess. It\u2019s all so different, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKari.\u201d His deep voice sharpened. \u201cDid you have a problem with Master Dan?\u201d</p><p>Just hearing Sir\u2019s name sent blood surging into her face and elsewhere. \u201cNo,\u201d she managed to say, her words husky. \u201cNo, he was\u2014\u201d Wonderful. Scary. Intimidating. Too much for an inexperienced schoolteacher. \u201cHe was fine.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle. \u201cI am happy to hear it. I\u2019ll give Jessica your message, that you\u2019ll be enjoying a quiet evening at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Kari said glumly and clicked the phone off. Just hearing a Dom\u2019s voice with that edge of command brought back all the reasons she wanted to continue. She yearned to hear Sir tell her what to do, to feel his hands holding her, to struggle and get nowhere.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t for her.</p><p>She shook her head. Get over it. She\u2019d done what she\u2019d set out to do, seen what it was all about. Returning to the Shadowlands would just give her pain, at least until Master Dan had lost some of his appeal. After that, she\u2019d go back and meet someone else.</p><p>Until then, maybe she should return to her normal life and normal men. The thought was as appealing as planning to eat oatmeal for three meals a day. Forever. Darn it.</p><p>Dan drove out of the police station parking garage and turned toward home without any sense of pleasure. His body sagged against the car seat, his mind equally tired. Three hours waiting to be called as a witness, and then the perp settled, a new form to fill out for snitch money. Dan\u2019s partner wanted to go on vacation for a month, and who the hell would he end up with then? Some kid fresh from patrol?</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he chosen to be an accountant? A quiet office and numbers. No blood, no violence. Far fewer lies. The paperwork would still suck.</p><p>His cell phone rang, and he pulled off to one side of the freeway. Flipping the phone open, he glanced at the number displayed. The Shadowlands.</p><p>\u201cZ? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Z, Dan. This is Jessica.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. Z\u2019s sub? \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell. You know the beginner you were with this week? Kari?\u201d</p><p>Knife-edged fear tightened his hand on the phone. \u201cWhat happened? Is she all right?\u201d</p><p>A huff of laughter. \u201cCops. You always imagine the worst. She\u2019s fine. But her car isn\u2019t. It\u2019s in the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called for a ride?\u201d That didn\u2019t seem like the little sub. Unlike most women, she didn\u2019t beg for release until he tormented her to the point where her brain shut off. Very doubtful that she asked for help often, at least for herself.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you idiot. She called to say she wouldn\u2019t be coming. We were planning to meet early, and she wanted me to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good she called then.\u201d Maybe he\u2019d go tonight then, since she wouldn\u2019t be there to mess with his emotions, to lure him into taking more, giving more than he wanted.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d A pause. \u201cRight. It\u2019s good. Sorry to have bothered you.\u201d</p><p>Dan frowned. Had Z\u2019s little sub just said \u201cstupid asshole\u201d under her breath?</p><p>After pulling back into the heavy traffic, he flipped on the radio, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel to Emmylou Harris. The air off the gulf was briny and warm, the sun setting in a clear blue sky. He\u2019d have time for a shower, maybe a fast bite, before leaving for the club.</p> <p>She wouldn\u2019t be there tonight.</p><p>Dan turned the music up louder, ignored the bastard who cut in front of him to make an exit. Tampa drivers terrified the nation: macho Cubans mixing it up with aggressive East Coast drivers tailgating retired snowbirds going twenty miles below the speed limit. Driving was probably the most dangerous part of his job as a cop.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be on the road; she didn\u2019t have a car. She wouldn\u2019t be there tonight.</p><p>Good. Very good. He didn\u2019t need to see her again. Didn\u2019t need any more reminders of her little whimpers right before coming, or the way her hot, soft mouth closed over him, or how her pussy would tighten around him, or\u2014</p><p>He slowed to let a bus onto the freeway, breathed in the diesel fumes. Busload of kids, probably some sporting event at the school.</p><p>She was a teacher. She\u2019d be a wonderful teacher. He remembered how she\u2019d tried to ease his mind about his carelessness: \u201cI forgive only if I get a kiss to make it all better, Sir.\u201d The tender look in her eyes when she kissed him that first night. And\u2014</p> <p>Fuck. She just wouldn\u2019t stay out of his head. He pulled off the freeway, flipped open the phone, and punched in the number.</p><p>\u201cShadowlands.\u201d Z\u2019s voice. Good thing it wasn\u2019t Jessica.</p><p>\u201cGive me her damn address, you sadistic bastard.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Number thirty-three. Dan pulled into the driveway.</p><p>The twilight showed a two-story house, sky blue with sparkling white trim. Bright red and white flowers bloomed along the fence with more in pots on the wide porch. Stepping up to the front door, he rang the doorbell.</p><p>When light footsteps sounded from inside, Dan berated himself again. He should stay away from her; she deserved better than what he could give. Dammit, he didn\u2019t want anything more from a woman than some mutual satisfaction. Definitely no emotional involvement.</p><p>Yet something about her pulled at him. He should never have taken her under command, and he damned well shouldn\u2019t be here today. Fuck, he was an idiot.</p> <p>Hell, she might not even want to see him. He\u2019d behaved like a real asshole on Wednesday. For the second time. What if she didn\u2019t want to return to the Shadowlands? Or be with him?</p><p>He set a hand against the door frame. Only one way to find out. Any Dom worth his leathers could read a sub\u2019s face. He\u2019d soon know if the no-car reason she\u2019d given Z was an excuse.</p><p>The door opened, and he had his answer in the big blue eyes.</p><p>Surprise, delight, wonder, delight, worry. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He ran a finger down her cheek, unable to keep from touching her. \u201cJessica said you needed a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... You\u2019re here to take me to the club? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go?\u201d He watched her face, her open expressions. She was honest, inside and out. Did she know how rare that was? After years on the force, he\u2019d grown cynical, begun to believe everyone lied. But not this little sub.</p><p>\u201cYes. Mostly.\u201d A wrinkle appeared between her brows. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t seem real, like something a person should do. But\u2014\u201d She smiled. \u201cOh, yes, I want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me?\u201d He tilted her chin up so she couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>The look of longing told him everything he wanted to know even before she whispered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>As satisfaction roared through him, he grinned. To hell with his misgivings. He could manage one more night. \u201cIn that case, you need to change. Jeans aren\u2019t allowed, although...\u201d He ran his gaze down her body. Red top displaying ample cleavage and gorgeous shoulders. Jeans so tight he wanted to bite that sweet ass. \u201cI like what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>Her face lit up. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely my pleasure. I could use a shower, if you don\u2019t mind. Jessica caught me on my way home, and I detoured here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep spare leathers in the truck. Let me get those.\u201d</p><p>A minute later, he walked into her house and stopped short. A German shepherd blocked his path. As a cop, he approved; as the man planning to strip Kari of those jeans, maybe not. He knelt and held out a hand. \u201cHey, boy.\u201d</p><p>A thorough sniffing later, he had a new friend. Ruffling the dog\u2019s soft fur, Dan said, \u201cHe\u2019s a beauty. What\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the musician?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, someday my prince will come,\u201d she said under her breath, adding aloud, \u201cSomething like that, yeah. C\u2019mon into the living room.\u201d</p><p>Cops have keen hearing, and the longing in her words struck Dan like a hard punch to his gut. He froze for a moment until Prince nudged him with a cold nose. \u201cRight, dog. I\u2019m moving.\u201d</p><p>Escorted by Prince, Dan followed Kari into a living room done in soft pastels with overstuffed chairs and a couch in flowery print. A small white brick fireplace conjured up images of how beautiful Kari would look in the firelight. Tied and helpless and whimpering her need. He shook his head; damn, he was impossible.</p><p>\u201cHello there.\u201d A thin woman in her midtwenties rose when he entered the room. Brown hair, brown eyes, maybe five-six.</p><p>\u201cJennifer, this is Mas...um...Dan,\u201d Kari said, giving him a flustered look.</p><p>He crossed the room, stuck his hand out. \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m sorry for the intrusion.\u201d</p><p>Jennifer shook his hand. \u201cNo intrusion. I\u2019d just come over to ask Kari for some advice on teenagers.\u201d She grinned at Kari. \u201cI\u2019ll try that and see what happens. Thanks, hon.\u201d</p><p>She kissed Kari on the cheek and headed for the front door. \u201cYou two enjoy yourselves.\u201d The door shut quietly behind her.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Kari glanced at Dan. \u201cMy towels are in the dryer. Give me a second.\u201d</p><p>While she was gone, Dan prowled around. The right side of the living room led to an old-fashioned kitchen with light oak cabinets to match the big round table and chairs at one end. There was a colorful braided rug on the floor, plants in the window over the sink, the scent of cinnamon in the air. Oatmeal cookies were spread on waxed paper. Flour, sugar, and a bottle of vanilla sat on the counter.</p><p>She made cookies from scratch? Unable to resist, he took one. Warm and chewy, it brought back memories of weekends at his grandmother\u2019s house in the country. Like Kari\u2019s home, Gran\u2019s place had been cheerful and filled with friends and family. The contrast with his bleak and lonely apartment was chilling.</p><p>\u201cWhere are\u2014\u201d Towels over her arm, Kari came around the corner into the kitchen. She tried to frown at him, but laughter lit her eyes. \u201cBad Master! Those are for the children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re very good.\u201d He touched the dimple that appeared in her cheek as she tried not to smile. \u201cYou can call me Dan, you know. Formality can be saved for the club. And sex.\u201d He smiled as she flushed. \u201cDefinitely for sex.</p><p>\u201cWell, okay. Thank you.\u201d She waved her hand at the counter. \u201cYou really can have more, you know. I made plenty. Or can I fix you some supper? Maybe a sandwich?\u201d</p><p>A born nurturer. \u201cNo. I\u2014\u201d His stomach growled, giving him away.</p><p>She laughed and pulled out bread and meats from the refrigerator. \u201cMustard? Mayonnaise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust mustard.\u201d He leaned against the door frame, watching her bustle about for him. Marion had rarely cooked; she\u2019d assumed he could get his own meals as well as she could. But they\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Kari touched his cheek with soft fingers. \u201cYou look so unhappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d No. The cop was taking a cop-out, and a Dom must be honest with himself. And his sub. \u201cI was thinking about my wife. She didn\u2019t like to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Kari stroked his cheek with light fingers and then returned to making his sandwich. After a minute, she handed him a plate with his sandwich on it, poured a glass of milk, and led him to the big oak table. \u201cSit. Eat while I put the cookies away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d just finished the sandwich when she joined him at the table and dropped two more cookies on his plate. \u201cYou read my mind,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>\u201cMen seem to love sweets.\u201d</p><p>And sweet women like Kari. Damn the way she pulled at him. He shouldn\u2019t get involved. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She nibbled on a broken cookie. Then her blue eyes swept up. \u201cTell me about your wife\u2019s death, Dan. How did the accident happen?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>His stomach clenched as the food inside turned to a hard lump. \u201cShe skidded off a road into a tree.\u201d</p><p>Kari tilted her head. Asking more questions would be like deliberately poking at his pain. Horribly rude.</p><p>Yet he reminded her of her sister. When Hannah\u2019s baby had been stillborn, everyone said she was handling it, only she wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone. But Hannah normally shared every little thought or pain. Arriving a week later, Kari prodded until Hannah screamed at her, burst into tears, and finally shared her tangled mess of emotions. More than just grief, Hannah felt guilty over the dumbest things: taking a puff of a cigarette, bouncing too much when she walked, eating something unhealthy. And she\u2019d been envious of every mother with a healthy baby, hated them, hated God, hated her husband, who somehow hadn\u2019t prevented the death. Hannah had talked and cried and talked some more.</p><p>And after that, she\u2019d been able to simply mourn for the loss of her baby.</p><p>Dan\u2019s eyes held the same torment. Kari clenched her hands in her lap, her heart aching as she decided to push him. \u201cWere you there?\u201d</p><p>His head jerked back as if she\u2019d slapped him.</p><p>She waited. \u201cDan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d He slammed his hand on the table so hard the dishes jangled. Pushing to his feet, he stalked across the room. \u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t there. I got called into work. I could have refused, but I didn\u2019t. And she went out partying. Drinking. By herself. If I\u2019d been there...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think if you\u2019d stayed home, she wouldn\u2019t have died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d be alive.\u201d At his sides, his hands opened and closed, over and over. The stark lines on his face were deepened by pain. \u201cI protect people; that\u2019s my job. And I let my wife die.\u201d</p><p>A nun once told Kari that guilt has no logic. She kept her voice low the way she did when trying to pet the Garretts\u2019 pit bull. \u201cSo if I decide not to go tonight, and you get drunk and run off the road, will it be my fault?\u201d</p><p>He glared at her, but after years of teaching sneaky little children, she knew how to offer up wide-eyed innocence. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same at all,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Kari rose and put her arms around him. His body felt like a stone pillar. \u201cUnless you promised to be at her side every moment of every day, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. People make their own decisions, and sometimes bad things happen. Not your fault, Dan, any more than it would be my fault if you went out tonight and got in an accident.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Remembering Hannah\u2019s anger, Kari added softly, \u201cYou know, if you got drunk and killed yourself driving, I\u2019d not only be grieving, I\u2019d be furious with you for doing something so stupid.\u201d</p><p>He growled, but she ignored that and just held him, her cheek pressed against his chest, feeling his pain, sharing his pain. Had she gone too far? Would he ever talk to her again?</p><p>After a minute, he took a ragged breath, and his muscles loosened. Wrapping his arms around her, he held her gently.</p><p>She could have nestled there all evening, but the phone rang. He stepped away from her. Feeling like cursing, she went to answer it, after pointing at the table. \u201cFinish your milk.\u201d</p><p>His huffed laugh relieved her immeasurably.</p> <p>His legs felt rubbery, as if he\u2019d run a marathon, so Dan took a chair at the table. After a minute, he did as the little sub ordered and drank his milk. The first swallow caught on the tightness in his throat, but the rest went down well enough after that.</p><p>Her voice was like a melody of happiness and caring as she talked with some friend about a play rehearsal. Prince padded over to lean against Dan\u2019s leg, a comfortingly warm weight. He stroked the soft fur, thinking about Kari\u2019s words.</p><p>She said she\u2019d be furious if he died being stupid. Was he mad at Marion? He\u2019d loved her, mourned her. But anger?</p><p>Now the possibility had been raised, he could almost feel the heavy mass of rage inside him. She had been stupid, not for going without him, but in getting drunk and then driving. They\u2019d fought about that before, and she\u2019d laughed at him, called him a hidebound cop. His jaw tightened. And then she\u2019d died...died and left him alone.</p><p>Feeling guilty. Feeling angry.</p><p>His eyes burned as the unsettling emotions swept over him, uncontrollable as waves hitting the shore. The room felt suffocatingly hot. He had to leave. He walked out into the night air, leaving Kari staring after him.</p><p>Kari heard a tap at her front door and jumped to her feet. Oh, thank God. The last half hour had seemed like an eternity. Every few minutes, she\u2019d gone to the door and stood there, wanting to go after him. Then she\u2019d return to the couch and sit down again. After the third time, Prince just stretched out and watched her.</p><p>Now she ran to the front door and pulled it open. \u201cAre you all right? I\u2019m so sorry, I should never have said\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her firmly. Briefly. \u201cI\u2019m fine, and yes, you should have said everything you did.\u201d He ran his finger down her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I left so abruptly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d She watched him walk into her living room, reassured to see his prowling gait had returned. \u201cDo you still want to go? I\u2019d understand if you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want to go.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cWe still have time before Ben locks the doors. Can I take that shower?\u201d</p><p>The guest bathroom lacked a shower, so Kari led him down the hall to her bedroom and the master bath. He followed silently\u2014a good thing since she couldn\u2019t figure out anything to say. She could talk fine when he\u2019d needed her, but he was back to normal.</p><p>And having Master Dan here, in her home, was disconcerting.</p><p>Before she\u2019d only seen his Dom side, but there was more to him. The depths of his pain and guilt over his wife\u2019s death broke her heart. But it was the little things that she hadn\u2019t been prepared for. The way he\u2019d stolen a cookie. How he looked completely at home in her kitchen. How friendly he\u2019d been with Jennifer; he hadn\u2019t whipped out cuffs or expected to be called Master. How normal\u2014gorgeous\u2014he looked in black jeans and a short-sleeved shirt. How he talked to Prince like a person.</p><p>And Prince liked him.</p><p>In leathers and at the Shadowlands, Master Dan was like a dream. A fantasy. This Dan was real. Frighteningly real.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d She set the towels on the counter.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d He unbuttoned his dark brown shirt and tugged it out of his jeans, before reaching in to turn on the shower.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Her gaze got trapped at the sight of his muscular chest, his broad shoulders. When he undid his pants, she glanced up and saw the amusement in his eyes. The disconcerting heat that matched her own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better change,\u201d she muttered and fled.</p><p>In the bedroom, she couldn\u2019t concentrate. He\u2019d be naked by now. In her shower. If she had any courage, she\u2019d go in there and join him. Yes. She\u2019d do just that. She took two steps toward the door and heard his voice.</p><p>\u201cKari, I need...\u201d The last part of his sentence trailed off.</p><p>What could he need? The shower had soap and shampoo. Steam billowed in the bathroom as she entered. Feeling like a voyeur, she hesitated outside the shower curtain, trying not to stare at the outline of his big body. Or at least to not be obvious about it.</p><p>\u201cDan?\u201d Saying his name still felt so strange. Nice, but strange. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He pushed the curtain back, grabbed her around the waist, and set her in the tub. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>The water and his deep laugh drowned out her startled yelp.</p><p>With ruthless hands, he stripped her out of her clothes and started washing her, his hands running over her arms, her back, her breasts. He gave extra attention to her breasts. \u201cCleanliness is next to godliness,\u201d he informed her, holding her firmly in place despite her squirming.</p><p>\u201cI had a shower earlier.\u201d His touch was making her hot, needy. Abandoning modesty, she ran her hands over his chest. \u201cBut I guess another one is good.\u201d She slid her arms around him and pushed her belly against his erection.</p><p>His eyes kindled. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re there, wash my back.\u201d He handed her the soap. Arms around him, she scrubbed his back and butt, each movement rubbing her breasts against his chest. The friction from his chest hair sent tingles running through her.</p><p>He took the soap back and returned the favor, although he spent far too long washing her bottom, massaging her cheeks, and running a finger down the crack.</p><p>Stepping back, she washed his front, lingering on his chest, searching out the flat nipples and playing with them. His contoured muscles moved under her touch. Where had he been when she\u2019d studied muscle groups in college anatomy? His biceps hardened when he ran his hand up her body; his pectoral muscles flexed when he put his arms around her. Slowly, she worked her way down his front to his\u2014not a penis\u2014he called it his cock. The velvety texture seemed incongruous over the iron rod underneath. She washed his balls, firm and heavy. His legs were apart, his hand stroking her hair as she bent to the task. When she finished and looked up, his eyes were black with passion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d He plucked the soap from her motionless fingers. His foam-covered hands slicked over her breasts. When he rolled her nipples between his fingers, her legs weakened. And then he touched her between her legs, sliding over her clit, washing her folds until her knees buckled. He grinned, steadied her, before turning her so her back was toward him.</p><p>He removed the flexible shower hose from the overhead clip and dropped it to spray on the tub floor. Taking her hands, he set them low on the shower wall, bending her forward. Her breathing increased.</p><p>The curtain slid aside, and a second later, she heard the crinkling sound of a condom wrapper. \u201cDon\u2019t move, little sub. I\u2019m going to take you hard and fast,\u201d he said. Just his voice sent a shudder through her.</p><p>Securing her in place with an iron arm around her waist, he entered her with a hard thrust that raised her up on her toes. She gasped as the shock sent waves of sensation searing through her.</p><p>\u201cYou feel incredible,\u201d he murmured in her ear, one hand caressing her breasts. His chest was hard and hot against her back as he pushed even deeper.</p><p>And then he stopped. \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. That sound from him was as ominous as a doctor saying, \u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand down the shower hose and pulled it up. \u201cSeems a shame to waste all this water, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Confused, she glanced at the shower handle. She wiggled her hips a little. He was thick and long inside her; why wasn\u2019t he moving? \u201cYou can turn it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, sweetie, I have a better idea.\u201d He twisted the adjustable head to a single stream. With a hum of satisfaction, he positioned it in front of her breasts. She sucked in a breath at the erotic, brutal sensation.</p><p>He moved it down her front slowly, down and down, until the fierce droplets struck her already sensitive clit.</p><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, murmured, \u201cBingo,\u201d and held the spray in place, held her in place as he eased his cock out of her. He drove back into her hard, filling her completely. In, out. Each thrust moved her hips forward, changing where the pulsing water struck her clit. Her hips jerked with each assault, her legs trembling so badly, his arm around her waist was all that held her up.</p><p>Her clit was on fire, so sensitive that the force of the water throbbed through her whole body. His rhythmic thrusts merged with the sensations, and everything in her tightened. She went onto tiptoes, pushing back against him, needing...needing. He moved the spray suddenly, back and forth, hitting all sides of her clit, and the shock threw her over the peak. Her climax roared over her in a devastating wave, exploding outward as she thrashed in his hard grip.</p><p>With a deep laugh, he dropped the showerhead, and grasping her hips in hard hands, he pounded into her, each thrust sending more and more spasms through her. His fingers tightened on her hips and his roar echoed through the small room as he came.</p><p>Wrapping his arms around her from behind, he held her through the after-shudders and when her legs went limp. She curled her fingers around his forearms, wanting to hold him tighter. The happiness she\u2019d felt when he climaxed had startled her and worried her a little.</p><p>When she could finally stand on her own, he turned her around, kissed her hard on the lips. \u201cThere, little sub. Don\u2019t you feel better now that you\u2019re all clean?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>An hour later, Dan walked with Kari up to the front of the club. He stayed far enough behind to enjoy the view of her wearing his shirt...and nothing else. Good thing he carried spare clothing in the truck. He should have guessed that the woman wouldn\u2019t own anything a nun wouldn\u2019t wear.</p><p>He\u2019d considered having her change into the soft cotton pajamas in one drawer, imagining how her breasts would have made SpongeBob dance.</p><p>But his hands had ached to play with her butt some more, so he\u2019d put her in one of his spare shirts. The dark blue brought out the color of her eyes and set off her rich brown hair. Even better, the material was thin enough to see each movement of her full breasts. She was so tiny that the shirttail completely covered her ass with a few inches to spare.</p> <p>Of course, since it was so long, he\u2019d refused to allow her any underwear. Her face had reddened with anger and embarrassment, and her eyes sparked with blue fire. He\u2019d hoped she\u2019d lose her temper, but she remembered her spanking too well... Dammit.</p><p>He grinned, anticipating his revenge. Sometime tonight, he\u2019d ask her to pick up something from the floor.</p><p>She looked back at him, saw where his eyes were focused, and shot him an evil look. \u201cDo you pick out your sub\u2019s clothing all the time?\u201d</p><p>He closed the gap between them, ran his hand over her bare butt. God, she was soft. \u201cNo, sweetie, this is just for my pleasure so nothing\u2019s in the way when I take my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Pink washed over the nape of her neck.</p><p>At his usual station behind the guard desk, Ben glanced up as they entered. \u201cKari, good to see you. Jessica hoped you\u2019d make it tonight. Just in time too. I\u2019m closing the doors in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Then he saw Dan, and his mouth dropped open. He glanced at Kari, then Dan again. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably so,\u201d Dan bit out as the unsettled feeling he\u2019d managed to calm on his long walk reared back up inside him. Marion. His anger, his guilt, his loss... All that was bad enough. How he felt about Kari added a different guilt.</p><p>And yet he\u2019d wanted to be here with her.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Ben rubbed his jaw. \u201cGood. Go on in, folks.\u201d</p><p>Dan pushed the feelings back down inside him, managed a thin smile. \u201cThanks, Ben.\u201d He nudged Kari toward the inner door.</p><p>Kari made it three steps into the club room before she stopped, stunned. Two steps farther than Dan had figured she\u2019d get. The quiet beginners\u2019 nights didn\u2019t prepare a newbie for a normal Saturday. Tonight, people crowded the small dance floor to the right, dancing to the raw, throbbing music. Across the room, Doms and Dommes, with subs kneeling at their feet, filled couches and tables. The dress code was in force, leather and latex predominant, corsets and loincloths not unusual, the odd disobedient sub wearing only cuffs or collar. They were late enough that the scene areas were in full use, and the slap of a flogger on bare flesh, wails, screams, and moans of arousal sounded over the music.</p><p>Kari edged closer to him, looked up with wide eyes, the look on her face so dazed, so innocent, that he had to pull her up against him so he could take her mouth. Damn, but he already wanted her again.</p><p>Kari sagged in Master Dan\u2019s arms, her body rousing as if she hadn\u2019t just gotten off less than an hour ago.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re addictive, little sub,\u201d he murmured in her ear, biting her neck hard enough to make her shudder with need.</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d she said under her breath. \u201cDammit.\u201d The way he overwhelmed both her body and emotions was frightening.</p><p>He frowned, tilted her chin up. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Oh, spit.</p><p>\u201cKari?\u201d</p><p>She huffed a breath. \u201cI said,\u201d she muttered. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>The amusement in his eyes made her want to punch him, but the feeling of his body as he yanked her up against him again wiped the notion out entirely. The warmth of his hands went right through her thin shirt. His leathers brushed her bare thighs, and the feeling of air against her private parts was almost as worrying as the interested looks from everyone walking past. Next time she\u2019d just take the spanking and wear what she wanted.</p><p>Or maybe not. She eyed his solidly muscular chest, exposed by the open leather vest, remembered the glint of laughter in his eyes when she\u2019d balked at the no-underwear decree. He\u2019d not only have enjoyed spanking her but would still have stuffed her into his choice of clothing.</p><p>The memory of how he\u2019d stripped her clothing off in the shower, pushing her hands away as easily as she\u2019d have brushed away a fly, sent a wave of heat through her and she shivered.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. When he rubbed his knuckles against her breasts, she realized her nipples had turned to hard nubs.</p><p>\u201cAnd what are you thinking about, little sub?\u201d</p><p>She flushed, didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>His arm around her tightened. His fingers caught one nipple in a sharp pinch.</p><p>When she squeaked, a few people turned to look at them. He didn\u2019t even notice.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question, Kari.\u201d</p><p>Muffled laughter sounded around them, and she felt her cheeks turning hotter and hotter. \u201cThe shower,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He grinned. \u201cGood to know it has such an effect on you.\u201d His hand on her butt pressed her against him. He was fully erect. \u201cThinking about that has the same effect on me. I have a feeling you\u2019re going to be a very clean submissive,\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p><p>She sank against him, loving the feel of his body. Loving the feel of his hands until she realized he\u2019d pulled the tail of the shirt up to her waist so he could touch her bare bottom.</p><p>She tried to shove back, but his arm around her waist only tightened. His fingers moved slowly over her buttocks, massaging her cheeks. \u201cDid you forget the rules, sweetling? For tonight, your body is mine to use.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He continued as her outrage passed, as his fingers started to arouse her. The knowledge that people could see made the heat even worse. He tightened his grip, rubbing her against his erection until her pussy throbbed.</p><p>\u201cDaniel.\u201d Master Z\u2019s voice behind her.</p><p>Kari stiffened, tried to pull away. Sir\u2019s arm didn\u2019t loosen, and he held her in place until she stopped pushing. Finally, finally, his point made, he released her.</p><p>She turned and looked up at Master Z, her face probably as red as a tomato. To her surprise, he had his arm around Jessica. Was Jessica his sub?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you made it here.\u201d Jessica frowned as her gaze swept over Kari. She shook her head at Master Dan. \u201cI wanted you to give Kari a ride, not to ride her.\u201d</p><p>Sir barked a laugh, then said, \u201cZ, your sub\u2019s getting mouthy. Called me an asshole earlier.\u201d</p><p>Master Z tilted his head. \u201cDid she now? If she sets such a bad example for our beginners, she will need to demonstrate what follows.\u201d He paused, said reflectively, \u201cI haven\u2019t given a lesson on discipline for some time.\u201d</p><p>Jessica froze, her eyes widening. A tremor shook her body.</p><p>Smiling slowly, Master Z looked down at Jessica and murmured, \u201cThank you for the suggestion, Daniel.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Sir pulled Kari away.</p><p>Kari rose up on tiptoe to whisper, \u201cWhat did he mean by \u2018demonstrate\u2019 and \u2018a lesson\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster Z teaches by demonstrating how something should be done.\u201d</p><p>Discipline? Oh God, poor Jessica.</p><p>Moving through the crowd, Sir kept a hard arm around Kari, and she loved how feminine and protected his strength made her feel. When they reached the bar, she snuggled even closer.</p><p>He glanced at her and ran a finger down her cheek. \u201cI like touching you, little sub,\u201d he said, his eyes gentle.</p><p>Her breath seemed to stop inside her chest.</p><p>But then he grinned and his hand trailed to where the shirt gaped open over her breasts. His voice lowered. \u201cAnd I also like spanking your ass until it\u2019s a glowing red. And fucking you hard against a wall.\u201d</p><p>She put her fingers over his mouth to silence him, but his amused look said he knew how his carnal words sent hunger through her and wet seeping between her legs.</p><p>Cullen wandered over and set drinks in front of them. His gaze lingered on her heated face. \u201cA sub for three nights, Dan. That\u2019s gotta be a record.\u201d</p><p>She felt Sir\u2019s body stiffen against her as his muscles turned iron hard. \u201cDon\u2019t jump to conclusions,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m just helping out with beginners\u2019 nights like I promised Z. Nothing else.\u201d His arm dropped.</p><p>His words sucked the air right out of Kari\u2019s chest.</p><p>Again. Nothing had changed. She turned her face away, her gaze coming to rest on Martha and Gerald across the bar. The old Dom nuzzled his wife, the caring so obvious in his actions that Kari\u2019s lips tightened. Their affection made her realize she\u2019d hoped for that with Dan. Especially after he\u2019d come to get her, and they\u2019d shared so much.</p><p>Well, obviously that wasn\u2019t going to happen. How could she keep forgetting he didn\u2019t want anything more than an occasional fucking? She deliberately used the f word, squeezing her hands together so hard the joints ached.</p> <p>How had she been so delusional? This place wasn\u2019t about love; it was about domination. Pain. Sex. She\u2019d been stupid.</p><p>\u201cThe sub you\u2019re with tonight isn\u2019t adequately dressed.\u201d Cullen\u2019s lazy tone had turned mean. Was he mad at her or at Sir?</p><p>Master Dan glanced at her, his gaze shuttered. \u201cVery true. Got a spare set of cuffs?\u201d</p><p>Cullen crossed the bar, opened a cupboard, and returned to thump down leather cuffs.</p><p>\u201cGive me your wrists, Kari,\u201d Sir snapped.</p><p>She hesitated. Did she even want to be with him tonight? How much of this high and low stuff could she take? Then again, she was just here for the sex. Just the sex. Nothing more.</p><p>Mouth tight, she slapped her wrists into his broad hand, ignoring his narrowed eyes.</p><p>He buckled the cuffs on, checked for the tightness automatically, his gaze not leaving her face.</p><p>She looked away. Just the sex, nothing more.</p><p>\u201cInteresting attire, Dan,\u201d Raoul said, sliding onto the bar stool next to where Kari stood. He nodded at the shirt she wore. \u201cAmazingly provocative on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Sir said. He didn\u2019t snap at Raoul, she noticed. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike anyone would be.\u201d Kari yanked the bottom of the shirt lower and scowled. Damn him anyway. She should have just stayed home. \u201cYou can see right through it, and it hardly covers my\u2014\u201d</p><p>Raoul raised his eyebrows, and Kari\u2019s breath strangled in her throat. Oh dear Lord. Holding her lip between her teeth, she ventured a look at Master Dan and tried not to cringe at the expression on his face. This wasn\u2019t the hurt man whom she\u2019d hugged in her living room. This was Master Dan, and her fantasy of him had just taken on a nightmarish tinge.</p><p>His gaze chilled her right to the bone. \u201cApparently your modesty weighs more heavily with you than my will. Rather surprising you have any modesty left, considering how you spent a good portion of Wednesday night.\u201d He glanced up at the chains on the rafters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master. Very sorry.\u201d She lowered her eyes, heart hammering in her chest. Would kneeling help?</p><p>\u201cI am sure you are,\u201d he said quietly and started unbuttoning her shirt. Her hands rose instinctively to stop him. His hard look made her drop her arms back to her sides. \u201cToss me a towel, Cullen,\u201d he said.</p><p>He used the towel to cover a bar stool, lifted her onto it, and flipped the shirt open. With unyielding hands, he moved her legs apart until her private parts showed, her brown curls blatantly dark against the white material.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Master,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cPlease is the right word, sub,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what you\u2019ll do. Please both yourself and me.\u201d He took her hands, placed them over her breasts. \u201cPlay with your breasts until your nipples are as swollen and red as I had them three days ago.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say to me?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers flinched as he moved her hands, massaging her breasts, ruthlessly plucking her nipples until fire streaked toward her groin. \u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she said, unable to look away from his lethal brown eyes.</p><p>He stepped away. She tried to move her hands like he wanted and ended up covering her breasts with them instead.</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cKari, do what I said, or I\u2019ll lay you out on the bar and use my mouth to do it myself.\u201d</p><p>Even as she recoiled, heat flooded her insides, and the towel dampened under her. Sir\u2019s lips curved up mockingly, even though his eyes remained frozen.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she touched her breasts, stroking, pulling on the nipples, pinching them. Club members stopped to watch with appreciative looks before smiling at Master Dan. Eyes half-lidded, Cullen propped an elbow on the bar, acting like he was at a movie. Kari raised her chin and looked away.</p><p>When Master Dan turned his back on her, she continued, her hands trembling as embarrassment seared her again and again with each laugh and half-heard comment. Buck\u2014oh, God, Buck\u2014started to approach, then stopped. He shot Dan a nasty look and moved away.</p><p>When Master Dan finally checked on her, he frowned. Nudging her hand away, he took a nipple between his fingers, pinching and rolling with increasing force until pain, then pleasure, shot through her, hammering into her clit. Her breath sucked in.</p><p>\u201cThat hard,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cLast warning, sub.\u201d</p><p>She nodded miserably. Closing her eyes to shut out the world, she touched herself. Harder, faster. To her shock, her body roused; her pussy ached as her breasts swelled and tightened. Her nipples moved past sensitive to throbbing need.</p><p>Hands closed on her wrists, held her immobile. She opened her eyes. \u201cMaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stop now, Kari.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fell to her sides, shaking. Her lips quivered.</p><p>He studied her, and the hardness eased from his face. His brown eyes warmed. He rubbed his knuckles over her jutting nipples, and she sucked in an audible breath at the gentle abrasion. \u201cNow that\u2019s a very pretty color,\u201d he said. His smile sent pleasure through her, melting the lump in her chest and almost making her forget why she\u2019d been so mad at him.</p><p>He tilted her chin up to pin her with his gaze. \u201cWhose body is this tonight, sub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this body is mine and I want to show it off, should you be embarrassed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cGood enough for now. You did well.\u201d After buttoning her shirt, he cupped her cheek so gently that her eyes puddled with tears. \u201cKari, I should let you go. I know that, and you know that. You deserve a Dom who can give you more than a night here and there.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d been standing, she would have fallen. Instead she firmed her spine and curled a hand around his wrist, resting her fingertips on the hard tendons. \u201cI\u2019m here tonight for the sex. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>He could undoubtedly read the lie in her face, but he didn\u2019t challenge her. \u201cSo be it.\u201d He turned her bar stool to face the bar and tucked an arm around her waist.</p><p>The warmth of his touch made her tremble inside fully as much as she shook outside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cullen appeared, removed her untouched, watery drink, and set a fresh one down.</p><p>Master Dan handed it to her and asked Cullen, \u201cAnything interesting happening tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks to be a good night. Raoul plans to scene with his sub. Flogging, I think, then the cane. Mistress Anne brought in some new toys and was going to demo them on her sub later. Cock cage, ball crushers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne is usually a good show.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Cullen\u2019s fingers tapped the bar as he thought. \u201cAh, Z\u2019s opening the Capture Gardens. Said he\u2019d save you a spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now.\u201d The change in Master Dan\u2019s voice whipped Kari\u2019s head around. Anticipation and amusement. One side of his mouth curved up as he looked at her. She knew that expression, and it made her insides quake.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, give me another set of cuffs, small plug, and lube,\u201d Sir said. \u201cAnd what time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime now.\u201d Cullen looked at Kari, his eyes filled with the same amusement as Sir\u2019s. \u201cKari. You may want another drink.\u201d</p><p>Kari choked on the sip she\u2019d just taken.</p> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The jerk hadn\u2019t bothered to explain anything. Fuming, Kari had barely finished her first drink when three chimes sounded over the music. Heads lifted all through the room.</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d She closed her mouth quickly, earning herself a frown from Sir, but nothing more.</p><p>\u201cThe Gardens are open.\u201d He led her to an open door on the right wall and into a room with a stone floor and darkly paneled walls. About twenty members congregated there. On the far side, a door leading outside stood open. The scent of night-blooming jasmine and newly cut grass wafted in.</p><p>An older DM, one of those who\u2019d touched Kari\u2019s breasts on Wednesday, faced the crowd. His light blue eyes met Kari\u2019s, and he winked.</p><p>She flushed, then wondered if she\u2019d ever lose that response. Probably not. Really, modesty should have been her middle name.</p> <p>\u201cMy name is Sam,\u201d the DM said. \u201cI\u2019ll be your contact for any problems during this role-play. There are rules, and as Master Z has decided upon the punishments, you want to listen closely. He can be a sadistic bastard.\u201d A ripple of laughter ran through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cFor those who haven\u2019t participated before, the game is this. Your sub is released into the Garden with a head start. You search for her or him,\u201d he added, nodding at a gay couple and a Domme with a male sub. \u201cOnce found, take whatever satisfaction you and your sub have agreed upon, either right in the Gardens, inside on the equipment, or upstairs in private.\u201d</p><p>Kari\u2019s eyes widened. On the first night, Sir had asked her about her fantasies. \u201cA gorgeous barbarian taking you against your will? Have you had that one?\u201d Her insides quivered. Was this real?</p><p>Sir leaned over to whisper, \u201cWhen I catch you, I will take you right then and there.\u201d His hand slid over her bare butt, squeezing possessively.</p><p>She bit her lip against the surge of arousal.</p><p>Sam continued, \u201cResistance is expected, but serious fighting is forbidden; no deep scratching, punching, or hard kicking for either subs or Doms. Subs, the club safe word is red, and DMs will be in the Gardens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoms, you may only capture the sub whose band matches yours.\u201d Motioning the gay couple forward, Sam fastened bright green glow-sticks around the Dom\u2019s wrist and matching ones on his sub\u2019s ankle and wrist. \u201cChasing anyone else\u2019s sub is forbidden. Of course, if one blunders right into you, feel free to cop a feel and then swat her to get her running again. Anything more than that...\u201d Sam\u2019s smile was pure evil. \u201cWell, the last Dom who tried for more was flogged by Mistress Rachel until her arm wore out, and then his membership was canceled. Pissing off Z isn\u2019t smart.</p><p>\u201cThe game lasts two hours, and three chimes mean the game is over. Subs, a few idiots have managed to hide by removing their glow-sticks. This is your warning. At closing, the DMs search the Gardens. Any sub still outside is considered available for use by any and all DMs who join the search.\u201d</p> <p>As Sam finished his lecture, Dan realized Kari had pressed so close to his side, she almost melted into his skin.</p><p>She looked up at him with big eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to do this.\u201d</p><p>So modest and so passionate. Why did the discrepancy bring all his Dom urges to the forefront? He rubbed his cheek against her silky hair and whispered back, \u201cI know you really do want to. I can see...smell your arousal.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, probably from his language. And then, brave little sub, she nodded.</p><p>The line moved forward as Z vetted the players; mind games like this brought out his overprotective nature. Now Z shook his head at the couple in front of them. \u201cSorry, Adam, but Beth isn\u2019t ready for this yet. She\u2019s terrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Adam scowled and shrugged. The bunched muscles in Beth\u2019s bared shoulders eased as she and her top for the night stepped out of line.</p><p>Dan smiled at the slender redhead and received a fleeting smile in return. He\u2019d once considered topping her before realizing she only chose weaker Doms. Sub or not, she wasn\u2019t about to give up much control. Something nasty must have happened in her past to make her so wary.</p><p>He and Kari stepped up to face Z.</p><p>\u201cLittle one, do you understand how the game works?\u201d Z studied Kari. \u201cYou\u2019ll be running away from Master Dan. When he catches you, he gets to do whatever he wants.\u201d</p><p>Kari shivered, then nodded.</p><p>Z glanced at Dan. \u201cShe has a nice mixture of fear and anticipation.\u201d Smiling, Z nodded to Sam, who fastened a bright pink glow-stick around both their wrists and another around Kari\u2019s ankle.</p><p>\u201cPink, huh.\u201d Dan shook his head at Sam. \u201cThanks a lot, you bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re so pretty in pink, Master Dan.\u201d</p><p>Fighting was forbidden in the club, so Dan just thumped Sam in the chest on the way past. Sam barked a laugh.</p><p>Once clear of the line, Kari tugged on Dan\u2019s arm. He leaned down to hear her whisper, \u201cBut you do look pretty in pink, Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust keep it up, sub, just keep it up,\u201d he warned.</p><p>When she giggled, his brain went stone-cold dead. He\u2019d never heard her laugh, not like that. He grinned, wanting more. He needed to... No, he didn\u2019t need anything. No more evenings, dammit.</p><p>They walked a few more paces while he subdued his emotions.</p><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d</p><p>He nodded permission for her to speak.</p><p>\u201cI run, and you catch me. I understand that. But I\u2019m not much of a runner, you know.\u201d</p><p>Dan tipped Kari\u2019s face up. \u201cI enjoy a good chase, so I\u2019ll add an incentive. If you don\u2019t try hard\u2014say, if I catch you within fifteen minutes\u2014then I\u2019ll show you how the spanking bench works in the bar room. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>If her blue eyes got any bigger, they\u2019d take over her whole face. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>He could hardly wait to get his hands on her. \u201cI\u2019ll even be nice and give you a fighting chance.\u201d He removed her cuffs.</p><p>\u201cDan.\u201d Nolan strolled over.</p><p>Damn, it was good to have him back. \u201cWe got fog tonight?\u201d</p><p>Nolan nodded. \u201cZ went all out. There\u2019s dry ice in every fountain.\u201d</p><p>Dan smiled at Kari\u2019s puzzled expression. She\u2019d understand soon enough. \u201cYou doing the subbie preps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy favorite job, especially since returning. You wouldn\u2019t believe how overdressed women are in Iraq.\u201d Nolan nodded at Kari. \u201cClothing? Oil?\u201d</p><p>Dan studied the little sub. Her eyes were wary but bright, her breathing fast. Not too scared. He could have her prepped in his favorite way. \u201cNo clothes, lots of oil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, that will be my pleasure.\u201d Nolan turned to Kari, his faint smile fading. \u201cSub, hang your shirt on the hook over there and return to me to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes whipped up to Dan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cKari, go with Master Nolan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>Nolan scowled, his voice cruel. \u201cWhat do you say to me, sub?\u201d</p><p>She flinched and gave Dan a look of betrayal before dropping her eyes. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d She unbuttoned the shirt and pulled it off slowly.</p><p>Nolan smothered a grin as Dan\u2019s sub hung her shirt on a hook and tried to act nonchalant. She looked around, obviously hoping no one saw her. Of course, everyone did. Grins appeared on the other Doms\u2019 faces; even Master Z\u2019s lips curved up before he turned to the next couple.</p><p>Nolan remembered this little one from last Wednesday. No man with a dick would forget those lush and responsive breasts. Considering Dan\u2019s preference for voluptuous and sweet, Nolan figured the Dom might end up keeping this sub. A good thing. He\u2019d been alone too long.</p><p>Nolan stomped on the envy rising within him.</p><p>As Kari approached, he looked her over slowly. Coldly. Part of prep included increasing a sub\u2019s anxiety, and with his scarred face, he was damned good at it. Odd how a man could enjoy scaring a sub and simultaneously want to cuddle her up and reassure her. Just one of those oddities of being a Dom.</p><p>He set a hand on her curvy ass just to feel her recoil and pushed her outside. The night air was warm and humid, perfect for playing in the Gardens.</p><p>Behind them, a sub in a lacy corset and tight latex pants let out a high shriek, then darted out the door and into the Gardens. Nolan glanced down at Kari. She chewed on her lip, obviously dying to ask why that sub got to keep her clothes and she didn\u2019t. Dan had trained her a bit, since she managed to keep silent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few feet to the right of the door, another DM, Jake, leaned against the wall, the sprayer at his feet. The DM\u2019s appreciative gaze ran over Kari. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan\u2019s sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, a newbie. I saw her on Monday. Very cute.\u201d Jake gave her another approving look, then straightened. \u201cDon\u2019t move, chica.\u201d</p><p>Nolan stepped back as Kari froze in place like a terrified rabbit. After pumping up the sprayer, Jake opened up. She flinched as the fragrant oil hit her, covering her shoulders, above her breasts, across her back, drizzling down her skin.</p><p>After one complete circle, Jake stepped back. \u201cBeen thinking. We should change jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Seniority had its rewards. Nolan stepped forward and closed his hands on the sub\u2019s soft shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She jerked back and put her hands up.</p><p>Damn, but the shy ones were fun. Nolan growled, \u201cStand very still, subbie, or I will chain you to the door and let everyone have a turn. Or do you want to use your safe word?\u201d</p><p>Even with the patchy moonlight, he saw her face pale, but she shook her head. Mouth pressed into a tight little line, she lowered her hands.</p><p>Taking his time, he stroked the oil over her body, down her arms, her hands, her shoulders, and back, enjoying the satiny skin and curves under his hands. No wonder Dan liked her.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs, sub.\u201d Her hands fisted, but she complied. Kneeling, he spread oil over her legs, smoothing down and then back up. A pity he couldn\u2019t do her cunt too, but oil wasn\u2019t good for pussies. When he stopped at her upper thighs, her tiny exhale of relief made him grin.</p><p>He heard Jake chuckle.</p><p>Unfortunately for her, he wasn\u2019t done yet. Rising, he gripped her upper arm to secure her\u2014the little rabbit looked ready to scamper\u2014and massaged the oil into her breasts, taking his time. His father always said, \u201cIf a job is worth doing, it\u2019s worth doing well.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d seen Dan force her to play with herself earlier and figured she\u2019d be pretty sensitive now. And yes, her breasts swelled all too quickly under his hands. Damned shame. So he concentrated on her nipples until her muffled whimpers became audible. Until pink arousal showed in her cheeks.</p><p>He rubbed the back of his hand over the brown curls of her pussy. Very, very wet. She closed her eyes in humiliation. Well then, his job here was done. \u201cSub.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened, and a tremor ran through her as she stared up at him with huge blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re ready to give Master Dan a good time. Off with you now.\u201d He pushed her toward the Gardens and smacked her bare bottom hard enough to make her yelp.</p><p>She ran. Once past the first tall hedge, fog appeared, pooling on the grass, curling upward like white fingers, giving the area a surreal atmosphere. Slowing, she moved past curving flower beds, heady with fragrance. Tall bushes and trees formed secluded nooks.</p><p>In the eerie mist, small fountains glimmered with soft lights, the only illumination in the gardens other than faint moonlight and the glow-sticks that darted here and there like colorful lightning bugs.</p><p>Okay. She needed to evade Master Dan for at least fifteen minutes, but how could anyone hide in here? The bushes were too thick to burrow into, the fountains too small to hide behind. Swings and flat lawn chairs offered no shelter. Even the soft grass was cut golf course short.</p><p>And look how the other subs\u2019 light sticks danced. Way too visible.</p><p>Suddenly a man\u2019s voice rose. \u201cMasters, the chase is on. Find your slaves and make them pay for trying to escape.\u201d</p><p>Kari shivered. This might be just a game, but knowing Sir hunted her, planned to take her, made her insides feel funny. Scared. Aroused.</p> <p>Spotting a pink glow that matched her bracelet, she ran across an open space and dodged behind more bushes. She stopped next to a gurgling fountain and saw white mist boiling from the water, spilling over the concrete sides like a volcano erupting. The fog suddenly turned silver, and Kari glanced up. Slow-moving clouds revealed the moon before hiding it again, darkening the world.</p><p>A sub ran past, her master in full chase. A squeak like a captured rabbit sounded a minute later, then high-pitched begging. Slaps of a hand hitting flesh and cries of pain.</p><p>Kari put a hand over her mouth. The sub hadn\u2019t yelled out a safe word, so she didn\u2019t need help. Did she?</p><p>Hands behind his back, a DM strolled toward her, obviously listening for trouble. Kari relaxed slightly.</p><p>He spotted her. His gaze ran over her, lingered on her breasts, and stopped on her bracelet. With a grin, he pointed to the left. Kari saw a pink glow heading closer, and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cRun, subbie,\u201d the DM said, amusement in his voice, and waved her off.</p><p>Breasts bouncing, she ran, weaving through the clearings, trying to find a barrier to block the glow-stick light. She ran some more. Had it had been fifteen minutes? She turned a corner and froze at the sight of a pink bracelet moving across a clearing. Master Dan. His shadow reached toward her like a monster from underground, the cuffs clipped to his leathers rattling.</p><p>What if she hadn\u2019t used up all the time?</p><p>Struggling for breath, she fled, sprinting past more fountains, veering one way, then another. Past a man pounding into a woman on all fours, past a man with arms chained to a low branch.</p><p>A hand grabbed her wrist. She squeaked, yanked, and Sir\u2019s fingers slid off her oil-covered arm. She dashed away, but he seized her within a minute and again lost his hold.</p><p>A couple of yards farther, his body thudded into hers from behind, and his arms wrapped around her waist, securing her.</p><p>She struggled, trying to push his hands away. No success. Then she lifted her feet and dropped, sliding right out of his arms. She rolled, pushed to her knees.</p><p>With a laugh, he flattened her under his heavy body, knocking the wind out of her. \u201cSneaky little sub.\u201d</p><p>With implacable hands, he flipped her onto her back. She started fighting again, instinctively trying to escape the hard hands holding her in place. His grip slipped, and he cursed, then straddled her, pinning her to the ground with his weight. Using his knee, he trapped one arm long enough to buckle a wrist cuff on. He did the other wrist and secured the cuffs together in front. He sat back on his haunches.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re faster than a rabbit.\u201d His eyes heated. \u201cAnd very slick.\u201d His hands stroked down her neck and her shoulder.</p><p>Holding her cuffs over her head with one hand, he kissed her hard, taking her mouth slowly. Thoroughly. His fingers played with her breasts, erotically slipping and sliding over her oily skin, toying with her nipples until her hunger grew overwhelming. When her hips tilted up toward him, he sat back and grinned wickedly.</p><p>The look in his eyes boded ill for her comfort level. What was he thinking? She glanced around the small, way-too-open clearing where fog drifted in small patches of white. No equipment, no benches, or crosses. Good. That was good.</p><p>When he rose to his feet, she made her move, rolling over and away. He snatched an ankle before she could rise and then wrapped a cuff around it. The other ankle got a cuff too.</p><p>She squirmed harder, and he chuckled. \u201cFight all you want, little sub. You\u2019re doomed.\u201d Pulling her to her feet by the wrist cuffs, he led her across the clearing to a picturesque grouping of three trees. Trees, wrist cuffs\u2014this didn\u2019t look good.</p><p>\u201cThis looks good,\u201d he murmured. \u201cKneel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d she whispered, bracing her feet. \u201cThere are people here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about that?\u201d he whispered back. Grabbing her around the waist, he laid her flat and threw a leg over her to keep her in place. She pushed at him. Got nowhere.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands over your head.\u201d</p><p>Was he insane? \u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head frantically. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and rolled her onto her side, pinning her legs between his own, and smacked her bottom, a hard, stinging blow. She barely managed to muffle her yelp.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands over your head, Kari.\u201d His hand stroked over her burning skin. \u201cOr don\u2019t. I would enjoy spanking you first.\u201d</p><p>He would too.</p><p>When he pushed her onto her back, she lifted her hands over her head, horrified at how vulnerable she felt. Outside. In public.</p><p>And yet, when he snapped the cuffs to a chain wrapped around the base of the tree, her breasts tightened and she dampened. As he rose to his feet, a quiver of panic went through her. Why had he put ankle cuffs on her? She looked around and realized chains circled the tree trunks with the ends dangling.</p><p>He grabbed her right ankle, lifting her leg into the air and snapping it to a chain that was waist high on the tree.</p><p>\u201cNo, Master. No.\u201d She kicked at his hands. He laughed, snatched her other foot, and secured her left ankle to a chain on the other tree. Her legs now formed a narrow V in the air.</p><p>He rubbed his cheek and studied her. \u201cWider would be good.\u201d Shortening the chain on the left tree, he reclipped her ankle cuff, pulling her legs farther apart. The misty air struck her wet labia like a shock of ice.</p><p>\u201cI love being outdoors, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said in a normal voice, kneeling between her legs.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThere are people around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the shadows. Mostly.\u201d Then he chuckled, traced a finger through her wet folds, making her squirm. \u201cHowever, if I\u2019m any good at all, the entire garden will hear you scream when you come.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh God. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d she hissed, glaring at him.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Dan tried to smother his laugh. She couldn\u2019t get much wetter or more aroused. \u201cPoor Kari. I can tell you\u2019re turned off by the whole thing.\u201d His finger circled her clit, and she wiggled like a worm on a hook. \u201cYou\u2019re lying to me, sweetheart. Have we talked about honesty?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>Lying down on top of her, he braced himself on one forearm. Her soft breasts cushioned his chest; her soft thighs cradled his hips.</p><p>Grasping her chin roughly, he frowned down at her. \u201cHow many times did you tell me no in the last five minutes? And now you\u2019re lying. You\u2019re racking up the punishments you have coming. I\u2019d suggest you confine yourself to \u2018yes, Sir\u2019 before I decide to make some of them very, very public.\u201d</p><p>Those big eyes. He could never describe the way they pulled at him, the satisfaction he got from seeing the nerves revving in them, the wariness, and the trust when she let him drive her to the heights. He took her mouth hard, pulling a response from her. When he squeezed her breast, he felt her nipple\u2019s hard point of arousal. Her trembling increased.</p><p>There was nothing more gratifying than a sub\u2019s sweet yielding.</p><p>Or a sub\u2019s squirming when being punished. He pushed back onto his knees, kneeling where he could see her pussy, a dark triangle in the misty shadows. Pulling the toy, lube, and condom from his pocket, he opened his leathers and sheathed himself. With the lube, he prepared the plug. \u201cYou might find this a bit different, little sub, but I think you\u2019ll like it...eventually.\u201d</p><p>He was holding something the length of her finger, shaped like a rocket with a flat base. It glistened with lubricant, and now he ran his hand down her thighs to her bottom. He spread her cheeks apart. When his fingers touched her rectum, horrifying realization hit.</p><p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t.\u201d She jerked at the restraints futilely.</p><p>A second later, something slid into her rectum, hard and cold, sending shivers through her at the sheer unfamiliarity of it.</p><p>\u201cTake it out!\u201d she whispered, moving her hips, trying to escape.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She gasped as he plunged a finger into her vagina, moving it against the swollen, sensitive walls. He lowered himself in the grass. His hair brushed her inner thighs, and his hot breath skimmed over her folds.</p><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry the plug this once, Kari, and we\u2019ll talk about it afterward.\u201d He touched the thing again, making it move inside her, and she gritted her teeth at the raw, carnal feeling. His fingers moved and then it started to vibrate inside her, an almost soundless buzz that set unfamiliar nerves to firing. Her hips lifted off the ground as waves of increasing pleasure ran through her from the unfamiliar direction.</p><p>And then his fingers pulled back her folds, opening her farther, exposing her engorged clit. He licked up and over the nub, and she bucked in his grip at the feeling of his hot, wet tongue. She almost climaxed right then.</p><p>He pulled back. \u201cNot yet.\u201d Waited as her body ached for him.</p><p>Finally he lowered his head again. The thing in her vibrated away as his tongue slid and flicked over her clit.</p><p>She panted, shot back into hard arousal.</p><p>When he slid a finger up inside her, she moaned at the exquisite sensation. He added another finger, moving slowly in and out, circling the walls of her vagina. The thickness of his fingers pressed the walls against the anal plug, sending vibrations coursing through all of her, until every nerve between her thighs throbbed intensely.</p><p>Her thighs, her stomach, her whole body tightened as he played with her. She sucked in a sobbing breath. She was close, so close\u2014</p> <p>His tongue moved away from her clit, his fingers stopped. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t have permission to come.\u201d</p><p>She moaned. \u201cPlease, Master.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. When her breathing slowed, he started again, brought her up and up...and stopped.</p><p>Her head rolled back and forth, her hips raised to him. She whined as everything inside her throbbed.</p><p>After a minute, he restarted and ruthlessly teased her until her clit was on the excruciating edge of climax and her need was so great that the world narrowed to each touch of his mouth, his fingers.</p><p>He lifted his head and removed his fingers from inside her.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, please...\u201d Her legs shook as she sobbed for release, her voice rising uncontrollably. \u201cPlease, Master. Oh, please, please, please.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he pushed himself up and, a second later, plunged his cock deep inside her, impaling her so hard that she screamed at the exquisite feeling. Her tissues were so swollen, so sensitive, that each slide of his shaft increased the storm of sensation assailing her. His thick cock pressed against the vibrating thing in her bottom, and her body shuddered.</p><p>The feelings grew overwhelming, and she stiffened, every muscle tightening as she hung on the precipice. Even her breathing stopped.</p><p>\u201cCome now, Kari. Come,\u201d he ordered in a deep voice. His hard fingers pinched her jutting clit, and her world went white. She screamed, screamed again as he thrust in and out of her, her mind in splinters and her vagina convulsing around him.</p><p>An eternity later, she blinked up at him, her body still giving little shudders. His corded arms planted beside her shoulders, and his eyes dark with passion, he waited, unmoving.</p><p>Her legs were still in the air, her arms over her head. \u201cLet me free,\u201d she demanded, her voice husky.</p><p>His lips curved in a smile. \u201cLittle sub, you\u2019re going to regret being so bossy,\u201d he murmured. Ignoring her demand, he pinned her hips with one hard hand so he could pound into her even deeper and harder. The steady rhythm took her past her climax and started building another. As arousal flared in her, she tried to lift her hips to meet his, but his hand held her just where he wanted her. His thumb slid in circles over her clit.</p><p>She whimpered at the building need, at the sensations shooting through her.</p><p>He was merciless, his cock massive. Her hips jerked uncontrollably within his grip; her trembling legs made the chains chime. Each plunge of his shaft, each sweep of his thumb over her sensitive clit sent her further out of control.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d Unable to think, only to feel. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome again, Kari. Come now.\u201d His thumb pressed down as he thrust deeply into her, and she exploded, feeling her blood boiling from her pelvis to her fingertips. Short screams escaped her as she shook like a breaking doll in his grip.</p><p>His fingers tightened, and his cock drove deep, reaching far up inside her. He groaned as his release jerked inside her, making her buck and shiver.</p><p>She roused a minute later. He pulled out, leaving her hollow, and then removed the thing inside her. When he stood and moved away, she shot awake. \u201cMaster!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, sweetheart, I\u2019m right here.\u201d He returned from across the clearing. His hands were gentle as he released her restraints, lowered her legs. She groaned as her joints and muscles protested.</p><p>Lying down beside her on the soft grass, he pulled her into his arms, the embrace so comforting, so welcome, that her breath shuddered. She\u2019d dropped every barrier she had under his hands, his body. He\u2019d seen her at her most vulnerable, and when he held her like this, she felt closer to him than she had to anyone before.</p><p>He tucked her head into the hollow of his shoulder. One arm kept her close while his hand stroked her hair, her arm, her side, and the tenderness of his touch, the care he took with her, made her heart swell.</p><p>After a minute, she remembered where they were. She was naked; her legs had been in the air. Everyone in the whole county had probably heard her screaming her release. Oh, God.</p><p>\u201cNow what was that thought?\u201d he asked. In the wavering light from the fountain, she could see his dark eyes crinkling in a smile.</p><p>\u201cI was...loud.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, deep and satisfied. \u201cYou certainly were. You know, you sound different when you get off.\u201d He kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou normally have a soft voice. Careful and polite.\u201d His finger circled her breast, teased the nipple until it budded. \u201cBut when you climax, your voice is raw. Carnal. Nothing held back.\u201d His pleasure was obvious.</p><p>She groaned and hid her face against his chest. She could never face any of those people again.</p><p>He rubbed his chin on the top of her head and chuckled.</p><p>As she breathed in, his scent surrounded her, mixed with the fragrance of oil on her body and their lovemaking. Sighing, she hitched an arm over his chest and pulled him closer. \u201cI wish we could just lie here and never leave,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She knew the words were a mistake the minute they left her mouth.</p><p>His muscles stiffened, and his arm around her loosened. She closed her eyes as grief hollowed her chest. Withdrawing again? How could he keep doing this to her?</p><p>\u201cKari.\u201d He sat up, pulling her with him. His hand cupped her chin. Even in the dim light, she could see his face had that...that damned cold look again. \u201cDon\u2019t get attached to me. It can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>The lovemaking and then his tender attention had lowered the shield she\u2019d put over her heart, and now his coldness stabbed into her chest. The anger she\u2019d bottled up surged out of control. She slapped his hand away from her face. \u201cCan\u2019t, don\u2019t, mustn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A muscle in his jaw tightened.</p><p>She shoved to her feet and glared down at him.</p><p>\u201cYou big jerk. You tell me there should be honesty between a Dom and his sub. It goes both ways, you know.\u201d Her voice rose to a shout; she couldn\u2019t control it any more than she could her temper. \u201cThere\u2019s more between us than just sex, and you know it. But you\u2019re afraid of me. You\u2019re afraid to live.\u201d</p><p>She unbuckled her ankle cuffs and dropped them onto the ground. He sat silently, watching her with unreadable eyes, his jaw tight. Rage swelled inside her until she choked with it. She fumbled with the wrist cuffs. They came off finally, and she threw them at him, watched them bounce off his unmoving chest.</p> <p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d She choked on the words, pain growing inside her. \u201cI d-deserve more than this. I\u2019m going to find someone who will appreciate me.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Furious, she sliced at him one last time. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re not mourning her anymore; you\u2019re just too scared to move on.\u201d</p><p>Hand over her mouth, trying to keep the sobs inside, she ran from the clearing. Ran until she discovered a fence at the far end of the Gardens. Wrapping her arms around herself, she slumped against the rough wood. Tears slid down her face onto her bare breasts as the angry fire inside of her faded, then died, leaving only ashes behind. She wanted to go home, home where her life was safe and normal, where Prince loved her.</p><p>Finally she took a shuddering breath and shook her head at whining like a child not getting something. Someone.</p> <p>God, how pitiful. She pushed off the fence. Walking through the mist-filled Gardens, she caught glimpses of others, flashes of bare skin, eyes watching her. The whole place had probably heard her yelling. She didn\u2019t care. Didn\u2019t care about this place, this lifestyle, or about him either. Especially not about him. He was so stupid, so dumb, so cowardly, and she...</p><p>Wanted him. Damn him. How had she gotten so...attached...as he called it, despite all his warnings?</p><p>But she had. And he didn\u2019t return the sentiment. Fine. She wanted to spit at the bitter taste in her mouth. Spit at him. She\u2019d find someone who did want her. There must be other clubs in Tampa.</p><p>But the thought of someone else touching her made her\u2014</p><p>\u201cKari.\u201d Dan\u2019s deep voice came from across the secluded glade. He stepped out of the shadows, the moonlight carving shadows across his muscular chest. \u201cYou\u2019re right, sweetheart. I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Growling like an animal, someone slammed into him, knocking him against a tree. Kari heard the thud of his head against the trunk. He dropped, stunned.</p> <p>She started to run to him, then stopped. The attacker was tall. Blond hair glinted in the moonlight. \u201cBuck?\u201d Kari whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou leave her alone, you bastard,\u201d Buck yelled. Straddling Dan, he punched him in the face.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Kari yelled, running across the clearing. She kicked Buck in the back of his head, her bare foot bouncing off his skull.</p><p>He turned. \u201cKari, honey. I heard you yelling. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dan hit him hard, knocking him completely over. And then Dan was on his feet, legs spread, waiting for Buck to stand.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt her,\u201d Buck spat out, his face contorted with hatred. He pushed himself to a kneeling position, fog swirling around his thighs and hands. \u201cI\u2019ll take better care of her than you ever could.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s face tightened. \u201cJust leave, you idiot, while you can.\u201d</p><p>Buck jumped up, holding a heavy branch from the ground. He swung, clubbing Dan\u2019s upper arm.</p> <p>Dan jerked back. Blood oozed, black in the dim light becoming a trickle running down his arm. \u201cHell, you\u2019re persistent.\u201d Dan crouched and moved sideways, staying just out of reach.</p><p>\u201cBuck, stop,\u201d Kari yelled. He ignored her. \u201cRed, red, red!\u201d she screamed at the top of her voice. Oh, God, somebody. Please come.</p><p>Buck jumped at the sound, then turned his head. Dan slapped the club aside and slammed a fist into his face, then punched him in the stomach, folding him over. Bringing his hands up, he caught Buck\u2019s jaw and tossed him backward. The man hit the ground hard.</p><p>Relief flooded Kari. Thank you, thank you, thank you. She released the breath she\u2019d been holding.</p><p>Master Nolan burst into the clearing, skidded to a stop. His glance flickered over Kari, Dan, and then Buck. He shook his head. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you were into m\u00e9nages,\u201d he said in a dry voice.</p><p>Dan snorted. Frowning down at his arm, he shook his head in disgust. \u201cI\u2019m getting slow.\u201d</p><p>Kari had moved to help him when Master Z appeared. He put an arm around her and pulled her against his side. \u201cAre you hurt, little one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d She attempted a laugh. \u201cI even got a kick in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>As Master Nolan tied something around the gash on Dan\u2019s arm\u2014a silk cloth he probably used for restraints\u2014Kari took a step forward, wanting to make sure Sir was all right. She stopped herself. He didn\u2019t want her. She had to remember that.</p><p>Dan rubbed his jaw, glanced at the makeshift bandage. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Nolan nudged Buck with his foot and got a groan. \u201cI\u2019ll even take the garbage out.\u201d</p><p>Master Dan motioned to Kari. \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of here before anything else happens. I\u2019ll find someone to take you home.\u201d</p><p>She considered arguing. Could they maybe talk this out? Then she shrugged. What was the point?</p><p>He put his hand against her lower back, the warmth against her bare skin reminding her she was naked. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Master Z and Nolan came behind them, half dragging the stunned Buck.</p><p>Just before they reached the door of the mansion, Master Z called, \u201cKari, I want to speak to you. Dan, please help Nolan with this idiot.\u201d</p><p>Master Z stepped to one side so Dan could take Buck\u2019s other arm. As the men moved away, Kari joined Z in the shadows.</p><p>Z studied her face. \u201cDid the violence leave you shaken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Not now.\u201d She looked at her hands. Not even a tremble. \u201cI\u2019ve seen fighting. I teach high school, and I swear there\u2019s a brawl or two every lunch period.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNo wonder you kept your head so well.\u201d He turned his head to watch the men. Another DM ran out to help with Buck. \u201cDo you still want Dan?\u201d</p><p>The unexpected question shocked her, and a wave of longing welled up in her, tied her tongue.</p><p>\u201cWell, that emotion is clear enough; you definitely want him.\u201d Smiling, he rubbed his knuckles over her cheek. \u201cHe wants you too, Kari, much as he\u2019d like to deny it. And between your walking away and then Buck wanting you back, his defenses have been shaken. But if he goes home now, he\u2019ll shore them back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d she asked, frowning at Sir\u2019s broad back as he handed Buck over to the other men.</p><p>\u201cKitten, if you run, he\u2019ll chase you. He won\u2019t be able to help himself after fighting another man for you. Once he catches you...\u201d Z sighed and shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t predict how he\u2019ll react at that point.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d catch her. Probably be pretty angry too. She bit her lip. \u201cHe\u2019d never hurt me. Not in anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him well then.\u201d Z tilted his head and waited.</p><p>He might hurt her heart, though. Again. The jerk. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. Who knows, maybe Master Nolan will catch me first.\u201d</p><p>He barked a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a mean streak, little one. Go now while you have a head start.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Having disposed of the asshole, Dan walked back out into the Gardens. He felt strange. Lighter. Probably from pounding on Buck. A fight was a damn good way to unload emotion. He\u2019d enjoyed the hell out of planting his fist in the guy\u2019s gut. God knew he\u2019d needed to punch someone and\u2014his step stalled\u2014and Marion wasn\u2019t around to yell at. Much of that anger he\u2019d expended had been at her.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t angry anymore. How could he be? She\u2019d paid horribly for her mistake. Oddly enough, his guilt had disappeared with the anger. Someday, he\u2019d have to thank Kari.</p><p>But right now, he wanted to take her home. He might feel better, but he still had no intention of getting involved or... He frowned. Z stood alone in the shadows of the trees. \u201cWhere\u2019s Kari?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWent back in.\u201d Z jerked his head at the Gardens.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean she went in? You let her go back in the Gardens?\u201d</p><p>Z shrugged. \u201cShe wanted to play some more. Said maybe Nolan would find her before you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she now?\u201d Nolan walked up behind Dan. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dan growled. \u201cYou take one fucking step farther, and I\u2019ll take you apart.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Nolan\u2019s mouth tipped up, and Dan let out a breath. Hell of a lot of control he was showing. \u201cSorry, Nolan.\u201d</p><p>But hearing that asshole Buck say he\u2019d take better care of her, when Dan had been trying to find her to apologize, and now to have Nolan doing the same...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get her,\u201d he told Z. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll beat her ass for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>Her curved bottom, soft under his hand. Her mouth quivering. Her eyes warming at the sight of him. \u201cI\u2019ll find her,\u201d he repeated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She ran.</p><p>One corner, then another. He was going to be... The word annoyed wasn\u2019t nearly descriptive enough. The thought increased Kari\u2019s speed. Her glow-sticks shone too brightly, beacons in the eerie fog. She whipped around a fountain, circling toward the right. How had she let Master Z goad her into this?</p><p>She shook her head, knowing the answer. Stupid Kari. How many times was she going to let him hurt her?</p><p>At the right corner of the Gardens in a wide clearing, the grass hadn\u2019t yet been cut. The cool strands brushed over the top of her feet. She slowed and dropped to her knees. If she sat on her ankles, only a faint gleam from her ankle bracelet escaped through the higher strands. She tucked her glowing wrist between her legs and scowled when the light lit her pale skin faintly pink. But if he didn\u2019t get too close, he wouldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one in a bad mood after all, and she felt like making him work a little.</p><p>From the right, a man shouted in victory. Kari hunched closer to the ground. A panting fight from another direction ended in a woman\u2019s shriek and a man\u2019s rumbled satisfaction. The minutes passed. Her legs started to cramp.</p><p>Had he given up? Maybe he didn\u2019t even want her, hadn\u2019t even come after her at all.</p><p>Then she saw a thin pink light moving steadily closer, flickering through the intervening bushes.</p><p>She could hear him now, his footsteps even and slow. Stalking her. Her heart started to hammer, her fingers closing around strands of grass. He wouldn\u2019t hurt her; her head knew that, but her body...her body felt like prey and wanted to run.</p><p>Closer. He knew she was hiding for he checked each small clearing. Her area came next. Oh, God. Her nerve broke. She scrambled to her feet and darted away.</p><p>He gave a grunt of satisfaction. Heavy footsteps thudded behind her. Risking a glance back, she saw him, bare chested and heavily muscled with the determined, cruel face of a predator.</p><p>Ignoring caution, she ran faster.</p><p>He closed on her. Out of breath, she stumbled, her heart hammering so loud she couldn\u2019t hear him. His hand closed on her arm, pulling her around. She yanked, and his hand slipped off.</p><p>She sprinted away. Glancing back, she saw he\u2019d disappeared. She slowed.</p><p>He charged her from the side, huge and overpowering, bringing them both down onto the grass. He rolled at the last minute, taking the fall on his back, protecting her with his arms.</p><p>Panting for breath, she fought him instinctively, still covered in enough oil that his grip couldn\u2019t hold her. She kicked at him, and he laughed. His hard hands slid over her breasts, her waist. She slid free and pushed to her feet.</p><p>He grabbed her ankle and yanked her down on top of him. Rolling, he pinned her under him, his weight inescapable.</p><p>She squirmed frantically as he flipped her onto her stomach, sitting on her as he loosened his leathers, applied a condom. She tried to crawl away as his implacable hands hauled her onto her knees, his arm securing her in place.</p><p>Fingers parted her folds, probing, sliding into her, her wetness a stunning betrayal.</p><p>A second later, he rammed into her, burying himself so hard, she cried out in shock. She tried to crawl away from the impaling shaft and from the treacherous pleasure.</p><p>\u201cGod, no, sweetheart. You\u2019re not getting away.\u201d His fingers dug into her hips, holding her immovable as he hammered into her, over and over. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Kari,\u201d he growled. \u201cMy sub. My woman. Mine.\u201d Each word was punctuated by a hard thrust.</p><p>He\u2019d called her his woman? A thrill ran through her. But it wasn\u2019t true. Shaking her head frantically, she tried to pull away.</p><p>With a low snarl, he shoved her knees farther apart and lifted her bottom higher, rendering her more helpless.</p> <p>As she strained against the grip of his big hands, arousal shot through her, every nerve in her body flaming to life. His thick shaft plunged in and out of her sensitive tissues ruthlessly, and she tightened around him, the need becoming unbearable. She keened, unable to stop the sound.</p><p>A ripple started inside her, like a tidal wave, carrying everything before it, intensifying until she convulsed around him, until her whole body shook with the strength of the exquisite spasms, her voice lifting in high cries of bliss.</p><p>And then he buried himself deep, deep inside her and came with a low roar.</p><p>Her arms gave out, and she landed on her forearms, dropping her heavy head in the grass. He still held her hips in the air, breathing in heavy gasps.</p><p>She felt battered inside and out. Taken. Possessed. His words rang in her ears. \u201cMy sub. My woman. Mine.\u201d</p><p>Dan\u2019s words rang in his ears. \u201cMy sub. My woman. Mine.\u201d</p><p>Her body trembled in his grip, her pussy giving intermittent twitches of satisfaction. He\u2019d used her hard, reacting to Buck\u2019s attack and her taunting like the alpha he was. He\u2019d had to possess her, to brand her with his scent, his body, his cum.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t move. His fingers wouldn\u2019t release their grip on her soft hips.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to release her. Ever. No matter how often his mind told him to retreat from her, his emotions and his body kept forcing him back.</p><p>His own expression came back to him. \u201cYour body likes that idea,\u201d he\u2019d told her, trying to teach her to look past her inhibitions. Hadn\u2019t done a hell of a job following his own advice, had he? He\u2019d been too busy looking to the past.</p><p>She\u2019d hit him over the head with the truth, shown him that he was both blind and deaf, and then she\u2019d walked away.</p><p>He\u2019d already been coming after her when the asshole attacked. Dan\u2019s jaw tightened. Should have punched the bastard a few more times, loosened some teeth.</p><p>Then again, maybe he should have thanked him. All-unknowing, the asshole had finished the awakening of Master Dan, the biggest idiot on the planet. But his ears were open now, and his body was telling him that he\u2019d found his mate.</p><p>His heart agreed.</p><p>Beat a man over the head hard enough, and he\u2019ll eventually figure things out.</p><p>Dan leaned forward and pressed a kiss to the nape of his little sub\u2019s neck. Slowly he pulled out of her. The whimper as she was emptied made him smile. He patted her soft ass. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, sweetheart.\u201d He disposed of the condom.</p><p>When he returned, she let him pull her into his arms, all her fight fucked right out of her. That shouldn\u2019t have felt so gratifying. With a sigh, she snuggled close like a milk-fed puppy. Having her there, fitting against him as if she\u2019d been designed for him...his world seemed to jerk and spin and suddenly right itself. Yeah, she was his.</p><p>Now all he had to do was get her to agree to take on a cynical cop with a penchant for kinky sex.</p><p>Piece of cake.</p><p>Kari rubbed her cheek against Sir\u2019s skin, wanting to take his scent with her when she left. And she needed to leave. Now. Before she burrowed farther into his arms. Why had Master Z thought Sir chasing her would make a difference? Why had she even tried? He\u2019d used her and now held her...just like every other time. Had she really thought he\u2019d blurt out some romantic nonsense?</p><p>She had to get out of here. At the thought of standing up and walking away again, she wanted to cry. \u201cLet me go, please.\u201d She pushed away from his body. \u201cI\u2019m going home. I want you to leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d He pulled her closer, his fingers tightening on her hip like a steel trap. \u201cDid you hear me say you\u2019re mine?\u201d</p><p>Just hearing the words tugged at her heart. And yet, in a minute, he\u2019d turn that cold face on her. \u201cJust now?\u201d she said, trying for a polite, indifferent tone.</p><p>\u201cMmmmh, just now when I was buried so deep inside you I never wanted to leave.\u201d</p><p>The rumbling words made her shiver. Still, she knew what came next. She struggled up and braced herself with a forearm across his chest. She\u2019d take the news looking at him, not huddling like a child.</p><p>His hand cupped her cheek. \u201cI meant that, sweetheart. You\u2019re mine.\u201d He smiled slowly, his cheek creasing. \u201cAnd I intend to keep you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep me?\u201d Her heart bounced inside her, choking her words into incoherence.</p><p>His eyes were intent, and she realized he\u2019d been studying her face. A satisfied smile crossed his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I can.\u201d His finger traced her lips, and the look in his eyes was one she hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cYour body says it likes the idea.\u201d</p><p>Keep her? She shoved the hope down. Don\u2019t be silly. He meant he\u2019d see her at the club, use her as a sub. \u201cYou mean here at the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Kari. And everywhere else.\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together. There had to be a catch. \u201cDoes that mean I get to keep you also?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, absolutely.\u201d He kissed her, his lips demanding. \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in equality at all times\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt all times?\u201d She glanced at the cuffs clipped to his leathers. \u201cWhy do I find that hard to believe?\u201d And why the heck was she arguing with him. Mine, mine, mine.</p><p>\u201cAt all times,\u201d he repeated. \u201cHowever, in the bedroom or in the club, I am a lot more equal than you.\u201d His grin flashed white before he rolled her onto her back. Pinning her between his knees, he buckled her cuffs on.</p><p>\u201cJerk,\u201d she said, the joy impossible to contain.</p><p>\u201cThat would be me. But I\u2019m your jerk.\u201d He lifted her hands over her head, trapped them there. Leaning down, he stopped with his mouth an inch away from hers, his breath warm on her face. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this later, but you\u2019re at the club right now. So what do you say to me, little sub?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>She barely managed to whisper, \u201cYes, Sir,\u201d before he took her mouth and kissed any thought of defiance right out of her head.</p><p>THE END </p>  </body></html>"]
