She had a natural talent, a gift from God Almighty, or so her father, Big Daddy Jake Renard, told her when, at the tender age of five and a half, she gutted her first speckled trout with the precision and expertise of a professional. Her father was so proud, he picked her up, put her on his shoulders \u2014 with her little skinny knees on either side of his face \u2014 and carried her down to his favorite watering hole, The Swan. He plopped her down on the bar and gathered his friends around to watch her gut another fish he\u2019d tucked into the back pocket of his worn-out overalls. Milo Mullen was so impressed he offered to buy the child for fifty dollars cash right then and there, and he boasted that he could make three times that amount in one week renting the little girl out to the local fish shacks on the bayou.</p><p>Knowing Milo was only trying to be complimentary, Big Daddy Jake didn\u2019t take offense. Besides, Milo bought him a drink and made a real nice toast to his talented daughter.</p><p>Jake had three children. Remy, the oldest, and John Paul, a year younger, weren\u2019t even teenagers yet, but he could already see they were going to be bigger than he was. The boys were pistols, slipping in and out of mischief every single day, and both as smart as whips. He was proud of his boys, but it was a fact that his little Michelle was the apple of his eye. He never once held it against her that she damned near killed her mama getting herself born. His own sweet Ellie had what the doctors called a massive stroke inside her head right smack in the middle of that final push, and after her daughter was washed and wrapped in clean blankets, Ellie was taken from their marriage bed to the local hospital on the other side of St. Claire. A week later, when it was determined that she was never going to wake up, she was transferred by ambulance to a state institution. The doctor in charge of Ellie\u2019s care called the foul place a nursing home, but Big Daddy, seeing the stark, gray, stone building surrounded by an eight-foot iron fence, knew the doctor was lying to him. It wasn\u2019t a home at all. It was purgatory, plain and simple, a holding area here on earth where all the poor, lost souls did their penance before God welcomed them into heaven.</p> <p>Jake cried the first time he went to see his wife, but he remained dry-eyed after that. Tears wouldn\u2019t make Ellie\u2019s condition any better or the terrible place she rested in any less bleak. The long hallway down the center of the building opened to room after room of seafoam green walls, institutional gray linoleum tile floors, and rickety old beds that squeaked every time the side rails were raised or lowered. Ellie was in a big square room with eleven other patients, some lucid, but most not, and there wasn\u2019t even enough space to pull up a chair next to her bed and sit a spell and talk to her.</p><p>Jake would have felt worse if his wife had known where she was resting, but her brain kept her in a state of perpetual sleep. What she didn\u2019t know couldn\u2019t upset her, he decided, and that fact gave him considerable peace of mind.</p><p>Every Sunday afternoon, once he had gotten out of bed and shaken off his aches and pains, he took Michelle to see her mama. The two of them, hand in hand, would stand at the foot of Ellie\u2019s bed and stare at her for a good ten or fifteen minutes, and then they would leave. Sometimes Michelle would pick a bouquet of wildflowers and tie them with twine and make a pretty bow. She\u2019d leave them on her mama\u2019s pillow so she could smell their sweet fragrance. A couple of times she made a crown of daisies and put them on her mother\u2019s head. Her daddy told her the tiara made Mama look real pretty, like a princess.</p><p>Jake Renard\u2019s luck changed a couple of years later when he won sixty thousand dollars in a private numbers game. Since it wasn\u2019t legal and the government didn\u2019t know about it, Jake didn\u2019t have to pay taxes on his windfall. He considered using the money to move his wife to a more pleasant setting, but somewhere deep down inside his head he could hear Ellie\u2019s voice scolding him for being impractical, wanting to spend the money on something that would do no one any good. And so, instead, Jake decided to use a little of the cash to buy The Swan. He wanted his boys to have a future tending bar when they finished growing up, stopped chasing skirts, and settled down with wives and babies to support. The rest of the money he tucked away for his retirement.</p><p>When Michelle wasn\u2019t in school \u2014 Jake didn\u2019t figure she needed an education, but the state figured she did \u2014 he took her everywhere he went. On fishing days, she sat beside him and passed the time talking like a magpie or reading stories to him out of the books she made him take her to the library to get. While he took his afternoon nap, she set the table and her brothers prepared supper. She was quite the little homemaker. She kept an immaculate house, no small feat given the fact that her father and her brothers were admittedly slovenly. In the summer months she always had fresh flowers in mason jars on the tables.</p> <p>In the evening, Michelle accompanied Big Daddy to The Swan for the late shift. Some nights the little girl fell asleep curled up like a tabby cat in the corner of the bar, and he\u2019d have to carry her to the storage room in back, where he had a daybed set up for her. He treasured every minute he had with his daughter because he figured that, like many of the girls in the parish, she\u2019d be pregnant and married by the time she turned eighteen.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he had low expectations for Michelle, but he was a realist, and all the pretty girls married young around Bowen, Louisiana. It was just the way things were, and Jake didn\u2019t figure his daughter would turn out any different. There wasn\u2019t much for the boys and girls to do in town except diddle with one another, and it was plain inevitable that the girls eventually found themselves in the family way.</p><p>Jake owned a quarter acre of land. He had built a one-bedroom cabin when he married Ellie, and he added on rooms as his family expanded. When the boys were old enough to help, he raised the roof and created a loft so that Michelle could have some privacy. The family lived deep in the swamp at the end of a winding dirt lane called Mercy Road. There were trees everywhere, some as old as a hundred years. In the backyard were two weeping willows nearly covered in moss that hung like crocheted scarves from the branches to the ground. When the mist rolled in from the bayou and the wind picked up and began to moan, the moss took on the eerie appearance of ghosts in the moonlight. On those nights, Michelle would scramble down from the loft and sneak into bed with Remy or John Paul.</p><p>From their house, the neighboring town of St. Claire was a quick twenty-minute walk away. There were treelined paved streets there, but it wasn\u2019t as pretty or as poor as Bowen. Jake\u2019s neighbors were used to poverty. They did the best they could to scratch a living out of the swampland and the water, and they scraped together an extra dollar every Wednesday night to play the numbers in hopes they would catch a windfall the way Jake Renard had.</p><p>Life took another surprising turn for the Renard family when Michelle entered the third grade at the Horatio Hebert Elementary School. She was assigned a brand-new teacher, Miss Jennifer Perine. During the fourth week of school, Miss Perine administered the standardized tests, received the results, and then sent an urgent request home with Michelle for a parent-teacher conference.</p><p>Jake had never gone to one of those before. He figured his daughter had gotten into a spot of trouble, maybe a little fistfight. She could be hot-tempered when pushed to the wall. Her brothers had taught her how to defend herself. She was little for her age, and they assumed she\u2019d be an easy target for the bullies at school to pick on, so they made sure she knew how to fight, and fight dirty.</p> <p>Jake reckoned he\u2019d have to soothe the teacher\u2019s nerves. He put on his good Sunday clothes, added a splash of the Aqua Velva he only used on special occasions, and walked the mile and a half to the school.</p><p>Miss Perine turned out to be a pain in the ass, which Jake expected, but she was also pretty, and he hadn\u2019t expected that at all. He was immediately suspicious. Why would an attractive, young, single woman want to teach in the little gnat of a town of Bowen? With her fine looks and her shapely figure, she could get herself a job anywhere. And how come she wasn\u2019t married yet? She looked to be in her twenties, and in the parish that made her a spinster.</p><p>The teacher assured him she didn\u2019t have any bad news to impart. Quite the contrary. She wanted to tell him what an exceptional child Michelle was. Jake\u2019s back stiffened. He interpreted her remarks to mean that his daughter wasn\u2019t quite right in the head. Everyone in the parish called Buddy Dupond an exceptional child, even after the police hauled him away and locked him up in a loony bin for setting fire to his parents\u2019 house. Buddy didn\u2019t mean any harm, and he wasn\u2019t out to kill anyone. He just had a fascination with fires. He\u2019d set over twelve good ones \u2014 all in the swamp, where the damage didn\u2019t matter. He told his mama that he just plain loved fires. He liked the way they smelled, the way they glowed all orange and yellow and red in the dark, and most of all he liked the snap, crackle, and pop noise they made. Just like the cereal. The doctor who examined Buddy must have thought he was exceptional, all right. He gave him a fancy name. Pyromaniac.</p><p>It turned out that Miss Perine hadn\u2019t meant to insult Jake\u2019s little girl after all, and when he realized that fact, he relaxed. She told him that, after she had received the first set of tests back and read the results, she\u2019d had Michelle tested by experts. Jake didn\u2019t know squat about IQs or how these experts could measure an eight-year-old\u2019s intelligence, but he wasn\u2019t surprised that his Michelle was \u2014 as he proudly told Miss Perine \u2014 as smart as a cookie.</p><p>It was imperative that he do right by the child. She told Jake that Michelle was already reading adult literature and that she was going to be skipping the equivalent of two full grades next Monday. Did he know that Michelle had an aptitude for science and math? Jake summed up all the educated talk to mean that his little girl was a natural-born genius.</p><p>Miss Perine told him that she believed she was a good teacher, but even so, she knew she wasn\u2019t going to be able to keep up with Michelle\u2019s educational needs. She wanted the little girl moved to a private school where her talents could be nurtured and she could set her own learning curve \u2014 whatever in tarnation that meant.</p><p>Jake stood, towering over the teacher as he shook her hand and thanked her for the nice things she had to say about Michelle. However, he added, he wasn\u2019t interested in sending his daughter away. She was just a little girl, after all, and it was too soon for her to leave her family.</p><p>Miss Perine coaxed him to hear her out. She offered him a glass of lemonade and pleaded with him to sit down again. Since she\u2019d gone to the trouble of fixing refreshments \u2014 there was a little plate of cookies on the table too \u2014 he reckoned he had to be polite and listen.</p> <p>The teacher started talking a mile a minute then, telling him all about the advantages his daughter would have with the proper schooling, and surely Jake didn\u2019t want to deprive her of the wonderful opportunities that would open for her. Miss Perine pulled a pink folder from her desk drawer and handed him a slick brochure with pictures so he could see what the school looked like. Michelle would love it there, she promised him. She would study hard, certainly, but there would also be time for fun.</p><p>Jake wanted the best for his daughter, and so he listened to every word Miss Perine had to say. The two of them were getting along just fine, sipping tart lemonade and chewing sweet peanut butter cookies while they chatted amicably about his girl, but damn if she didn\u2019t insult him by suggesting that he could apply for state assistance in paying the tuition, maybe even qualify for a grant he wouldn\u2019t have to pay back. Jake had to remind himself that the woman was new to Bowen and didn\u2019t know any better. Surely she hadn\u2019t meant any harm. Why, she was just trying to be helpful. But because she was new to the parish, she didn\u2019t have any notion how important a man\u2019s pride was in these parts. Take pride away from a man and you might as well run a knife through his heart.</p><p>Jake gritted his teeth as he politely explained he wasn\u2019t about to become a charity case, and he wasn\u2019t going to let anyone else pay for his daughter\u2019s education.</p><p>He was considered by some to be well-off because of his gambling windfall, but she didn\u2019t know anything about that, of course. Folks didn\u2019t talk about their illegal betting games with outsiders. Nevertheless, he still didn\u2019t much care for her making snap judgments about a family based on how they dressed or where they lived. If Jake decided to send his girl to that fancy school, he\u2019d use his retirement nest egg to pay the tuition, and when that money was all used up, then his sons could take on extra jobs to help with expenses.</p><p>But, before any decisions were going to be made, he thought he ought to discuss the matter with his wife. He talked to Ellie all the time, in his head anyway, and he liked to think she appreciated being included and that, in her magical way, she helped guide him with important family decisions.</p><p>He reckoned he ought to talk it out with Michelle too. She deserved to have a say in her future.</p><p>The following Sunday he took her fishing. They sat side by side on the dock with their fishing poles dangling in the murky water. His big knife was nestled in his leather pouch as a precaution against predators.</p><p>\u201cFish aren\u2019t biting, are they?\u201d he remarked while he tried to figure a way to broach the subject of changing schools.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Daddy. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re fishing this time of day. You\u2019re always telling me early morning is the best time to catch fish. How come you wanted to come fishing this late? It\u2019s going on to four already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what time it is, smarty-pants. I wanted to get you away from your brothers and have a talk with you about something . . . important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just spit it out, then?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you sass me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sassing you. Honest.\u201d She crossed her heart with her fingers.</p><p>She was as cute as a button, he thought, staring up at him with those big blue eyes. She needed her bangs trimmed again. They were hanging down, catching on her long lashes. He guessed he\u2019d get the scissors out after supper.</p><p>\u201cThat Miss Perine\u2019s a real nice lady. She\u2019s pretty too.\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him and stared down at the water. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. She smells good, but she doesn\u2019t smile very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeaching is serious work,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why she doesn\u2019t do a lot of smiling. Do you get along with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a real nice visit about you the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted to talk to me about, isn\u2019t it? I just knew it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHush now and hear me out. Miss Perine thinks you\u2019re an exceptional child.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t set fires, Daddy. Honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t,\u201d he replied. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re exceptional like Buddy Dupond. She means you\u2019re real smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p> <p>She turned away again. He gave her a little nudge to get her to look up at him. \u201cHow come you don\u2019t like her? Is she making you work too hard? Is she putting too many demands on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the work too hard for you to do?\u201d</p><p>She giggled as though he\u2019d just made a joke. \u201cOh, no. It\u2019s awful easy, and sometimes I get bored because I get it all done too soon, and I have to sit there and wait until Miss Perine can find something else for me to do. Some of the kids are just now learning how to read, but I\u2019ve been reading since I was little. Remember?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI remember when you started in reading the paper to me while I shaved. You pretty much taught yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. You taught me the letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you put them together pretty much on your own. All I did was read to you. You picked it up quick. Took to it like a duck . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo water,\u201d she ended.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, sugar. Tell me why you don\u2019t like Miss Perine. Is it because you have to wait on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe wants to send me away,\u201d she blurted. Tears flooded her eyes, and her voice trembled. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she, Daddy? She told me she wants to make you send me away to a different school where I won\u2019t know anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, you ought to know nobody\u2019s gonna make your daddy do anything he doesn\u2019t want to do, but this Miss Perine . . . well, now, she got me started in thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a busybody. Don\u2019t you pay her any mind.\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head. His little girl had just turned one of his favorite sayings back on him. When her brothers teased her, he always told her not to pay them any mind.</p><p>\u201cYour teacher says you\u2019ve got a real high IQ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything wrong with being smart, but Miss Perine thinks we ought to figure a way to get you the best education we can. She thinks you can make something of yourself. I never considered it before, but I guess it isn\u2019t written in stone that you\u2019ve got to get married and have babies lickety-split. Maybe this family has been setting our sights too low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, Daddy.\u201d</p> <p>He knew from her tone of voice that she was attempting to placate him.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want anything to change,\u201d she added then.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know your mama would want us to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Mama smart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my, yes. She sure is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got married and had babies lickety-split.\u201d</p><p>Lord, his girl was bright, all right. And how come it took a brand-new teacher to make him realize it?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I came along and swept her off her feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause you were irresistible. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you ought to have a talk with Mama before you make up your mind about sending me away. She might know what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>He was so shocked by what she\u2019d just said, he jerked. \u201cYou know I like to talk things over with your mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you know?\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him, her eyes shining. \u201c\u2019Cause sometimes you talk out loud. It\u2019s okay, Daddy. I like to talk things over with Mama too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Tomorrow, when we go visit your mama, we\u2019ll both talk this over with her.\u201d</p><p>She started splashing her feet in the water. \u201cI think she\u2019s gonna tell me I should stay home with you and Remy and John Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, listen here \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, tell me how you and Mama met. I know you\u2019ve told me the story hundreds of times, but I never get tired of hearing it.\u201d</p><p>They had veered off the subject, and he knew his daughter had done it on purpose. \u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about your mama and me now. We\u2019re talking about you. I want to ask you an important question. Put your fishing pole down and pay attention.\u201d</p><p>She did as he said and waited with her hands folded in her lap. She was such a little lady, he thought to himself, and how in thunder had that happened living with three lumbering mules?</p><p>\u201cIf you could be anything in the world, anything at all, what do you suppose you\u2019d be?\u201d She was making a church steeple with her fingers. He tugged on her ponytail to get her attention. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be embarrassed with your daddy. You can tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair\u2019s getting red and so are your freckles.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cMy hair\u2019s already red, and my freckles can\u2019t change color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna tell me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise not to laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy and John Paul would maybe laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brothers are idiots. They laugh at just about anything, but you know they love you and they\u2019ll work hard to see you get what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna tell me or not? It sounds like you\u2019ve already got some ideas about what you\u2019d like to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know,\u201d she admitted. She looked him right in the eyes to make sure he wasn\u2019t going to laugh and then whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going to be a doctor.\u201d</p><p>He hid his surprise and didn\u2019t say a word for a long minute while he chewed the notion over in his mind.</p><p>\u201cNow, why do you suppose you want to be a doctor?\u201d he asked, already warming to the idea.</p><p>\u201cBecause then maybe I could fix . . . something. I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a long time, ever since I was little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still little,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd doctors fix people, not things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Daddy,\u201d she said with such authority in her voice she made him smile.</p><p>\u201cYou got someone in mind you want to fix?\u201d</p><p>Big Daddy put his arm around his daughter\u2019s shoulders and hauled her into his side. He already knew the answer, but he wanted to hear her say the words.</p><p>She brushed her bangs out of her eyes and slowly nodded. \u201cI was thinking maybe I could fix Mama\u2019s head. Then she could come home.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>PRESENT DAY, NEW ORLEANS</p><p>The first one was a mercy killing.</p><p>She was dying a very, very slow death. Each day there was a new indignity, another inch of her once magnificent body destroyed by the debilitating disease. Poor, poor Catherine. Seven years ago she had been a beautiful bride with a trim, hourglass figure men lusted after and women envied, but now her body was fat and grossly bloated, and her once perfect alabaster skin was blotchy and sallow.</p><p>There were times when her husband, John, didn\u2019t recognize her anymore. He would remember what she used to look like and then see with startling clarity what she had become. Those wonderful sparkling green eyes that had so captivated him when he\u2019d first met her were now glazed and milky from too many painkillers.</p><p>The monster was taking its time killing her, and for him there wasn\u2019t a moment\u2019s respite.</p><p>He dreaded going home at night. He always stopped on Royal Street to purchase a two-pound box of Godiva chocolates first. It was a ritual he had started months ago to prove to her that he still loved her in spite of her appearance. He could have had the chocolates delivered daily to the house, of course, but the errand stretched out the time before he had to face her again. The next morning the almost empty gold box would be in the porcelain trash can next to the king-size canopy bed. He would pretend not to notice she\u2019d gorged herself on the sweets, and so would she.</p><p>John no longer condemned her for her gluttony. The chocolates gave her pleasure, he supposed, and there was precious little of that in her bleak, tragic existence these days.</p><p>Some nights, after purchasing the chocolates, he would return to his office and work until fatigue overcame him and he\u2019d be forced to go home. As he maneuvered his BMW convertible up St. Charles to the Garden District of New Orleans, he\u2019d inevitably start shaking as if he were suffering from hypothermia, but he wouldn\u2019t actually become physically ill until he entered the black-and-white foyer of his house. Gripping the box of chocolates in his hand, he\u2019d place his Gucci briefcase on the hall table and stand there in front of the gilded mirror for a minute or two taking deep, calming breaths. They never soothed him, but he repeated the habit anyway night after night. His harsh breathing would mingle with the ticking of the grandfather clock on the wall adjacent to the mirror. The tick-tick-tick would remind him of the timer on a bomb. A bomb that was inside his head and about to explode.</p><p>Calling himself a coward, he would make himself go upstairs. His shoulders would tense and his stomach would twist into knots as he slowly climbed the circular staircase, his legs feeling as though they were encased in cement socks. By the time he reached the end of the long hallway, perspiration would dot his brow and he would feel cold and clammy.</p><p>He\u2019d wipe his forehead with his handkerchief, plaster a phony smile on his face, and open the door, trying with all his might to mentally brace himself for the foul stench hanging in the air. The room smelled of iron pills, and the thick vanilla-scented air freshener the maids insisted on spraying into the stagnant air only made the stench worse. Some nights it was so bad, he had to hurry out of the room on a false errand before she heard him gag. He would go to any length to keep her from knowing how repulsed he was.</p><p>Other nights his stomach could handle it. He\u2019d close his eyes while he leaned down and kissed her forehead, then he\u2019d move away while he talked to her. He\u2019d stand by the treadmill he\u2019d bought for her a year after they were married. He couldn\u2019t remember if she had ever turned it on. A stethoscope and two identical, voluminous, floral silk bathrobes hung on its handlebars now, and its wide black vinyl belt wore a coat of dust. The maids never seemed to remember to clean it. Sometimes, when he couldn\u2019t bear to look at Catherine, he\u2019d turn and stare out the arched Palladian windows at the softly lit English garden behind the house, enclosed like all the other minuscule yards with a black wrought-iron fence.</p><p>The television would be blaring behind him. It was on twenty-four hours a day, turned to either the talk shows or the shopping network. She never thought to turn it down when he was talking to her, and he\u2019d gotten to the point where he could ignore it. Although he\u2019d learned to block the incessant chatter, he often found himself marveling over the deterioration of her brain. How could she watch such drivel hour after hour after hour? There had been a time, before the illness took over her life and her personality, when she had been an intellectual who could cut any adversary to the quick with one of her incredibly clever whiplash retorts. He remembered how she loved to debate politics \u2014 put a right-wing conservative at her impeccably appointed dinner table and there were guaranteed fireworks \u2014 but now all she wanted to talk about and worry about were her bowel functions. That \u2014 and food, of course. She was always eager to talk about her next meal.</p><p>He often thought back seven years to their wedding day and remembered how desperately he had wanted her. These days, he dreaded being in the same room with her \u2014 he slept in the guest quarters now \u2014 and the torment was like acid in his stomach, eating him alive.</p><p>Before she had taken to her bed out of necessity, she\u2019d had the spacious suite decorated in pale green tones. The furniture was oversized Italian Renaissance, and there were statues of two favored Roman poets \u2014 Ovid and Virgil. The plaster busts squatted on white pedestals flanking the bay window. He had actually liked the room when the clever young interior designer had finished it, so much so that he\u2019d hired her to redecorate his office, but now he despised the bedroom because it represented what was now missing in his life.</p><p>As much as he tried, he couldn\u2019t escape the constant reminders. A couple of weeks ago he\u2019d met one of his partners at a trendy new bistro on Bienville for lunch, but as soon as he walked inside and saw the pale green walls, his stomach lurched and he had trouble catching his breath. For a few terror-filled minutes he was certain he was having a heart attack. He should have called 911 for help, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, he ran outside into the sunlight, taking deep, gasping breaths. The sun on his face helped, and he realized then that he was in the throes of a full-blown anxiety attack.</p><p>At times he was certain he was losing his mind.</p><p>Thank God for the support of his three closest friends. He met them for drinks every Friday afternoon to unwind, and how he lived for Fridays when he could unburden himself. They would listen and offer him solace and compassion.</p><p>What an ironic twist, that he should be the one out drinking with his buddies, while Catherine was the one wasting away in solitude. If the Fates were going to punish one of them for past sins, why her and not him? Catherine had always been the upstanding, morally superior one in the marriage. She had never broken a law in her life, had never even gotten a parking ticket, and she would have been stunned if she\u2019d known all that John and his friends had done.</p><p>They called themselves the Sowing Club. Cameron, at thirty-four, was the oldest in the group. Dallas and John were both thirty-three, and Preston, whom they had nicknamed Pretty Boy because of his dark good looks, was the youngest at thirty-two. The four friends had gone to the same private school, and though they were in different classes, they had been drawn to each other because they had so much in common. They shared the same drive, the same goals, the same ambition. They also shared the same expensive tastes, and they didn\u2019t mind breaking the law to get what they wanted. They started down the criminal path in high school when they found out how easy it was to get away with petty larceny. They also discovered it wasn\u2019t very lucrative. On a lark, they committed their first felony when they were in college \u2014 robbery of a jewelry store in a nearby town \u2014 and they fenced the precious gems like pros. Then John, the most analytical in the group, decided the risks were too great for the return they were getting \u2014 even the best-laid plans could go wrong because of the elements of chance and surprise \u2014 and so they began committing more sophisticated white-collar crimes, using their education to foster connections. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their first real windfall came from the Internet. Using their sleek laptops, they purchased worthless stocks under an alias, flooded the chat rooms with false data and rumors, and then, after the stocks had skyrocketed, sold their shares before the security regulators discovered what was going on. The return on that little venture was over five thousand percent.</p><p>Every dollar they extorted or stole was put in the Sowing Club account in the Cayman Islands. By the time the four of them had finished graduate school and taken positions in New Orleans, they had collected over four million dollars.</p><p>And that only whetted their appetites.</p><p>During one of their gatherings, Cameron told the others that if a psychiatrist ever examined them, he would discover that they were all sociopaths. John disagreed. A sociopath didn\u2019t consider anyone else\u2019s needs or desires. They, on the contrary, were committed to the club and to the pact that they had made to do whatever they had to do to get what they wanted. Their goal was eighty million dollars by the time the oldest turned forty. When Cameron celebrated his thirtieth birthday, they were already halfway there.</p> <p>Nothing could stop them. Over the years, the bond between the friends had strengthened, and they would do anything, anything at all, to protect the others.</p><p>While each of them brought his own special talents to the club, Cameron and Preston and Dallas knew that John was the mastermind, and that without him they would never have gotten this far. They couldn\u2019t afford to lose him, and they became increasingly alarmed over his deteriorating state of mind.</p><p>John was in trouble, but they didn\u2019t know how to help. And so they simply listened as he poured his heart out. The topic of his beloved wife would inevitably come up, and John would fill them in on the latest horrific developments. None of them had seen Catherine in years because of the illness. That was her choice, not theirs, for she wanted them to remember her the way she had been, not the way she was now. They sent gifts and cards, of course. John was like a brother to them, and while they were genuinely sympathetic about his wife\u2019s condition, they were much more concerned about him. In their collective opinion, she was, after all, a lost cause. He wasn\u2019t. And they could see what he couldn\u2019t, that he was headed for disaster. They knew he was having trouble concentrating while at work \u2014 a dangerous tendency given his occupation \u2014 and he was also drinking too much.</p><p>John was getting roaring drunk now. Preston had invited him and the others over to his new penthouse apartment to celebrate the success of their latest venture. They sat at the dining room table in plush upholstered chairs, surrounded by a panoramic view of the Mississippi. It was late, almost midnight, and they could see the lights twinkling outside in the inky darkness. Every few minutes the sound of a foghorn would hum mournfully in the background.</p><p>The noise made John melancholy. \u201cHow long have we been friends?\u201d He slurred the question. \u201cDoes anybody remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout a million years,\u201d Cameron said as he reached for the bottle of Chivas.</p><p>Dallas snorted with laughter. \u201cMan, it seems that long, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince high school,\u201d Preston said, \u201cwhen we started the Sowing Club.\u201d He turned to John. \u201cYou used to intimidate the hell out of me. You were always so smooth and self-assured. You were more polished than the teachers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you think of me?\u201d Cameron wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cNervous,\u201d Preston answered. \u201cYou were always . . . edgy. You know what I mean? You still are,\u201d he added.</p><p>Dallas nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been the cautious one in the group.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe worrier,\u201d Preston said. \u201cWhereas Dallas and I have always been more . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaring,\u201d Dallas suggested. \u201cI never would have been friends with any of you guys if John hadn\u2019t brought us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw what you didn\u2019t,\u201d John said then. \u201cTalent and greed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, here,\u201d Cameron said as he raised his glass in a mock salute to the others.</p><p>\u201cI think I was just sixteen when we started the Sowing Club,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>\u201cYou were still a virgin, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, no. I lost my virginity by the time I was nine.\u201d</p><p>The exaggeration made them laugh. \u201cOkay, so maybe I was a little older,\u201d Dallas said.</p> <p>\u201cGod, we were cocky little shits back then, weren\u2019t we? Thinking we were so clever with our secret club,\u201d Preston said.</p><p>\u201cWe were clever,\u201d Cameron pointed out. \u201cAnd lucky. Do you realize the stupid risks we took?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever we wanted to get drunk, we\u2019d call for a meeting of the club,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky we haven\u2019t turned into alcoholics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says we haven\u2019t?\u201d Cameron asked, and then laughed again.</p><p>John held up his glass. \u201cA toast to the club and to the tidy profit we just made, thanks to Preston\u2019s oh-so-sweet insider information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, here,\u201d Cameron said as he clinked his glass against the others. \u201cI still can\u2019t figure out how you got that information, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think I got it?\u201d Preston asked. \u201cI got her drunk, fu**ed her brains out, and after she passed out, I went through her computer files. All in a night\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou boinked her?\u201d Cameron howled.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Boinked\u2019? Who uses that word these days?\u201d Preston asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to know how you got it up. I\u2019ve seen the woman. She\u2019s a pig,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>\u201cHey, I did what I had to do. I just kept thinking about the eight hundred thousand we\u2019d make, and I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cI closed my eyes, okay? I don\u2019t think I can do it again, though. One of you guys will have to take over. It pretty much . . . sucked,\u201d he admitted with a grin over his pun.</p><p>Cameron emptied his glass and reached for the bottle. \u201cWell, too bad. You\u2019re stuck with the job as long as the women go crazy over those bulging muscles and that movie-star face of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn five more years we\u2019ll all be set for life. We can walk away, disappear if we have to, do whatever we want. Don\u2019t lose sight of the goal,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>John shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can hold on five more years. I know I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019ve got to keep it together,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got too much to lose if you fall apart on us now. You hear me? You\u2019re the brains of this outfit. We\u2019re just . . .\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t come up with the right word. Preston suggested, \u201cCoconspirators?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are that,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve all done our part. John\u2019s not the only one with brains. I\u2019m the one who brought Monk in, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, this isn\u2019t the time for an ego tantrum,\u201d Preston muttered. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell us how much you do, Dallas. We all know how hard you work. As a matter of fact, that\u2019s all you do. You\u2019ve got nothing outside of your job and the Sowing Club. When\u2019s the last time you took a day off or went shopping? I\u2019m guessing never. You wear the same black or navy suit every day. You\u2019re still taking a brown bag for lunch \u2014 and I\u2019ll bet you even take the bag home to use again the next day. For that matter, when have you ever picked up a tab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m a cheapskate?\u201d Dallas countered.</p><p>Before Preston could answer, Cameron interrupted. \u201cKnock it off, you two. It doesn\u2019t matter which one of us is the smartest or works the hardest. We\u2019re all culpable. Do you know how many years we\u2019d get if anyone ever found out what we\u2019ve done?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to find out anything.\u201d John was angry now. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t know where to look. I made sure of that. There aren\u2019t any records except on my home computer disks, and no one\u2019s ever going to have access to those. There aren\u2019t any other records, no phone calls, no paper trail. Even if the police or the SEC gets curious, they wouldn\u2019t find a shred of evidence to pin on us. We\u2019re clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonk could lead the police to us.\u201d Cameron had never trusted the courier, or \u201chired help\u201d as John called him, but they needed someone reliable, an implementor, and Monk fit the bill. He was every bit as greedy and corrupt as they were and had everything to lose if he didn\u2019t do what they wanted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worked for us long enough for you to start trusting him, Cameron,\u201d Preston said. \u201cBesides, if he goes to the police, he\u2019ll take a much harder fall than we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right,\u201d John muttered. \u201cLook, I know we said that we\u2019d keep going until Cameron turned forty, but I\u2019m telling you I can\u2019t last that long. Some days I think my mind . . . oh, hell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He got out of his chair and crossed to the window, his hands clasped behind his back as he stared at the lights. \u201cDid I ever tell you guys how Catherine and I met? It was at the Contemporary Arts Center. We both wanted to buy the same painting, and somehow, during our heated argument, I fell in love. Man, the sparks between us . . . it was something to see. All these years later, and that spark\u2019s still there. Now she\u2019s dying and I can\u2019t do a damned thing to stop it.\u201d</p><p>Cameron glanced at Preston and Dallas, who both nodded, and then said, \u201cWe know how much you love Catherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make her a saint, John. She isn\u2019t perfect,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>\u201cJeez, that was cold,\u201d Preston muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know Catherine isn\u2019t perfect. She has her quirks, just like we do. Who isn\u2019t a little compulsive about something?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that she worries about being without, and so she has to have two of everything. She has two television sets, identical ones, sitting side by side on the table by her bed. She has one of them on day and night, but she worries it might break, so she makes sure she has a backup. She does the same thing when she\u2019s ordering something from a store or a catalog. Always buys two, but what\u2019s the harm in that?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe isn\u2019t hurting anyone, and she has so little joy these days. She puts up with me because she loves me.\u201d Bowing his head he whispered, \u201cShe\u2019s my entire life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we know,\u201d Cameron agreed. \u201cBut we\u2019re concerned about you.\u201d</p><p>John whirled around to confront them. His face was twisted with anger. \u201cHell, you\u2019re worried about yourselves. You think I\u2019ll do something to screw it all up, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thought crossed our minds,\u201d Cameron admitted.</p><p>\u201cJohn, we can\u2019t afford for you to go crazy on us,\u201d Preston said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to go crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cHere\u2019s the way we\u2019re gonna play it.</p><p>John will tell us if he needs help. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>John nodded. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>His friends let the subject drop and spent the rest of the evening plotting their next project.</p><p>They continued to meet on Friday afternoons, but they kept silent about John\u2019s mounting depression. None of them knew what could be done about it, anyway.</p><p>Three months passed without a mention of Catherine. Then John broke down. He couldn\u2019t bear to watch Catherine suffer anymore, and he told them he was worried about money all the time now, which he thought was ludicrous given the fact that they had millions tucked away in the Sowing Club account. Millions they couldn\u2019t touch for five more years. He told them that insurance covered a pittance of the treatment Catherine needed, but not nearly enough, and if his wife continued to linger, her trust would eventually be gone and he would be financially ruined. Unless, of course, the others agreed to let him dip into the Sowing Club account.</p><p>Cameron protested. \u201cYou all know how I\u2019m hurting for money, what with my divorce pending and all, but if we make a withdrawal now, without closing out the whole account, we could create a paper trail, and the IRS \u2014\u201d</p><p>John cut him off. \u201cI know. It\u2019s too risky. Look, I shouldn\u2019t have brought it up. I\u2019ll figure out something,\u201d he said.</p><p>The following Friday afternoon, they met at their favorite bar, Dooley\u2019s. While it thundered and poured outside, and Jimmy Buffett sang about Margaritaville over the speakers, John leaned across the table and whispered his dark wish aloud.</p><p>He wanted to kill himself and end the torment.</p><p>His friends were appalled and outraged. They admonished him for even thinking such crazy thoughts, but it didn\u2019t take them long to see that their rebukes were not helping. On the contrary, they realized they were adding to his misery and his depression. Their harsh words quickly turned into solicitous ones. What could they do to help him?</p><p>Surely there was something.</p><p>They continued to talk, huddled around a table in the corner of the bar, putting their heads together to come up with a viable solution to their friend\u2019s untenable situation. Later, near midnight, after hours and hours of discussion, one of them was bold enough to suggest what all of them were thinking. The poor woman was already under a death sentence. If anyone should die, it should be his pathetic, long-suffering wife.</p><p>If only.</p><p>Later none of them would be able to remember who had voiced the proposal to kill her.</p><p>For the next three Friday afternoons, they discussed the possibility, but once the debate had ended and the vote had been taken, there was no going back. The decision, when it was finally made, was unanimous. There were no second thoughts, no nagging doubts on the part of any of the members of the club.</p><p>It was as absolute as dried blood on white carpet.</p><p>They didn\u2019t consider themselves monsters or admit that what they were doing was motivated by greed. No, they were simply white-collar overachievers who worked hard and played harder. They were risk-takers, feared by outsiders because of the power they wielded. They were known as real ball breakers \u2014 a term they considered flattery. Yet, despite their arrogance and their audacity, none of them had the courage to call the plan what it really was \u2014 murder \u2014 and so they referred to it as \u201cthe event.\u201d</p><p>They did have balls of steel, considering that Dooley\u2019s was located just half a block away from the Eighth District station of the New Orleans Police Department. While they planned the felony, they were surrounded by detectives and policemen. A couple of Federal Bureau agents assigned to PID occasionally stopped by as well, as did the up-and-coming attorneys hoping to foster connections. The police and the courthouse lawyers considered Dooley\u2019s their personal watering hole, but then, so did the overworked and underappreciated interns and residents from both Charity Hospital and LSU. The groups rarely mingled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Sowing Club didn\u2019t take sides. They sat in the corner. Everyone knew who they were, though, and until the serious drinking got under way, they were constantly interrupted by greetings from coworkers and ass-kissers.</p><p>Oh, yes, they had gall and nerve, for in the midst of New Orleans\u2019s finest, they calmly talked about the mercy killing.</p><p>The discussion would never have gotten this far if they hadn\u2019t already had the connection they needed. Monk had killed for money, and he certainly wouldn\u2019t have any qualms about killing again. Dallas was the first to see the potential and to take advantage by saving Monk from the judicial system. Monk understood the debt he would have to repay. He promised Dallas that he would do anything, anything at all, as long as the risks were manageable and the price was right. Sentiment aside, their killer was, above all else, a businessman.</p><p>They all met to discuss the terms at one of Monk\u2019s favorite hangouts, Frankies, which was a dilapidated gray shack just off Interstate 10 on the other side of Metairie. The bar smelled of tobacco, peanut shells that customers discarded on the warped floorboards, and spoiled fish. Monk swore that Frankie\u2019s had the best fried shrimp in the south.</p> <p>He was late and made no apology for his tardiness. He took his seat, folded his hands on the tabletop, and immediately outlined his conditions before accepting their money. Monk was an educated man, which was one of the main reasons Dallas had saved him from a lethal injection. They wanted a smart man, and he fit the bill. He was also quite distinguished looking, very refined and shockingly polished considering he was a professional criminal. Until he was arrested for murder, Monk\u2019s sheet had been clean. After he and Dallas had struck the deal, he did a little bragging about his extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which included arson, blackmail, extortion, and murder. The police didn\u2019t know about his background, of course, but they had enough evidence to convict on the murder \u2014 evidence that was deliberately misplaced.</p><p>The very first time the others met Monk was at Dallas\u2019s apartment, and he made an indelible impression upon them. They had expected to meet a thug, but instead they met a man they could almost imagine as one of them, a professional with high standards \u2014 until they looked closely into his eyes. They were as cold and as lifeless as an eel\u2019s. If it was true that the eyes were mirrors to the soul, then Monk had already given his to the devil.</p><p>After ordering a beer, he leaned back in the captain\u2019s chair and calmly demanded double the price Dallas had offered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u201d Preston said. \u201cThat\u2019s extortion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s murder,\u201d Monk countered. \u201cBigger risk means bigger money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t . . . murder,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cThis is a special case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so special about it?\u201d Monk asked. \u201cYou want me to kill John\u2019s wife, don\u2019t you? Or was I mistaken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what, Cameron? Does it bother you that I\u2019m being blunt? I could use another word for murder if you want, but that won\u2019t change what you\u2019re hiring me to do.\u201d He shrugged and then said, \u201cI want more money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already made you a very rich man,\u201d John pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, you have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, as**ole, we agreed on a price,\u201d Preston shouted, then looked over his shoulder to see if anyone had heard.</p><p>\u201cYes, we did,\u201d Monk replied. He seemed totally unaffected by the burst of anger. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t explain what you wanted done, did you? Imagine my surprise when I talked to Dallas and found out the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Dallas tell you?\u201d Cameron wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThat there was a problem you all wanted eliminated. Now that I know what the problem is, I\u2019m doubling the price. I think that\u2019s quite reasonable. The risk is more substantial.\u201d</p><p>Silence followed the statement. Then Cameron said, \u201cI\u2019m tapped out. Where are we going to come up with the rest of the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my problem, not yours,\u201d John said. He turned to Monk then. \u201cI\u2019ll even throw in an additional ten thousand if you\u2019ll agree to wait until after the will is read to get paid.\u201d</p><p>Monk tilted his head. \u201cAn extra ten thousand. Sure, I\u2019ll wait. I know where to find you. Now give me the details. I know who you want killed, so why don\u2019t you tell me when, where, and how much you want her to suffer.\u201d</p><p>John was shaken. He cleared his throat, gulped down half a glass of beer, and whispered, \u201cOh, God, no. I don\u2019t want her to suffer. She\u2019s been suffering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s terminally ill,\u201d Cameron explained.</p><p>John nodded. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any hope for her. I can\u2019t stand to see her in so much pain. It\u2019s . . . constant, never ending. I . . .\u201d He was too emotionally distraught to continue.</p><p>Cameron quickly took over. \u201cWhen John started talking crazy about killing himself, we knew we had to do something to help.\u201d</p><p>Monk motioned him to be quiet as the waitress walked toward them. She placed another round of beers on the table and told them she\u2019d be back in a minute to take their dinner orders.</p><p>As soon as she walked away, Monk said, \u201cLook, John. I didn\u2019t realize your wife was sick. I guess I sounded a little cold. Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry enough to cut your price down?\u201d Preston asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not that sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to do it, or what?\u201d John asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s intriguing,\u201d Monk said. \u201cI would actually be doing a good deed, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He asked for the particulars about the wife\u2019s unfortunate condition and also wanted to know about the living situation inside the house. As John was answering his questions, Monk leaned forward and spread his hands in front of him. His fingernails were perfectly manicured, the pads smooth, callus free. He stared straight ahead, seemingly lost in thought, as if he were constructing the details of the job in his head.</p><p>After John finished describing the floor plan, the alarm system, and the maids\u2019 daily routine, he tensely waited for more questions.</p><p>\u201cSo, the maid goes home each night. What about the housekeeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosa . . . Rosa Vincetti is her name,\u201d John said. \u201cShe stays until ten every night, except for Mondays, when I\u2019m usually home so she can leave by six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny friends or relatives I need to be concerned about?\u201d</p><p>John shook his head. \u201cCatherine cut her friends off years ago. She doesn\u2019t like visitors. She\u2019s embarrassed about her . . . condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about relatives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one uncle and a couple of cousins, but she\u2019s all but severed ties with them. Says they\u2019re white trash. The uncle calls once a month. She tries to be polite, but she doesn\u2019t stay on the phone long. It tires her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this uncle ever stop by uninvited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She hasn\u2019t seen him in years. You don\u2019t have to worry about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t,\u201d Monk said smoothly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to suffer . . . I mean, when you actually . . . is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Monk said. \u201cI have a compassionate nature. I\u2019m not a monster. Believe it or not, I have strong values and unbendable ethics,\u201d he boasted, and none of the four men dared laugh at the contradiction. A hired killer with ethics? Insane, yes, yet they all sagely nodded agreement. If Monk had told them he could walk on water, they would have pretended to believe him.</p><p>When Monk finished discussing his virtues and got down to the business at hand, he told John he didn\u2019t believe in cruel or unnecessary pain, and even though he\u2019d promised that there would be little suffering during \u201cthe event,\u201d he suggested, just as a precaution, that John increase the amount of painkillers his wife took before bed. Nothing else was to change. John was to set the alarm as he did every night before retiring, and then he was to go to his room and stay there. Monk guaranteed, with an assurance they all found obscenely comforting, that she would be dead by morning.</p><p>He was a man of his word. He killed her during the night. How he had gotten inside the house and out again without setting off the alarm was beyond John\u2019s comprehension. There were audio and motion detectors inside and video cameras surveying the outside, but the ethereal Monk had entered the premises without being seen or heard, and had quickly and efficiently dispatched the long-suffering woman into oblivion.</p><p>To prove that he had been there, he placed a rose on the pillow next to her, just as he had told John he would do, to erase any doubt as to who should receive credit and final payment for the kill. John removed the rose before he called for help.</p><p>John agreed to an autopsy so there wouldn\u2019t be any questions raised later. The pathology report indicated she had choked to death on chocolates. A clump of chocolate-covered caramel the size of a jaw-breaker was found lodged in her esophagus. There were bruises around her neck, but it was assumed that they were self-inflicted as she attempted to dislodge the obstacle while she was suffocating. The death was ruled accidental; the file was officially closed, and the body was released for burial.</p><p>Because of her considerable bulk, it would have taken at least eight strong pallbearers to carry her coffin, which the funeral director delicately explained would have to be specially built. With a rather embarrassed and certainly pained expression, he told the widower in so many words that it simply wouldn\u2019t be possible to squeeze all of the deceased into one of their ready-made, polished mahogany, satin-lined coffins. He suggested that it would be more prudent to cremate the body, and the husband readily agreed.</p><p>The service was a private affair attended by a handful of John\u2019s relatives and a few close friends. Cameron came, but Preston and Dallas begged off. Catherine\u2019s housekeeper was there, and John could hear Rosa\u2019s wailing as he left the church. He saw her in the vestibule, clutching her rosary beads and glaring at him with her damn-you-to-hell-for-your-sins stare. John dismissed the nearly hysterical woman without a backward glance.</p><p>Two mourners from Catherine\u2019s side of the family also came, but they walked behind the others as the pitifully small group marched in procession toward the mausoleum. John kept glancing over his shoulder at the man and woman. He had the distinct feeling they were staring at him, but when he realized how nervous they were making him, he turned his back on them and bowed his head.</p><p>The heavens wept for Catherine and sang her eulogy. While the minister prayed over her, lightning cracked and snapped, and thunder bellowed. The torrential downpour didn\u2019t let up until the ash-filled urn was locked inside the vault.</p><p>Catherine was finally at peace, and her husband\u2019s torment was over. His friends expected him to grieve but at the same time feel relief that his wife wasn\u2019t suffering any longer. He had loved the woman with all his heart, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Despite others urging him to take some time off, the widower went back to work the day after the funeral. He insisted he needed to keep busy in order to take his mind off his anguish.</p><p>It was a bright, blue, cloudless day as he drove down St. Charles toward his office. The sun warmed his shoulders. The scent of honeysuckle hung heavily in the humid air. His favorite Mellencamp CD, Hurts So Good, blared through the speakers.</p><p>He pulled into his usual spot in the parking garage and took the elevator up to his suite of offices. When he opened the door bearing his name, his secretary hurried forward to offer her heartfelt condolences. He remarked to her that his wife would have loved such a glorious summer day, and she later told the others in the office that there had been tears in his eyes when he\u2019d said Catherine\u2019s name.</p><p>As the days passed, he appeared to be battling his depression. During most of his hours at work he seemed withdrawn and distant, going through his routine as if in a daze. Other times, he seemed shockingly cheerful. His erratic behavior was a concern to his staff, but they dismissed it as the understandable remnants of his grief. The best thing they could give him now was space. John was not one to discuss his feelings, and they all knew what a private person he was.</p><p>What they didn\u2019t know was that John was also quite the busy boy.</p><p>Within a couple of weeks after \u201cthe event,\u201d he had thrown out every painful reminder of his wife, including the Italian Renaissance furniture she had so loved. He dismissed her loyal servants and hired a housekeeper who hadn\u2019t known Catherine. He had the two-story house painted from top to bottom in bright, bold colors, and he had the garden re-landscaped. He added the fountain he\u2019d wanted, the one with the cherub spouting water out of its mouth. He\u2019d wanted the fountain for months, but when he\u2019d shown Catherine a picture of it in a catalog, she had decreed it too gaudy.</p><p>Everything was finished to his satisfaction. He\u2019d chosen contemporary furniture because of the sleek, uncluttered lines. When it was delivered from the warehouse where he\u2019d been storing it, the placement of each piece was personally overseen by the interior designer.</p><p>Then, when the last delivery truck had pulled away from the driveway, he and the oh-so-clever, beautiful young designer christened the new bed. They screwed the night away in the black-lacquered four-poster \u2014 just like he\u2019d been promising her for over a year now.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Theo Buchanan couldn\u2019t seem to shake the virus. He knew he was running a fever because every bone in his body ached and he had chills. He refused to acknowledge that he was ill, though; he was just a little off-kilter, that was all. He could tough it out. Besides, he was sure he was over the worst of it. The godawful stitch in his side had subsided into a dull throbbing, and he was positive that meant he was on the mend. If it was the same bug that had infected most of the staff back in his Boston office, then it was one of those twenty-four-hour things, and he should be feeling as good as new by tomorrow morning. Except, the throbbing in his side had been going on for a couple of days now.</p><p>He decided to blame his brother Dylan for that ache. He\u2019d really nailed him when they\u2019d played football at a family gathering in the front yard at Nathan\u2019s Bay. Yeah, the pulled muscle was Dylan\u2019s fault, but Theo figured that if he continued to ignore it, the pain would eventually go away.</p><p>Damn, he was feeling like an old man these days, and he wasn\u2019t even thirty-three yet.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think he was contagious, and he had too much to do to go to bed and sweat the fever out of his body. He\u2019d flown from Boston to New Orleans to speak at a law symposium on organized crime and to receive recognition he didn\u2019t believe he deserved for simply doing his job. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slipped his gun into its holster. The thing was a nuisance, but he was required to wear it for the time being, or at least until the death threats he\u2019d received while trying the mob case died down. He put on the jacket to his tuxedo, went into the bathroom of his hotel room, and leaned close to the framed vanity mirror to adjust his tie. He caught a glimpse of himself. He looked half-dead. His face was covered with sweat.</p><p>Tonight was the first of three black-tie affairs. Dinner was going to be prepared by five of the top chefs in the city, but the gourmet food was going to be wasted on him. The thought of swallowing anything, even water, made his stomach lurch. He hadn\u2019t eaten anything since yesterday afternoon.</p><p>He sure as certain wasn\u2019t up to pointless chitchat tonight. He tucked the room key into his pocket and was reaching for the doorknob when the phone rang.</p><p>It was his brother Nick calling to check in.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m walking out the door,\u201d Theo answered. \u201cWhere are you calling from? Boston or Holy Oaks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoston,\u201d Nick answered. \u201cI helped Laurant close the lake house, and then we drove back home together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she staying with you until the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Tommy would send me straight to hell.\u201d</p> <p>Theo laughed. \u201cI guess having a priest for a future brother-in-law does put a crimp in your sex life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of months and I\u2019m gonna be a married man. Hard to believe, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe any woman would have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurant\u2019s nearsighted. I told her I was good-looking and she believed me. She\u2019s staying with Mom and Dad until we all head back to Iowa for the wedding. What are you doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a fund-raiser I have to go to,\u201d he answered. \u201cSo what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought I\u2019d call and say hello.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. You want something. What is it? Come on, Nick. I\u2019m gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo, you\u2019ve got to learn to slow down. You can\u2019t keep running for the rest of your life. I know what you\u2019re doing. You think that if you bury yourself in work, you won\u2019t think about Rebecca. It\u2019s been four years since she died, but you \u2014 \u201d</p><p>Theo cut him off. \u201cI like my life, and I\u2019m not in the mood to talk about Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a workaholic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call to lecture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I called to see how you were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a beautiful city with beautiful women, incredible food \u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what do you want?\u201d</p><p>Nick gave up. \u201cTommy and I want to take your sailboat out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather Tom\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He drove back with Laurant and me,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. You and Tommy want to take my sailboat out, and neither of you knows how to sail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my fishing boat? Why don\u2019t you take the Mary Beth out instead? She\u2019s sturdier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to fish. We want to sail.\u201d</p><p>Theo sighed. \u201cTry not to sink her, okay? And don\u2019t let Laurant go with you guys. The family likes her. We don\u2019t want her to drown. I\u2019ve got to hang up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. There\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurant\u2019s been bugging me to call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she there? Let me talk to her,\u201d he said. He sat down on the side of the bed and realized he was feeling better. Nick\u2019s fianc\u00e9e had that effect on all the Buchanan brothers. She made everyone feel good.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t here. She went out with Jordan, and you know our sister. God only knows what time they\u2019ll get home. Anyway, I promised Laurant that I\u2019d track you down and ask . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted me to ask you, but I figure I didn\u2019t need to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s understood.\u201d</p><p>Theo held his patience. \u201cWhat\u2019s understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be my best man in the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the wedding, of course, but I\u2019m expecting you to be best man. I figured you already knew that, but Laurant thought I should ask you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what?\u201d</p><p>Theo smiled. \u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p><p>His brother was a man of few words. \u201cOkay, good. Have you given your speech yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not until tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you get your trophy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a plaque, and I get it right before I give my speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you blow it and put all those armed officers to sleep, they can\u2019t take the trophy back, can they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Theo? For once, stop thinking about work. See the sights. Get laid. You know, have a good time. Hey, I know . . . why don\u2019t you give Noah a call? He\u2019s on assignment in Biloxi for a few months. He could drive over to New Orleans, and the two of you could have some fun.\u201d</p><p>If anyone knew how to have fun, it was Noah Clayborne. The FBI agent had become a close friend of the family after working on several assignments with Nick and then later assisting Theo with his investigations as a federal attorney for the Justice Department. Noah was a good man, but he had a wicked sense of fun, and Theo wasn\u2019t sure he could survive a night out with Noah just now.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Theo hung up the phone, stood, and quickly doubled over from the pain that radiated through his right side. It had started in his belly, but it had moved down, and, damn, but it stung. The muscle he\u2019d pulled felt like it was on fire.</p><p>A stupid football injury wasn\u2019t going to keep him down. Muttering to himself, he grabbed his cell phone from the charger, put it into his breast pocket with his reading glasses, and left the room. By the time he reached the lobby, the pain had receded and he was feeling almost human again. That, of course, only reinforced his own personal golden rule. Ignore the pain and it would go away. Besides, a Buchanan could tough out anything.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>It was a night to remember.</p><p>Michelle had never attended such an extravagant affair before, and as she stood on the steps overlooking the hotel ballroom, she felt like Alice about to fall through the looking glass into Wonderland.</p><p>There were flowers everywhere, beautiful spring flowers in sculptured urns on the marble floors and in crystal vases on all the white linen tablecloths. In the very center of the ballroom, beneath a magnificent crystal chandelier, was a cluster of giant hothouse magnolia trees in full bloom. Their heavenly fragrance filled the air.</p><p>Waiters glided smoothly through the crowd carrying silver trays with fluted champagne glasses while others rushed from table to table lighting long, white, tapered candles.</p><p>Mary Ann Winters, a friend since childhood days, stood by Michelle\u2019s side taking it all in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of my element here,\u201d Michelle whispered. \u201cI feel like an awkward teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like one,\u201d Mary Ann said. \u201cI might as well be invisible. I swear every man is staring at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re staring at my obscenely tight dress. How could anything look so plain and ordinary on a hanger and so \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo devastatingly sexy on you? It clings in all the right places. Face it, you\u2019ve got a great figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never have spent so much money on a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Michelle, it\u2019s an Armani. You got it for a song, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Michelle self-consciously brushed her hand down the side of the soft fabric. She thought about how much she\u2019d paid for the dress and decided she would have to wear it at least twenty times to make it cost-effective. She wondered if other women did that \u2014 rationalized a frivolous expense to assuage the guilt. There were so many more important things she could have used the money for, and when, in heaven\u2019s name, was she ever going to have another opportunity to wear this beautiful dress again? Not in Bowen, she thought. Not in a million years.</p><p>\u201cWhat was I thinking? I never should have let you talk me into buying this dress.\u201d</p><p>Mary Ann impatiently brushed a strand of white blond hair back over her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare start in complaining about the cost again. You never spend any money on yourself. I\u2019ll bet it\u2019s the first really gorgeous dress you\u2019ve ever owned, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re absolutely beautiful tonight. Promise me you\u2019ll stop worrying and enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Michelle nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now let\u2019s go mingle. There\u2019s hors d\u2019oeuvres and champagne out in the courtyard, and we\u2019ve got to eat at least a thousand dollars\u2019 worth each. That\u2019s what I heard the tickets cost. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Her friend had just gone down the stairs when Dr. Cooper spotted Michelle and motioned for her to join him. He was the chief of surgery at Brethren Hospital, where she had been moonlighting the past month. Cooper was usually reserved, but the champagne had rid him of his inhibitions, and he was quite affectionate. And effervescent. He kept telling her how happy he was that she was using the tickets he\u2019d given her and how pretty she looked all dressed up. Michelle thought that if Dr. Cooper got any happier, he was going to pass out in the soup.</p><p>While Dr. Cooper expostulated on the attributes of the crawfish, spraying spit every time he said the word \u201cfish,\u201d she backed away to get out of the firing range. A few minutes later, Cooper\u2019s wife joined them with another older couple in tow. Michelle used the opportunity to sneak away.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to get trapped sitting next to the Coopers during dinner. The only thing worse than a happy drunk was a flirtatious one, and Cooper was definitely headed in that direction. Since he and his wife were standing near the entrance to the courtyard and would see her if she went past, she walked around into the adjacent hallway with the bank of elevators, hoping there was a way to get to the courtyard from the opposite side.</p><p>And that\u2019s when she noticed him. He was leaning against a pillar, hunched over, tilted protectively to one side. The man was tall, broad-shouldered, well-built, like an athlete, she thought. But there was a sickly gray pallor to his complexion, and as she walked toward him, she saw him grimace and grab his stomach.</p><p>He was obviously in trouble. She touched his arm to get his attention just as the elevator doors opened. He staggered upright and looked down at her. His gray eyes were glazed with pain.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d</p><p>He answered her by throwing up all over her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get out of the way because he\u2019d grabbed hold of her arm. His knees buckled then, and she knew he was going to go down. She wrapped her arms around his waist and tried to ease him to the floor, but he lurched forward at the same time, taking her with him.</p><p>Theo\u2019s head was spinning. He landed on top of the woman. He heard her groan and desperately tried to find the strength to get up. He thought he might be dying, and he didn\u2019t think that would be such a bad thing if death would make the pain go away. It was unbearable now. His stomach rolled again, and another wave of intense agony cut through him. He wondered if this was what it felt like to be stabbed over and over again. He passed out then, and when he next opened his eyes, he was flat on his back and she was leaning over him.</p><p>He tried to bring her face into focus. She had pretty blue eyes, more violet than blue, he thought, and freckles on the bridge of her nose. Then, as suddenly as it had stopped, the fire started burning in his side again, so much worse than before.</p><p>A spasm wrenched his stomach, and he jerked. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>The woman was talking to him, but he couldn\u2019t understand what she was saying. And what the hell was she doing to him? Was she robbing him? Her hands were everywhere, tugging at his jacket, his tie, his shirt. She was trying to straighten out his legs. She was hurting him, damn it, and every time he tried to push her hands away, they came back to poke and prod some more.</p><p>Theo kept slipping in and out of consciousness. He felt a rocking motion and heard a siren blaring close to his head. Blue Eyes was still there too, pestering him. She was asking him questions again. Something about allergies. Did she want him to be allergic to something?</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>He felt her open his jacket, knew she could see the gun holstered above his hip. He was crazed with pain now, couldn\u2019t seem to think straight. He only knew he couldn\u2019t let her take his weapon.</p><p>She was a damned talkative mugger. He\u2019d give her that. She looked like one of those J. Crew models. Sweet, he thought. No, she wasn\u2019t sweet. She kept hurting him.</p><p>\u201cLook, lady, you can take my wallet, but you\u2019re not getting my gun. Got that?\u201d He could barely get the words out through his gritted teeth.</p><p>Her hand pressed into his side. He reacted instinctively, knocking her back. He thought he might have connected with something soft because he heard her yell before he went under again.</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t know how long he was out, but when he opened his eyes, the bright lights made him squint. Where the hell was he? He couldn\u2019t summon up enough energy to move. He thought he might be on a table. It was hard, cold.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d His mouth was so dry, he slurred the question.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in Brethren Hospital, Mr. Buchanan.\u201d The man\u2019s voice came from behind him, but Theo couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>\u201cDid they catch her?\"</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ. Crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s loopy.\u201d A female voice he didn\u2019t recognize made the comment.</p><p>Theo suddenly realized he wasn\u2019t in any pain. He felt good, in fact. Real good. Like he could fly. Odd, though, he didn\u2019t have the strength to move his arms. A mask was placed over his mouth and nose. He turned his head to get away from it.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting sleepy, Mr. Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head again and saw her. Blue Eyes. She looked like an angel, all golden. Wait a minute. What the hell was she doing here? Wait . . .</p><p>\u201cMike, are you going to be able to see what you\u2019re doing? That eye looks bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it happen?\u201d the voice behind Theo\u2019s head asked.</p><p>\u201cHe clipped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe patient decked you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She was staring into Theo\u2019s eyes when she answered. She had a green mask on, but he knew she was smiling.</p><p>He was in such a happy daze now and so sleepy he was having trouble keeping his eyes open. Conversation swirled around him, but none of it made any sense.</p><p>A woman\u2019s voice. \u201cWhere did you find him, Dr. Renard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a party.\u201d</p> <p>Another woman leaned over him. \u201cHubba, hubba.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it love at first sight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou decide. He threw up all over me and ruined my new dress.\u201d</p><p>Someone laughed. \u201cSounds like love to me. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s married.</p><p>All the good-looking men are married. This one\u2019s sure built. Did you check out the goods, Annie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope our patient is sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d a male voice said. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t going to remember anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the assist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrubbing.\u201d</p><p>There seemed to be a party going on. Theo thought there were at least twenty or thirty people in the room with him. Why was it so damned cold? And who was making all the clatter? He was thirsty. His mouth felt like it was full of cotton. Maybe he ought to go get a drink. Yeah, that\u2019s what he would do.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dr. Cooper?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably passed out in the dessert by now.\u201d Blue Eyes answered the question. Theo loved the sound of her voice. It was so damned sexy.</p><p>\u201cSo you saw Cooper at the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Blue Eyes answered. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t on call tonight. He works hard. It was nice to see him having a good time. Mary Ann\u2019s probably having a great time too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d Theo struggled to get the word out. Still, he\u2019d gotten her attention because when he opened his eyes, she was leaning over him, blocking out the glaring light above him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go to sleep, Mr. Buchanan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fighting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat . . .\u201d Theo began.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>The man hiding behind him answered. \u201cMike wants your appendix, Mr. Buchanan.\u201d</p><p>It sounded good to him. He was always happy to accommodate a beautiful woman. \u201cOkay,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s in my wallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cWho do you want to hear tonight, Dr. Renard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed you ask, Annie?\u201d</p><p>A groan went around the room. Then a click. Theo heard the chair squeak behind him, then the stranger\u2019s voice telling him to take deep breaths. Theo finally figured out who the man behind him was. Damn if it wasn\u2019t Willie Nelson, and he was singing to him, something about Blue Eyes cryin\u2019 in the rain.</p><p>It was one hell of a party.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Theo slept through recovery. When he awoke the following morning, he was in a hospital bed. The side rails were up, and he was hooked to an IV. He closed his eyes and tried to clear his mind. What the hell had happened to him? He couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>It was past ten o\u2019clock when he opened his eyes again. She was there, standing beside the bed, pulling the sheets up around his waist. Blue Eyes. He hadn\u2019t imagined her after all.</p><p>She looked different today. She was still dressed in surgical scrubs, but her hair wasn\u2019t hidden underneath a cap. It was down around her shoulders, and the color was a deep, rich auburn.</p><p>She was much prettier than he remembered.</p><p>She noticed he was awake. \u201cGood morning. How are you feeling? Still a little drowsy?\u201d</p><p>He struggled to sit up. She reached for the controls and pushed a button. The head of the bed slowly rose. Theo felt a tugging in his side and a mild stinging sensation.</p><p>\u201cTell me when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She picked up his chart and started writing while he blatantly stared at her. He felt vulnerable and awkward sitting in bed in a hospital gown. He couldn\u2019t think of anything clever to say to her. For the first time in his life he wanted to be charming, but he didn\u2019t have the faintest idea how to go about it. He was a die-hard workaholic, and there simply hadn\u2019t been room for social graces in his life. In the last four years \u2014 since his wife\u2019s death \u2014 he had become blunt, abrasive, and to the point because it saved time, and Theo, these days anyway, was always in a hurry to get things done. This sudden turnabout surprised him. He actually wanted to be charming. Go figure, as his youngest brother, Zack, would say. Still, Theo thought he could manage it. Yeah. Charming was definitely doable.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what happened last night?\u201d she asked, glancing up from her notes.</p><p>\u201cI had surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Your appendix was removed. Another fifteen minutes and you definitely would have ruptured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember bits and pieces. What happened to your eye?\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she started writing in his chart again. \u201cI didn\u2019t duck fast enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Renard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone called you Mike.\u201d</p><p>Michelle closed the folder, put the lid back on her ink pen, and tucked it into her pocket. She gave him her full attention. The surgical nurses were right. Theo Buchanan was gorgeous . . . and sexy as hell. But none of that should matter. She was his physician, nothing more, nothing less, yet she couldn\u2019t help reacting to him as any woman naturally would react to such a fit specimen. His hair was sticking up and he needed a shave, but he was still sexy. There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with her noticing that . . . unless, of course, he noticed her noticing.</p><p>\u201cYou just asked me a question, didn\u2019t you?\u201d She drew a blank.</p><p>He could tell he\u2019d rattled her, but he didn\u2019t know why. \u201cI heard someone call you Mike.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes. The staff calls me Mike. It\u2019s short for Michelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle\u2019s a pretty name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>It was all coming back to Theo now. He was at a party, and there was this beautiful woman in a slinky black evening gown. She was breathtaking. He remembered that. She had killer blue eyes and Willie Nelson was with her. He was singing. No, that couldn\u2019t be right. Obviously, his head hadn\u2019t quite cleared yet.</p><p>\u201cYou were talking to me . . . after the surgery,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIn recovery. Yes,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut you were doing most of the talking.\u201d She was smiling again.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly gibberish,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou took my gun. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocked up in the hospital safe with your other personal possessions. Dr. Cooper will make sure you get them back before you leave. He\u2019s going to be taking over your care. You\u2019ll meet him in a little while when he makes his rounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what, Mr. Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo,\u201d he corrected. \u201cMy name\u2019s Theo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. Your brother told me you go by that nickname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd two sisters. So who\u2019d you talk to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou gave me his phone number and asked me to call him. He was concerned and made me promise to call him again after the surgery. As soon as you were wheeled into recovery, I called and assured him that you were going to be fine. He wanted to come,\u201d she added, \u201cbut he sounded relieved when I told him it wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>Theo nodded. \u201cNick hates flying,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen did I give you his phone number? I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were in pre-op. You were very talkative, once we gave you something to get rid of the pain, and by the way, the answer\u2019s no.</p><p>I won\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, sure she was joking. \u201cI don\u2019t remember being in pre-op. I remember the pain, though. It hurt like a son of a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did the surgery, didn\u2019t you? I didn\u2019t imagine that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did the surgery.\u201d</p><p>She was backing out of the room. He didn\u2019t want her to leave just yet. He wanted to find out more about her. Hell, he wished he were more adept at small talk.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She stopped. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater . . . could I have a glass of water?\u201d</p><p>She went to the bedside table, poured a tiny bit of water into a glass, and handed it to him. \u201cJust a sip,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you get nauseated and throw up, you\u2019ll mess up my stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. He took a drink and handed the glass back to her. \u201cYou don\u2019t look old enough to be a surgeon.\u201d Stupid, he thought, but it was the best he could come up with at the moment.</p><p>\u201cI hear that a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like you should be in college.\u201d That statement, he decided, was worse than stupid.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cHigh school, actually. They let me operate for extra credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Renard? May I interrupt?\u201d A male aide was standing in the hallway, shifting a large cardboard box under his arm.</p><p>\u201cYes, Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Cooper filled this box with medical supplies from his office for your clinic,\u201d the young man said. \u201cWhat do you want me to do with it? Dr. Cooper left it at the nurses\u2019 station, but they wanted it moved. It was in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind taking it down to my locker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too big, Dr. Renard. It won\u2019t fit. It isn\u2019t heavy, though. I could carry it out to your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father has the car,\u201d she said. She glanced around, then looked at Theo. \u201cWould you mind if Bobby left my box here? My father will carry it down to the car for me just as soon as he arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be seeing you again. I\u2019m going home today, but don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re in good hands. Dr. Cooper\u2019s chief of surgery here at Brethren, and he\u2019ll take good care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the swamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. She smiled again, and he noticed the little dimple in her left cheek. \u201cHome is a little town that\u2019s pretty much surrounded by swamp, and I can\u2019t wait to get back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomesick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019m a small-town girl at heart. It isn\u2019t a very glamorous life, and that\u2019s what I like about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like living in the swamp.\u201d It was a statement not a question, but she responded anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou sound shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re from a big, sprawling city, so you\u2019d probably hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou seem too . . . sophisticated.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if that was a compliment or a criticism. \u201cSometimes you can\u2019t go home. I think I read that in a book once. Besides, you look like a New Orleans kind of woman to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love New Orleans. It\u2019s a wonderful place to come for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t ever be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, are you the town doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of several,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m opening a clinic there. It\u2019s not very fancy, but there\u2019s a real need. So many of the people don\u2019t have the resources to get regular medical care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like they\u2019re very lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m the lucky one.\u201d Then she laughed. \u201cThat sounded saintly, didn\u2019t it? I am the lucky one, though. The people are wonderful \u2014 at least I think they are \u2014 and they give me far more than I can give them.\u201d When she spoke, her whole face lit up. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m going to like best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo games. For the most part, they\u2019re honest, ordinary people trying to scrape a living together. They don\u2019t waste a lot of time on foolishness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, everyone loves everyone else?\u201d He scoffed at the notion.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I\u2019ll know my enemies. They won\u2019t sneak up behind me and blindside me. It isn\u2019t their style.\u201d She smiled again. \u201cThey\u2019ll get right in my face, and I\u2019m going to like that. Like I said, no games. After the residency I just finished, that\u2019s going to be a refreshing change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t miss the big beautiful office and all the trappings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. There are rewards other than money. Oh sure, it would be great to have all the supplies and equipment we need, but we\u2019ll make do. I\u2019ve spent a lot of years getting ready for this . . . besides, I made a promise.\u201d</p><p>He kept asking her questions to keep her talking. He was interested in hearing about her town but not nearly as much as he was fascinated with her expressions. There was such passion and joy in her voice, and her eyes sparkled as she talked about her family and friends and the good she hoped she could do.</p><p>She reminded him of how he had felt about life when he had first started practicing the law, before he\u2019d become so cynical. He, too, had wanted to change the world, to make it a better place. Rebecca had ended all that. Looking back, he realized he had failed miserably.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worn you out, going on and on about my hometown. I\u2019ll let you rest now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhen can I get out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Dr. Cooper\u2019s call, but if it were up to me, I\u2019d keep you another night. You had quite a nasty infection. You need to take it easy for a couple of weeks, and don\u2019t forget to take your antibiotics. Good luck, Theo.\u201d</p><p>And then she was gone, and he\u2019d lost the only chance he had to find out more about her. He didn\u2019t even know where her home was. He fell asleep trying to figure out a way to see her again.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>The room was filled with flowers when Theo woke up from his morning nap. He heard whispering in the hallway, opened his eyes, and saw a nurse talking to an older man. She was pointing to the box the aide had left.</p><p>The man looked like a retired linebacker, Theo thought. Or maybe a boxer. If he was Dr. Renard\u2019s father, she\u2019d gotten her good looks from her mother\u2019s side of the family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to disturb you,\u201d the man said, his voice thick with a Cajun accent. \u201cI\u2019d just like to pick up this box Dr. Cooper fixed up for my daughter and be on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Theo said. \u201cYou\u2019re Dr. Renard\u2019s father, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. My name\u2019s Jake. Jake Renard.\u201d He walked over to the side of the bed and shook Theo\u2019s hand. Theo didn\u2019t have to introduce himself. Jake knew who he was. \u201cMy girl told me all about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did?\u201d He couldn\u2019t hide his surprise.</p> <p>Jake nodded. \u201cYou must have been real quick, son, because my Mike knows how to take care of herself.\u201d</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t know what the man was talking about. \u201cI was \u2018quick\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you clipped her,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhere\u2019d you think she got that shiner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did that?\u201d He was incredulous. He had no memory of it, and she hadn\u2019t said anything about it. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. I figured you didn\u2019t mean to hit her. She told me you were in considerable pain at the time. You were lucky she noticed you.\u201d He leaned against the bed rail and folded his arms across his chest. \u201cNow, my daughter doesn\u2019t usually talk about her patients, but I knew she had gone to a fancy party wearing a brand-new dress she didn\u2019t want to spend money on, and when I asked her if she had a good time, she told me about you. She had only just gotten there when she had to turn around and go back to the hospital. She didn\u2019t get to have a single bite of food.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should apologize to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tore her dress. You should probably tell her you\u2019re sorry about that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tore her dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust after you threw up on her.\u201d Jake chuckled, then shook his head. \u201cRuined that brand-new four-hundred-dollar dress.\u201d</p><p>Theo groaned. He did remember doing that.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you need to get some rest. If you see my daughter, will you tell her I\u2019m waiting down in the lobby? It was sure nice to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait here?\u201d Theo suggested. \u201cI\u2019ve slept as much as I\u2019m going to,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen your daughter comes looking for you, I can tell her thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I could sit a spell. I don\u2019t want to wear you out, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jake dragged a chair to the side of the bed and sat down.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s home, son? From your accent, I\u2019d have to guess the east coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever been there,\u201d Jake admitted. \u201cAre you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDivorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my wife died.\u201d</p><p>His tone of voice suggested that Jake not pursue that line of questioning.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your parents? They still around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they are,\u201d he answered. \u201cI come from a big family. There\u2019s eight of us, six boys and two girls. My father\u2019s a judge. He keeps trying to retire but hasn\u2019t quite figured out how to do it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever known a judge,\u201d Jake said. \u201cMy wife, Ellie, wanted a big family, and if we\u2019d been blessed, I probably would have figured out a way to feed them all. I was willing to do my part, but we had to stop with three. Two boys and a girl to round the family out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly is home, sir? Your daughter was talking about her clinic, but she never mentioned the name of the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Jake,\u201d he insisted. \u201cBowen, Louisiana, is home, but I don\u2019t expect you\u2019ve ever heard of it. The town\u2019s not big enough to be a speck on a map. Bowen\u2019s tiny, all right, but it\u2019s the prettiest stretch of land in all Louisiana. Some afternoons when the sun\u2019s going down and the breeze picks up, the moss starts in swaying and the light bounces off the bayou just so, and the bullfrogs and the gators start in singing to each other . . . well, son, I think to myself that I must be living in paradise. It\u2019s that pretty. The closest town is St. Claire, and that\u2019s where folks do their Saturday shopping, so we\u2019re not completely isolated. There\u2019s a hospital there on the north side. It\u2019s old, but adequate,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cDo your sons live in Bowen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy, my oldest, is out in Colorado. He\u2019s a fireman and still not married,\u201d he added. \u201cHe comes home every now and again. John Paul, the middle one, left the marines and moved back to Bowen a couple of years ago; he\u2019s not married either. Too busy, I imagine. He lives in a nice little cabin he built deep in the swamp, and when he isn\u2019t working the bar for me, he\u2019s a carpenter. Last year we opened a brand-new high school, and John Paul helped build it. Daniel Boone is what it\u2019s called. Named after a local celebrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean it\u2019s named after the Daniel Boone who helped settle Kentucky . . . the frontiersman . . . is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying Boone lived in Bowen?\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cNo, son, we can\u2019t boast that, but legend has it that Daniel roamed the area hunting and fishing. Of course, that was way back in the 1700s before Bowen was even a town. Still, we like to think that Daniel fished our waters and stayed a spell.\u201d</p><p>Theo managed not to laugh. It appeared that the people in Bowen were hard-pressed for local heroes.</p><p>\u201cWhere does the name Bowen come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt comes from the word Bowie, like in the knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Jim Bowie? Did he stop by too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe like to think he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting me on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Jake insisted. \u201cOf course, Jim didn\u2019t show up at the same time Daniel did. He came years later, in the 1800s,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you aren\u2019t getting Daniel Boone mixed up with Davy Crockett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure hope not. The school\u2019s already got the lettering on it in stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there proof that Boone was in Bowen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone to speak of,\u201d Jake admitted with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cBut we believe it to be true. Now, as I was telling you, the Bowen kids used to have to bus over to the fancy high school in St. Claire, but it just got too cramped. It was past time we had our own. We\u2019ve even got a football team. We were all real excited about that last year . . . until we saw them play. Lord, they\u2019re a sorry lot at best. I never missed a game though, and I won\u2019t miss this year either because, now that my daughter is home, she\u2019ll be going with me. Mike agreed to be the team\u2019s physician, which means she\u2019s got to sit on the sidelines and fix them up when they get hurt. We all know they\u2019re going to get trounced again, but I figure I ought to be supportive of their efforts by showing up and cheering them on. We didn\u2019t win a single game last year. We\u2019ve got some real big boys, but they don\u2019t know what to do when they get the ball. They don\u2019t know how to hit either. You like to watch football, Theo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou ever play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d he answered. \u201cHigh school, and college until I trashed my knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat position? You\u2019re tall and thick through the shoulders. I\u2019d guess quarterback.\u201d</p><p>Theo nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. It seems like a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Jake had a speculative gleam in his eyes. \u201cYou ever think about coaching?\u201d</p><p>Theo laughed. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike might be able to fix up your knee for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be very proud of your daughter, coming back home to open a clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m proud of her,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let her work herself to the bone, though. There are other doctors in St. Claire, and they\u2019ll be taking call for one another so each of them can have some time off now and again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is she doing surgery here in Brethren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make some extra money. They call it moonlighting, but she\u2019s finished now and won\u2019t be coming back. Do you like to fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to, but the last few years, there just hasn\u2019t been any time for it,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI remember, though, there\u2019s nothing like that feeling of peace that comes over a man when he\u2019s \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolding a fishing pole in one hand and a cold beer in the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. Nothing like it in the world.\u201d</p><p>They started discussing their favorite lures and bait, and then did a good deal of bragging about the fish they\u2019d caught. Jake was impressed. He didn\u2019t think anyone understood or loved fishing as much as he did, but he had to admit that from the way Theo talked, he had met his match.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, you ought to come up to Bowen. We\u2019ve got the best fishing in the state, and I mean to prove it to you. We\u2019ll pass a good time out on my dock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may take you up on the offer sometime,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come the chief of police is sending you flowers?\u201d he asked. He looked sheepish as he added, \u201cThey were sitting on the counter at the nurses\u2019 station before they brought them on in here, and I read the card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to New Orleans to give a speech,\u201d he said, leaving out the fact that he was being honored by the local authorities. \u201cI work for the Justice Department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was assigned to a special task force,\u201d he said. He realized he was still being evasive and added, \u201cThe area was organized crime. I just finished up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get your man?\u201d</p><p>Theo smiled. \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you out of a job now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cJustice wants me to stay on. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>Jake continued with his questions. Theo thought he would have made a great prosecutor. He had a sharp mind and a quick wit.</p><p>\u201cYou ever think about going into private practice?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any good attorneys in Bowen. We got two over in St. Claire, but they\u2019ll rob you blind. Folks don\u2019t think much of them.\u201d</p><p>While Jake talked about his town, Theo kept trying to think of a subtle way to bring the subject back to Michelle.</p><p>\u201cIs your daughter married?\u201d So much for subtle.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering when you were going to get around to asking me about Mike. The answer\u2019s no, she isn\u2019t married. She hasn\u2019t had time. Of course, the men in Bowen and St. Claire are all trying to get her attention, but she\u2019s been too busy setting up her clinic to pay them any mind. She\u2019s still young,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd smart. Lord, is my girl smart. She finished college before she was twenty, then started in on her medical training. She had to go out of state to do her residency, but she came home to visit every chance she got. She\u2019s mindful of family,\u201d he added with a nod. \u201cAnd she\u2019s pretty too, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d notice.\u201d</p><p>Jake stood up and put the chair back against the wall. \u201cIt was nice passing the time with you, but I should go now. You get some sleep, and I\u2019ll carry that box to the car. Dr. Cooper gave my daughter some old surgical equipment, and when she asked me to come and fetch it, she was smiling like it was Christmas morning. If you ever make your way to Bowen, you be sure and come by The Swan. That\u2019s my bar,\u201d he explained. \u201cDrinks on the house.\u201d</p><p>He was at the door when Theo stopped him. \u201cIf I don\u2019t see your daughter before she leaves, please tell her thank you for me, and also tell her how sorry I am about the dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure and tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe our paths will cross again someday.\u201d</p><p>Jake nodded. \u201cMaybe so.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>John\u2019s friends never saw it coming.</p><p>Two weeks to the day after Catherine\u2019s funeral, Cameron happened to run into the grieving widower at Commander\u2019s Palace, a four-star restaurant located in the Garden District. Cameron was sitting in one of the dining rooms waiting for his attorney to join him to discuss the never-ending and thoroughly nauseating topic of his divorce settlement. His wife was determined to destroy him financially and to publicly humiliate him in the process, and from the way things were going, it looked as though she would succeed.</p><p>John was having dinner with a young woman in the next room. The blond looked vaguely familiar. Her head was bent down, and she was diligently writing in her Day-Timer.</p><p>Cameron couldn\u2019t remember where he\u2019d seen the woman before, but he was pleased to see his friend out for the evening, even if it was business. John\u2019s moods had been so volatile since his wife\u2019s death. One minute he was overjoyed, almost euphoric, and the next, he was wallowing in self-pity and depression.</p><p>The blond lifted her head, and Cameron got a good look at her face. She was quite pretty. He still couldn\u2019t place her. He decided to interrupt the couple to say hello. He ordered a double scotch neat as fortification to get through the ordeal ahead of him with his attorney, then started winding his way through the tables into the next dining room.</p><p>Had he not dropped his pen, he never would have known the truth. He bent down to scoop it up, and that was when he saw John put his hand on the blond\u2019s thigh under the white linen tablecloth. Her legs spread, and she shifted ever so slightly until she was leaning into his hand, which was now moving upward under her dress.</p><p>Cameron was so shocked by the intimacy he almost lost his balance. He quickly caught himself and stood. Neither John nor the woman noticed him. She had turned her head and was staring off into space, her eyes half-closed in obvious bliss.</p><p>Cameron couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing, but that instant of disbelief swiftly turned into confusion.</p><p>He suddenly remembered who the blond was, though he couldn\u2019t recall her name. She was the insipid female who called herself an interior decorator. Cameron had met her in John\u2019s office. Oh, yes, it was all coming back to him now. She didn\u2019t have taste or talent. She had turned his friend\u2019s office into a bordello parlor by painting the beautiful walnut-paneled walls a deep, garish mustard yellow.</p><p>She obviously had talent in another area though. The way John was all but licking his lips as he greedily stared at her pouting mouth indicated she was real talented in the bedroom. Cameron continued to stand near the doorway, staring at his friend\u2019s back while the truth settled in his mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The son of a bitch had duped them all.</p><p>Incredulous, and at the same time overwhelmed with anger, Cameron turned and walked back to his table. He tried to convince himself that he was jumping to the wrong conclusions. He had known John for years and trusted him completely.</p><p>Until now. Damn it, what had John done to them? White-collar crime was one thing; murder was quite another. The club had never gone this far before, and what made it all the more chilling was that they had convinced themselves that they were actually doing a good deed. Tell that to a jury of their peers and watch them laugh.</p><p>Dear God, had Catherine really been terminal? Had she been dying a slow, agonizing death? Or had John simply been lying to them to get them to do his dirty work?</p> <p>No, not possible. John wouldn\u2019t have lied about his wife. He\u2019d loved her, damn it.</p><p>Cameron was sick to his stomach. He didn\u2019t know what to think, but he did know it would be wrong to condemn his friend without knowing all the facts. Then it occurred to him that the affair, if that was what this was, could have begun after Catherine\u2019s death. He latched onto the idea. Yes, of course. John had known the decorator before his wife\u2019s death. The blond had been hired by Catherine to redecorate her bedroom. But so what if he had known her? After his wife died, John was grieving and lonely, and the young woman was available. Hell, she probably pounced on his vulnerability right after the funeral.</p><p>A nagging doubt remained. If this was innocent, then why hadn\u2019t John told his friends about her? Why was he hiding it?</p><p>Maybe because his wife\u2019s ashes hadn\u2019t even had time to cool off yet. Yeah, that was it. John knew it wouldn\u2019t look good to get involved with another woman so soon after Catherine\u2019s death. People would certainly think it was odd and start talking and speculating, and the club sure as hell didn\u2019t want that to happen. John was smart enough to know he should keep a low profile.</p><p>Cameron had almost convinced himself that what he had seen was pretty harmless, but he still felt compelled to make certain. He didn\u2019t let John see him. He paid his bar tab and slipped out of the restaurant. He had the valet bring around the used Ford sedan he was forced to drive these days \u2014 his soon-to-be ex-wife had already confiscated his cherished Jaguar, damn the slut. He drove to the next block, ducked down in the seat, and turned to watch for the couple to come outside. While he waited, he called his attorney on his cell phone to cancel dinner.</p> <p>The two of them came outside twenty minutes later. They stood at the curb, facing each other about five feet apart, acting stiff and formal, as though they were little more than strangers, John with his hands stuffed in his pants pockets, the blond clutching her purse and her Day-Timer. When her car arrived, she tucked her purse under her arm and shook John\u2019s hand. The valet held the door of her cherry red Honda open, and she got inside and drove away without a backward glance.</p><p>To the casual observer, the scene was very businesslike.</p><p>A minute later John\u2019s gray BMW convertible arrived. He took his time removing his suit jacket, folding it just so before carefully placing it on the passenger\u2019s seat. The well-fitted suit was Valentino, the only designer John ever wore. A wave of bitterness washed over Cameron. Six months ago he, too, had had a closet full of Joseph Abboud and Calvin Klein and Valentino suits, but then his wife, in a drunken rage, had grabbed a butcher knife and shredded the clothes into rags. That little tantrum had destroyed over fifty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of garments.</p><p>God, how he longed to get even. Some nights he lay in bed and fantasized about all sorts of ways to kill her. The most important element in the daydream was pain. He wanted the bitch to suffer as she was dying. His favorite scenario was smashing her face through a glass window and watching the whore slowly bleed to death. In his fantasy a shard of glass barely nicked her artery.</p><p>Oh, yes, he wanted her to suffer the way she was making him suffer, to get even with her for stealing his life from him. She\u2019d frozen all of his assets until the divorce settlement was reached, but he already knew what the outcome would be. She was going to take it all.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know about the Sowing Club or the assets they had hidden. No one did. Her attorney wouldn\u2019t be able to find the money either, even if he had been looking. The millions of dollars were in an offshore account, and none of it could be traced back to him.</p> <p>But for now, it didn\u2019t matter that he had money hidden. He couldn\u2019t touch any of it until he turned forty. That was the deal the four friends had made, and he knew the others wouldn\u2019t let him borrow from the fund. It was too risky, and so, for the next five years, he was going to have to bite the bullet and live like a pauper.</p><p>John was the lucky devil. Now that Catherine was dead, he had what was left of her trust fund, which he didn\u2019t have to share with anyone.</p><p>Cameron was filled with envy as he watched his friend put on his Saints\u2019 ball cap. He knew John only wore the thing to hide his bald spot. He was going to be completely bald by the time he was fifty, like all the men in his family, no matter what precautions he took. But what did that matter? He\u2019d still look real good to women. Women would put up with any flaw if there was money involved.</p><p>Cameron dismissed this latest bout of self-pity with a shake of his head. Feeling sorry for himself wasn\u2019t going to change anything. Besides, he could hold on for a few more years. Concentrate on the future, he told himself. Soon he would be able to retire as a multimillionaire and move to the south of France, and there wouldn\u2019t be a damned thing his ex could do about it.</p><p>John slid onto the soft leather seat. Then he loosened his tie, adjusted the rearview mirror, and drove away.</p><p>Should he follow him? Cameron threaded his fingers through his hair in frustration. He knew he wasn\u2019t being fair to John and that it was wrong for him to become so easily spooked by what was surely innocent. John had loved his wife, and if a cure had been possible, Cameron knew that his friend would have spent every dollar he had to save Catherine.</p><p>Yet, the nagging uncertainty wouldn\u2019t go away, and so he did follow him. He figured that if he could just sit down with him and talk, they would be able to clear up this . . . misunderstanding. John would tell him this suspicion was simply a reaction to the horrible guilt he was feeling over what they had done in the name of mercy.</p><p>Cameron thought about turning the car around and going home, but he didn\u2019t do it. He had to be sure. Had to know. He took a shortcut through the Garden District and arrived at John\u2019s house before he did. The beautiful Victorian home was on a coveted corner lot. There were two enormous, ancient oak trees and a magnolia casting black shadows on the front yard. Cameron pulled onto the side street adjacent to the electronically gated driveway. He turned the lights off, then the motor, and sat there, well-concealed under a leafy branch that blocked out the streetlight. The house was dark. When John arrived, Cameron reached for the door handle, then froze.</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She was there, waiting. As the iron gate was opening, he spotted her standing on the sidewalk by the side of the house. The garage door lifted then, and Cameron saw her red Honda parked inside.</p><p>As soon as John parked his car and walked out of the garage, she ran to him, her large round br**sts bouncing like silicone balls underneath the tight fabric of her dress. The bereaved widower couldn\u2019t wait to get her inside the house. They tore at each other like street dogs in heat. Her black dress was unzipped and down around her waist in a matter of seconds, and his hand was latched onto one of her br**sts as they stumbled to the door. His grunts of pleasure blended with her shrill laughter.</p><p>\u201cThat son of a bitch,\u201d Cameron muttered. \u201cThat stupid son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>He had seen enough. He drove home to his rented one-bedroom apartment in the untrendy section of the warehouse district and paced for hours, stewing and fuming and worrying. A bottle of scotch fueled his anger.</p><p>Around two in the morning, a couple of drunks got into a fistfight outside of his window. Cameron watched the spectacle with disgusted curiosity. One of them had a knife, and Cameron hoped he\u2019d stab the other one just to shut him up. Someone must have called the police. They arrived, sirens blaring, minutes later.</p><p>There were two officers in the patrol car. They quickly disarmed the drunk with the knife and then slammed both men up against a stone wall. Blood, iridescent under the garish streetlight, poured from a gash in the side of one drunk\u2019s head as he crashed unconscious to the pavement.</p><p>The policeman who\u2019d used the unnecessary force shouted a crude blasphemy as he rolled the unconscious man over onto his stomach and then knelt on his back and secured the handcuffs. Then he dragged him to the car. The other drunk meekly waited his turn, and within another minute or two, both were locked in the back of the car on their way to the city jail.</p><p>Cameron gulped a long swallow of scotch and wiped the perspiration from his brow with the back of his hand. The scene under his window had freaked him, especially the handcuffs. He couldn\u2019t handle being cuffed. He couldn\u2019t go to prison, wouldn\u2019t. He\u2019d kill himself first . . . if he had the courage. He had always been a little claustrophobic, but the condition had worsened over the years. He couldn\u2019t be inside a windowless room these days without feeling tightness in his chest. He\u2019d stopped using elevators, preferring to walk up seven flights of stairs rather than spend thirty or forty seconds inside a metal elevator box, squeezed in like a dead sardine with the other office dwellers.</p><p>Dear God, why hadn\u2019t he thought about his claustrophobia before he agreed to this lunacy?</p><p>He knew the answer and was drunk enough to admit it. Greed. Fucking greed. John was the motivator, the planner, the man with the vision . . . and the money connections. With the fervor of a southern evangelist, he\u2019d promised he could make them all rich. Hell, he already had. But he had also played them for the greedy fools he knew they were. When he started talking about killing himself, he knew they\u2019d all panic. They couldn\u2019t lose John, and they would do anything to keep him happy.</p><p>And that was exactly what the bastard had counted on.</p><p>Bleary-eyed from drink, Cameron finished the bottle of scotch and went to bed. The following morning, Sunday, he battled a hangover until noon. Then, when he was clearheaded, he came up with a plan. He needed absolute proof for Preston and Dallas to see, and once they realized how John had manipulated them, Cameron would demand that they split the profits in the Sowing Club now and go their separate ways. He wasn\u2019t about to wait five more years to collect his share. After what John had done, all Cameron could think about was running away before they got caught.</p><p>Cameron had a few connections of his own, and there were a couple of calls he needed to make. He had five working days before the confrontation he planned on Friday. Five days to nail the son of a bitch.</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell anyone what he was doing. Friday rolled around, and he arrived at Dooley\u2019s late, around six-thirty in the evening. He made his way to their table and took the seat across from John. The waiter had spotted him and brought him his usual drink before Cameron had taken off his suit jacket and loosened his tie.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell,\u201d Preston said in his customary blunt way. Of the four, he was the health nut and made it clear at every opportunity that he didn\u2019t approve of Cameron\u2019s lifestyle. Built like an Olympic weightlifter, Preston was obsessive about working out five nights a week at a posh health club. In his opinion, any man who didn\u2019t have steely upper arms and a stomach you could bounce a quarter off of was a weakling, and men with beer guts were to be pitied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put in some long hours at work this week. I\u2019m tired, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to start taking care of yourself before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Preston said. \u201cCome with me to the club and start lifting weights and running the track. And lay off the booze, for Christ\u2019s sake. It\u2019s killing your liver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did you become my mother?\u201d</p><p>Dallas, a die-hard peacemaker, couldn\u2019t stand discord, no matter how minor. \u201cPreston\u2019s just concerned about you. We both know you\u2019ve been under a lot of stress lately with the divorce and all. We just don\u2019t want you to get sick. Preston and I depend on you and John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreston\u2019s right,\u201d John said. He swirled his swizzle stick in the amber liquid as he added, \u201cYou do look bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNow enough about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Preston said, offended by the censure in Cameron\u2019s voice.</p><p>Cameron gulped down his drink and then motioned for the waiter to bring him another. \u201cAnything new happen this week?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been dull for me.\u201d Preston shrugged. \u201cBut I guess in our business that\u2019s good. Right, Dallas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. It\u2019s been pretty dull for me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, John? Anything new going on with you?\u201d Cameron asked mildly.</p><p>John shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m hanging in there, taking it a day at a time.\u201d</p><p>He sounded pathetic. Cameron thought John\u2019s performance was a bit overdone, but Preston and Dallas bought it and were sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cIt will get easier,\u201d Preston promised. Since he had absolutely no experience with losing anyone he cared about, he couldn\u2019t possibly know if John\u2019s life would get easier or not, but he felt he should give his friend some sort of encouragement. \u201cWith time,\u201d he added lamely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You just need some time,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since Catherine died?\u201d Cameron asked. John raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou know how long it\u2019s been.\u201d He stood, removed his suit jacket and carefully folded it, then draped it over the back of the chair. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get some Beer Nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, bring some pretzels too,\u201d Preston said. He waited until John had walked away before turning on Cameron. \u201cDid you have to bring Catherine\u2019s name up now?\u201d</p><p>John told the waitress what he wanted and was walking back to the table when he heard Dallas say, \u201cJohn was just starting to relax. Give the guy a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to coddle me,\u201d John said as he dragged his chair out and sat down. \u201cI haven\u2019t kept count of the hours and minutes my wife has been gone,\u201d he said. \u201cSome nights it seems like only yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost a month.\u201d Cameron studied his friend as he made the comment. He picked up his glass and saluted John. \u201cI think you ought to start dating. I really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Dallas whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s way too soon.\u201d</p><p>Preston vehemently nodded. \u201cPeople will talk if he starts dating this soon, and talk leads to speculation. We don\u2019t want that. Don\u2019t you agree, Dallas?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell, yes, I agree. I can\u2019t believe you suggested it, Cam.\u201d</p><p>John leaned back in his chair. His shoulders slumped ever so slightly and his expression looked pained. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it, not yet anyway. Maybe never. I can\u2019t imagine being with another woman. I loved Catherine, and the thought of replacing her makes me sick to my stomach. You know how I felt about my wife.\u201d</p><p>Cameron gripped his hands together in his lap to keep himself from reaching across the table and grabbing the lying bastard by the throat.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right. I was being insensitive.\u201d He reached down into his open briefcase and pulled out a thick manila file folder. Pushing his drink aside, he carefully placed it in the center of the table.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Dallas wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cAnother investment opportunity?\u201d Preston guessed.</p><p>Cameron stared at John as he dropped his bomb. \u201cLots of notes and figures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cCatherine\u2019s medical records.\u201d</p> <p>John was reaching for the folder. When Cameron announced what was inside, John reacted as though a rattlesnake had just landed on his hand. He jerked back and then came up halfway out of his chair. The shock was quickly replaced by anger. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing with my wife\u2019s medical records?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>John\u2019s face was so red he looked as if he was about to have a stroke. Cameron began to hope that he would and that it would be massive and debilitating. The prick should suffer as much and as long as possible.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d Cameron hissed. \u201cI saw you Saturday night with the blond. I couldn\u2019t figure out why you hadn\u2019t told us about her, and so I decided to do a little investigative work on my own.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t trust me?\u201d John was genuinely outraged.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Turning to Preston and Dallas, Cameron said, \u201cGuess what? Good old Catherine wasn\u2019t dying. John just wanted to get rid of her. Isn\u2019t that right, John? You played us for fools, and, damn, we were that. We believed every word you told us. You knew Monk wouldn\u2019t kill her unless we all agreed. That was the deal when we hired him. He works for the club, and you didn\u2019t have the guts to kill her yourself. You wanted to involve us, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Dallas whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p> <p>Preston was too stunned to speak. He stared at the file folder as he asked, \u201cIs Cameron right or wrong? Catherine was terminal, wasn\u2019t she? You told us it was her heart, a congenital defect . . .\u201d He stopped and turned helplessly to Cameron. Then he whispered, \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s lips were pinched together. His eyes blazed with fury, his gaze fully directed on Cameron. \u201cWhat gave you the right to spy on me?\u201d</p><p>Cameron laughed harshly. \u201cYou arrogant ass. You\u2019ve got the balls to be outraged that I spied on you and your little Barbie doll?\u201d Glancing at Dallas, whose complexion was rapidly turning green, he asked, \u201cWant to hear something else really funny? You\u2019ll get a kick out of this news. I know I did.\u201d</p><p>Dallas picked up the folder and asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d John lunged to grab the file, but Dallas was quicker.</p><p>\u201cCatherine introduced this woman, Lindsey, to John. She hired the bitch to redecorate her bedroom. Isn\u2019t that right, John? The affair started almost immediately after you met her, didn\u2019t it? But you had already decided to kill your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to talk about this here,\u201d Preston said with a worried glance around the bar to see if anyone was watching them.</p><p>\u201cOf course we should talk about this here,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cThis is, after all, where we planned the mercy killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam, you\u2019ve got it all wrong,\u201d John said. He looked earnest now, sincere. \u201cI\u2019ve only had one date with Lindsey, and it wasn\u2019t really even a date. It was a business meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Eager to believe John was telling the truth, Preston vigorously nodded. \u201cIf he says it was business, then that\u2019s what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. He\u2019s lying. I followed him home. I saw Lindsey\u2019s car parked in his garage, and she was there waiting for him. They were all over each other. She\u2019s living with you now, isn\u2019t she, John? And you\u2019re hiding it from everyone, especially the three of us.\u201d Cameron began to rub his temples. He\u2019d had a pounding, relentless headache off and on for the past week, ever since he discovered John\u2019s nasty little secret. \u201cDon\u2019t bother to answer. I\u2019ve got all the facts right here,\u201d he said, pointing to the folder Dallas had just opened. \u201cDid you know Lindsey thinks you\u2019re going to marry her? I got that bit of information from her mother. She\u2019s already planning the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Lindsey\u2019s mother? All that alcohol has gotten to you, Cameron. It\u2019s made you delusional . . . paranoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pompous ass,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cLower your voice,\u201d Preston pleaded. His brow was covered with perspiration, and he wiped it away with the bar napkin. Fear made his throat dry.</p><p>\u201cShall we discuss Catherine\u2019s little trust fund that John was so worried would run out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Preston asked. \u201cWas there any left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Cameron drawled. \u201cAbout four million dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree million, nine hundred seventy-eight thousand to be exact,\u201d Dallas read from the folder.</p><p>\u201cDear God . . . this can\u2019t be happening,\u201d Preston said. \u201cHe told us . . . He told us he took her to Mayo, and they couldn\u2019t do anything for her. Remember, Cameron? He told us . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied. He lied about everything, and we were so damned trusting we believed him. Think about it, Preston. When was the last time any of us saw her? A couple of years ago? It was right before she went to Mayo, wasn\u2019t it? We all saw how bad she looked. Then when she got back, John said she didn\u2019t want to see anyone. And so we respected her wishes. For two years, it was John who told us how her condition was deteriorating and how much she was suffering. All that time, he was lying.\u201d</p><p>They all stared at John, waiting for him to explain.</p><p>John lifted his hands, palms up in mock surrender, and smiled. \u201cI guess the game\u2019s over,\u201d he said.</p><p>Stunned silence followed the announcement.</p><p>\u201cYou admit it?\u201d Preston asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess I do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a relief, really, not to have to sneak around you guys any longer. Cameron\u2019s right. I\u2019ve been planning this for a long time. Over four years,\u201d he boasted. \u201cDid I ever love Catherine? Maybe, in the beginning, before she turned into an obsessive, demanding pig. It\u2019s funny how love can turn into hate so quickly. Then again, I might not have loved her at all. It could have been her trust fund. I did love the money.\u201d</p><p>Dallas dropped a glass. It landed with a thud on the carpet. \u201cWhat have you done to us?\u201d The question came out in a choked whisper.</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to do,\u201d John defended. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have any regrets. Well, no, that isn\u2019t exactly true. I regret inviting Lindsey to move in. I mean, I\u2019ve loved every minute I\u2019ve had her. She\u2019ll do anything in bed, anything at all that I ask, and she so wants to please me. She\u2019s getting clingy, though, and I\u2019m sure as hell not going to get tied down again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d Cameron snarled.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am that,\u201d John agreed smoothly. \u201cWant to know the best part, besides the pig\u2019s trust fund? It was so damned easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou murdered her.\u201d Dallas closed the folder.</p><p>John shifted in his chair. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not exactly true. I didn\u2019t murder her. We did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be sick,\u201d Dallas stammered, and then bolted for the bathroom.</p><p>John seemed amused by the reaction. He motioned to the waiter to bring another round of drinks.</p><p>They sat stiffly together, like strangers now, each lost in his own thoughts. After the waiter had placed fresh drinks on the table and left, John said, \u201cI bet you\u2019d like to kill me with your bare hands, wouldn\u2019t you, Cameron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sure as hell like to,\u201d Preston said.</p><p>John shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re a hothead, Preston. Always have been. And with your muscle-building regime, you could break every bone in my body. But,\u201d he added, \u201cif it weren\u2019t for me, you\u2019d already be in prison. You don\u2019t think things through. You don\u2019t have what it takes. I guess you just don\u2019t have a calculating mind. We\u2019ve had to push you into every financial decision. And we had to pressure you into agreeing with us to pay Monk to kill Catherine.\u201d He paused. \u201cCameron, on the other hand, does have what it takes.\u201d</p><p>Cameron inwardly cringed. \u201cI knew you didn\u2019t have much of a conscience, but I never figured you\u2019d screw us. We\u2019re all you\u2019ve got, John. Without us, you\u2019re . . . nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were friends and I trusted you,\u201d Preston said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still friends,\u201d John argued. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it hasn\u2019t,\u201d Cameron shot back.</p><p>John was completely unruffled. \u201cYou\u2019ll get past it,\u201d he promised. \u201cEspecially when you remember how much money I\u2019ve made for you.\u201d</p><p>Cameron propped his elbows on the table and stared into John\u2019s eyes. \u201cI want my cut now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s out of the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say we dissolve the club. We each take our share and go our separate ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d John said. \u201cYou know the rules. None of us touches a dime for five more years.\u201d</p><p>Dallas came back to the table and sat down. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d</p><p>Preston, who now looked as though he was going to be sick, answered, \u201cCameron wants to dissolve the club and split the assets now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Dallas said, appalled. \u201cYou make a withdrawal, and it can be traced by the IRS. It\u2019s out of the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t touch the money unless we all go with him to the bank, remember? We all have to sign before we\u2019re given access. That\u2019s how we set it up,\u201d John reminded them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real bastard, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so you said. Face it, Cameron. You aren\u2019t angry because I lied to you. You\u2019re pissed off because your life\u2019s miserable right now. I know you better than you know yourself. I know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I didn\u2019t have it all that bad. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cameron admitted. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s voice was calm as he said, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have the courage to do more than whine. I did. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d He turned to Dallas. \u201cYou know, you\u2019d never have asked Monk to kill Catherine if I hadn\u2019t lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, John, if you wanted out, why didn\u2019t you just divorce her?\u201d Dallas asked.</p><p>\u201cThe money,\u201d he answered. \u201cI wanted every dollar she had. By God, I deserved it for putting up with her. She was a controlling bitch,\u201d he added, and for the first time there was bitterness and hatred in his voice. \u201cUnlike Cameron, I didn\u2019t mask my misery with booze. I planned. You have no idea how sickening she was. Her weight had gotten out of hand. She was a hypochondriac. All she thought about and talked about was her health. She did have a heart murmur, but it was no big deal. She was thrilled when she found that out. It gave her a reason to become even more slovenly. She took to her bed and stayed there, being waited on hand and foot by her maids and by me. I kept hoping her heart would blow up, and, honest to God, I tried to kill her with the ton of chocolates I brought home every night, but it was taking too long. Granted, I could have screwed around on her every night and she wouldn\u2019t have known. In fact, I did screw around and she didn\u2019t find out. Like I said, the woman was too lazy to get out of bed, much less leave her bedroom. I couldn\u2019t stand coming home to her. Looking at her made me want to puke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we supposed to feel sorry for you now?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut as for crossing the line, we did that a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never murdered anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? We\u2019d still get twenty, maybe thirty years for all the crimes we have committed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they were white-collar crimes,\u201d Preston stammered.</p><p>\u201cIs that going to be your defense against the IRS?\u201d John asked. \u201cThink they\u2019ll just slap your hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now we have,\u201d John snapped, irritated with Preston\u2019s whiny attitude. Focusing on Cameron now, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this. It was easy . . . easy enough to do again. You know what I\u2019m saying? We could wait a little while, maybe six months or so, and then talk to Monk again about your situation.\u201d</p><p>Dallas\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d</p><p>Cameron cocked his head. He was already thinking about it. \u201cI\u2019d love for Monk to pay a visit to my wife. It would be worth every penny I had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d John said smoothly.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop talking like that, I\u2019m out,\u201d Preston threatened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for you to get out,\u201d John countered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a perfect murder,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>\u201cCatherine\u2019s was pretty damned perfect,\u201d John said. \u201cI can tell you\u2019re thinking about it, aren\u2019t you, Cam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Preston suddenly wanted to wipe the smug look off of John\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019ve become a monster,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone finds out about Catherine . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d John said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the clear. Now stop worrying. No one\u2019s ever going to find out.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>Catherine had the last laugh. The controlling bitch had ordered her attorney, Phillip Benchley, to wait six weeks to the day after her death to read her last will and testament. John was furious about the delay, but he knew he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Even in death the woman continued to try to manipulate him.</p><p>Catherine had hired Phillip before she\u2019d married John. He was a partner in the prestigious firm of Benchley, Tarrance, and Paulson. Benchley knew which side of the bread was buttered. The old fart had catered to Catherine\u2019s every whim. She must have changed her will at least three times that John knew of while they were married, but the last time he went through her papers to make sure he was still the primary beneficiary was six months ago. After that, he\u2019d done his best to monitor her phone calls and visitors to make certain she didn\u2019t have the opportunity to talk to her kiss-ass attorney again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since her death, John\u2019s bills had been piling up, most of them now past due, and Monk was breathing down his neck, waiting for his money. To placate him, John had had to up the bonus to twenty thousand.</p><p>John fumed while he waited in Benchley\u2019s plush corner office. It was outrageous that the attorney was keeping him waiting.</p><p>John checked the time again. Three-forty-five. He was supposed to meet his friends at Dooley\u2019s to celebrate. He knew they were probably just now leaving their offices.</p><p>The door opened behind him. John didn\u2019t bother to turn around. He wasn\u2019t going to be the first to speak either, no matter how childish that made him appear.</p> <p>\u201cGood afternoon.\u201d Benchley\u2019s voice was cold, damn near glacial.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve kept me waiting forty minutes,\u201d John snapped. \u201cLet\u2019s get this done.\u201d</p><p>Benchley didn\u2019t apologize. He took his seat behind his desk and placed a thick folder on the blotter. He was a little man with frizzy gray hair. He slowly opened the file.</p><p>The door opened again, and two young men John assumed were junior associates walked over to stand behind Benchley. Before John could ask what they were doing, Benchley gave him a clipped one-word explanation. \u201cWitnesses.\u201d</p><p>The second Benchley broke the seal and began to read, John relaxed. Fifteen minutes later he was shaking with rage.</p> <p>\u201cWhen was the will changed?\u201d He had to force himself not to yell.</p><p>\u201cFour months ago,\u201d Benchley explained.</p><p>\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I notified?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Catherine\u2019s attorney, sir, if you will remember. I had no reason to inform you of your wife\u2019s change of heart. You did sign the prenuptial, and you have no claim to her trust fund. I\u2019ve made a copy of the will for you to take with you. Catherine\u2019s instructions,\u201d he added smoothly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contest it. Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t. She thinks she can leave me a hundred dollars and leave the rest to a goddamn bird sanctuary, and I won\u2019t contest it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t quite accurate,\u201d Benchley said. \u201cThere is a four-hundred-thousand-dollar gift to the Renard family, to be divided equally among her uncle Jake Renard and her three cousins, Remy, John Paul, and Michelle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he railed. \u201cCatherine hated those people. She thought they were white trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have had a change of heart,\u201d Benchley said. Tapping the papers with his fingertips, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s all here in the will. Each of her relatives will receive one hundred thousand dollars. And there was one other special request. Catherine was quite fond of her caretaker, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she liked her. The woman catered to her every whim and made no bones about hating me. Catherine was amused by that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Benchley continued, \u201cshe left Rosa Vincetti one hundred fifty thousand dollars as well.\u201d</p><p>John was infuriated over that news. He wished now he\u2019d had Monk kill her too. He hated the holier-than-thou witch with her hawkish eyes. How he had relished firing her. Now she, too, was getting a piece of his money.</p><p>\u201cEvery dime belongs to me,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI\u2019ll fight this and win, you pompous ass.\u201d</p><p>Benchley appeared unruffled by the tantrum. \u201cDo what you will. However . . . Catherine thought you might want to fight her wishes, and so she gave me this sealed envelope to hand deliver to you. I have no idea what\u2019s inside. But Catherine assured me that after you\u2019ve read it, you will decide against a legal battle.\u201d</p><p>John signed for the package and snatched it from Benchley. Venom all but spewed from his mouth when he said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why my wife would do this to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps the letter will explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a copy of the damned will,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAnd I assure you, nothing Catherine had to say in her letter is going to change my mind. I\u2019m litigating.\u201d</p><p>He slammed out of the office. The rage was boiling inside his head. Then he remembered all the bills and Monk. What the hell was he going to do about that?</p><p>\u201cGoddamn bitch,\u201d he mumbled as he got into his car.</p><p>It was dark inside the garage. John turned the overhead light on and tore open the envelope. There were six pages in all, but Catherine\u2019s letter was the first page. John lifted the paper to see what other surprises she\u2019d saved.</p><p>Incredulous at what he was seeing, he flipped back to the first page and frantically began to read.</p><p>\u201cMy God, my God,\u201d he muttered over and over again.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>John was frantic. He broke every law imaginable as he sped up St. Charles, weaving in and out of traffic like a drunk driver at seventy miles an hour.</p><p>Catherine\u2019s obscene letter was clenched in his hand. He kept slamming his knuckles into the leather dashboard, wishing it were her face he was smashing. That bitch! That conniving bitch!</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe what she had done to him, wouldn\u2019t believe it. It was all a bluff. Yeah, that was it. Even in death, she was still trying to manipulate and control him. She couldn\u2019t possibly have gotten around all the safeguards he\u2019d built into his computer. She hadn\u2019t been that smart, damn it.</p><p>By the time he pulled into his driveway, he had almost convinced himself that it was all a hoax. He misjudged the distance and hit the garage door when he slammed on the brakes. Cursing, he jumped out of the car and ran to the side door and only then realized he\u2019d left the motor running.</p><p>He cursed again. Stay cool, he told himself. Just stay cool. The bitch was still trying to get under his skin, unnerve him. That was all. But he had to be sure. He ran through the empty house, knocking over a dining room chair in his haste. When he reached the library, he kicked the door shut behind him and lunged over the desk to turn the computer on, then sat down in the padded chair.</p><p>\u201cCome on, come on, come on,\u201d he muttered, drumming his fingertips on the desktop while he waited for the computer to boot up. The second the icon appeared, he slipped in the disk and typed the password.</p><p>Scrolling down the documents, he counted the lines as Catherine had instructed in her letter, and there on line sixteen, right smack in the middle of the transaction made over a year ago, five words had been inserted. Thou shalt not commit adultery. John roared like a wounded animal. \u201cYou fat bitch,\u201d he screamed. Stunned, he fell back in his chair.</p><p>His cell phone began ringing, but he ignored it. Cameron or Preston or Dallas was calling to find out what was keeping him. Or maybe it was Monk calling to find out when and where to meet him to collect his money.</p><p>What in God\u2019s name was he going to tell Monk? John rubbed his temples while he thought about the problem. Dallas was the solution, he decided. He would let Dallas handle Monk. After all, Monk didn\u2019t belch without Dallas\u2019s permission, and he would surely agree to wait for payment if he were told to.</p><p>But what would John tell the group? Lying wasn\u2019t going to get him out of his nightmare, and the longer he waited, the worse it would get. He had to tell them, and soon, before it was too late.</p><p>He desperately needed a drink. He crossed the room to the bar, spotted the empty silver ice bucket, and knocked it to the floor. When Catherine had been alive, she had made sure the bucket was always full of ice, no matter what time, day or night. Such a stupid little detail, but suddenly important to him. She ran the house from her bed, just as she tried to run him ragged with her whining and her demands.</p><p>He poured a full glass of whiskey and carried it back to the desk. Leaning against the side, he drank it down, hoping it would steady his nerves for the ordeal ahead of him.</p><p>The phone rang again, but this time he answered it.</p><p>It was Preston. \u201cWhere are you? We\u2019ve been waiting to celebrate your windfall. Get your butt over here.\u201d Music and laughter clattered in the background.</p><p>John took a breath. His heart felt as though it were going to explode. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any windfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn, I can barely hear you. Did you say you didn\u2019t get the windfall yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the others there with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Preston answered, his voice cautious now. \u201cWe even ordered you a drink and \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a serious problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a problem do we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not something I want to talk about over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want us to come over there? Is this problem something we need to talk about right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d he shouted. \u201cJust get over here.\u201d</p><p>John hung up before any more questions were asked. He refilled his glass at the bar, then returned to his desk. He sat staring at the glowing monitor screen as darkness descended.</p><p>Cameron and Preston rode together and arrived at his doorstep fifteen minutes later. Dallas was right behind them.</p><p>John showed them into the library, hit the light switch, and pointed to the letter he\u2019d unwadded and left on the desk blotter. \u201cRead it and weep,\u201d he muttered. He was well on his way to getting drunk.</p><p>Cameron picked up the paper and silently read it. When he was finished, he tossed the letter back on the desk and went for John\u2019s throat. Preston blocked him.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Cameron shouted as his face turned red. \u201cYou let your wife have access to our records? My God . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Cameron,\u201d Preston demanded as he pulled him back. \u201cYou read the letter, and then tell me to calm down,\u201d Cameron shouted back.</p><p>Dallas got out of the chair, reached for the letter, and read it aloud to Preston.</p><p>Dear John,</p><p>Long good-byes are tiresome, and so my farewell is going to be short and sweet.</p><p>It was my heart, wasn\u2019t it? Forgive me for being trite and saying I told you so, but it was as I suspected all along. I died of heart failure, didn\u2019t I? Do you believe at last? I wasn\u2019t such a hypochondriac, after all.</p><p>By now you must be reeling from the shock of finding out that I have changed my will and have left you nothing. I know you well, John, and right now you\u2019re determined to contest it, aren\u2019t you? Perhaps you\u2019ll claim that I was out of my mind or too critically ill to know what I was doing. I suggest, however, that by the time you finish reading this, you will have decided to go away quietly and hide. One thing I am certain of is this \u2014 you won\u2019t contest.</p><p>You\u2019re also thinking about all the expenses you\u2019ve incurred since my death. I\u2019ve requested that the will not be read for six weeks from the date of my passing because I know that you will go on a little spending frenzy, and so I want you to be left high and dry. I want you to have to hide from your creditors too.</p><p>Why have I treated you so cruelly? Retribution, John. Did you truly believe I would let you have one dollar to spend on your whore? Oh, yes, I know about her. I know all about the others too.</p><p>Are you fuming, my darling? Get ready for more. I\u2019ve saved the best surprise for last. I wasn\u2019t such a \u201cstupid cow.\u201d That\u2019s right, I\u2019ve heard you on the phone with your whore, calling me such names. I was crushed and angry at first, and so disillusioned, I cried for a week. Then I decided to get even. I began looking through your office for evidence of your affairs. I was obsessed with knowing how much of my money you had spent on your sluts. When you would leave for your office, I would get my \u201cfat ass\u201d out of bed and go downstairs to your library. It took quite a long time, but I was finally able to come up with your password and get into your secret little files. Oh, John, I never realized how twisted and corrupt you and your Sowing Club friends are. What will the authorities say about all of your illegal investments? I made copies of every single file, and just to make certain that you will know I\u2019m telling you the truth, do hurry home and pull up the file labeled \u201cAcquisitions.\u201d Scroll down to line sixteen. I\u2019ve inserted a little message in one of your latest transactions, just to let you know I\u2019ve been there.</p><p>Are you worried? Terrified? I, on the other hand, am gloating. Imagine my joy in knowing that after I\u2019m gone, you will spend the rest of your life rotting in prison. The day you get this, the printouts are going out to someone who will do the right thing.</p><p>You shouldn\u2019t have betrayed me, John.</p><p>Catherine</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Michelle had just finished the paperwork to dismiss one of Dr. Landusky\u2019s patients and was sitting in his cubicle on the surgical floor of St. Claire Community Hospital, trying to summon up enough strength to finish dictating her charts. Nine were completed, and she only had two more to go. Most of the patients belonged to Landusky. She\u2019d been taking calls for him for the past two weeks while he went on a whirlwind tour of Europe, but he would be back at work tomorrow, and Michelle would officially start her first vacation in so many years she couldn\u2019t remember the last one.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go anywhere, though, until the charts were finished. And the mail. My God, there was a stack of unopened mail she\u2019d carried from her cubicle to Landusky\u2019s, and she vowed she wouldn\u2019t stop until she had sorted through it all. Exhausted, she looked at her watch and groaned. She\u2019d been on her feet since four-fifteen this morning. A ruptured spleen from a motorcycle accident had gotten her out of bed an hour earlier than usual \u2014 and it was now five o\u2019clock in the evening. She propped her elbows on the stack of charts she\u2019d already dictated, rested her cheeks in the palms of her hands, and closed her eyes.</p><p>She was sound asleep thirty seconds later. Michelle had learned, while doing her residency, the benefits of catnaps. She had conditioned herself to sleep anywhere, anytime.</p><p>\u201cDr. Mike?\u201d</p><p>She jerked awake. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need some caffeine,\u201d a nurse remarked as she walked past.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to get you something to drink? You look wiped out.\u201d</p><p>Michelle didn\u2019t hide her irritation. \u201cMegan, you woke me up to tell me I looked tired?\u201d</p><p>The nurse was a young, pretty woman, fresh out of school. She had been working at the hospital less than a week, but already she knew everyone\u2019s name. She had just received notice that she\u2019d passed her state boards. Nothing was going to bother her today, not even a surgeon glaring at her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can sleep like that. You were chatting on the phone just a minute ago, and then boom, you\u2019re drooling on your charts and snoring.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Michelle shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t drool, and I don\u2019t snore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going down to the cafeteria,\u201d Megan said. \u201cDo you want me to get you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m on my way out the door. I\u2019ve just got to finish going through the mail and I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>An aide interrupted. \u201cDr. Mike?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a delivery for you down in ER,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you have to sign for it. It looks important,\u201d she added. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not getting sued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Mike hasn\u2019t been here long enough to get sued,\u201d Megan interjected.</p><p>\u201cThe messenger said the package is from a law firm in New Orleans, and he won\u2019t leave until he hands it over to you and gets your signature. What do you want me to tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p> <p>Michelle picked up the completed charts and put them in the out box. She left the two she still had to dictate on top of the stack of mail, then took the stairs down to the emergency room. The messenger was nowhere in sight. The staff secretary spotted her and hurried over to hand her a large manila envelope. \u201cHere\u2019s your package, Doctor. I knew you were busy, so I told the messenger I had the authority to sign your name for deliveries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Elena.\u201d</p><p>She turned to go back up to the surgical floor, but Elena stopped her. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet, Doctor. There was a bad wreck on Sunset, and the paramedics are bringing in a vanload of kids. They\u2019re two minutes out. We\u2019re going to need your help.\u201d</p><p>Michelle carried the large envelope with her into the doctors\u2019 lounge to get a Diet Coke. Then she returned to the nurses\u2019 station, sat down, and popped the lid on the beverage. She needed the caffeine to get her second wind, she decided. She put the can down and reached for the envelope just as the door opened and a paramedic shouted for assistance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a bleeder.\u201d</p><p>Michelle hit the ground running, the envelope all but forgotten.</p> <p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>No man is an island, and Leon Bruno Jones wasn\u2019t the exception.</p><p>The Count, as he was called by his associates because his eyeteeth were noticeably longer than his other front teeth, resembled a vampire when he smiled. Leon looked as though he could suck the blood out of his victim, and if the extortion numbers in his duplicate set of books were accurate, he had taken more than blood.</p><p>Leon had a very large circle of friends, and all of them hated Theo Buchanan. Without Theo\u2019s investigation, Leon wouldn\u2019t have turned state\u2019s evidence and he wouldn\u2019t have testified before a Boston grand jury, bringing down one of the most powerful organized crime rings in the country.</p><p>Theo had returned to Boston a few days after his surgery. Even though Leon\u2019s case had ended and a half dozen high-level mob bosses were now behind bars, Theo still had a ton of reports to file and a mountain of documents to record. His superiors in the Justice Department suggested that he maintain a low profile. Theo had received death threats before, and though he certainly didn\u2019t take them lightly, he also didn\u2019t allow them to interfere with his work. For the next couple of weeks he spent long, exhausting days at the office.</p><p>Finally, when the last paper had been filed and his staff had given their final reports, Theo closed the door to his office and headed home. He was worn-out, mentally and physically. The pressure of the job had gotten to him, and he wondered if, after all was said and done, his efforts actually made much difference. He was too tired to think about it. He needed a good night\u2019s sleep. No, he needed a month of good nights. Then maybe he could see things a little more clearly and decide where he should go from here. Would he take the job of heading up a new crime study that the Justice Department had offered, or would he return to his private law practice and spend his days in meetings and negotiations? Either way, he would be jumping right back on the treadmill. Was his family right? Was he trying to escape life by working nonstop?</p><p>The department heads had urged him to stay out of sight for a little while, at least until Leon\u2019s family simmered down some. Time away from it all actually sounded good to Theo right now. Visions of a fishing line rippling the serene waters of a Louisiana bayou popped into his head. Before he\u2019d left New Orleans, he\u2019d promised to return to give the speech he\u2019d missed, and he guessed now was as good a time as any. After the speech, he could take a little trip and check out the fishing hole that Jake Renard had bragged about. Yes, a little time to chill out was just what he needed. There was another reason he was anxious to return to Louisiana, however . . . and it had nothing to do with fishing.</p><p>Three and a half weeks post surgery, Theo was back in New Orleans standing at the podium in the Royal Orleans ballroom waiting for the applause to die down so he could give his long overdue speech to the law enforcement officers who had come once again from all over the state to hear what he had to say. Suddenly, there she was, inside his head, messing with his thoughts. She had the most wonderful smile, like bottled sunshine. She also had a killer body, no doubt about that. He remembered how, lying in that hospital bed, he hadn\u2019t been able to take his eyes off her. Any normal man would have reacted the way he had. He had been sick at the time, but he hadn\u2019t been unconscious.</p> <p>He was trying to remember the conversation he had had with her when he suddenly realized the applause had ended. Everyone in the ballroom was staring expectantly up at him, waiting for him to begin, and for the first time in his life, he was unnerved. He couldn\u2019t remember a single word of his prepared speech, or even the topic. He glanced down at the podium where he had placed the program, read the title and a brief description of the talk he was supposed to give, and ended up winging it. Because he kept his remarks short, his trapped audience loved him. Overworked and overstressed, they had been given a one-night reprieve to eat and drink and celebrate. The sooner he finished boring the badges off of them with platitudes about putting their lives on the line every day, the happier they would be. His thirty-minute presentation ended in just under ten minutes. Their response was so enthusiastic, he actually laughed. They gave him a standing ovation.</p><p>Later, on his walk back to his hotel, he thought about his bizarre behavior and concluded that he was acting like a boy who had just discovered sex. He felt like he\u2019d traded places with his youngest brother, Zachary. These days Zack couldn\u2019t speak two full sentences without the words \u201cgirl,\u201d \u201chot,\u201d and \u201csex\u201d in them.</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t know what had come over him, but he figured it would all go away as soon as he went fishing. He loved to fish. When he was out on his boat, the Mary Beth, he completely relaxed. It was almost as good as sex.</p><p>Tuesday morning, before he headed to Bowen, Theo had a breakfast meeting with a couple of New Orleans police captains, and then he stopped by Dr. Cooper\u2019s office. The doctor worked him in just so he could give him hell about not keeping his appointment after the surgery. After he finished his lecture about how important his time was, he checked Theo\u2019s incision. \u201cIt\u2019s healed nicely,\u201d he announced. \u201cBut you could have gotten into trouble if there had been any complications. You shouldn\u2019t have flown back to Boston so soon after surgery. It was a stupid thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Cooper sat down on the stool next to the examination table. \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t expect any complications. Mike did an excellent job. She always does,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s as good with a knife as I am, and that\u2019s high praise indeed. She\u2019s one of the best cutters in the country,\u201d he added with a nod. \u201cYou were very fortunate she saw you were in trouble. I offered her a place on my team, even hinted at a partnership. She\u2019s that gifted,\u201d he stressed. \u201cWhen she turned me down, I encouraged her to go on and get a subspecialty under her belt, but she wasn\u2019t interested. She\u2019s too stubborn to see she\u2019s wasting her talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Theo asked as he rebuttoned his shirt.</p><p>\u201cDoing family practice out in the boonies,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cMike will be doing a little cutting, but not much. It\u2019s a waste, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people of Bowen might not see it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they need another doctor, no doubt about that, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>Cooper was fiddling with the lid of the cotton swabs. He abruptly closed it and stood. \u201cBowen isn\u2019t the sweet little town she made it out to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI talked to her this morning about a bowel resection she\u2019d sent me, and she told me her clinic was vandalized. Turned upside down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night. The police are investigating, but so far, Mike told me there aren\u2019t any leads. You know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids did it, looking for drugs. When they didn\u2019t find what they wanted, they tore up the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>\u201cMike doesn\u2019t keep hard drugs in her clinic. None of us do. Patients who need that kind of medicine should be in a hospital. It\u2019s a real shame,\u201d he added. \u201cShe worked hard to get that clinic ready, and she was so happy and excited to be going back home again.\u201d He paused to shake his head. \u201cI worry about her. I mean to say . . . if it wasn\u2019t vandalism, then maybe someone doesn\u2019t want her back in Bowen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m headed to Bowen to go fishing with her father,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>\u201cYou could do me a favor then,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got another box of supplies I was going to take to her, but you could take them for me, and while you\u2019re there, you could look into this vandalism. Maybe I\u2019m overreacting, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s scared. She didn\u2019t say so, but I could tell. I got this feeling while I was talking to her that there was something else she wasn\u2019t telling me. Mike doesn\u2019t get scared easily, but she sounded upset when she was talking to me.\u201d</p><p>Theo left the doctor\u2019s office a few minutes later carrying a large cardboard box of medical supplies. He had already checked out of the hotel, and his suitcase and fishing gear were packed in the car he\u2019d rented.</p><p>The sky was pristine blue, and it was sunny and warm, a perfect day for a drive in the country.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>It was early afternoon, and Cameron, Preston, and John were all chomping at the bit for Dallas to arrive. They had been waiting in John\u2019s library for over an hour and were becoming more and more anxious.</p><p>Dallas was late as usual.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d Cameron demanded the second Dallas walked into the library, looking as tired and haggard as the others. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been running my ass off,\u201d Dallas snapped. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not in the mood for attitude, Cameron, so knock it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we pack up and leave the country?\u201d Preston asked. \u201cAre the police going to knock on our doors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, don\u2019t talk like that.\u201d Cameron broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have to pack our clothes just yet,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>\u201cYou got the copies of our files back?\u201d Preston asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dallas answered. \u201cI didn\u2019t get them . . . yet. I found out what courier service the law firm uses and went there. Fortunately, they hadn\u2019t mailed the receipt back to the firm yet, and I got a copy. I called Monk immediately, and he headed out right away. Catherine sent the information to a relative, a Dr. Michelle Renard in Bowen, Louisiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it. Why would Catherine wait till she was dead to send it to a relative and not just turn it over to the Feds the minute she found out?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>John answered. \u201cI know exactly what she was doing. Catherine was a fanatic about marriage being forever, and she wasn\u2019t going to let me go. She would have used what she discovered to make me behave. The last couple of months, she must have thought I was coming around. I was being so sickeningly nice to the woman. But Catherine was vindictive. No matter how nice I was to her, she was going to send me to prison after she died. Still, I never would have guessed that she would have sent the file to the family she\u2019d practically disowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the doctor sign for the package?\u201d Preston asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch. We\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit interrupting and let me finish,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cI talked to the man who delivered the package. He told me he went to Renard\u2019s home first. She wasn\u2019t there, and so he headed over to the hospital. He said she signed for the package in the emergency room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do we care where she was when she signed for it?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cI was getting to that,\u201d Dallas replied. \u201cThe messenger remembered that, when he was pulling out of the parking lot, he almost ran into an ambulance as it came flying by. He said another ambulance was right behind the first, and while he waited, he saw the medics unload four boys. He remembers seeing a lot of blood on their clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Preston prodded.</p><p>\u201cSo, my guess is that Dr. Renard was pretty busy last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to hang tight because you guess the doctor didn\u2019t have time to read the files and call the police?\u201d Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cWill you shut up?\u201d Dallas snapped. \u201cAs soon as Monk got to Bowen, he drove over to the St. Claire hospital. Sure enough, Dr. Renard had been in surgery. Monk told one of the aides that he wanted to talk to the doctor about a financial opportunity and asked her if he should wait. The aide told him that Renard had two back-to-back surgeries and wouldn\u2019t be done for several more hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d John asked. He was sitting behind his desk, drumming his fingers on the blotter. Dallas resisted the urge to stop him.</p><p>\u201cThe slip showed she signed for the delivery at exactly five-fifteen,\u201d Dallas said, checking a notepad. \u201cI checked with the ambulance service, and the time of arrival at the hospital was five-twenty. So . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have had time to do anything about the package,\u201d Preston said.</p><p>Dallas continued. \u201cWhile Renard was in surgery, Monk put a tap on the phone line to her house. When he got back to the hospital, there had been a shift change in the ER. He took advantage of the opportunity to slip into the doctors\u2019 lounge and search Renard\u2019s locker. He even had an aide helping him. He told her a package had accidentally been sent to the wrong person.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd she bought it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonk can be charming when he wants to,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cAnd she was young. They didn\u2019t find anything, but she gave him all kinds of information about Dr. Renard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Renard took the package to surgery,\u201d John suggested.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cThe aide said she went up with a patient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what did Monk do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe waited. It was late when Renard left the hospital, and he followed her. She made one stop on the way home. She went by a clinic, and she had some papers in her hands when she went inside. Monk would have searched her car then, but she\u2019d left the motor running, which indicated she wasn\u2019t going to be there long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she have the papers when she came back out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone that he could see,\u201d Dallas answered. \u201cBut she was carrying a backpack. Anyway, he followed her home, waited until he was sure she was asleep, then broke in and searched the house. He found the backpack in the laundry room and went through it first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t there.\u201d John made the statement.</p> <p>Dallas nodded.</p><p>Cameron began to pace. \u201cShe had to have taken it to her clinic. Maybe she was thinking she\u2019d deal with it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonk went back and checked the clinic. It wasn\u2019t there either. He assured me he searched everything. Only problem was, he broke a lock on her desk and decided he had to trash the place so it would look like kids had been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is the package?\u201d John was furious now and wasn\u2019t trying to hide it. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the bitch sent it to her cousin. She hated her relatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where it is,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cBut it occurred to me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Preston urged.</p> <p>\u201cShe can\u2019t possibly know what she has.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>St. Claire, Louisiana, was easy for Theo to find. Bowen was impossible. There weren\u2019t any signs pointing the way, and as Jake had indicated, the little town wasn\u2019t on a map. Loath to admit that he was lost and needed directions \u2014 a genetic flaw passed down to the males in the family, according to his sisters, Jordan and Sydney \u2014 Theo drove around in circles until he was almost out of gas and had to stop. When he went inside the filling station to pay, he broke down and asked the attendant if he happened to know where Bowen was located.</p><p>The freckle-faced, slightly cross-eyed teenager nodded enthusiastically. \u201cI sure do know where Bowen is. Are you new in town?\u201d Before Theo could answer, the boy asked another question. \u201cAre you looking for the new high school? It\u2019s over on Clement Street. Hey, I bet you are.\u201d He paused to give Theo the once-over, then squinted up at him and nodded. \u201cI know why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. You\u2019re interviewing for the coaching job, aren\u2019t you? Yeah, that\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re answering the ad, aren\u2019t you? We heard someone was maybe interested, and it\u2019s you, right? It wasn\u2019t a rumor after all. We really need help \u2019cause Mr. Freeland \u2014 he\u2019s the music teacher, but I guess you already know that \u2014 doesn\u2019t know squat about football. So are you going to take the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You haven\u2019t even seen the place yet. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to make up your mind before you even see the place.\u201d</p> <p>Theo\u2019s patience was wearing thin. \u201cI\u2019m not a football coach.\u201d</p><p>The teenager wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cYou look like you ought to be a coach. You got the shoulders, like maybe you used to play some football when you were young.\u201d</p><p>When he was young? Just how old did the kid think he was? \u201cLook, all I want is directions \u2014\u201d</p><p>The teenager cut him off. \u201cOh, I get it,\u201d he said, nodding enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cGet what?\u201d Theo asked in spite of his better judgment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret, isn\u2019t it? I mean, until the position is filled, it\u2019s like a secret. You know, when the principal announces his choice at the big rally in a couple of weeks. By the way, Coach, my name\u2019s Jerome Kelly, but everyone calls me Kevin on account of that\u2019s my middle name.\u201d He reached across the counter to shake Theo\u2019s hand. \u201cIt sure is nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Theo clenched his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to find Bowen. Are you going to tell me where it is or not?\u201d</p><p>Kevin put his hands up in a conciliatory gesture. \u201cOkay. You don\u2019t need to get mad at me. But it is a secret, right?\u201d</p><p>Theo decided to agree just to get the boy off the subject. \u201cYeah, right. It\u2019s a secret. Now, where\u2019s Bowen?\u201d</p><p>Kevin was grinning from ear to ear. \u201cYou see that?\u201d he asked, pointing to the street in front of the station.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I see it.\u201d</p><p>Kevin nodded again. \u201cThat\u2019s Elm Street, but there aren\u2019t any elms on it. I\u2019m a kicker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kicker. Mr. Freeland says that ought to be my position on the team. I can kick a football forty yards without breaking a sweat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be your punt returner too. I\u2019m that fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Kevin, I\u2019m not the new football coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, and I won\u2019t tell anybody until it\u2019s officially announced. You can count on me, Coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bowen?\u201d His voice now had a real bite in it.</p><p>\u201cI was just getting to that,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, if you drive on this side of Elm Street, the east side,\u201d he qualified as he pointed out the window again, \u201cthen you\u2019re in St. Claire. If you don\u2019t know which way is east and which way is west \u2014 I sometimes have trouble with that \u2014 you\u2019ll know you\u2019re in St. Claire if you see sidewalks. Bowen doesn\u2019t have any sidewalks.\u201d</p><p>Theo gritted his teeth. \u201cAnd where exactly is Bowen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d he promised. \u201cNow, if you cross Elm Street, like if you were walking . . .?\u201d</p><p>Theo really hated this kid. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Bowen. Get it? One side of Elm Street is St. Claire, and the other side is Bowen. It\u2019s as simple as that. I sure hope you\u2019ll give me a shot at kicker. I\u2019d be a real asset to the team.\u201d</p><p>Theo counted out the bills for the gas and asked, \u201cHave you ever heard of a bar called The Swan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone knows The Swan. It\u2019s a big old place tucked in the swamp, clear on the other side of Bowen. It\u2019s got a big swan on top. You can\u2019t miss it once you find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me how to find it.\u201d</p><p>Kevin came through this time with directions. When he was finished describing the convoluted route, he said, \u201cYou know the people in St. Claire like to think of Bowen as their suburb, but that really pisses off the people of Bowen. Oh . . . sorry. I probably shouldn\u2019t say \u2018pisses off\u2019 in front of faculty.\u201d</p><p>Theo pocketed his change, thanked Kevin for his help, and headed back to the car. Kevin chased after him. \u201cSir, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo Buchanan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget,\u201d he called out.</p><p>\u201cForget what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I should be your kicker.\u201d</p><p>Theo grinned. \u201cI won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>Kevin waited until the car had pulled out onto Elm, then raced back inside to call his friends. He wanted to be the first to tell the secret news about Coach Buchanan.</p><p>Ten minutes later Theo was driving down yet another seemingly endless unmarked gravel road. On either side were lush foliage and cypress trees with grayish green moss dripping from each branch. It was hot outside and terribly humid, but it was so beautiful and peaceful Theo rolled down the window to take in the sweet, earthy scents.</p><p>He could see murky water beyond the trees as he continued on the road at a snail\u2019s pace. He wanted to stop the car and simply sit there and take it all in. What a great place to do some exploring on foot, he thought. That thought led to another. Didn\u2019t alligators live in the swamp? Hell, yes, they did. Forget hiking anywhere.</p><p>What was he doing here? Why had he come all this way just to go fishing? Because she was here, he admitted, and he was suddenly feeling foolish. He considered turning the car around and going back to New Orleans. Yeah, that\u2019s what he should do. If he hurried, he could catch a late flight and be back in Boston by midnight. Wasn\u2019t that where he belonged? If he wanted to fish, he could take his boat out on the ocean and do some serious \u201ccatch a whale\u201d kind of fishing.</p><p>He was nuts, that\u2019s what he was. He was just plain nuts. He knew what he should do, and yet he kept driving.</p><p>The road curved again, and suddenly there it was, The Swan, straight ahead at the end of the lane. The second he saw the building, he burst into laughter. Honest to God, he\u2019d never seen anything like it. The building had gray corrugated sides and a pitched metal roof. It looked more like a big old barn, and a bit off-kilter at that, but the charm was definitely in the huge swan perched on top of the roof.</p><p>Only, it wasn\u2019t a swan at all. It was a hot pink flamingo, and one wing was hanging precariously by a thin metal wire.</p><p>There was an old battered Ford pickup parked in the gravel lot. Theo parked his car next to it, got out, and removed his suit jacket. He was rolling up the sleeves of his blue dress shirt and walking to the entrance before he remembered he\u2019d worn the suit jacket to conceal the gun and holster clipped to his belt. It was too hot and muggy to put his jacket back on. He decided not to worry about the gun being noticeable. Michelle already knew he carried a weapon. Besides, he was too busy trying to figure out what he was going to say to Jake when he asked him why he was there. He wondered if the old man would appreciate hearing the truth. I\u2019ve become obsessed with your daughter. Oh, yeah, the truth would set him free, all right, and no doubt get him punched in the nose.</p><p>The door was half open. Theo pushed it wider and walked inside. He spotted Jake Renard behind the bar, a dishcloth in his hand, wiping down the varnished wooden counter. Theo removed his sunglasses, tucked them into his shirt pocket next to his reading glasses, and nodded to the man. He hoped Jake would remember him and was trying to figure out what to say to him if he didn\u2019t. What was the other reason he\u2019d driven to Bowen? Fishing. Yeah, that was it. He wanted to go fishing.</p><p>Jake did remember him. The second he spotted Theo, he let out a hoot like a country singer about to break into song. Then he grinned from ear to ear, dropped the dishcloth, wiped his hands on his overalls, and came rushing around the counter.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be.\u201d \u201cHow are you doing, Jake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fine, Theo. I\u2019m doing just fine. You come to fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I did.\u201d</p><p>Jake shook Theo\u2019s hand, pumping it enthusiastically. \u201cI sure am happy to see you. I was telling Ellie just the other night that we\u2019d be running into one another again, and here you are, plain as day.\u201d</p><p>Theo knew who Ellie was. Jake had mentioned his wife when he had visited with him in the hospital.</p><p>\u201cHow is your wife?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>Jake looked startled but quickly recovered, then said, \u201cMy wife passed on, God rest her soul, a good while back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d Theo said, growing more confused. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, who is Ellie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, then you remarried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I never had the urge to marry again after my Ellie died. I didn\u2019t think I could ever find anyone who could measure up to her.\u201d He paused to smile. \u201cI just knew you\u2019d show up on your own. I thought about calling you, but I knew Mike would have my hide if I did, and besides, I figured you\u2019d find a way to come out to Bowen.\u201d</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t know what to make of the old man\u2019s comments. Then Jake said, \u201cI knew once I put the notion of fishing in your head, you\u2019d figure out a way to take a couple of days off. A true fisherman can\u2019t ever say no, no matter how long it\u2019s been since he\u2019s held a fishing pole in his hand. Isn\u2019t that the way of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf you turn out to be a natural-born fisherman \u2014 and I\u2019ve got a feeling you are \u2014 then I may have to pair myself with you in the tournament coming on next weekend. I\u2019ve always partnered up with my friend Walter, but Mike had to yank his gallbladder out yesterday, and he isn\u2019t going to be in any shape to pull his weight. He\u2019s already told me to find someone else. You\u2019ll still be here, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about how long I\u2019d stay in Bowen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s settled. You\u2019ll stay on.\u201d</p><p>Theo laughed. \u201cWhat kind of tournament are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s a big affair around here,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce a year, all the fishermen come from miles around to compete. Everyone puts in fifty dollars cash,\u201d he added. \u201cIt adds up to quite a hefty prize, and I\u2019ve been wanting to beat old Lester Burns and his brother Charlie for the past five years. They\u2019ve taken the ribbon and the cash prize every single year since we started the tournament. They\u2019ve got the fancy equipment, which gives them the advantage. The rules aren\u2019t complicated,\u201d he added. \u201cYou just catch your quota, and the judge weighs them out in front of the crowd at the end of the day. Afterwards there\u2019s a party with good Cajun food right here at The Swan. Say, what do you think of my place?\u201d he asked. He made a sweeping gesture with his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Theo looked around with interest. The sun streaming in through the open windows beat down on the hardwood floors. Tables had been placed against the wall, their chairs stacked on top. There was a bucket with a mop propped against the corner of the bar, and to the left was a jukebox. Overhead fans made a clicking sound as the blades slowly circled. The room was surprisingly cool given the temperature outside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very nice,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cWe do a heck of a business come the weekend,\u201d Jake said. \u201cYes, sir, it sure is good to see you, son. Michelle\u2019s going to be pleased too. She\u2019s mentioned you more than once.\u201d</p><p>For some reason that bit of news was inordinately nice to hear. \u201cHow\u2019s she doing? I saw Dr. Cooper and he told me her clinic was vandalized.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey tried to destroy the place is what they did,\u201d he said. \u201cNo rhyme or reason to it. They didn\u2019t take anything, just turned it upside down. Poor Mike hasn\u2019t had time to do more than look over the wreck. She saw the clinic this morning. Just as soon as she got home and changed her clothes, she got called back for another surgery. She hasn\u2019t had a minute to sort out the mess and tell her brother and me what she wants us to do to help clean it all up. I\u2019m telling you, she\u2019s been run ragged. I expect her to keel over any second now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing just fine, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Theo turned at the sound of her voice, and there she was, standing in the doorway, smiling at the two men. She was dressed in a pair of khaki shorts and a burgundy-and-white rugby shirt that was spotted with paint.</p><p>He tried not to stare at her legs, but, damn, it took work. They were incredible. Long, shapely . . . amazing.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing in Bowen, Mr. Buchanan?\u201d Michelle asked, hoping to heaven her voice was calm. Finding him in her father\u2019s bar had shaken her, and when he turned and smiled at her, she thought her knees were going to buckle. Her heart started fluttering, and she was pretty sure she was blushing. And why not? As the nurses in the OR had said, Theo Buchanan was drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to treat a guest, asking questions like that?\u201d her father said.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get past the shock of finding Theo there. \u201cDid you call him and ask him for his help?\u201d she asked her father with an accusing scowl.</p><p>\u201cNo, young lady, I did not. Now, stop giving me that glare and remember your manners. When Theo was resting up in the hospital, I invited him to come fishing with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, you invite everyone you meet to come fish with you,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She turned back to Theo. \u201cYou really came to fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I \u2014\u201d</p><p>Jake interrupted. \u201cI just told you he did, and you know what I just decided? I\u2019m gonna let Theo partner with me in the tournament next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d she asked Theo, retreating to the comfortable, safe role of physician. \u201cAny complications?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m as good as new thanks to you. That\u2019s one of the reasons I drove out here . . . besides fishing. I wanted to pay you for the dress I ruined, but mostly I wanted to say thank you. You saved my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that nice to hear, Mike?\u201d Jake was beaming like a neon road sign. \u201cIt\u2019s why you went into medicine, isn\u2019t it? To save lives?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Daddy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry, Theo?\u201d Jake asked. \u201cIt\u2019s past noon, and I\u2019ll bet you haven\u2019t had lunch yet. I\u2019ve got some gumbo simmering in the pot. Come and sit at the bar and pass the time while I finish up. Mike, why don\u2019t you get Theo a nice cold beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater will be fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>He followed Michelle to the bar, noticing that her lopsided pony-tail bounced with each step she took. Just how young was she? God, maybe he was going through a midlife crisis. Yes, that was it. Michelle made him feel young again. Except that he was only thirty-two. Wasn\u2019t that a little early for a midlife anything?</p><p>Jake placed a big bowl of thick gumbo in front of Theo and handed him a napkin and a spoon. \u201cBe mindful,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Theo thought he meant that the gumbo needed to cool for a minute. He stirred it and took a big bite. He swallowed. Two seconds later his eyes were tearing, his nose was running, and he was coughing and trying to catch his breath at the same time. He felt as if he\u2019d just swallowed molten lava. He grabbed the glass of water and gulped it down.</p><p>\u201cI think you made it too hot this time,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cHow much of your special hot sauce did you add?\u201d</p><p>Jake handed Theo another glass of water and watched him try to drink it while he was still coughing. \u201cI just added one bottle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed a little bland to me when I sampled it. I was fixing to add some more.\u201d</p> <p>Michelle shook her head. \u201cHe comes here to say thank you, and you try to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Theo still couldn\u2019t talk. Jake had reached across the counter and was vigorously pounding him between his shoulder blades. Theo would have told him to stop, but he was pretty sure his vocal cords had just been cremated.</p><p>Michelle handed him a crust of French bread. \u201cEat this,\u201d she ordered. \u201cIt will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019re ready for that cold beer now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jake asked as soon as Theo swallowed the bread.</p><p>Theo nodded, and after he had taken a long drink of the Michelob that Jake had handed him, he turned to Michelle and said, \u201cI saw Dr. Cooper this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were doing all right,\u201d she said. She\u2019d gone behind the counter and was stacking glasses.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t keep the first appointment. I flew home to Boston a few days after the surgery, but they rescheduled my speech, so I came back. Better late than never,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cYou must have felt half dead by the time you got home,\u201d she said. \u201cPlaying the tough man can kill you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt about did,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnyway, Cooper told me about the vandalism at your clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see, Mike? I didn\u2019t call him,\u201d Jake asserted emphatically. \u201cI suggested calling you,\u201d he admitted to Theo, \u201cbecause you\u2019re the only FBI man I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work as an attorney in the Justice Department,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cStill, the FBI is part of the Justice Department, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut \u2014\u201d</p><p>Jake wouldn\u2019t let him explain. \u201cWhich is why I wanted to call you. I thought maybe you could look into the matter, but Mike wouldn\u2019t hear of it. You know what else those boys did to her clinic? They sprayed those pretty white walls with black paint. Words I\u2019m not going to repeat. They tore up her files too, and contaminated her supplies. Michelle\u2019s got to start all over again. Don\u2019t you, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will all work out. The timing\u2019s good anyway. I\u2019ve got the next two weeks off to get the clinic cleaned up. That\u2019s plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that was supposed to be your vacation time. You were going to rest up and do some fishing.\u201d He turned back to Theo. \u201cMy daughter has always been an optimist. She gets that from me. Now, Theo, what do you think we ought to do about this situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did call the police, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he asked Michelle.</p><p>She looked exasperated. \u201cYes, I did. Ben Nelson, the chief of police in St. Claire, took the report. He\u2019s investigating, and like my father, he thinks it was kids looking for drugs. Hopefully, word will get out that I don\u2019t keep any there, and this will be an isolated incident.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can do anything constructive . . .\u201d</p><p>Jake disagreed. \u201cYou work for the government, and you carry a gun. I figure those folks in Justice wouldn\u2019t give you a weapon unless they had trained you to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, you sound like you want him to shoot someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying he\u2019s an expert. Ben Nelson is a fine chief of police. We\u2019re lucky to have him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut two heads are better than one. Isn\u2019t that right, Theo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that the chief would want me to interfere in his investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be interfering, and I think he\u2019d be happy for your assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Daddy. It was just vandalism. Ben will catch the kids. Give him time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, honey,\u201d Jake said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you go get me a glass of cold milk from the refrigerator.\u201d The minute she was out of earshot, he turned back to Theo, leaned closer, and lowered his voice. \u201cPride\u2019s going to be my daughter\u2019s downfall,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s stubborn and so independent she thinks she can take on the world by herself, but she\u2019s got enough on her plate being a doctor. Maybe it was vandalism. Maybe it wasn\u2019t. But since you\u2019re going to be passing time with us for a few days, I think you ought to look into this situation. Besides, she saved your life \u2014 you said so yourself \u2014 and you owe it to my daughter to watch out for her while you\u2019re here.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder before whispering, \u201cI\u2019m thinking it might be a good idea if you stayed at her house.\u201d He saw Michelle walk out of the kitchen and quickly added, \u201cDon\u2019t let her know I said anything to you.\u201d As Michelle was handing her father the glass, Jake said emphatically so that both could hear, \u201cYes, sir, I think Ben could use another opinion. I\u2019ve had my say and that\u2019s the last you\u2019ll hear about the subject.\u201d</p><p>Michelle grinned. \u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you sass your daddy. I just thought Theo might like to help out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to take a look at the clinic,\u201d Theo offered.</p><p>\u201cGood. Mike can take you there now, and then tonight you can stay at my place . . . or with Mike,\u201d Jake said with a conspiratorial glance at Theo. \u201cWe\u2019ve both got extra bedrooms. I won\u2019t hear of you staying at some motel. You\u2019re my partner in the tournament, so you\u2019re also my guest, and you can eat all your meals free here at The Swan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He said it so quickly Michelle laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think Theo likes your gumbo.\u201d</p><p>She gave him that smile again. That incredible smile. What the hell was he getting into? This fishing trip was getting complicated. \u201cI forgot,\u201d he said. \u201cCooper sent another box of supplies for you. It\u2019s in the trunk of the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was nice of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wooing her is what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a married man, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wooing you to join his practice and move to the big city. That\u2019s what I meant.\u201d</p><p>A knock sounded at the door interrupting the conversation. They all turned as the door opened wider and a teenage boy stuck his head inside. The kid was huge. He had a buzz haircut and looked as if he weighed over two hundred fifty pounds.</p><p>\u201cMr. Renard?\u201d His voice cracked when he called out Jake\u2019s name. \u201cSince you\u2019re not officially open for business, would it be all right if I came inside?\u201d</p><p>Jake recognized the boy. His name was Elliott and he was the oldest of Daryl Waterson\u2019s brood. Daryl and Cherry had eight strapping boys, all healthy and fit, but the family was in a bad way financially, ever since an unfortunate shredder accident at the mill. The older boys were working part-time jobs to help feed the family until Daryl could get back on his feet.</p><p>\u201cElliott, you know my rules. No one underage steps foot inside The Swan anytime, day or night. You don\u2019t want me to lose my liquor license, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I sure don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looking for work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I got a good job over in St. Claire with the packing company unloading boxes on weekends. We were all just wondering how long \u2014 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWho exactly is we?\u201d Jake demanded.</p><p>\u201cSome of the guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they all underage too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, I guess they are, and the girls too, but they \u2014 \u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the door after you, son. You\u2019re letting the flies in. You be sure to give my best to your folks, and tell Daryl I\u2019ll be over Sunday to pass the time with him.\u201d</p><p>Elliott looked confused. \u201cYes, sir, I will, but \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet going now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, don\u2019t you think you ought to find out what they want to see you about?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>Theo started for the door. \u201cMaybe one of them knows something about the vandalism at your clinic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ought to talk to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I was too hasty,\u201d Jake admitted. \u201cIs somebody sick or hurt, Elliott? Mike, maybe you ought to have a look.\u201d</p><p>Elliott was frantically shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean no one\u2019s hurt.\u201d He turned around, leaned out the door, and shouted, \u201cHey, you guys, he wears a gun. Is that cool or what?\u201d</p><p>The teenager whirled around again just as Michelle walked forward. He glanced at her legs and quickly looked away. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am, I mean, no, Dr. Mike, no one needs to see you. I mean we all like looking at you . . . no, that\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m just saying no one\u2019s sick or nothing. Honest.\u201d</p><p>Elliott had turned three shades of red. Staying coherent in the presence of a beautiful woman was obviously beyond him. Theo had great empathy for the kid.</p><p>\u201cDo you know something about the vandalism?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, I don\u2019t, and I did ask around just like your dad told my dad to tell me to do. No one knows anything, and it\u2019s kind of odd \u2019cause usually if kids do something like that, they like to brag. You know what I mean? Only no one\u2019s bragging. Nobody I talked to knows anything. Honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here, Elliott?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t quite bring himself to stop staring at Michelle, but he was able to point at Theo. \u201cUh . . . we were all just hoping . . . uh, that is, if he doesn\u2019t mind . . . uh, maybe Coach Buchanan could come outside now and meet some of the team.\u201d</p><p>Michelle was sure she hadn\u2019t heard correctly. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Coach Buchanan could come out and meet some of the team.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cCoach Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>Theo was at a loss for words. Where in God\u2019s name would Elliott get the idea . . . Then it clicked and he started laughing. \u201cThere was this kid \u2014\u201d</p><p>Elliott interrupted his explanation when he shouted outside, \u201cCoach is coming out. Everybody get ready.\u201d</p><p>Jake was nudging Theo between his shoulder blades. \u201cMight as well step outside, son, and find out what all the ruckus is about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all a misunderstanding,\u201d he said as Michelle walked to the door. Theo followed her and was about to explain, but the second he stepped out into the sunlight, a resounding cheer went up. He looked around in amazement. The parking lot was filled with cars and pickups and kids, at least forty of them, and every single one was shouting and whistling.</p><p>Four young, perky, blond-haired girls moved forward in unison. They were all wearing the same outfit, white shorts and red T-shirt. One of them had a pair of red-and-white pompoms, and she led the others in a cheer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive me a B,\u201d she shouted, and was aptly rewarded with a screeching, \u201cB!\u201d \u201cGive me a U, give me a K, give me an A, give me an N, give me an A, give me an N. What\u2019s that spell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats me,\u201d Theo said dryly.</p><p>\u201cBukanan!\u201d the crowd roared.</p><p>Michelle burst into laughter. Theo put his hands up, trying to quiet the mob. \u201cI\u2019m not your coach,\u201d he shouted. \u201cListen to me. It\u2019s all a misunderstanding. This kid \u2014\u201d</p> <p>It was hopeless. No one paid any attention to his protest. The exuberant teenagers came running toward him, all shouting at the same time.</p><p>How in thunder had this gotten so out of hand? He felt Jake put his hand on his shoulder, and he glanced back at him.</p><p>The old man was smiling broadly. \u201cWelcome to Bowen, son.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>He tried to clear up the misunderstanding, but the boys, obviously high on testosterone, wouldn\u2019t let Theo get a word in as they surrounded him, each shouting to be heard over the others. They wanted Coach to know what their special talents were and what positions they wanted to play. One boy called Moose shoved his way to the front of the crowd and told Theo he thought he would make a good linebacker. From the kid\u2019s size, Theo thought he could probably handle the entire line.</p> <p>He kept trying to quiet them down so he could explain, but they were too excited to listen. In the background, the cheerleaders were doing back flips across the parking lot.</p><p>Michelle wasn\u2019t much help. She couldn\u2019t seem to stop laughing. Then one boy thought he might like to get a closer look at Theo\u2019s gun. Theo\u2019s reaction was swift, instinctive. He grabbed the kid by the wrist and pushed. The boy landed on his knees.</p><p>\u201cCool reflexes, Coach.\u201d Moose nodded as he shouted his approval.</p><p>\u201cYou kids back away,\u201d Jake shouted. \u201cLet Coach and Mike get to his car. Go on now. Move out of the way. They\u2019ve got to get over to Mike\u2019s clinic so Coach can start investigating.\u201d</p><p>Calling Theo \u201cCoach\u201d was only making the matter worse, and from the grin on Jake\u2019s face, Theo knew he was doing it on purpose.</p><p>Michelle took Theo\u2019s hand and led the way through the throng while Theo continued to try to get the kids to listen to him. The pair wound their way around the vans and pickups to where he\u2019d parked his rental car. He opened the passenger door for Michelle and was immediately surrounded again by the high schoolers. Theo was a tall man, but some of the boys towered over him. He couldn\u2019t help but think that, with the right training and motivation, they could be one hell of a team.</p> <p>He gave up trying to explain and simply nodded as he walked around to the driver\u2019s side and got in.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right, center,\u201d he said as he pulled the door closed and hit the lock button.</p><p>\u201cCenter what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat kid with the earring wants to play center.\u201d</p><p>She was biting her lower lip to keep from laughing, but as they were leaving the parking lot, Theo was subjected to yet another cheer, and Michelle lost it.</p><p>\u201cGive me a B!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what those kids need?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. A football coach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, they need an English teacher, someone who can teach them how to spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just very happy you\u2019re here,\u201d she said. She wiped the tears away from her eyes and let out a sigh.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he said, \u201call I did was stop for gas, and this kid mistook me for the coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to be very disappointed you\u2019ve led them on. Oh, my, I haven\u2019t laughed like that in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I could help,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cTell me something. How come no one in this town will listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re too busy trying to impress you. Are you going to let Andy Ferraud quarterback this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a good arm.\u201d</p><p>He stopped the car at the intersection and turned to her. \u201cI came to fish.\u201d</p><p>After a few seconds Michelle realized the car wasn\u2019t moving. He had obviously stopped to wait for her to give him directions, and there she sat, like a lump, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cTurn left here,\u201d she instructed. \u201cMy clinic\u2019s a few blocks down this road. If you keep going, you\u2019ll run into my house. It\u2019s about a block further along the curve. It\u2019s a little two-bedroom house actually. Nothing fancy. I\u2019m rambling, aren\u2019t I? It\u2019s odd,\u201d she added. \u201cI think you make me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should make you nervous. After all . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were, of course, naturally impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour appendix impressed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it takes to make a beautiful woman notice me,\u201d he said as he steered the car to the left.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my clinic.\u201d</p><p>It would have been hard to miss. The clinic was the only building on the gravel road. Theo pulled into the black tarred lot on the side of the building and parked the car near a giant sycamore tree. The branches of the tree draped across the roof. It was a disaster waiting to happen.</p><p>\u201cYou should get someone to trim those branches for you. A good lightning storm and you could lose your roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s on my to-do list.\u201d</p><p>Her clinic was a small, rectangular, stone building that had been freshly painted white. The front door was black, and above the doorknob in the center was a black plaque with Michelle\u2019s name in gold letters. There were two overturned potted geraniums in cement planters flanking the stone walkway. Both of the planters had been smashed.</p><p>Michelle led him to the back entrance of the building. There were trash bags ripped apart, and the metal garbage container had been overturned. The backyard resembled a dump site.</p><p>\u201cI just finished painting the door, and look what they did to it.\u201d</p><p>Across the white enameled door, the word \u201cbitch\u201d had been spray-painted \u2014 spelled correctly, Theo noticed.</p><p>She pointed to a discarded spray can on the ground. \u201cThey got the paint from the supply closet.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the back lot again, then backed out of the way so Michelle could get her key into the lock to let him inside. She brushed against him as she walked past into the back hall and flipped on the lights.</p><p>There were three examination rooms, and all of them appeared to be intact. Aside from the spray paint on the walls, the exam tables and the cabinets had been left alone. The doors were open and the supplies had been overturned, but it didn\u2019t appear that much had been tampered with.</p><p>Her office was another matter altogether. Theo whistled when he saw it. The room looked as if a cyclone had hit it. Her desk had been turned on its side, the drawers ripped out and smashed in, and there were papers everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI meant it when I said I hadn\u2019t had time to start cleaning up,\u201d she warned. \u201cI took one look and called Ben.\u201d</p><p>Theo was looking at an old sofa across the room. One of the vandals had taken a knife to it. The burgundy leather had been shredded, and the stuffing was sticking out like puffed wheat. It looked like someone had worked himself into a rage in this room.</p><p>\u201cLook what those creeps did to my door. I always keep my office closed, but I never lock the door. All they had to do was turn the knob. They went to a lot of trouble kicking it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they had just figured out you didn\u2019t have any hard drugs around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd went crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>She started down the hallway. \u201cWait until you see the front. It\u2019s worse.\u201d</p><p>Theo continued to stand in the office doorway staring at the wreckage.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiguring out the pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat pattern?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHow come your brother and your dad haven\u2019t started cleaning up the place? Jake told me he offered, but you wouldn\u2019t let him touch anything. Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to put the files back together first or at least be here when they do it so I can supervise. The information in the patient files is confidential, and I need to make sure all the reports get back in the right folders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were just opening this clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where did all the patient files come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Dr. Robinson\u2019s files. He left Bowen two months ago and sent all his patient files to me. I found out about it after the fact,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew he hated Bowen, but he really left his patients in the lurch. He told my dad that life was too short to work in a, and I quote, \u2018Godforsaken shanty town.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith that attitude, his patients must have loved him,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t like him much, and they only went to him for medical help when they were desperate. They knew how he felt about our town . . . and about them, or rather, us. You ready to see the front office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He followed her down the hall and around the corner to the nurses\u2019 station behind the reception area. A glass partition that separated the space was shattered, and most of the jagged glass was still on the floor. There was a broken window next to the file cabinets. He slowly crossed the room to get a closer look at it. Then he looked at the floor below and nodded.</p><p>\u201cBe careful where you step,\u201d she warned.</p><p>Though it didn\u2019t seem possible, the nurses\u2019 station was much worse. The countertop had been torn out of the wall and was on the floor on top of a mound of torn files and papers. The fabric on the chairs in the reception room had also been cut. They were all too badly damaged to be repaired.</p><p>Theo was glancing from the reception room to the nurses\u2019 station when Michelle interrupted his concentration.</p><p>\u201cThank God I\u2019m starting a vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than two weeks to get this place in shape again.\u201d</p><p>She disagreed. \u201cTwo of my friends are going to drive up from New Orleans. It shouldn\u2019t take us more than one long day to get files in order. They\u2019re both nurses and will know what goes where. Once the paperwork is put away, John Paul and Daddy can help me paint. I\u2019ve got enough time,\u201d she added. \u201cBut not the money to replace the furniture, not yet anyway.\u201d She picked up one of the chairs and put it against the wall, then bent to shove the white cotton stuffing back inside. \u201cI guess duct tape will work for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to loan you some money.\u201d</p><p>It was definitely the wrong thing to say. She shot upright like a rocket, and the look on her face told him he\u2019d shocked and insulted her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t give him time to figure out a way to do damage control. \u201cI don\u2019t want your money. In Bowen, we take care of our own. We don\u2019t expect outsiders to save the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pride talking. I was only trying to \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp a little lady in distress? I don\u2019t mean to sound rude, but you are an outsider, and you don\u2019t understand how important it is for us to be able to manage the clinic ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved my life, and I only wanted to . . .\u201d Her frown stopped him. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t understand, but I\u2019m not going to press you. I\u2019ll even apologize. I didn\u2019t mean to insult you.\u201d</p><p>Her expression softened. \u201cLook, I know you meant well, but this isn\u2019t your problem. It\u2019s mine, and I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>He put his hands up. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou deal with it. So tell me, what did the chief of police say? Does he have any idea who did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if he does catch the kids who did this, I still won\u2019t be compensated. No one around here has any money. Surely you noticed the absence of mansions on your drive into town. Most of the families have to work two jobs just to make ends meet.\u201d</p><p>He nodded toward the reception room. \u201cThis looks pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a setback, but I\u2019ll recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about insurance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will ease the pain, but it won\u2019t cover everything. I had to spend a fortune for malpractice insurance, and there wasn\u2019t much left over. To save money, I took a huge deductible.\u201d Without pausing for air, she switched topics. \u201cDo you need help carrying in that box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can put it in the back hall and be on your way. Fish won\u2019t be biting this late in the afternoon, but you could get settled at Dad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to get rid of him and wasn\u2019t being at all subtle about it. She obviously didn\u2019t know what she was up against. Theo was every bit as stubborn as she was, and he had already decided he wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll stay with you . . . if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a better cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese days, I don\u2019t have much time to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? You\u2019re already better. Come on. I\u2019ll unload that box, and then we can drive over to your place. I want to see your house, unpack, and get out of this suit.\u201d</p><p>He tried to leave, but she blocked him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>They were standing toe to toe. He towered over her, but she didn\u2019t appear to be the least intimidated. \u201cWhy do you want to stay with me? Dad has more room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re prettier, and he did offer me a choice. His place or yours. I\u2019m choosing yours. Small-town hospitality and all that . . . it would be rude to turn me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean southern hospitality, but you still haven\u2019t told me \u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted her. \u201cLet me get settled in your house, grab a cold drink, and then I\u2019ll tell you what I think about this mess.\u201d</p><p>Theo went to the car, got the box out of the trunk, and put it on the floor in the back hall, then waited for her to turn the lights off.</p><p>\u201cI should stay and start cleaning,\u201d she said halfheartedly.</p><p>\u201cWhen will your friends be coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHow about if I have a friend of mine go through the place first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell me if I\u2019m right or wrong. Take tonight off, Michelle. Then we\u2019ll get your brother and your dad to help. It won\u2019t take us any time at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came here to fish.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, and I will fish. Now can we go get a cold drink?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, pulled the door closed behind them, and headed for the car.</p><p>\u201cCooper told me you sounded scared on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was scared . . . so scared I\u2019ve been jumping at shadows.\u201d She stopped to smile. \u201cMy imagination\u2019s playing tricks on me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought someone was in my house last night . . . while I was sleeping. I heard a noise and I got up and went through the whole house, but there wasn\u2019t anyone hiding in a corner or under my bed. It could have been John Paul. He drops by at odd times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your brother, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be certain. He might have left before I called out to him. It was probably just a bad dream, or the house was making a settling noise. I even thought someone might have been at my desk. It\u2019s in the library just off the living room,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe phone is always in the upper right-hand corner of my desk . . . it\u2019s kind of an obsession of mine to keep the center of my desk clear so I can work, but when I went downstairs this morning, the first thing I noticed was the phone. It had been moved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had this creepy feeling that someone\u2019s been following me.\u201d She shook her head at the absurd idea. \u201cHow paranoid is that?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t tell her she was paranoid, and he didn\u2019t laugh. Unfortunately, his expression on the way to her house wasn\u2019t giving her any hints as to what was going through his mind.</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d he asked, nodding at the house on the curve of the road.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, temporarily distracted. \u201cI have the only house on the entire block.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cFYI. Your house is on a dirt road, not a block.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy Bowen\u2019s standards, this is a block.\u201d</p><p>The setting was incredibly beautiful. There were at least a dozen big trees surrounding her lot. The wood-framed house had a wide columned porch and three dormers jutting from the roof. There was water about a hundred yards beyond. As he pulled into the drive, he could see more trees growing crookedly out of the bayou.</p><p>\u201cDo you get many snakes around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed with relief. \u201cI hate snakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know too many people who like them.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and then followed her up the sidewalk to the front steps. Michelle had a thing for flowers, he noticed. There were flowers in the window planters on either side of the door and more around the porch in big clay pots with ivy spilling over.</p><p>She unlocked the front door and led the way inside. Theo put his bag down in the entry next to an old chest and glanced around. By all appearances the house had been painstakingly restored. The hardwood floors and moldings were beautifully finished to a soft luster, and the walls were painted a pale buttery yellow. Theo detected the aroma of fresh varnish. He propped his fishing pole against a wall and closed the door behind him. When he locked the deadbolt, he saw how flimsy it was. He opened the door again, squatted down, and examined the lock closely, looking for signs of tampering. There weren\u2019t any visible scratches, but she needed to replace it very soon.</p><p>He stepped into the foyer. To the left was a small dining room furnished with dark mahogany table and chairs and a beautifully crafted sideboard on the wall facing the windows. The color was in the rug. It was a deep, bright red with splashes of yellow and black.</p><p>To the right of the entrance was the living room. An overstuffed beige sofa faced two easy chairs in front of the stone hearth. A trunk sat on another colorful rug in front of the sofa, and on top of the makeshift coffee table were stacks of books. At the back of the living room were French doors, and he could see the desk beyond.</p><p>\u201cThe house is really a big square,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can walk from the dining room into the kitchen and breakfast room, cross the back hall into my office, and then walk through those French doors into the living room. There aren\u2019t any dead ends in this house and I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the bedrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stairs are in the back hallway next to the laundry, and I\u2019ve got two bedrooms upstairs. They\u2019re big, but the floors and the walls still need to be refinished. I\u2019m taking it a room at a time. We\u2019ll have to share the bathroom if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she added. \u201cOr you can use the bath on this floor, but there\u2019s a washer and dryer in there. When I\u2019m finished remodeling, there will be two separate rooms.\u201d</p><p>Michelle\u2019s house was furnished simply, yet everything was tasteful and uncluttered, a reflection, he decided, of the woman who lived there.</p><p>\u201cIs that a Maitland-Smith?\u201d he asked as he walked into the dining room to get a closer look at the table.</p><p>\u201cYou know furniture manufacturers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI appreciate fine workmanship. So is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t a Maitland-Smith. It\u2019s a John Paul.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t recognize the name for a second or two; then he realized she was telling him her brother had made the furniture.</p><p>\u201cNo way your brother did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle, this is a work of art.\u201d</p><p>He gently stroked the tabletop as though it were a baby\u2019s forehead. Michelle watched him, pleased that he appreciated her brother\u2019s work.</p><p>The mahogany wood felt as smooth as polished marble. \u201cIncredible,\u201d Theo whispered. \u201cLook at these great lines.\u201d</p><p>He squatted down to look underneath. The legs were ornately carved, and the scrollwork was amazing. It was perfect. Every line was perfect.</p><p>\u201cWho taught him how to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s self-taught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cMy brother\u2019s a perfectionist in some things. He\u2019s certainly talented, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Theo wasn\u2019t finished examining the set. He stood and picked up one of the chairs. Then he turned it upside down and whistled. \u201cNot a nail or screw in sight. Man, oh, man, what I would give to be able to do work like this. With the right care, this chair will last for centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do carpentry?\u201d She didn\u2019t know why, but the thought of Theo doing anything manual surprised her. It seemed contradictory to what she knew about him.</p><p>He glanced at her and saw her surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to work with your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What type do I seem?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWall Street . . . custom-made suits . . . servants. You know, big-city boy.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I do some of my best work with my hands.\u201d Flashing her a grin, he added, \u201cWant some references?\u201d</p><p>The sexual innuendo wasn\u2019t lost on her. \u201cDo I have to lock my bedroom door tonight?\u201d</p><p>His expression immediately sombered. \u201cNo, I would never intrude on your privacy. Besides . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He winked at her. \u201cIf I play my cards right, you\u2019ll come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you this brazen with all the women you meet, Mr. Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, Michelle. You seem to bring out the devil in me.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHonest,\u201d he said, \u201cI really do like working with my hands. I like building things . . . or at least I used to. I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m not any good yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy last project was a two-story birdhouse. I built it four years ago, but it was a failure. The birds won\u2019t go near it. I\u2019m starving, Michelle. How about I take you out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather stay in tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that\u2019s all right with you. You are my houseguest . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s kind of nice, having a Justice Department attorney under my roof. Maybe you\u2019ll keep the wolves at bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still going to lock your bedroom door, though, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It was strange to banter with a good-looking man. And fun, Michelle thought. There really hadn\u2019t been much time for any of that while she was in medical school, and then residency, where all she could think about was getting a nap. Banter was definitely not part of her curriculum.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is I don\u2019t have a lock on my door,\u201d she told him. \u201cCome with me. I\u2019ll show you where you\u2019ll be sleeping, and you can change clothes while I rummage through the refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>Theo grabbed his bag and followed her through the dining room into the kitchen. It was a bright, cheerful, country kitchen and twice the size of the dining room. In the breakfast nook were an old oak table and four paint-splattered folding chairs. There were three double-hung windows above the old enamel sink, overlooking the screened porch and the back lot. Her yard was long and narrow, and in the distance he could see a dock jutting into the murky water beyond. An aluminum outboard boat was tethered to one of the posts.</p><p>\u201cDo you fish off that dock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I like my dad\u2019s dock better. I catch more fish there.\u201d</p><p>There were three doors off the back hallway. One led to the screened porch, another opened to a freshly painted bathroom, and the third led to the garage. \u201cThere\u2019s another bathroom at the top of the stairs. Your bedroom is on the left.\u201d</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t immediately go upstairs. He dropped his bag on the steps, checked the back door lock, shaking his head because it was so weak a ten-year-old could have gotten it open. Then he looked at the windows on the first floor. When he returned to the kitchen, he said, \u201cAnyone could have climbed in your windows. Not one of them was locked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll keep them locked from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to frighten you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as far as the vandalism \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind waiting until after we eat? It\u2019s been a stressful day.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and went to the refrigerator. She could hear the stairs squeak as Theo went up. The old iron bed in the guest room had a lumpy mattress, and she knew his feet were going to hang over the rail. She also knew he\u2019d never say a word about any discomfort because he was a gentleman.</p><p>She loved his Boston accent. The thought popped into her mind as she was stacking vegetables on the counter, and she immediately pushed it aside. Yes, Boston. A world away. Then she sighed. Theo had come to fish and to return a favor, she decided. He would help sort out this mess she\u2019d gotten into, and then he would go back to Boston.</p><p>\u201cEnd of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cI was talking to myself.\u201d</p><p>He was wearing a pair of old, faded jeans and a gray T-shirt that had definitely seen better days. His white tennis shoes were also gray, and there was a hole in one of the toes. She thought he looked incredibly sexy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. I expected pressed and creased jeans, I guess,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d she quickly added when she saw his frown. \u201cYou fit right in . . . except for that gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy when I can give this sucker back. I don\u2019t like guns, but the authorities back in Boston have asked me to wear it until the furor over my last case dies down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had to shoot anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I haven\u2019t given up hope,\u201d he said with a sly grin. \u201cMay I have that apple?\u201d</p><p>He took a bite out of it before she gave him permission. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m hungry. What are you fixing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrilled fish with vegetables and rice. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It sounds a little too healthy for me. I like junk food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. You\u2019re eating healthy in my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter dinner, how about we sit down and talk about what\u2019s going on in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who in this town wants to screw with you,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry, I should have said, \u2018who has a grudge.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard worse,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to have quite a mouth myself,\u201d she boasted. \u201cWhen I was a little girl. I picked up the colorful language from my brothers. Daddy said I could make a grown man blush, but he nipped that in the bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? Soap in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, nothing like that.\u201d She turned on the faucet and began to wash the green onions. \u201cHe just told me that every time I used a bad word, my mother cried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he used guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad talks about her as though . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s waiting at home for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDaddy likes to talk things over with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d she die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a massive stroke while she was in labor with me. She never recovered, and she eventually died.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang, interrupting the conversation. Michelle wiped her hands on a towel and answered. Her father was calling from The Swan. She could hear glasses clinking.</p><p>Theo leaned against the counter and finished his apple while he waited for Michelle to tell him what she wanted him to do to help with dinner. His stomach growled in anticipation, and he looked around the kitchen for something to snack on. The woman didn\u2019t keep any junk food around. How could she drink a cold beer without a handful of potato chips? That seemed almost criminal to him.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d he asked, pointing to the cabinets.</p><p>She waved him ahead, and he immediately started searching the shelves for something more to eat. Jake was doing most of the talking on the phone. Every minute or two Michelle would try to get a word in.</p><p>\u201cBut, Daddy . . . we were just fixing . . . yes, Daddy. I understand. All right. I\u2019ll go right over . . . Why does Theo have to go with me? Honestly, Daddy, the man came here to fish . . . No, I wasn\u2019t arguing. Yes, sir. I\u2019ll call you as soon as we get back.\u201d Then she laughed, and it was such a joyful sound, Theo smiled in reaction. \u201cNo, Daddy, I don\u2019t think Theo wants any more of your gumbo.\u201d</p><p>After she hung up the phone, she put the fish back in the refrigerator. \u201cSorry, but dinner\u2019s going to have to wait a little while. Daryl Waterson is having trouble with his hand, and Daddy told him I\u2019d drive over there and look at it. Daryl\u2019s probably just bandaged it too tight again. I\u2019d insist that you stay here and relax, or start dinner for me, but my car\u2019s at The Swan and Daddy thinks you ought to go with me. Do you mind?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since he didn\u2019t have any intention of letting Michelle out of his sight until they had had a talk about her situation, he didn\u2019t mind at all. \u201cNo problem,\u201d he said. \u201cDaryl\u2019s the big kid\u2019s dad? The teenager who came into the bar looking for me? What was his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElliott,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yes, Daryl\u2019s his dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we could drive through a McDonald\u2019s on the way. Get some french fries and a Big Mac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you just not care about your arteries?\u201d</p> <p>It was the way she asked the question that made him laugh. She\u2019d sounded so appalled. \u201cSure I do. So how about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any McDonald\u2019s in Bowen.\u201d</p><p>He ran upstairs to get his car keys while she went into her office to get her medical bag. Theo beat her to the front door and waited.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got your house key?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She patted her pocket. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI locked your back door. You left it open.\u201d He sounded as though he was accusing her of a crime.</p><p>\u201cI sometimes forget to turn it. We don\u2019t worry about locking our doors in Bowen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas your clinic locked up tight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom now on,\u201d he said as he pulled the front door closed behind them and made sure it was locked, \u201cevery door is secured. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay,\u201d she said as she put her medical bag on his backseat.</p> <p>Theo was backing out of the driveway when he glanced at her and said, \u201cThink we could stop for \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. French fries, greasy burger \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPotato chips,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cToo much sodium.\u201d</p><p>While she directed him down one unmarked road after another, he argued with her about nutrition. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever lighten up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a doctor, so I guess the answer is no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoctors aren\u2019t allowed to eat anything that tastes good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea my houseguest was going to be such a whiner. Daddy likes junk food. You could move in with him.\u201d</p><p>She was afraid she sounded belligerent. Theo gave her the opening to prove she wasn\u2019t a complete stuffed shirt or a prude when he asked, \u201cWhat do people do around here for fun?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cOh, pretty simple things . . . go to the movies, swap fishing stories over a pitcher of beer at The Swan, have potluck dinners at the VFW hall, visit neighbors to compare tomato crops . . . and then, of course, there\u2019s the perennial favorite . . . sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, sure he hadn\u2019t heard her correctly.</p><p>\u201cSex,\u201d she repeated innocently. \u201cThey have sex. Lots and lots of sex.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI knew I was gonna like this place.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>There\u2019s Daryl\u2019s house at the end of the road,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>Theo would have parked by the curb, but there wasn\u2019t one. There wasn\u2019t a driveway either, and so he pulled up on the grassy slope and parked the car next to a battered old Chevy van. The two-story frame house was in desperate need of repair. The bowed steps looked as though they were about to cave in.</p><p>Daryl\u2019s wife, Cherry, was watching for them behind the screen door. As soon as they got out of the car, she came out on the porch and waved to them.</p><p>\u201cGood of you to come by, Dr. Mike. Daryl\u2019s hand is giving him fits. He doesn\u2019t like to complain, but I can tell he\u2019s in considerable pain.\u201d</p><p>Theo took Michelle\u2019s medical bag and followed her. She introduced him. After Cherry wiped her hands on her apron, she shook his hand. She was a rather plain woman with a weathered complexion, around the age of forty, Theo guessed, but when she smiled, she was quite lovely. The nickname, Cherry, obviously was due to her bright red hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard all about you from our oldest boy, Elliott. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen him so excited,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cYou certainly did impress him,\u201d she added with a nod. \u201cCome on inside. I was just fixing to set the table for supper. Oh, before I forget to tell you, Mr. Freeland might be passing by to say his hello. He rang up about twenty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Freeland?\u201d The name seemed familiar to Theo, but he couldn\u2019t remember where he\u2019d heard it before.</p><p>\u201cThe music teacher at the high school,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>Cherry led the way through the living room and dining area. The furniture was sparse and worn-out. The kitchen was small and crowded with a long oak table and ten chairs, none of which seemed to match.</p><p>Daryl was waiting for them. He was seated at the head of the table feeding a banana to the baby in the high chair next to him. The little boy had more of the banana on his face and hands than in his mouth. The baby spotted his mother and broke out in a toothless grin. Then he saw Michelle and immediately clouded up. His lower lip trembled.</p><p>She kept her distance. \u201cNo shots today, Henry,\u201d she promised.</p><p>The toddler burst into tears. Cherry patted the baby\u2019s hand and soothed him with a handful of Cheerios she placed on his tray.</p><p>\u201cEvery time Henry sees me, I hurt him,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cWhen I can afford it, I\u2019m going to hire a nurse and let her give the shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mind Henry. He\u2019ll figure out you aren\u2019t here to mess with him in a minute or two,\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>Daryl stood and put his hand out to shake Theo\u2019s as Michelle made the introductions. The man\u2019s left hand and arm were bandaged to the elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down next to Dr. Mike by that stack of papers,\u201d Cherry suggested to Theo, \u201cwhile she has a look at Daryl\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>Daryl wasn\u2019t too subtle as he shoved the papers closer to Theo. \u201cBig Daddy Jake thought you might find these papers of mine interesting . . . you being a lawyer and all.\u201d</p><p>Theo knew a setup when he saw one. He nodded and sat down. Michelle knew what was going on as well, but she went through the motions of looking at Daryl\u2019s hand.</p><p>After checking the color of his fingers, she asked, \u201cAre you changing the bandage every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, his gaze fully directed on Theo. \u201cCherry changes it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got enough of the gauze you gave us to last another week,\u201d Cherry said. She, too, was watching Theo closely and was nervously twisting her apron in her hands.</p><p>Theo wasn\u2019t sure what was expected of him. Michelle decided to fill him in.</p><p>\u201cDaryl worked for the Carson Brothers\u2019 sugar mill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the accident they let me go. Laid me off permanently is what they did,\u201d he explained as he rubbed his chin.</p><p>\u201cDid the accident happen while you were at work?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, it did,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cDaryl put in twenty-two years at that mill,\u201d Cherry interjected.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d her husband said. \u201cI started the day I turned seventeen.\u201d</p><p>Theo did the math and was shocked when he realized Daryl was only thirty-nine or forty years old. The man looked ten years older. He was as worn-out as his house. His hair was streaked with gray, he had deep calluses on his right hand, and his shoulders were stooped.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore or after you look through those papers?\u201d Daryl asked.</p><p>\u201cBefore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll make it simple. I was operating a shredder, which is a big machine you just can\u2019t do without in a sugar mill, and I told Jim Carson it wasn\u2019t working right and he needed to shut it down and get it fixed, but he wouldn\u2019t listen to me. He\u2019s hard up for money, and I understand that, of course. Still, I wish he had listened. Anyway, I was doing my job, and all of a sudden the belt snapped and the whole darn thing came down on me. Crushed every bone in my hand, didn\u2019t it, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>She was standing over him and thought she might be making him nervous, and so she pulled up a chair and sat down between him and Theo.</p><p>\u201cDid you do the surgery?\u201d Theo asked Michelle.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cDr. Mike sweet-talked a hand surgeon in New Orleans into fixing me up,\u201d Daryl said.</p><p>\u201cHe did a good job too, didn\u2019t he, Daryl?\u201d Cherry added.</p><p>\u201cHe sure did. Because of him, I\u2019m going to keep all my fingers. I can already move them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle is what it is,\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>\u201cJim Carson came to see me in the hospital. It wasn\u2019t a social call,\u201d he added. \u201cHe told me it was carelessness on my part because I knew that machine wasn\u2019t working right, and I went ahead and used it. He called me a slacker and let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a union at this mill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, the Carson brothers would close the mill down before they\u2019d let a union in there. They complain they don\u2019t make enough money as it is to make ends meet and make payroll, and if they had to put up with employees trying to tell them what to do, well then, they\u2019d just fold up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re always threatening to retire and close the mill if anyone makes trouble for them,\u201d Cherry said. She let go of her apron and went to the sink to wet a cloth to wash her baby\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a pen?\u201d Theo asked Michelle. \u201cI want to make a couple of notes.\u201d</p><p>She opened her medical bag and sorted through her instruments. The baby, Theo noticed, was watching Michelle with what could only be described as a comically wary expression.</p><p>\u201cHenry doesn\u2019t trust you,\u201d Theo said, grinning. The baby turned to Theo and smiled. Drool dripped down his chin.</p><p>While his mother tried to wash the banana off his fingers, Michelle handed Theo a notepad and a pen. He put on his glasses and began writing.</p><p>\u201cWhat about worker\u2019s compensation?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cJim told me their insurance rates would go up if I put in a claim and that I didn\u2019t qualify anyway, since the accident was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaryl\u2019s worrying about the other folks at the mill,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cIf Jim Carson shuts it down, everyone will be out of work.\u201d</p><p>Theo nodded, then picked up the papers Daryl had collected and began to read. The conversation immediately stopped, and Daryl and Cherry waited expectantly. The only noise in the kitchen was the baby slurping on his fist.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Theo long to finish. \u201cDid you sign any papers about your termination?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Daryl answered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to tell Theo about the lawyer,\u201d Cherry reminded her husband.</p><p>\u201cI was just getting to that,\u201d Daryl said. \u201cJim sent over Frank Tripp to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone calls him Maggot,\u201d Cherry said. She had moved to the stove and was stirring the stew she\u2019d prepared for supper. \u201cWe call him Maggot to his face,\u201d she added. \u201cWe don\u2019t go behind his back. We want him to know what we think of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, calm down, Cherry, and let me tell it,\u201d Daryl said softly. \u201cFrank\u2019s a lawyer over in St. Claire, and if I weren\u2019t sitting in my house, I\u2019d have to spit after saying his name. He\u2019s a common thug is what he is, and so is his partner, Bob Greene. They\u2019ve got a partnership together, and they work on a monthly . . . what\u2019s that word I\u2019m searching for, Cherry honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetainer,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the word. Anyway, like I was saying, they get a monthly retainer from the Carsons, and it\u2019s their job to take care of any problems that come around, problems like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a sweet deal,\u201d Michelle said softly.</p><p>\u201cWe were wondering . . .\u201d Cherry began, and then nodded to Daryl. \u201cSpeak up, honey. Tell him what\u2019s on your mind like Big Daddy told you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Cherry and I were wondering if there might be something you could do about this, since you happen to be a lawyer yourself. We\u2019ll pay you for your time, of course. We don\u2019t take charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t want to get you into any trouble,\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>\u201cHow would you be getting me into trouble?\u201d Theo asked, thoroughly perplexed.</p><p>\u201cSince you haven\u2019t officially resigned from the Justice Department yet and signed the coaching contract at the school, Big Daddy explained you can\u2019t take money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you get paid by the Justice Department,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cIs that true? Or was Big Daddy just speculating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there is a fee, I need to know the amount so I can start figuring how I\u2019m going to come up with the money,\u201d Daryl said.</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be any fee,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>\u201cThen what Big Daddy said was true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you can do about the Carsons?\u201d Cherry asked again. Her voice was hopeful, but her face showed her worry.</p><p>\u201cWithout making the Carsons mad enough to shut the mill down,\u201d Daryl reminded him. \u201cBig Daddy spoke highly of your abilities . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, did he?\u201d Theo wanted to laugh. He couldn\u2019t imagine what Jake could have said about him. Jake certainly didn\u2019t know what Theo\u2019s abilities were. Theo and the older man had discussed fishing and little else.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, he did, and he thought you could have a little chat with Jim Carson on my behalf. You know, get him to be reasonable. They take so much out of our pay for medical each month, and then they don\u2019t let us use it in an emergency. That doesn\u2019t seem right to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t right,\u201d Theo agreed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could talk to Jim\u2019s brother, Gary. He\u2019s older, and Jim does whatever Gary tells him to do. Gary runs the place,\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>Theo nodded again. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with Louisiana law,\u201d he began, and immediately noted that Daryl\u2019s expression went from hopeful to resigned. \u201cWhich means I need to do some research, talk to some friends who can give me some advice,\u201d he added, and was pleased to see Daryl nodding and smiling again. \u201cSo here\u2019s what I propose we do. I\u2019ll do the research, figure out a course of action, and then you and I will sit down together and I\u2019ll give you your options. In the meantime, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to tell anyone about this conversation. I don\u2019t want the Carsons or their attorneys to know I\u2019m looking into this. Agreed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Daryl said. \u201cI won\u2019t say a word to anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Big Daddy Jake?\u201d Cherry asked. \u201cHe already knows we\u2019re talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Daryl said to his wife.</p><p>A child shouted for his mother, disrupting the conversation. \u201cMama, Mr. Freeland\u2019s waiting on the porch. Can he come on in?\u201d</p> <p>Then another little boy around the age of five or six came running into the kitchen. His face was covered with freckles and he had his mother\u2019s curly hair.</p><p>\u201cJohn Patrick, bring Mr. Freeland into the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>The little boy wasn\u2019t paying his mother any attention. He had squeezed up next to Michelle and had latched onto her arm.</p><p>\u201cWe should get out of your way,\u201d Theo said as he pushed his chair back. \u201cI\u2019ve read through these papers, Daryl. You can keep them here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cMr. Freeland came all this way to meet . . . I mean, it wouldn\u2019t be right for you to leave without meeting him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince he just happened to be in the neighborhood,\u201d Daryl said. His gaze was directed at the tabletop, but Theo didn\u2019t have to look him in the eyes to know he was lying.</p><p>\u201cDoes Mr. Freeland happen to have a legal problem?\u201d he asked Michelle.</p><p>She smiled, then promptly changed the subject. \u201cJohn Patrick,\u201d she said to the hovering child. \u201cThis is my friend, Theo Buchanan. He came all the way from Boston just to go fishing.\u201d</p><p>John Patrick nodded. \u201cI know who he is already. Everybody knows. Dr. Mike, can you tell your brother he\u2019s got to come around again? And will you tell John Paul to hurry \u2019cause I left my kickball in the backyard and I need it. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Lois back?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe boy seems to think she is,\u201d Daryl said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get an ulcer fretting about her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen Lois in over a month now, but John Patrick\u2019s still worried about her showing up unexpectedly. He won\u2019t get his ball out of the yard until your brother comes by again, and he won\u2019t let any of us go out there and fetch the ball for him either. I have to hang my clothes out to dry in the side yard just to calm him. Our John Patrick\u2019s a worrier,\u201d Cherry added for Theo\u2019s benefit, as if that would explain the child\u2019s bizarre behavior.</p><p>\u201cJohn Patrick\u2019s named after Dr. Mike\u2019s brother, John Paul,\u201d Daryl interjected.</p><p>\u201cSo will you tell him?\u201d the boy pleaded.</p><p>Michelle put her arm around the child. \u201cJust as soon as I see him, I\u2019ll tell him you\u2019d like him to come back over. Now, you\u2019ve got to stop worrying, John Patrick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the child whispered. \u201cThe man sitting here . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo?\u201d</p><p>John Patrick nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Michelle asked.</p> <p>\u201cCould I ask him something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can ask me anything you want,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>John Patrick straightened and turned to Theo. Though Theo didn\u2019t have much experience dealing with children, he thought he could hold his own with a six-year-old.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>The boy wasn\u2019t shy. He leaned into Theo\u2019s leg, stared him right in the eye, and said, \u201cMy daddy says Big Daddy Jake says you\u2019ve got a gun. Do you?\u201d</p><p>The question surprised him. \u201cYes, I do have a gun, but I\u2019m not going to be keeping it much longer. I\u2019m going to give the gun back,\u201d he told the child. \u201cI don\u2019t like guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve got it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>The kid\u2019s fascination was a concern, and Theo thought he should probably give a short lecture about the dangers and how guns weren\u2019t playthings. He was trying to figure out how to put it all on a six-year-old\u2019s level, but apparently John Patrick had already moved on.</p><p>\u201cSo could you go outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to go out into your backyard?\u201d</p><p>John Patrick solemnly nodded. Theo glanced at Michelle and caught the twinkle in her eye.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d the boy asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Theo agreed. \u201cAnd what do you want me to do when I get out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you shoot Lois for me?\u201d</p><p>He knew the kid was going to ask that question, but it still shocked the hell out of him. He was speechless.</p><p>\u201cNo, Theo isn\u2019t going to shoot Lois for you,\u201d his father said in exasperation. \u201cYou don\u2019t want Dr. Mike\u2019s boyfriend to get into trouble with the law, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Daddy, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just as well,\u201d Michelle said. She patted the little boy as though she were consoling him. \u201cIf Theo shot Lois, he\u2019d just make her mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mean when she\u2019s mad,\u201d the kid told Theo.</p><p>The screen door banged once, then again and again in the background. \u201cGo and wash up for supper,\u201d Cherry told John Patrick.</p><p>The little boy gave Theo a look of disappointment and then went to the sink.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of a bloodthirsty little boy, isn\u2019t he?\u201d he whispered to Michelle.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a sweetheart,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cIf I were Lois, I\u2019d run for the woods.\u201d</p><p>The screen door banged again, and suddenly the floor under Theo\u2019s feet began to vibrate. It sounded like a herd of buffalo was running through the living room. Then a slew of boys of various ages and sizes came lumbering into the kitchen. Theo lost count after five.</p><p>Mr. Freeland was the last to enter the crowded kitchen. Elliott had to squeeze against the refrigerator to let the man in.</p><p>Freeland could have been mistaken for one of the boy\u2019s friends, except he was dressed in a shirt and tie. He was just a little over five feet tall and rail thin. He wore thick horn-rimmed glasses that slid down the bridge of his nose. He pushed them up with his index finger.</p><p>\u201cMr. Freeland\u2019s the music teacher over at the high school,\u201d Daryl explained.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Mr. Freeland.\u201d</p><p>There were two of Daryl\u2019s boys behind Theo\u2019s chair, making it impossible for him to stand. He reached around to shake Freeland\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Conrad,\u201d he insisted. \u201cCherry, Daryl,\u201d he added with a nod to each of them. Then he turned to Michelle and nodded again. \u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConrad,\u201d Cherry said, nodding back. \u201cHow\u2019s Billie doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBillie\u2019s my wife,\u201d Conrad explained to Theo. \u201cAnd she\u2019s doing just fine. The baby\u2019s only getting us up once a night now, so we\u2019re both getting more sleep. Billie sends her regards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys, move out of the way and let Mr. Freeland sit down beside Theo so they can talk,\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>There was a good deal of shuffling in the kitchen as the children took their places at the table. Theo moved closer to Michelle to give Conrad room.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay but a minute,\u201d Conrad said as he pulled the chair out and sat. \u201cBillie\u2019s got supper waiting for me.\u201d Turning his full attention to Theo, he said, \u201cDaryl and Cherry understand the importance of an education for their eight boys. They\u2019d like to see all of them go to college.\u201d</p><p>Theo nodded. He wasn\u2019t sure what more he was supposed to say.</p><p>\u201cNow, Elliott has a four point in school. He\u2019s going to try to get an academic scholarship, but those are hard to come by,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cHe\u2019s a hard worker and a very smart boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Conrad,\u201d Daryl said, as though he and not his son had just been given the compliment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re thinking Elliott could maybe get a full scholarship . . . with your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how can I help?\u201d Theo asked, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cBy getting him a football scholarship.\u201d</p><p>Theo blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElliott has what it takes to make the cut,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cHe could be good, real good, with the proper . . . guidance.\u201d</p><p>Everyone started talking at once then. \u201cThe St. Claire team was undefeated last year,\u201d Cherry told Theo just as Daryl remarked, \u201cIt sounds like an impossible goal, but you could do it. Big Daddy Jake spoke so highly of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your connections,\u201d Conrad supplied.</p><p>Theo turned to Michelle. \u201cWhy did I know your dad was behind this?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, then smiled. \u201cDaddy likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig Daddy was thinking that if they could see our boy shine on that field, well then, they\u2019d make him an offer and pay his college expenses,\u201d Daryl explained.</p><p>Theo put a hand up. \u201cHold on a minute . . .\u201d</p><p>They ignored his protest. \u201cThey\u2019re always looking for good linebackers,\u201d Conrad said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, they are,\u201d Daryl agreed. \u201cBut Big Daddy thinks that because Elliott is so fast, he could maybe run with the ball too.\u201d</p><p>Michelle nudged Theo to get his attention. \u201cThe scouts do go to the St. Claire games to see the talent.\u201d</p><p>Then Conrad nudged him to get him to turn to him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarted?\u201d Theo asked as he rubbed his temples. He was developing one hell of a headache. \u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>Conrad pulled out some folded papers from his back pocket and put them on the table. Then he reached into his shirt pocket, pulled out a smaller piece of paper and a stubby yellow pencil, and looked expectantly at Theo.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you attend college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Conrad patiently repeated the question.</p><p>\u201cMichigan,\u201d Theo answered. \u201cWhy do you want to know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big school, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Cherry asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Conrad answered.</p><p>\u201cI imagine it\u2019s a fine school too,\u201d Daryl remarked.</p><p>Theo glanced around the table and noticed the others, including the children, were staring at him. Everyone seemed to know what was going on. Everyone but him.</p><p>\u201cDid Big Daddy suggest that you talk to me about schools?\u201d he asked. Good God, now he was calling the old man Daddy.</p><p>No one answered his question. Then Conrad asked, \u201cAnd you played football, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you went on to law school.\u201d</p><p>It was a statement, not a question, but Theo still responded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you stay on in Michigan to get the law degree?\u201d</p><p>What in thunder was going on? \u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cI got my MBA and law back east.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an MBA?\u201d Cherry asked.</p><p>Michelle answered. \u201cA master\u2019s in business administration,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd law too. Don\u2019t that beat all.\u201d Daryl sounded in awe.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, lots of people get \u2014\u201d</p><p>Conrad interrupted him. \u201cWhere exactly did you get these degrees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my, that\u2019s a fine school,\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>Conrad nodded. \u201cI imagine your grades were impressive. I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he asked as he furiously wrote on his paper.</p><p>It all clicked, and Theo couldn\u2019t figure out why he\u2019d been so slow on the uptake. The guy was interviewing him for a position at the high school.</p><p>Theo decided he was going to have to have a little talk with Jake as soon as possible. Set him straight.</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019ve still got your old playbooks too, don\u2019t you?\u201d Conrad asked him then.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Playbooks\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFootball playbooks,\u201d Michelle explained.</p><p>She was smiling sweetly, and she was thoroughly enjoying his discomfort and confusion. He decided he needed to have a private talk with her too.</p><p>\u201cOkay, this has gone far enough.\u201d His voice held a firm, no-nonsense tone. \u201cThere\u2019s been a misunderstanding that I need to clear up right now. You see, I stopped for gas on my way to Bowen. And this kid \u2014\u201d</p><p>It was as far as he got. Michelle wouldn\u2019t let him continue. She put her hand on top of his and said, \u201cYou did keep your old playbooks, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a guy thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, as a matter of fact I did keep a couple of them. But,\u201d he hastily added, \u201cthey\u2019re packed away with all my other junk in the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you have one of your brothers send them to you? You could ask him to overnight them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could go to the next practice with me and look the team over.\u201d</p><p>Elliott pressed forward. \u201cWe sure would appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Everyone started talking again about the team, everyone but little John Patrick. The boy was trying to get to Theo\u2019s gun. He kept pushing the kid\u2019s hand away. He felt as though he\u2019d just been dropped into the middle of a foreign land where no one understood a word he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a football coach!\u201d he yelled. When everyone quieted down, he nodded emphatically. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You heard me. I\u2019m not a football coach.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d finally taken control, and he felt inordinately pleased with himself as he sat back in his chair and waited for the truth to sink in.</p><p>The announcement didn\u2019t faze them. \u201cThese boys are mighty eager to learn,\u201d Conrad pressed. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to pressure you, Theo. No, sir, I\u2019m not. We don\u2019t do things like that in Bowen. Do we, Daryl? We\u2019re laid back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re laid back,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Conrad tore off a piece of paper, bent over the table, and wrote something down. Then he folded the paper and looked at Theo again.</p><p>\u201cThe principal of our school is in Memphis, but I talked to him long distance before I drove over here.\u201d He pushed the folded paper toward Theo. \u201cWe both think you\u2019ll be happy with this.\u201d</p><p>He stood and nodded to Cherry. \u201cI can\u2019t keep Billie waiting any longer, and I sure thank you for letting me interrupt your supper hour. Theo, I look forward to seeing you at our practice tomorrow. Mike knows the where and when.\u201d</p><p>He handed Theo the legal-sized papers he\u2019d placed next to the folded note, shook his hand as he told him it was a pleasure talking with him, and then worked his way through the boys to the door. He paused at the doorway. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have a teacher\u2019s certificate, would you, Theo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so, but I thought I should ask. It\u2019s all right. You needn\u2019t worry. The board of education will work with us on this, you being a special circumstance and all. Good night, everybody.\u201d</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t rush after Freeland to set him straight. He decided he could wait until practice the next day to explain things. Without the chaos that surrounded him in the small kitchen, calmer heads would prevail.</p><p>\u201cMama, when are we gonna eat?\u201d John Patrick asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting it on the table right this minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe should be going,\u201d Theo said to Michelle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay to supper?\u201d Cherry asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cOrdinarily I\u2019d take you up on your offer, but the fact is my stomach isn\u2019t up to a meal just yet. I ate some of Jake\u2019s gumbo, and it was a little too spicy for me. My stomach\u2019s giving me fits.\u201d</p><p>It was a lie, but Michelle thought he\u2019d told it well. Cherry was nodding in sympathy. Daryl looked a little suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWe always have enough to feed our guests.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s from the big city, Daryl,\u201d Michelle reminded him as though that explained everything.</p><p>\u201cI forgot about that,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess Jake\u2019s gumbo would upset your stomach if you weren\u2019t used to hot food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could make you a cup of my special tea,\u201d Cherry offered. \u201cIt should settle you down in no time at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure would appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>Daryl nodded. \u201cFix him up then, Cherry. Mike, do you mind changing this bandage for me while you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>And so Theo drank hot, bitter tea in a hot, muggy kitchen while Michelle rebandaged Daryl\u2019s hand and Cherry fed her children. John Patrick insisted on moving his plate next to Theo, and by the time the child finished eating, Theo\u2019s stomach was growling. It took extreme discipline not to grab one of the homemade biscuits out of the kid\u2019s hand.</p> <p>They left the family after Theo had finished his third cup of tea. John Patrick took hold of Theo\u2019s hand and officially walked him onto the front porch. The little boy tugged on Theo\u2019s shirt and said, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s my birthday. Are you gonna get me a present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d Theo replied. \u201cYou have anything specific in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could come back with a bigger gun.\u201d He let go of Theo\u2019s hand and looked over his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Mama I asked you for a present.\u201d</p><p>Michelle had already gone down the steps and was waiting for Theo by the car.</p><p>\u201cThat kid,\u201d Theo remarked as he backed the car onto the road. \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling we\u2019ll be reading about him in about fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bloodthirsty,\u201d he countered. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. He\u2019s got at least four older brothers . . . right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo how come they don\u2019t tell this Lois to leave him the hell alone? I used to look out for my younger brothers and sisters. I wouldn\u2019t let anyone mess with them. That\u2019s what big brothers are supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still look out for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your brothers still look out for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey try,\u201d she said. \u201cFortunately, Remy is in Colorado, so he can\u2019t interfere in my life too much these days, and John Paul has always been a bit reclusive. Of course, he still shows up at the most unexpected times. I think Daddy sends out an SOS every once in a while.\u201d</p><p>John Patrick was frantically waving to them. Michelle rolled down her window and waved back to the little boy.</p><p>Theo put the car in drive and headed toward Bowen. Glancing back at the child, he shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, that kid\u2019s just not normal.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s a perfectly normal little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLois isn\u2019t a neighbor, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you noticed there aren\u2019t any other houses on this stretch. No wonder you work for the Justice Department. You\u2019re very observant.\u201d \u201cHey, I\u2019m on vacation,\u201d he countered. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to be a little slow. So tell me, what exactly is Lois? A possum? No, I bet it\u2019s a raccoon. God, it\u2019s not a snake, is it? They can dig holes and \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLois is an alligator.\u201d</p><p>He slammed on the brakes and damn near wrecked the car, narrowly missing a big oak when he swerved off the road. Even though he knew alligators lived in the swamp \u2014 hell, he read National Geographic like everyone else, and he occasionally watched the Discovery Channel when he had insomnia \u2014 it still had never occurred to him that there would be any so close to a house.</p><p>And who in his right mind named an alligator Lois? \u201cAre you telling me there\u2019s a full-fledged, live alligator living in that kid\u2019s backyard?\u201d</p><p>The expression on Theo\u2019s face was priceless. He looked as though he\u2019d just found out there really was a bogeyman.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m telling you. The females are very territorial. Lois has decided their backyard belongs to her. She chases anyone who goes out there . . . or at least she did, until my brother moved her. And, by the way, I would appreciate it if you didn\u2019t mention this to Ben Nelson. Alligators are protected, and my brother could get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you people name all your alligators?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust some.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his forehead. \u201cJeez,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to go back to Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot before I go fishing. So tell me, how do I get back to your place?\u201d</p><p>She gave him directions, and before he knew it, they were in St. Claire, where there were actually sidewalks. When he turned the corner at an honest to goodness traffic light, he could see the golden arches looming in the distance.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he sighed. \u201cCivilization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still going to cook a healthy dinner when we get home,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I figured . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserved a treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were starving when you were sitting in that kitchen drinking hot tea . . . because you didn\u2019t grab the biscuit in John Patrick\u2019s hand that you were eyeing like a hungry wolf . . . and because . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let Daddy take advantage.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>A whole day had passed since the package had been delivered. Cameron waited again with the others in John\u2019s library for Dallas to arrive to give them Monk\u2019s report.</p><p>The waiting was making him crazy. Dear God, how had he arrived at this place? What had happened to him? He had had such dreams, such hopes when he\u2019d started out. Where had it all gone wrong?</p><p>Now he felt as though he were trapped in a ghoulish game of beat the clock. Every hour that passed was an hour closer to the iron bars slamming shut on him. When he closed his eyes, he could hear the sound of the door locking him in.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just sit on our hands and do nothing,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a day now. The clock\u2019s ticking. We\u2019ve got to do something and do it fast.\u201d</p><p>Preston agreed. \u201cI say we drive to Bowen tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you propose we do when we get there?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cAnything is better than sitting here waiting for the police to come and get us,\u201d Preston argued. \u201cThe longer we wait \u2014\u201d</p><p>Cameron cut him off. \u201cI\u2019m through waiting. If I have to take matters into my own hands, then that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>John slammed his fist down on the desk. \u201cThe hell you are,\u201d he roared. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together, and you aren\u2019t going to do anything unless we all agree. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did you become our leader?\u201d Cameron muttered. Shaken by John\u2019s fury, he tried to regain the upper hand. \u201cI don\u2019t remember voting for you,\u201d he blustered.</p><p>\u201cI made all of you a fortune,\u201d John said. \u201cAnd that makes me leader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t getting us anywhere,\u201d Preston said. \u201cEveryone just calm down and try to be reasonable. Maybe Dallas will have some good news for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cHow come Monk won\u2019t report to any of us? Why does he have to go through Dallas? He\u2019s getting his money from all four of us, and we should be able to get hold of him any time we want. Hell, I don\u2019t even know Monk\u2019s cell phone number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Cameron\u2019s right. Why can\u2019t we talk directly to Monk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of you are obsessing over a minor detail,\u201d John said. \u201cDallas brought Monk in, remember? Maybe our killer doesn\u2019t like meeting with the four of us because he doesn\u2019t trust us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull,\u201d Preston said. \u201cDallas just likes running him. It\u2019s a stupid power play if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>John was irritated. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn who he gives his report to as long as he gets the job done.\u201d</p><p>Dallas was standing in the doorway listening to the conversation. \u201cYou want Monk\u2019s phone number? Two-two-three\u2013one-six-nine-nine. Happy now, Cameron? What about you, Preston? Want to know his home address? Even I don\u2019t know that, but I could put a tail on him and find out . . . if you want that information too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019ve got good news,\u201d Preston said, ignoring the sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me if Monk has the package, the answer\u2019s no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still hasn\u2019t found the damn papers?\u201d Cameron asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cThe package has to be in the hospital,\u201d Preston said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only place Monk hasn\u2019t been able to search thoroughly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get him back in there,\u201d Cameron demanded.</p><p>\u201cI told Monk to stay on Renard,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cHe can\u2019t be two places at once, and besides, he already looked through her locker at the hospital. Remember what I told you, Cameron? He even had an aide helping look around the ER. He can\u2019t just waltz in there and start opening drawers. Use your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like assumptions.\u201d John made the statement as he rocked back and forth in his swivel chair behind the desk. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced Michelle Renard didn\u2019t take that package with her when she left the hospital. Just how thorough do you think Monk was when he went through her house and her clinic? Maybe he was in a hurry . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cHe\u2019s a professional, and he did his job. Why wouldn\u2019t he be thorough? He\u2019s going to make a hell of a lot of money the second he hands over the package. He wants to find the files as much as we do.\u201d</p><p>Turning to John, Preston said, \u201cGod damn your wife. She put us in a hell of a situation here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet real. We killed her, remember?\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>Cameron buried his face in his hands and leaned forward on his elbows. \u201cJohn, you\u2019re the one who got us into this nightmare, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>John remained calm. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. We have to think about the future.\u201d</p><p>Cameron shouted back. \u201cWhat future? If we don\u2019t get those papers, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>There were six messages on Theo\u2019s cell phone. He went to Michelle\u2019s library to listen and make notes while she started dinner. When he was finished, he called Noah Clayborne and asked him to drive over from Biloxi.</p><p>\u201cIs dinner ready? I\u2019m hungry,\u201d he asked when he came into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNo, dinner isn\u2019t ready,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a bed-and-breakfast. You\u2019re going to help.\u201d She picked up the knife and began chopping celery and carrots. He leaned against the sink watching her.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what all the boys say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a robot with that knife. Quick, precise . . . impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know how to turn a girl\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed one of the carrots and popped it into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do? I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat double cheeseburger didn\u2019t do the trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was just an appetizer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could light the grill for me. There are some matches in the drawer to your right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the grill in the backyard?\u201d He was looking suspiciously out the back window, squinting to see into the twilight through the screened-in porch.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s in the backyard. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to worry about another Lois out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she assured him. And then, as her daddy would say, the devil got hold of her and she couldn\u2019t resist adding, \u201cOf course, Elvis could be in the neighborhood. You might want to take the broom out with you, just in case.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in his tracks. \u201cElvis?\u201d</p><p>She tore a sheet of aluminum foil and was piling vegetables in the center. \u201cOur local celebrity. Last time anyone reported seeing him, he swore Elvis was sixteen feet long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou named an alligator Elvis? What\u2019s the matter with you people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t name all of them,\u201d she defended. \u201cJust the impressive ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking about Elvis. Right?\u201d</p><p>She smiled sweetly. \u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of damned cruel to torment a man who has an obvious phobia about alligators, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer it if you called me Michelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer it if you didn\u2019t joke about alligators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how come I can\u2019t call you Mike? Everyone else does.\u201d</p><p>She was carefully folding the edges of the foil when she answered. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to think of me as a . . . Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t very feminine. How many men do you know who would want to get involved with a woman named Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to \u2018never mind.\u2019 Are you saying you want to get involved \u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him. \u201cNo, that isn\u2019t what I\u2019m saying. Just don\u2019t call me Mike. Now, go light the grill, and stop looking at me as though you think I\u2019ve lost my mind. If you get scared, scream and I\u2019ll come out with a broom and save you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMen don\u2019t scream, and you, Michelle, have a sick sense of humor.\u201d He glanced out the window again and then said, \u201cAh, hell. Alligators come out at night, don\u2019t they? I\u2019m the one who\u2019s lost his mind. What am I doing in this . . .\u201d He was going to say godforsaken place but caught himself in time. \u201c. . . wilderness.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d guessed where he\u2019d been headed, though. The glint in her eyes told him so.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You tell me. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to fish, remember? I didn\u2019t figure on alligators getting in my way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo far, none have,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t come here just to fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m looking for something. Okay?\u201d Now he sounded antagonistic.</p><p>She turned back to the sink. \u201cTell me what it is. I\u2019ll help you find it.\u201d</p> <p>He went outside without answering her. She couldn\u2019t understand where the sudden tension had come from. One minute they were joking, and the next Theo had turned dead serious. On the surface he was a laid-back, take-everything-in-stride kind of man. Still waters . . . she thought. There was a good deal more to Theo Buchanan than his good looks.</p><p>She decided to lighten up. If he wanted to tell her what his agenda was, then he would. She wasn\u2019t going to nag him like a fishwife.</p><p>It was such a lovely, sultry evening that they ate dinner at the wrought-iron table on the porch. The conversation was superficial and strained, but it didn\u2019t interfere with Theo\u2019s appetite. He ate like her father, with unbridled gusto. When he was finished, there wasn\u2019t a single leftover.</p><p>\u201cIf I ate like you do, I\u2019d have to widen the doorways,\u201d she said.</p><p>He leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s so peaceful here, listening to the sounds of the bullfrogs and crickets.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to give him an upset stomach by getting him all riled up again, so she didn\u2019t mention that the sounds in the distance were coming from the alligators. Since she\u2019d grown up in the swamp, she didn\u2019t even notice it. She had a feeling city boy would freak out, though.</p> <p>He insisted on doing the dishes. Since she didn\u2019t have a dishwasher, he had to do them by hand. She put the seasonings away while he washed the silverware, then grabbed a towel and started drying.</p><p>\u201cHow come you aren\u2019t married?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing anyone now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Good, he thought. He had no intention of hanging around Bowen, but while he was here, he didn\u2019t want any other man getting in his way. And that made him a heartless son of a bitch, he thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the most ferocious look on your face.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a selfish bastard. That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. \u201cI\u2019m wondering why you don\u2019t have men chasing you. One look and any man would know . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the goods.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat a romantic way to give a girl a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m from Boston, remember? Men are raised to be blunt. Are there any men around here you\u2019re interested in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Ben Nelson would like to get something going, but I\u2019m not going to encourage him. Ben\u2019s nice, but there isn\u2019t any chemistry between us. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. Like the chemistry between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d He handed her a plate to dry, noticed it was still streaked with soap bubbles, and snatched it back to rinse again. \u201cYou\u2019ve been wanting to jump my bones since the minute I walked into your dad\u2019s bar.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d hit that nail on the head, but she wasn\u2019t about to admit it. \u201cJump your bones? I think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m simply calling it like it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you come up with that notion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw it in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou were too busy looking at my legs.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t appear the least chagrined. \u201cThey\u2019re fine-looking legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit there is a certain physical attraction, but that\u2019s perfectly healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a lead-in to a lecture about hormones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on how long I\u2019m going to have to stand here and wait for you to finish washing that bowl. You don\u2019t do a lot of dishes, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m slow and easy with everything I do.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what he said but how he said it that made her heartbeat escalate. Was he slow and easy in bed? Oh, Lord, wouldn\u2019t that be something?</p><p>\u201cYou were married, weren\u2019t you?\u201d She blurted out the question.</p><p>\u201cYes, I was. I wasn\u2019t very good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and put another dish away in the cabinet. \u201cThat\u2019s what Daddy told me. How did she die?\u201d</p><p>He handed her a salad bowl. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m being too intrusive, I won\u2019t ask any more questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. She died in a car crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Theo, I\u2019m sorry. How long ago did the accident happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d</p><p>There was absolutely no inflection in his voice. He might as well have been talking about a leaky faucet.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t an accident. You know what? This is the first time since it happened four years ago that I\u2019ve said it out loud.\u201d She could tell by his demeanor that he wanted her to change the subject, but she wouldn\u2019t accommodate him. It wasn\u2019t morbid curiosity on her part. If it had taken him four years to be able to admit the truth, then maybe it was time he got it all out.</p><p>\u201cIt was a suicide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d</p><p>He handed her another bowl. \u201cI don\u2019t think she meant to kill herself. At least not that way. My wife was taking the slow route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlcohol and drugs.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything but waited until he continued.</p><p>\u201cShe mixed alcohol with all the pills and God knows what else already in her system. It was a lethal combination. At least that\u2019s what the autopsy report indicated. She was out of control behind the wheel. She drove the car over a bridge into the bay. A hell of a way to end it, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cI doubt she even knew what was happening to her, and I thank God she didn\u2019t take anyone else with her.\u201d</p><p>It took extreme discipline not to show any outward reaction to what he had just told her. Theo was a proud man, and she knew that if she showed any compassion or sympathy, he would close up on her, and she didn\u2019t want that to happen.</p><p>\u201cYour friends and your family . . . do any of them know what really happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Nick guessed something was wrong, but he never said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was waiting for you to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how far she should push. Leaning against the sink, she carefully folded the wet towel and asked, \u201cDo you blame yourself?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, as though the question weren\u2019t important. \u201cI\u2019ve come to terms with what happened. It sure convinced me I wasn\u2019t cut out for marriage. I put everything in front of it. I should have been paying more attention to her, though. I was so busy at work, putting in twenty-hour days, and I didn\u2019t notice what was going on at home. Hell, I knew she drank, but I didn\u2019t realize it had become a problem. I think that\u2019s called \u2018burying your head in the sand.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made the choice. I know I sound unsympathetic, but you didn\u2019t pour the pills or the alcohol down her throat. She did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage is a partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t hold up my end of the agreement. She was . . . fragile. Yeah, fragile. She needed help, but I was too blind to see it. Maybe I didn\u2019t want to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s healthy that you\u2019re finally able to talk about what happened. Now maybe you can get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet rid of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe anger and the hurt and the guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn shrink on me.\u201d He handed her a spatula to put away, then drained the sink. \u201cThere, I\u2019m finished,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you have any more questions, or can we move on?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to ask him if he had loved his wife, but she didn\u2019t dare. She had pushed him as far as he was willing to go. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll move on. Dinner\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you to be patient until after dinner. Now I\u2019d like you to tell me what you think about my clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to,\u201d he promised. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He left the kitchen and headed upstairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she called up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna get my laptop and set it up in your library,\u201d he called back. \u201cI\u2019ve got to check my e-mail.\u201d He paused at the top of the stairs and looked down at her. \u201cHopefully, I\u2019ll have some answers. Then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Michelle went back into the kitchen and washed the countertops. When she was finished, she turned the light off and went upstairs. She stood in the doorway of her guest room. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower. It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p><p>He was bent over the bed, unlocking his attach\u00e9 case. He\u2019d already unpacked his duffel bag. His clothes were folded on her dresser.</p><p>The room was a mess. There were boxes piled high in front of the windows facing the backyard. She hadn\u2019t bothered to dust or vacuum the area rug, and she was pretty sure there were cobwebs in all the corners.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been using this room for storage,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that old bed is going to give your back fits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re longer than the bed,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAnd the mattress is lumpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I can sleep anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still feeling guilty. I guess you could have my bed. It\u2019s king-sized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He stood and gave her the look. She recognized it instantly. She\u2019d seen enough late-night movies and had been around enough men on the prowl to recognize it. Theo made the look sexier than Mel Gibson did, and God only knew, she\u2019d always been a sucker for Mel.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d She laughed after she gave the order. \u201cJust stop it right now.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. Oh, God, now he was doing Cary Grant.</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>What could she say? Stop looking at me as though I just asked you to get na*ed and have hot, mind-altering sex with me?</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she said. \u201cSo do you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep in your bed? What an invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to share your bed?\u201d</p><p>Oh, boy, did she want to. How long had it been since she\u2019d been involved with a man? She couldn\u2019t remember. Probably because it had ended in disaster and she had deliberately blocked the memory.</p><p>Slow and easy. Oh, boy.</p><p>Her throat felt like it was closing up on her. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>If she were thirty years older, she would have thought she was having a hot flash. Her entire body felt as though it was on fire, and she was having difficulty catching her breath. Her endorphins were going crazy too. She was feeling light-headed. If he took another step toward her, she knew she\u2019d start hyperventilating. And wouldn\u2019t that be a wonderful turn-on. Men weren\u2019t the only ones who needed to take a cold shower to squelch their sexual appetites. She felt like she needed to dive headfirst into her freezer.</p><p>She blamed him for her scattered thoughts. He was the one giving her the look, after all.</p><p>He was slowly walking forward, obviously giving her time to make up her mind. Her feet were rooted to the floor and her stomach started tingling. \u201cIt would complicate things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d have sex, and then \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat sex,\u201d he corrected. \u201cWe\u2019d have great sex.\u201d</p><p>He had her thinking about it, and the look in his eyes told her he was thinking about it too. She nodded, tried to swallow, but her throat was too dry. Her pulse was racing. Probably a hundred sixty beats per minute. Irregular too. Great, she thought, a gorgeous man flirts with her and she goes into ventricular fibrillation. If he took another step, she thought she just might drop dead. Wouldn\u2019t that be something? The pathology report would show cause of death was cardiac arrest.</p><p>He stopped a foot away from her. He gently stroked her cheek with his fingers and then nudged her under her chin, forcing her to look up at him. She felt awkward and unsure, until she saw the laughter in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you thinking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>As if he didn\u2019t know. \u201cThat you\u2019re making me nuts. Theo, you might as well understand before this goes any further . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he asked softly. His hand had moved to her neck, his touch warm.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I need to understand something.\u201d</p><p>He was rubbing the back of her neck now. She got goose bumps.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d She nodded. \u201cNo, I mean . . . oh.\u201d Breathe, she told herself. Take a deep breath and try to locate your brain. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the way it is. I\u2019m not cut out for a casual fling. I have to have a . . . solid connection with a man before I go to bed with him. I don\u2019t believe in recreational sex.\u201d She forced a smile in hopes of lightening the moment and added, \u201cI\u2019m a dinosaur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention I like dinosaurs?\u201d</p><p>Oh, boy, she inwardly sighed. Oh, boy.</p><p>His fingers gently played with the hair at the nape of her neck. \u201cYour hair is so soft,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe color\u2019s like fire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI get the red hair and freckles from my mother,\u201d she answered, grasping for a rational thought.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention I like women with freckles? I get this overwhelming urge to kiss every one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got freckles all over my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to those.\u201d</p> <p>She felt light-headed again. \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Lord, he was cocky. He really needed to work on that flaw, and she meant to tell him so when her head cleared. Right now, she was too busy trying to stand on her feet. The man aroused her simply by touching her. Every nerve ending in her body responded to him.</p><p>When she realized she wanted to tear his clothes off, she pulled back. She gently pushed his arm away. Her legs felt like Jell-O, but she managed to turn and walk to her bedroom. As she was shutting the door behind her, she made the mistake of looking at him. He was leaning against the doorframe smiling at her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to let him know how potent his touch was. Mr. Big City Boy needed to be taught a lesson. He wouldn\u2019t get his way.</p> <p>\u201cYou mess with me and you pay the consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can take a cold shower after I do.\u201d How telling was that? Too late, she realized what she\u2019d given away. \u201cI\u2019m taking a cold shower because I\u2019m hot,\u201d she explained, and then realized she\u2019d only made it worse.</p><p>\u201cMichelle?\u201d he drawled out.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t begun to mess with you.\u201d</p><p>She shut the door and leaned against it. \u201cOh, boy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p> <p>Michelle was counting all the reasons she shouldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t get involved with Theo. She\u2019d gotten up to number twenty when he knocked on the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t taken my shower yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I was just wondering if you wanted me to hook up your computer for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found it?\u201d</p><p>She opened the door a crack and peeped out, holding her cotton robe together across her breasts.</p><p>\u201cIt was hard to miss. I tripped over one of the boxes when I put my clothes on the washer. So do you want me to or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHook up my computer? Sure,\u201d she said.</p><p>She shut the door in his face and started counting all over again. When she got to number twenty-three \u2014 she\u2019d have to change the sheets \u2014 she realized she was getting desperate and went back to the number one reason. The man would break her heart.</p> <p>She stepped into the bathtub and turned the shower on full blast. The icy cold water made her grimace. She adjusted the temperature and let the warm water soothe her.</p><p>By the time she rinsed the shampoo from her hair, she\u2019d worked herself back up into a fit of indignation. Mess with her indeed. She wasn\u2019t so easily manipulated, she thought as she combed the tangles out of her hair and then turned on the blow dryer.</p><p>He\u2019d probably be a demanding lover . . .</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d she whispered. Slow and easy. Would she ever get those words out of her mind? It was like a song that kept replaying in her head.</p><p>She brushed her teeth, then put moisturizer on her face and stared at herself in the mirror. \u201cAdmit it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou want to sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. No, that wasn\u2019t true. She wanted to have sex with him. And what was wrong with that? Absolutely nothing. She was merely fantasizing, and fantasy was a perfectly healthy function of the human psyche.</p><p>Acting upon the fantasy was another matter altogether. Reason number one . . . that heartbreaking thing . . . \u201cBeen there, done that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Oh, no, she wasn\u2019t going to get involved with Theo Buchanan. And so she didn\u2019t put on one of the short nightgowns that she usually wore to bed. She got her long blue silk pajamas out of her bottom drawer instead. She buttoned every button, including the top one. The mandarin collar rubbed the sensitive skin underneath her chin. She reached for the matching blue slippers, but rejected those and found an old pair of thick white terry-cloth slip-ons under her bed. She brushed her hair to get it out of her eyes, dabbed on a little colorless, moisturizing lip gloss, then hunted through her closet and dug out her heavy white flannel robe. The hem dragged on the floor. The robe had buttons and she secured every one of them. It also had a belt. She double knotted it.</p><p>Then she looked at herself in the mirror. Good, she thought. She looked like a nun.</p><p>Theo was in the library. He\u2019d unloaded the computer equipment and had it up and running by the time she came downstairs. He was reading something on the monitor. He glanced over the top of his horn-rimmed glasses at her when she entered the room, and his gaze froze. In a flash he noticed every little detail about her \u2014 how the blue pajamas matched the color of her eyes; how her hair, down around her shoulders, shimmered like russet gold in the soft light; how, without an ounce of makeup, she looked beautiful.</p><p>She was dressed for bed . . . as long as the bed was in Antarctica. Michelle was a physician, but she sure didn\u2019t know anything about how a man\u2019s mind worked. All those clothes . . . they just made him fantasize about what was underneath.</p><p>His imagination went to work, and he pictured her stripping off each layer before slipping between the covers. Ah, hell, don\u2019t think about it, he warned himself. For the love of God, don\u2019t think about the soft, warm skin underneath all that fabric.</p><p>Michelle walked over to the desk. Feeling extremely self-conscious because of the way he was staring at her, she fiddled with the knot in her belt and asked, \u201cSo? What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo?\u201d she asked when he didn\u2019t immediately answer. He had a funny smile on his face now and was staring at her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you expecting a snowstorm tonight?\u201d</p><p>Her hand went to her throat. \u201cI was chilly.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI get cold when the air conditioner is on. I turned it down so you would be comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Now she felt stupid because he wasn\u2019t buying her lie.</p><p>\u201cCute bunny slippers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re finished mocking me, answer my question. What do you think . . . about my computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ancient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop staring at my slippers?\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, she leaned against the side of the desk and removed the slippers. Theo laughed again when he saw that she was wearing socks.</p><p>\u201cNow what\u2019s so funny?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering if you were wearing long underwear too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t own any long underwear,\u201d she countered. \u201cNow, will you answer my question. Does my computer work or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother Remy gave it to me. He picked it up secondhand the last time he was home. I haven\u2019t had time to set it up. I\u2019ve only been in the house a couple of weeks. John Paul wanted to put another coat of varnish on the floors, and if you knew my brother, you\u2019d understand he does things on his own schedule. I\u2019ve been using the computer at the hospital. I know this one is outdated, but eventually, when I can afford it, I\u2019ll get a newer one.\u201d</p><p>Theo angled the screen near the corner of the desk, adjusted the keypad the way he thought she\u2019d want it, then leaned back in the soft leather chair. \u201cSo, whoever is following you . . . he isn\u2019t some broken-hearted guy you dumped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going over it again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t been involved with anyone. Besides that, I\u2019m a physician. I don\u2019t break hearts. I \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. You fix them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I refer them.\u201d</p><p>His laptop was on the opposite side of the desk. It was a slick, expensive piece of equipment. As she was examining it, a big red E floated across the screen. It was followed by a single beep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got mail.\u201d</p><p>He reached over, touched a key, and saw who had sent him the message. She read the name before he hit the key and the screen went blank.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if he was waiting until later to read the message because he knew it wasn\u2019t important or because he didn\u2019t want her to read it.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read the name,\u201d she explained even though he hadn\u2019t asked. \u201cYou were talking to him on the phone earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes; he called. He must have been waiting by his computer, because I just sent him a message a couple of minutes ago, while you were in the shower, and he already responded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to read the message now, I\u2019ll go in the other room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. You can read it with me. You won\u2019t understand it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo technical?\u201d</p><p>Before she could take issue, he said, \u201cToo Noah. If you knew him, you\u2019d understand. The guy\u2019s got a warped sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make that sound like a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said. \u201cIn his line of work, it helps to be a little warped.\u201d</p><p>Theo hit a button and waited. Michelle leaned over his shoulder so she could read the message. It was convoluted, and didn\u2019t make any sense to her.</p><p>\u201cIs it in code?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered gruffly. Damn, he wished she\u2019d move back. He could smell the clean scent of her shampoo, feel the heat from her soft body.</p><p>He tensed in reaction. He pictured himself pulling her onto his lap and kissing the breath out of her. Then he expanded the fantasy until he was thinking about all the other things he wanted to do with her and to her. He\u2019d start with her toes and work his way up until he had every button undone and he was \u2014</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Mary Beth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah said he never thanked you for letting him use Mary Beth the last time he was in Boston. You boys share your women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Beth is a fishing boat. I invited Noah to drive to Bowen to go fishing. I told him about the tournament, and he wants me to sign him up. He\u2019s going crazy in Biloxi. He\u2019s doing a training program, and he hates it.\u201d He turned back to the monitor, removed his glasses, and set them on the desk. He was having trouble concentrating now. It was all he could do to restrain himself from grabbing her. What the hell was the matter with him? Michelle was a complication he didn\u2019t need now. She wasn\u2019t the love-her-and-then-leave-her type of woman, and he wouldn\u2019t be staying around.</p><p>He knew he wasn\u2019t making any sense. He had come to Bowen because of her, and yet . . .</p><p>She poked him in the shoulder to get his attention. \u201cWho\u2019s Priest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather Tom Madden,\u201d he answered. \u201cHe\u2019s like a brother,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen he was just starting grade school, he moved in with our family. He\u2019s Nick\u2019s age, and the two of them are best friends. They went to Penn State together. Nick\u2019s going to marry Tommy\u2019s little sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does Noah call him Priest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, and I\u2019m quoting Noah now, \u2018It pisses him off.\u2019 That\u2019s why he does it. Tommy lets him get away with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Noah almost died saving Tommy\u2019s life. He drives Tommy crazy, but they\u2019ve actually become good friends. The three of them go fishing every once in a while,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded, then asked, \u201cThat last line Noah wrote . . . what does he mean, \u2018regarding the other, no problem\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means he knows I\u2019m out of my element here, and so he\u2019s going to check out a couple of things for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour answer is as ambiguous as his message.\u201d</p><p>She walked away from the desk and opened the French doors connecting the library to the living room. There were medical journals strewn along her sofa. She picked them up, stacked them on an end table, and sat down with a sigh.</p><p>She lifted her hair up so her neck would get some air. God, she was hot. The heavy robe was suffocating her. She picked up one of the journals and was going to fan her face, then realized how telling that would be and put the magazine down.</p><p>Theo leaned back in his chair and peered around the half-open door. \u201cAre you okay? You look a little flushed.\u201d</p><p>The man didn\u2019t miss anything. \u201cI\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince four or five.\u201d</p><p>He finished typing into his computer. \u201cI\u2019ll leave this on,\u201d he said. Then he stood, stretched, and rolled his shoulders.</p><p>He reminded her of a big old tomcat. \u201cHow come you packed your laptop? Going to check your e-mail while you\u2019re fishing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like my cell phone. I never leave home without it. Do you want something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, but you help yourself.\u201d</p><p>Theo went into the kitchen, grabbed a Diet Coke out of the refrigerator, then searched through her pantry. He found an unopened box of low-fat, low-sodium Triscuits and carried the box with him back to the living room.</p><p>He sat down in the big, overstuffed easy chair, kicked his shoes off, and swung his feet up on the matching ottoman. Placing his drink on a cardboard box next to the chair, he held up the Triscuits and said, \u201cWant some of these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just brushed my teeth. Do you ever fill up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on stuff like this.\u201d</p><p>He opened the box and began to munch on the crackers. \u201cI\u2019ve got some friends making calls and a couple of my interns doing some research for me. It isn\u2019t a tough assignment, so hopefully, they\u2019ll e-mail me tonight and have everything ready to go tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustice Department work while you\u2019re on vacation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar mill work.\u201d</p><p>She perked up. \u201cOh? Do you think you might be able to help Daryl and his family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to try. What do you know about the Carson brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d she admitted. \u201cYou should talk to Daddy. He\u2019s known the brothers for years. He can answer your questions. This is a small community, so information is pretty easy to get. Everybody keeps up on what everybody else is doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, no one knows anything about the break-in at the clinic,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI\u2019ve given it some thought, and I don\u2019t believe kids trashed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you think?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was a one-man operation. I could be wrong, but I don\u2019t think I am. There was a pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What do you mean by \u2018a pattern\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was order to the chaos. He came in through the back door \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the window in the reception area was broken.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe broke it while he was inside. That was easy to figure out. The glass fragments prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do this kind of thing for a living,\u201d he said. \u201cI prosecute. But if they were kids looking for drugs, as your dad and your friend Ben Nelson believe, then how come the examination rooms were barely touched?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe glass and the locks were broken in the medicine cabinets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the needles and the prescription pads were still there. And what about the files, Michelle? Why would someone take the time to go through boxes of files?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe they were just throwing things left and right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis didn\u2019t look like a simple case of vandalism to me. Kids who set out to vandalize . . . they bring along their own fun equipment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpray paint,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guy who did this used your paint to mess up the rooms. Makes me think he didn\u2019t come prepared to tear things up. And the trash bags in the yard looked like someone had gone through them. There wasn\u2019t a scratch on the lock on your back door, which tells me that he had the right tools and knew how to use them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in a professional?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. \u201cNoah\u2019s going to be here tomorrow. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like you to leave the clinic the way it is until he\u2019s finished looking around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed. Her friends weren\u2019t coming to help until the day after. She could wait until then. \u201cWhat does Noah do for a living?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a specific answer but said, \u201cHe\u2019s FBI,\u201d and left it at that.</p><p>\u201cFBI?\u201d She couldn\u2019t hide her alarm. \u201cThen you must think \u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted her. \u201cDon\u2019t jump to conclusions. Noah\u2019s a family friend, and I thought it would be a good idea to let him look at the clinic. Get his opinion. Besides, he\u2019s over in Biloxi, and he loves to fish. A day or two in Bowen will be a vacation for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will appreciate his help . . . and yours too, but I wonder if maybe we aren\u2019t making a mountain out of what could have been just a random act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really believe that, do you?\u201d</p> <p>She rubbed her temples. \u201cNo, I guess I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think Ben believes kids did it either,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe walked around the clinic with me, and we both noticed there weren\u2019t any footprints outside the window. The grass was still soggy. It had rained hard the night before. There should have been footprints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did you argue with me about how he got in?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI guess I just wanted it to be easy and make sense. Do you know the first thought I had when I saw my office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone really hates me. It scared me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been racking my brain trying to come up with a name, but honestly, I haven\u2019t been back in town long enough to make enemies. Give me a couple of months, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have a list as long as my arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe man was definitely out of control in your office. Noah will have some ideas for us.\u201d</p><p>He popped another Triscuit in his mouth. Without some squirty cheese or peanut butter, the crackers tasted like sawdust to him, but he kept eating them anyway.</p><p>\u201cMen like Noah catch criminals, and you put them away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you don\u2019t have to worry about people shooting at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d His quick agreement was a lie, of course. Hell, he\u2019d been shot at, kicked, bitten, punched, and spit on while he was doing his job. He\u2019d even had a contract taken out on him \u2014 twice now that he recalled \u2014 and when he went after Leon\u2019s family, he received daily threats.</p><p>\u201cI have a theory,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d He was digging into the bottom of the box, searching for one last piece of sawdust he could eat.</p><p>\u201cOne of Dr. Robinson\u2019s patients was trying to steal his file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would his reason be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought that if he had some contagious disease or some diagnosis he didn\u2019t want his insurance company or his family to know about, then maybe he might want to steal his file. I know I\u2019m reaching, but that\u2019s the only theory I can come up with as to why the files were all torn apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Robinson give you a list of his patients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. There was a printout in a manila envelope taped to one of the boxes. He didn\u2019t have a big practice considering the length of time he worked here. From what I\u2019ve heard, Dr. Robinson needed to take a couple of sensitivity classes. He offended his patients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why he didn\u2019t have a big practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Noah goes through the clinic and tells us what he thinks, you\u2019re going to have to match the files with the list of names to see if anyone\u2019s chart is missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming that list wasn\u2019t destroyed.\u201d</p><p>Theo nodded. \u201cI also think you should call Robinson and ask him if there were any difficult patients. You\u2019ll know what to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right. He probably has a copy of the patient list anyway if we need it.\u201d</p><p>He noticed she was rubbing the back of her neck. \u201cAre you getting a headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I can \u2018sort of\u2019 fix it.\u201d</p><p>He got up and joined her on the sofa. Then he put a pillow on the floor between his bare feet and told her to sit there while he worked the kinks out.</p><p>The offer was irresistible. She got settled between his knees and stretched her legs. He put his hands on her shoulders, then pulled back.</p><p>\u201cTake your robe off.\u201d</p><p>She unbuttoned the robe, untied the belt, and slipped the robe off.</p><p>\u201cNow take your pajama top off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOkay, then unbutton the top buttons.\u201d</p><p>She had to undo three buttons so his hands could get to her skin.</p><p>Too late, she realized what she was doing. His big, warm hands were touching her bare skin, and, oh, Lordy, did it feel wonderful.</p><p>\u201cYour skin\u2019s soft.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. She should make him stop, she thought. How crazy was this? Theo was the reason she was feeling so tense, and now he was making it blissfully worse. Oh, yes, she should definitely make him stop. She turned her head to the side instead so he could rub the knot on the column of her neck.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I thought when I first met you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was irresistible?\u201d she teased. \u201cSo irresistible you had to throw up on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to let me live that down, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was out of my mind with pain then,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not what I was talking about anyway. After the surgery, when you came into my room and you were telling me about Bowen and your clinic and the people who live here . . . you know what I was thinking then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you wish I\u2019d stop talking and let you get some sleep?\u201d</p><p>He tugged on her hair. \u201cI\u2019m being serious here. I\u2019m gonna tell you why I really came to Bowen.\u201d</p><p>His tone of voice indicated he wasn\u2019t teasing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I wanted what you had,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw something inside of you I had when I first started out, but somewhere along the way, I lost it. That never bothered me until I met you. You made me want to find it again . . . if that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it you saw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassion.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand. \u201cPassion for my work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassion to make a difference.\u201d</p><p>She paused for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to change the world, Theo. I\u2019m only hoping I can make a difference in a little corner of it.\u201d She got up on her knees and turned around to face him. \u201cYou don\u2019t think you make a difference?\u201d she asked, astonished.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure I do,\u201d he said very matter-of-factly. \u201cI\u2019ve just lost my enthusiasm for the job, I guess. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s wrong with me. The men I put away . . . they\u2019re like rodents. Every one I lock up, three more take his place. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re experiencing burnout. You\u2019ve been working long hours since your wife died. You don\u2019t allow yourself time to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you loved building things with your hands, but you also said you haven\u2019t had time for the hobby in four years. In other words, since your wife died.\u201d</p><p>She could tell he wanted to interrupt her, and so she hastened to add, \u201cAnd fishing too. You told me you used to love to fish, but the way you said it was as though you were talking about a past life. You\u2019ve been punishing yourself long enough, Theo. You have to let it go.\u201d</p><p>His immediate reaction was to tell her he hadn\u2019t come to Bowen to get analyzed and that she should leave him the hell alone. She\u2019d hit too close to the bone . . . but she\u2019d only told him what he already knew. For the past four years he\u2019d been running as fast as he could so he wouldn\u2019t have time to think about his failure to save his wife. The guilt had been eating at him for a long time. It had taken his energy, his enthusiasm, and his passion.</p><p>\u201cYou need to kick back and let life pass you by for a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor\u2019s orders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel rejuvenated. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She was worried about him. He could see it in her eyes. Lord, she was sweet. And what was he going to do about that? He was beginning to like her a hell of a lot more than he\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you decide to go back to Boston, you\u2019ll have a new attitude.\u201d \u201cIf I go back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant when you go back,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about Boston or work or his future or anything else for that matter, and that was so unlike him. He was a planner, always had been for as long as he could remember, but now he didn\u2019t want to plan anything. He wanted to do exactly what Michelle had suggested. Kick back and let the world pass him by.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . . me. It\u2019s like fate threw us together.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re a contradiction, Theo. A lawyer with a romantic side. Who would have thought that was possible?\u201d</p><p>Theo decided to lighten the mood. Michelle was so easy and fun to tease and gave as good as she got. He liked embarrassing her. The esteemed doctor could blush with the best of them.</p><p>\u201cYou know what else I thought when I met you?\u201d he asked with a playful grin.</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cYou were sexy. Real sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The word came out with a sigh.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 what?\u201d</p><p>Oh, boy. \u201cThe baggy green surgical scrubs, right? The outfit\u2019s a real turn-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat cute little mask hid your best feature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy freckles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Theo certainly knew how to flirt. He could make her squirm and pant at the same time.</p><p>She smiled sweetly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen my best feature yet.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow in that wonderful Cary Grant way she loved. \u201cYeah?\u201d he drawled. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got me curious. You\u2019re not going to tell me what your best feature is, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to spend half the night thinking about it?\u201d</p><p>She hoped he would. She hoped he\u2019d squirm a little too, just the way she did every time he looked at her. She knew she wasn\u2019t going to get much rest tonight. Why should she be the only one sleep-deprived? Tit for tat, she thought. She was suddenly feeling quite pleased with herself. Theo might have been the master at sexual banter, but she was finally feeling as though she was holding her own. She wasn\u2019t such a neophyte after all.</p><p>You mess with me and you pay the consequences.</p><p>\u201cYou want to fool around?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you\u2019d better button your top.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her chest and let out a loud groan. The silk pajama top was completely undone. Damn those silk buttons. They never stayed put. Her br**sts were covered, though just barely. Mortified, she frantically rebuttoned.</p><p>Her face was bright pink when she looked at him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Why would I want to do that? I liked it. And don\u2019t look at me that way. I didn\u2019t unbutton the thing. I\u2019m an innocent bystander.\u201d</p><p>She sat back on her heels while she put her robe on. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. Thanks for the massage. It helped.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, cupped the sides of her face and kissed her. Her mouth was so soft and warm and sweet. She tasted like peppermint. He took his time coaching a response, trying not to rush her.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been time to prepare. She hadn\u2019t realized he was going to kiss her until his lips were touching hers. She didn\u2019t resist. She should have, but she didn\u2019t. Her lips parted, and then he deepened the kiss and she went limp.</p><p>She was his for the taking and both of them knew it.</p><p>He abruptly pulled back. \u201cSweet dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes, I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>There was a definite twinkle in his eyes. He knew what he\u2019d just done to her. She\u2019d all but melted in front of him. Lord, what would happen if they made love? She\u2019d probably have a complete mental breakdown.</p><p>How could he turn it on and off so quickly and efficiently? Experience and discipline, she decided as she stood and walked out of the room. Years and years of experience and discipline. She, on the other hand, apparently had the discipline of a rabbit. One kiss and she was ready to have his babies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, she was disgusting. And did he have to be such a great kisser? She shoved her hair out of her face. Mr. Big City was going to eat her alive if she didn\u2019t get a handle on her emotions. She wasn\u2019t an innocent. She\u2019d been in a relationship before, and at the time, she\u2019d believed she was going to marry the man. He hadn\u2019t kissed the way Theo had, though, and he hadn\u2019t made her feel so alive and desirable.</p><p>The big jerk. Michelle tripped on the hem of her robe going up the stairs. As soon as she reached her bedroom, she threw the robe on a chair. Then she got into bed. She stayed there about five seconds, got up again, and went downstairs.</p><p>Theo was back at the desk, typing on his laptop.</p><p>\u201cListen, you.\u201d She came close to shouting.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d he asked, his hands poised over the keyboard.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a damned good surgeon. While you were out getting all that experience . . . screwing around, and I use that word specifically . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he asked, a hint of a smile playing at the corners of his mouth.</p> <p>She poked herself in the chest. \u201cI was busy learning how to use a scalpel. I just wanted you to know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d he asked when she abruptly stopped.</p><p>Her mind went blank. Several seconds passed in silence. Her shoulders slumped and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she left the room.</p><p>Could she have made a bigger fool of herself? \u201cI doubt that,\u201d she whispered as she got into bed. She felt like David going to meet Goliath and forgetting to bring his slingshot. Letting out a loud groan, she rolled onto her stomach, pulled the pillow over her head, and closed her eyes.</p><p>He was making her nuts.</p> <p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>Monk hated surveillance. He stood in the shadows of a weeping willow watching Dr. Renard\u2019s house, waiting to make certain she had gone to bed so he could return to his motel room and catch a few hours\u2019 sleep. He would have to listen to all the taped telephone calls first, of course. He rubbed his thigh as though to console himself because he\u2019d torn his best pair of khakis climbing the telephone pole when he\u2019d placed the tap.</p><p>While he stood there, hour upon hour, waiting and watching, he thought about past assignments. He liked to go over each minute detail. He wasn\u2019t being ghoulish, and he certainly wasn\u2019t getting any perverse pleasure thinking about his victims. No, his goal was to review his performance and then analyze it. What mistakes had he made? What could he do to improve himself?</p><p>He\u2019d learned something from each job he\u2019d taken. The wife in Biloxi kept a loaded gun under her pillow. If her husband knew about it, he\u2019d failed to mention it to Monk. He had almost gotten his head blown off, but fortunately he\u2019d been able to wrestle the gun away from her. Then he\u2019d used it to kill her instead of wasting valuable seconds trying to suffocate her. Expect the unexpected. That was the first lesson.</p><p>And then there was the teenager in Metairie. Monk\u2019s performance that night had been less than perfect, and looking back, he realized he had been lucky that no one had walked in on him. He\u2019d stayed much too long. He should have left the second the job was finished, but he watched a movie on television instead. What made that all the more remarkable was the fact that Monk never watched television. He felt he was far too intelligent to stare at the trash the networks put out to numb the already numb minds of beer-guzzling couch potatoes.</p><p>This movie had been different. And vastly amusing. The film had just begun playing when he\u2019d broken into the victim\u2019s bedroom. He still remembered every detail from that night. The pink-and-white-striped wallpaper with the tiny pink rosebuds, the assortment of stuffed animals on the client\u2019s bed, the pink frilly curtains. She had been the youngest client he had ever taken on, but that fact hadn\u2019t bothered him much at all. A job, after all, was simply that. A job. All he cared about was getting it done and getting it done right.</p><p>The music from the video, he recalled, had been blaring. The client had been awake, half-stoned on a joint she\u2019d just smoked. The air smelled sweet, heavy. She was dressed in a short blue T-shirt, her back against pillows and the headboard of the pink canopy bed, a super-sized bag of Doritos in her lap. She mindlessly stared at the screen, unaware of his presence. He\u2019d murdered the teenage girl with the acne-ravaged face and the oily brown hair as a special favor \u2014 and for twenty-five thousand \u2014 so that good old Dad could collect on a three-hundred-thousand-dollar policy he\u2019d taken out on his only child six months before. The policy had a double indemnity clause, which meant that if the cause of death was proven to be accidental, Dad would receive double the face value. Monk had gone to great lengths to make the murder look accidental so that he would receive double his fee. The father had been most appreciative of his work, of course, and although it hadn\u2019t been necessary to explain why he wanted his daughter murdered \u2014 the money was all Monk was interested in \u2014 he confessed that he was desperate to get the loan sharks off his back and was only doing what he had to do.</p><p>Ah, fatherly love. Nothing like it in the world.</p> <p>While he was killing her, he listened to the dialogue from the movie, and within a minute or two, he was captivated. He shoved the deceased\u2019s feet out of his way, sat down on the foot of the bed, and watched the movie until the last credits came on, all the while munching on Doritos.</p><p>He had just stood up to leave when he heard the garage door opening. He\u2019d gotten away in the nick of time, but now, thinking about the foolish risk he\u2019d taken, he realized how fortunate he\u2019d been. What lesson had he learned from that experience? Get in and get out as quickly as possible.</p><p>Monk believed he\u2019d vastly improved since those early murders. He\u2019d dispatched Catherine without any problems at all.</p><p>He glanced up at the doctor\u2019s bedroom window again. She was staying up much later than he\u2019d expected, but then, she was entertaining a man. When Monk had followed her to The Swan, he\u2019d spotted the man in the crowd of loud, crass teenagers. He\u2019d only gotten a brief look at his face and shoulders. The adolescents completely surrounded him as they shouted to get his attention. They were calling him Coach.</p><p>Expect the unexpected. He\u2019d called Dallas, read the license plate number on the rental car, and asked for a thorough background check.</p><p>The light finally went out in her bedroom. Monk waited another half hour to make certain she had gone to bed before he quietly made his way down the side of the gravel road to where he\u2019d hidden his vehicle. He drove back to the motel in St. Claire, listened to the tape he had made of her phone calls, disappointed there was nothing significant there, set his alarm clock, and finally went to bed.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>There were definite perks to carrying government credentials and knowing people in high places. By ten o\u2019clock in the morning, Theo had all the information he needed on the Carson brothers. What he had learned about the con artists pissed the hell out of him. He also had the writs and the filings ready, thanks to his eager interns and a guaranteed-on-time courier service.</p><p>What Theo planned to do wasn\u2019t all that conventional and could possibly be thrown out in a court of law, but he wasn\u2019t concerned about that now. He hoped to have Daryl\u2019s problem with the sugar mill resolved before the brothers wised up, and from what he had learned about the two attorneys the brothers kept on a monthly retainer, they were little league players who wouldn\u2019t figure out they had been manipulated until after the fact.</p><p>Theo also had another advantage that he\u2019d never used until today. As a member of the Justice Department, he could strike as much fear into the hearts of small-time criminals as the IRS.</p><p>He was whistling while he fixed breakfast. Michelle walked into the kitchen just as he was putting the utensils on the table.</p><p>She looked good enough to eat. Dressed in tight, faded blue jeans that emphasized her long legs and a snug white T-shirt that ended just above her navel, she looked sexier to him than she had the night before, and he hadn\u2019t thought that was possible. Heaven help him, the woman just kept getting better and better.</p><p>He handed her a glass of juice. \u201cWant to have some fun?\u201d</p><p>Those weren\u2019t the first words she expected to hear. \u201cWhat kind of fun?\u201d she asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cSugar mill fun.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe she was actually a little disappointed. \u201cOh. Yes . . . yes, of course. May I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can, but eat your breakfast first. I\u2019ve got it all ready for you. I like cooking,\u201d he added enthusiastically, as though he\u2019d only just realized that fact. \u201cIt relaxes me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the table and laughed. \u201cOpening a box of cereal and getting the milk out of the fridge isn\u2019t cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made coffee too,\u201d he boasted.</p><p>\u201cWhich, translated, means you pushed the button. I got it ready last night.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a chair for her, got a whiff of her perfume, and wanted to get closer. He moved back instead and leaned against the sink. \u201cYou look nice today.\u201d</p><p>She tugged on the hem of her T-shirt. \u201cYou don\u2019t think this top is a little tight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I said you look nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time I put it on, I take it off and find something else to wear. It\u2019s the latest fashion,\u201d she added defensively. \u201cMy friend Mary Ann gave it to me, and she told me my belly button is supposed to show.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his faded navy blue T-shirt up until his navel was showing. \u201cIf it\u2019s in fashion, I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll change,\u201d she said, prying her attention away from his hard, flat stomach. The man was disgustingly fit, which was a miracle considering the amount of junk food he ate.</p><p>\u201cI like what you\u2019re wearing,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m changing,\u201d she said again. Then she shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult . . . trying to get comfortable in my skin these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent so many years trying not to look like a girl.\u201d</p><p>He thought she was joking and laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was in medical school, I did everything I could to downplay the obvious fact that I was a woman.\u201d</p><p>Astonished, he asked, \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe head of one department was extremely prejudiced against female doctors and did everything he could to make our lives miserable. He was such a creep,\u201d she added. \u201cHe and his buddies would go out drinking with the male students, but only after he had loaded the female students down with research assignments and extra work. I didn\u2019t care about that, but I didn\u2019t like having to jump through twice as many hoops as the male students. Complaining would have made the situation worse. The only alternative for a female student was to drop out, which was exactly what the head of the department wanted.\u201d She suddenly smiled. \u201cOne night, while some of the other women and I were getting zonkered on margaritas, we figured it all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you figure out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe department head was afraid of us. Keep in mind we were exhausted and tipsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come up with a reason for why he was afraid of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur minds. He knew the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen have vastly superior minds.\u201d She laughed as she added, \u201cFear and insecurity were at the root of the prejudice. I remember, at the time the revelation was stunning to us. It wasn\u2019t true, but we were too drunk to know or care. I realize now of course that it was all nonsense, we aren\u2019t any less or any more capable than male doctors, but being able to laugh and feel smug helped us get through the really tough times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas your residency as difficult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was completely different. We were all treated equally horrible twenty hours a day, seven days a week. It didn\u2019t matter that I was a woman. All I needed to know was how to run. It was grueling,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI learned how to catch fifteen minutes of sleep standing up. I was fortunate to train under a gifted surgeon. He was obnoxious,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he and I got along. I pretty much lived in scrubs, and fashion wasn\u2019t part of the curriculum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy doctor\u2019s a female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She took my appendix out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your doctor. If that were the case, I\u2019d put you on a low-sodium, low-fat diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention I don\u2019t like my doctor and that I never follow her advice? As for clothes, it doesn\u2019t matter what you wear, Michelle. Men are still going to stare at you. I just hope the Carson brothers aren\u2019t gawking out the window at you while I\u2019m trying my best to terrorize them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to use terror tactics? Cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, looking out the window at me? Can\u2019t I go inside with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. You don\u2019t get to watch the brothers sweat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want you to hear what I\u2019m going to say. You never know. You might have to testify against me in court one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what are you planning to do?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the sugar bowl from the lazy Susan on the counter and sat down across from her. \u201cWait and see,\u201d he said. Then he reached for the box of cereal and poured a huge helping of cornflakes. \u201cI like Frosted Flakes better,\u201d he remarked as he started dumping sugar on top.</p><p>She got nauseated watching him. \u201cI\u2019ve got a five-pound bag of sugar in the pantry. Why don\u2019t you get it down, grab a spoon, and dig in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, sarcasm first thing in the morning isn\u2019t appreciated. Want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made that for you,\u201d she said. \u201cI usually drink a Diet Coke for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAnd you\u2019re criticizing my eating habits?\u201d</p><p>She got a cold can out of the refrigerator, popped the lid, and took a long swallow. \u201cDid I hear the doorbell this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had some papers messengered to me from New Orleans. It\u2019s kind of amazing the driver found your house. My directions were iffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have offices in New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got friends there,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter I talked to Daryl, I called some people in Boston. Since I\u2019m not familiar with Louisiana law or workman\u2019s comp, I had to use some of my connections.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt seems to me that if an employee were injured while on the job, then he\u2019s entitled to workman\u2019s compensation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are exceptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the employee did anything to cause the accident, like come to work drunk, he could be denied workman\u2019s comp.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr if he used a machine he knew was broken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the argument the Carsons will use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re prepared for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you moving so quickly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to leave Daryl hanging. I\u2019m not going to be here long, and I want to try to get his problem fixed before I go back home. I promised him.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head and watched her cornflakes get soggy. She had known all along that Theo was going to leave. Of course, she did. And that was the reason she was trying not to become attached. There was only one little wrinkle in her plan. As loath as she was to admit it, she wanted to grab hold of him and never let go.</p><p>The big jerk. This was all his fault. If he hadn\u2019t kissed her, she wouldn\u2019t be feeling miserable now.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that look on your face . . . like you want to kick someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>She pushed the uneaten cereal out of her way, leaned back in her chair, and folded her arms. \u201cNonspecific viruses.\u201d There was a thread of belligerence in her voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last thing in the world I would have guessed you were thinking about. Viruses. Go figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonspecific viruses,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cMy mistake. So tell me. What exactly were you thinking about nonspecific viruses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re insidious . . . and destructive, the way they attack the body. One minute you\u2019re feeling just fine and dandy, and the next, your throat is scratchy and sore and your body begins to ache everywhere. Then your glands get so swollen you have trouble swallowing. When you think you couldn\u2019t possibly feel any worse, you start coughing, and before you know it, you\u2019ve got all sorts of secondary complications.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for several seconds and then asked, \u201cAnd you were thinking about this because . . .?\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019re leaving, you big jerk. She lifted her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m a physician. I think about such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but who knows how I\u2019ll feel in five minutes. It\u2019s cruel . . . these viruses. They strike just like that.\u201d She snapped her fingers and nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut if they aren\u2019t the deadly kind of virus, then eventually they run their course and go away. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, they go away, all right,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Theo said what he was thinking. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel a virus coming on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said you were feeling fine,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this any longer. Sick people depress me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a doctor. I\u2019m going out on a limb here, but don\u2019t you treat sick people all day long?\u201d</p><p>She suddenly realized how childishly she was behaving and tried to come up with an excuse for her moment of madness. \u201cI\u2019m not a morning person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you do most of your surgeries early in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, but the patients are already under. They don\u2019t care what kind of a mood I\u2019m in. Did you sleep well?\u201d she asked, deliberately changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cYes. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was nice not having the phone jar me awake. Have you heard from your friend Noah, yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll need to stop by here to get the key to the clinic so he can look around. We\u2019ll have to wait for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah won\u2019t need a key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will he get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll break and enter, but don\u2019t worry. He won\u2019t really break anything. He prides himself on being quick and quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you supposed to meet him at a set time and place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not worried. Noah will find me. What\u2019s on your schedule today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you don\u2019t want me to start cleaning up the clinic until Noah\u2019s gone through the place, I\u2019ve got a free day. I do need to get hold of Dr. Robinson and find out about his difficult patients,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the only other thing I have to do is drag you to football practice at three. You did promise Mr. Freeland that you\u2019d stop by, and since I\u2019m the team physician \u2014 and I use the term loosely \u2014 I have to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need a doctor during practice?\u201d he asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boys do a lot of damage to one another banging heads and other body parts. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter that they wear helmets and pads. I had a dislocated shoulder last week and a badly sprained knee two days ago. The boys are really awful, but don\u2019t tell anyone I said so. Speaking of Mr. Freeland,\u201d she continued, \u201che wrote down a number on that paper he handed you. Did you look at it, and were you duly impressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I read the number. I can\u2019t really say I was impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmused, then?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI make more in a week than he offered for the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a rich district.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he assumed you\u2019d be making money working as a lawyer too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to change into your suit before we go to the mill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with what I\u2019m wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLevi\u2019s? Is that proper attire when you want to intimidate someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t what you wear that counts. It\u2019s all in the attitude. When can you be ready to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>She stacked the dishes in the sink and then hurried upstairs to change her shirt to a less revealing one while Theo collected his papers.</p><p>As he was backing the car out of the drive, he said, \u201cFirst stop is Second and Victor. I know it\u2019s in St. Claire, but you\u2019ll have to give me exact directions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy. It\u2019s right behind McDonald\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I can get some fries to hold me over until lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour blood must be as thick as Crisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. I\u2019ve got low cholesterol and lots of the good stuff.\u201d</p><p>Michelle directed him through the streets of St. Claire.</p><p>\u201cTurn left here,\u201d she instructed. \u201cWhy are we going to Second and Victor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFencing. Ah, there it is.\u201d He pulled into the lot adjacent to the St. Claire Fencing Company, parked the car but left the motor running, and got out. \u201cI already called the order in, so this won\u2019t take long. I just need to pay.\u201d He hit the power lock and then shut the door.</p><p>She waited with the air conditioner running full speed. It was hot and muggy outside, and the weatherman had predicted an eighty percent chance for an afternoon thundershower. She lifted her hair and fanned her neck. She still hadn\u2019t readjusted to the humidity in Bowen. Or the pace of life. She was used to running, and now she was going to have to learn how to slow down again.</p><p>It took ten minutes for Theo to complete the transaction. Michelle was dying to know why he wanted to buy a fence, but she wasn\u2019t going to ask any more questions. If he wanted her to know, he\u2019d tell her in his own good time.</p><p>She lasted until Theo had parked the car in front of the St. Claire Bank and Trust, which was exactly three blocks away from the fencing company.</p><p>\u201cDid you buy a fence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind did you get?\u201d</p><p>He was going through the stack of papers in the files he had tucked in the console between them. \u201cWrought iron,\u201d he said. He pulled out two official-looking documents, then got out of the car and came around to open her door for her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awfully expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why did you buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it a consolation prize,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not going to get a bigger gun.\u201d</p><p>He knew she didn\u2019t understand. She\u2019d already gone to the car when little John Patrick had told him about his birthday.</p><p>\u201cThere are fencing companies back in Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there are.\u201d</p><p>It suddenly dawned on her. \u201cDoes this have anything to do with Lois?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLois who?\u201d</p><p>She gave up. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m the strong, silent type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate the strong, silent types. They\u2019re all type A personalities. Heart attacks waiting to happen.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the door open. \u201cSweetheart, don\u2019t you ever think about anything but medicine?\u201d</p><p>If he only knew. Since she\u2019d met him, the only thing she\u2019d been able to think about was going to bed with him. But she wasn\u2019t going to admit it. \u201cSure I do,\u201d she said. \u201cWant to know what I\u2019m thinking right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you getting cranky again?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhen was I cranky?\u201d</p><p>Theo motioned to the guard, then stepped back so Michelle could go inside first. He knew his weapon would set the alarm off. He flashed his government ID at the elderly man and waited for him to hit the release button. The gun was concealed in an ankle strap he\u2019d had sent to him with the papers.</p><p>The guard waved Theo inside. \u201cHow can I help you, Officer?\u201d</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t correct the misassumption. \u201cI have an appointment with the president of the bank. Could you direct me to his office?\u201d</p><p>The guard nodded enthusiastically. \u201cSure I can. Mr. Wallbash is in the back. You can see him sitting behind his desk on the other side of the glass wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Theo caught up with Michelle, pointed to a chair in the lobby outside of the president\u2019s office, and said, \u201cMaybe you should wait here. I may have to use a dirty word in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would that word be?\u201d</p><p>He leaned down close to her ear and whispered, \u201cAudit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am. Aren\u2019t you Big Daddy Jake\u2019s girl?\u201d The guard was hurrying toward Michelle.</p><p>She whispered, \u201cGood luck,\u201d to Theo and then turned to the old man. \u201cYes, I am,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re the doctor, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He introduced himself and shook her hand. \u201cI heard about what happened down at your clinic. My wife, Alice, and I were just saying how nice it was going to be to have Jake\u2019s girl looking out for us. We both need a good doctor. Alice has trouble with her bunions and her corns. She can\u2019t put on her Sunday shoes \u2019cause it hurts so much, and I\u2019ve got to do something about my bursitis. Some days I can\u2019t raise my right arm at all. When do you think you\u2019ll be seeing patients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully, in a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can wait until then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve put up with our aches and pains this long. This part-time job of mine helps me keep my mind off my ailments,\u201d he added. \u201cI fill in for the regular guard two days a week. I guess you could say I keep banker\u2019s hours.\u201d He laughed at his own joke and then said, \u201cWill you look at that? Mr. Wallbash looks like he\u2019s gonna have himself a heart attack. His face is as red as a chili pepper, and he\u2019s sweating like a pig. He sure doesn\u2019t like what the officer is telling him.\u201d</p><p>Michelle agreed. Wallbash did look ill. He shuffled through the papers Theo had placed on his desk, then looked up long enough to glare at Theo.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see Theo\u2019s face because his back was to her, but whatever he was saying as he leaned over the desk was having quite an impact on Wallbash. The president put both hands up as though he were being robbed and nodded vigorously.</p><p>She thought she knew why. Theo must have used the magic word.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t inside the president\u2019s office all that long, and he didn\u2019t shake the man\u2019s hand when he was leaving. Wallbash was busy mopping the sweat from his brow. Theo paused in the doorway, and whatever he said in parting made the color drain from Wallbash\u2019s face.</p><p>Theo\u2019s expression was ferocious as he crossed the lobby to her. He noticed her watching him, winked, then grabbed hold of her hand, nodded to the guard, and kept right on going, dragging her along in his wake.</p><p>She waited until they were in the car to find out what had happened. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWallbash isn\u2019t happy, but he\u2019ll cooperate. He damn well better,\u201d he added in a voice that made her take notice.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more stop and then we can eat lunch. Tell me how to get to the sugar mill.\u201d</p><p>She gave him directions and then asked him to tell her what he\u2019d done. \u201cWallbash looked like he was going to have a tantrum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Carson brothers have done their banking at the St. Claire Bank and Trust since the company began. They\u2019re one of the bank\u2019s largest depositors, and that ought to tell you something about the sweet deal those sons of bitches have going. Wallbash and Gary Carson are friends. According to Wallbash, he\u2019s a real nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim Carson\u2019s a hothead. I think Wallbash is a little afraid of him. Jim\u2019s the one who went to the hospital to fire Daryl. They play it that way on purpose because it gets them what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike good cop, bad cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like bad and worse. You know, I\u2019ll take a hothead over a sneaky little weasel manipulator any day of the week. If I\u2019m lucky today, both brothers will be at the mill and I\u2019ll get to watch them do their routine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what was the purpose of visiting the bank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI froze their accounts.\u201d</p><p>She burst into laughter. \u201cThat can\u2019t be legal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is,\u201d he countered. \u201cWallbash has the papers, all signed and legal. He has to cooperate, or I\u2019ll nail his . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stopped himself in time. She ended the sentence for him. \u201cHis backside to the wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep looking at your watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiming is everything,\u201d he said. \u201cMy appointment with Gary Carson is at twelve-thirty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou made an appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him what you wanted to see him about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ruin the surprise? Of course I didn\u2019t tell him the truth. I told his secretary I wanted to do some business with the mill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn left at the next corner,\u201d she instructed. \u201cAnd follow this road for a couple of miles. The mill\u2019s out in the country,\u201d she added. \u201cSo Carson thinks he\u2019s getting a new account.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWallbash will probably call him and tell him about your visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll call him at exactly one o\u2019clock and not a minute before, or I\u2019ll have auditors tearing that bank apart before he can blink. He\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you really do that?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. She studied his profile for several minutes and then said, \u201cWhen you want something, you don\u2019t let anything get in your way, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I don\u2019t. You might want to keep that in mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always win?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>It was subtle, the way he had changed the subject. They both knew they were talking about getting his way with her now. Then she remembered what he had said to her before he\u2019d even unpacked the night before. He wouldn\u2019t have to go to her bed. She would come to him. When hell freezes over, she thought. She turned to look out her window. Then another thought occurred to her, and she said, \u201cWhat about payroll? If you froze their accounts, how will the men get paid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe court will appoint someone to write the checks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the brothers shut down the mill out of spite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re making too much money to shut down, and besides, I\u2019m not going to let them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I can. If they don\u2019t cooperate, when I\u2019m finished with them, the employees will own the company.\u201d</p> <p>Theo could see the mill in the distance. There were smokestacks jutting out of round silos nestled in between two huge concrete-block buildings. All were connected.</p><p>The closer he got, the bleaker the place looked. It had a dirty gray fa\u00e7ade and dirty windows, but it didn\u2019t look as if it was in bad shape. He parked in the gravel lot, got out, and looked around.</p><p>\u201cMr. Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>He turned at the sound of the voice. \u201cConnelly?\u201d</p><p>A tall, thin man wearing a business suit approached the car. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything in order?\u201d</p><p>Connelly lifted his briefcase. \u201cYes, sir, it is. I just got word. He\u2019s filed.\u201d</p><p>Theo leaned into the open car door and said to Michelle, \u201cDo you mind waiting here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she answered, \u201cbut if I hear gunshots, I\u2019m going to come running.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Connelly, introduced him to Michelle, and then said, \u201cWhen I come out, you go in. I want you to wait outside the door.\u201d</p><p>Theo left the motor running. Removing her seat belt, Michelle pushed the seat back and turned on the radio. Willie Nelson was singing. She took it as a good omen. Maybe Theo wouldn\u2019t run into any trouble after all.</p><p>Three songs and nine commercials later, Theo came outside. He was smiling as Connelly passed him on his way inside. Theo double-timed it to the car, slid into the seat, and put the car in drive before he shut his door. She barely had time to click her seat belt closed before he was speeding down the drive.</p><p>\u201cAre we making a fast getaway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re watching the rearview mirror,\u201d she remarked as she turned in her seat to look out the back window.</p><p>\u201cJust being cautious. Never know who might have a shotgun under his desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went that well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it did go well. Gary Carson\u2019s a real nice guy. Couldn\u2019t have been more understanding and pleasant. Wants to do the right thing. I can\u2019t tell you how many times he said that. Of course, he qualified it with the veiled threat that he\u2019d have to close the mill because, and I quote, \u2018We\u2019re just scraping by.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you respond?\u201d</p><p>He flashed her a grin. \u201cI laughed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were tactful.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really getting a kick out of this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He seemed surprised by the question and then said, \u201cYes, I am. It feels good helping Daryl. Feels real good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can see the difference you\u2019re making.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course, this case is easy. I should have it settled before the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think you can get the problem fixed in a couple of days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Unless the brothers have some cash stashed away I don\u2019t know about and think they can hold out. But even then, it won\u2019t matter. They\u2019ve broken so many laws, I could put both of them behind bars. OSHA would have a field day in that plant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the hothead go for your throat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYou sound disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI wanted to see their routine. Jim Carson\u2019s in New Orleans for the day, but he\u2019s supposed to be back in Bowen around six. Gary mentioned he was going to wait to tell his brother face-to-face instead of calling him on his cell phone, probably so he can get him foaming at the mouth before he sics him on me. My guess is that I\u2019ll be hearing from Jim about five minutes after Gary imparts the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you happen to tell Gary where you were going to be tonight?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI might have mentioned that I\u2019d be at The Swan.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou may get to shoot someone after all.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>The new high school football stadium was impressive. The football team, on the other hand, was anything but. They were, in Theo\u2019s estimation, unbelievably bad.</p><p>The boys wanted to show off for him. They did have talent; they just didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Conrad Freeland had to scream at the top of his lungs to be heard over the boys\u2019 shouting matches. He used his whistle so often the kids pretty much ignored the sound. Practice was chaotic and deafening.</p><p>Conrad finally got the first string to cooperate long enough to line up. They then began running back and forth across the beautifully manicured field like chickens with their heads cut off.</p><p>Theo and Michelle stood next to the music teacher on the fifty-yard line watching. Beaming with pride, Conrad turned to Theo and asked, \u201cWhat do you think of your boys?\u201d</p><p>Theo ignored the \u201cyour boys\u201d reference \u2014 he wasn\u2019t about to claim ownership of this motley crew \u2014 and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you run some plays, and Michelle and I will sit in the stands and watch. It\u2019s been a few years,\u201d he warned, \u201cbut maybe I can give you some suggestions.\u201d</p><p>Conrad looked confused. Nodding toward the field, he said, \u201cThat was the play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just saw the play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe play? You only have one . . .\u201d He was trying not to smile, because he didn\u2019t want Conrad to think he wasn\u2019t taking practice seriously.</p><p>The music teacher nervously tugged on his collar. He was dressed for a music recital in an immaculately pressed long-sleeve white dress shirt, pin-striped tie, and a navy blazer. The clouds were heavy with rain, and it was so sticky and hot that Theo thought Conrad had to be suffocating.</p><p>Michelle nudged him. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice play, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Then Conrad said, \u201cWe\u2019ve only perfected that one play you just saw. We call it the stinger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he remarked for lack of anything better to say that wasn\u2019t a blatant lie.</p><p>\u201cGood, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Michelle nudged Theo again. He ignored her and turned to Conrad. He didn\u2019t want to hurt the man\u2019s feelings. It was obvious he had worked hard to get the undisciplined boys to cooperate, but Theo wasn\u2019t going to start lying to him either, and so he simply said, \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand my position and the background of the team,\u201d Conrad said, his voice earnest now. \u201cLast year was our first year with a football team, and the coach . . . well, he just up and left in the middle of the season. Of course, he didn\u2019t win any games. The boys don\u2019t know what to do out there. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing either,\u201d he admitted. \u201cGive me a flute, and I\u2019ll teach you how to play it, but this,\u201d he added with a wave of his hand, \u201cis beyond me. It\u2019s why we desperately need playbooks. I really have tried to do a good job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have,\u201d Theo agreed, trying to think of something positive to say.</p><p>\u201cI even went searching on the computer. I can give you the history of football, but I can\u2019t tell you how to play the game. I couldn\u2019t make head nor tail out of all the drawings I found on the Internet. Lots of circles and arrows that didn\u2019t make any sense to me.\u201d</p><p>He removed the whistle from around his neck and offered it to Theo. \u201cSee what you can do, Coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not . . .\u201d Conrad had already jogged toward the watercooler. \u201c. . . the coach,\u201d Theo ended.</p><p>Michelle leaned into his side. \u201cThey\u2019re really awful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll go sit in the bleachers until you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>Okay, he thought. One practice. He\u2019d talk to the boys, tell them he\u2019d send Freeland some playbooks and maybe a couple of films they could watch too, and that\u2019s it. Then he was out of here. Yeah, that was his game plan.</p><p>Putting two fingers into his mouth, he whistled to get the boys\u2019 attention and then motioned them over to him.</p><p>They ran like lumbering overweight foals. One kid fell down, got up, ran a couple more yards, and tripped over his own feet again. Theo hoped he wasn\u2019t going out for the position of running back. They squeezed in around him as they pressed him with questions. Theo didn\u2019t say a word. He simply held up one hand and waited. The noise finally died down.</p><p>In a low voice, he told them to remove their helmets and sit down on the grass in front of him. They actually obeyed. When they dropped to the ground, Theo swore he felt the earth move underneath him. Then Elliott Waterson shouted, \u201cWhere\u2019s your gun, Coach?\u201d And the noise started all over again.</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t say a word. He simply stood there with his arms folded across his chest, waiting for them to catch on. It didn\u2019t take long. Within a minute it was quiet again.</p><p>In a near whisper, he said, \u201cElliott, my gun is in a safe place, but I swear, the next kid who interrupts me while I\u2019m talking is going to get clobbered. Understood?\u201d He was forcing the boys to sit still and strain to hear what he had to say. \u201cNow, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p><p>Michelle sat on the hard bleachers watching the transformation. She was astonished at how easily Theo had taken control of the boys. The team sat with their legs folded underneath them, their helmets in their laps. Every eye was on Theo, and the boys seemed to be hanging on his every word. Conrad looked impressed. He had walked back to Theo\u2019s side and was nodding every now and then.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>Michelle turned at the sound of the voice and saw a tall, slightly overweight, dark-haired man standing just outside the tunnel that led to the locker rooms. He looked vaguely familiar to her.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He walked forward. The stranger was dressed in khaki shorts and a matching short-sleeve khaki shirt with the word \u201cSpeedy\u201d sewn above the breast pocket. There was a name tag dangling from the clip below the pocket. He carried a Speedy Messenger package \u2014 she recognized the label \u2014 but he was too far away for her to read his name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a Dr. Michelle Renard. Would you happen to know where I can find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Renard.\u201d</p><p>The messenger beamed. \u201cThank heavens. I\u2019ve been all over this town searching for you.\u201d</p><p>He tucked the package under his arm and hurried up the metal stairs.</p><p>\u201cDo you have something for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Doctor. What I\u2019ve got is a problem, but I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll help me solve it before Eddie gets himself canned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>The messenger smiled. \u201cEddie\u2019s the new guy with our company, and he screwed up big time,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name\u2019s Frank, by the way.\u201d He extended his hand to shake hers. His palm was damp, his grip weak.</p><p>\u201cHow did your friend screw up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe delivered the right packages to the wrong people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he really needs the job because his wife is expecting, and if Eddie gets fired for messing up, he\u2019ll lose his insurance. Eddie\u2019s only nineteen,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I feel responsible because I\u2019m the man who trained him, so I\u2019m using my day off to try to fix this before the boss finds out about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, Eddie picked up a package from a law firm in New Orleans on Monday, and he should have filled out the label and put it on the package right then and there at the receptionist\u2019s desk, but Eddie didn\u2019t do that. He took it back to the company van. Now, he\u2019d already picked up another package from Belzer Labs, and he hadn\u2019t put the label on that package either. He figured he\u2019d sit in the air-conditioned van and fill out both labels, but he stuck them on the wrong packages. The only way I found out about the screwup was when a secretary from another law firm called to say she had gotten the wrong package. When she opened hers, she found a bunch of literature about a new drug the company was going to be selling. Fortunately for Eddie, I was the one who happened to answer the phone. If that secretary had talked to the boss, I hate to think what would have happened. Speedy Messenger Service prides itself on being fast and reliable, and I swear that this is the first mix-up we\u2019ve had in over three years. Anyway,\u201d he added as he shifted from foot to foot, \u201cI was hoping you could give me the package you got by mistake, and I\u2019ll deliver it to the law firm today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Michelle shook her head. \u201cI\u2019d like to help you, but I don\u2019t remember receiving any special deliveries. When and where was it delivered? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie took it to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>His hands, she noticed, shook as he flipped through the pages of his notebook. He was nervous and couldn\u2019t quite look her in the eyes. She thought that was odd but then decided he was embarrassed because of the mix-up.</p><p>\u201cI already went over there, hoping I\u2019d find you, and one of the nurses was kind enough to look at the weekly log. She said there was an accident late that afternoon and that you were in surgery when Eddie made the delivery, but that doesn\u2019t make any sense, since you signed for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, I remember the accident. I was on the surgical floor, up to my elbows in charts I had to finish before I could leave. I did get a call from ER telling me there was a package for me. I don\u2019t remember getting it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it will jog your memory if I tell you that you signed for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d She certainly didn\u2019t remember doing that.</p><p>Frustration crept into his voice when he said, \u201cYes, Doctor, you did. We always keep a copy of the receipt in our offices and mail the original back to the sender, and I\u2019m telling you,\u201d he added, his anxiety not quite masking his anger, \u201cyour signature is as clear as can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t do you any good to get angry,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you could read my handwriting, then I definitely didn\u2019t sign for it. No one can read my writing. I do think I know what must have happened,\u201d she added. \u201cThe staff secretary down in ER signed my name. That\u2019s pretty much standard procedure.\u201d</p> <p>She racked her brain, trying to remember the sequence. Exhausted from being up most of the night before, she had made up her mind not to leave on vacation until every one of her charts had been dictated. \u201cI did go down to get the package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he asked urgently with a hasty look over his shoulder at the football team. \u201cDid you go to admitting or to the emergency room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cER,\u201d she answered. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when the paramedics arrived.\u201d She shrugged then. \u201cI went right back up to surgery and did two cases back-to-back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you never opened the package, did you?\u201d He was smiling and sounded relieved.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t open it,\u201d she said. \u201cI certainly would have remembered doing that, especially if there were papers from a law firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can understand how anxious the attorneys are to get those papers. They were going to another law firm. It\u2019s all confidential stuff. I could drive over to the hospital right this minute and get the package from that secretary, couldn\u2019t I? What\u2019s her name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cElena Miller, but she won\u2019t give it to you unless I tell her it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you call her now? Eddie already picked up the package meant for you and is on his way here now. I sure would like to get this finished today. I\u2019ve got my phone with me.\u201d</p><p>He moved closer so he could hand her the phone. Michelle could smell his aftershave. He\u2019d used a heavy hand, but it didn\u2019t mask the odor of sweat.</p><p>He was acting like a nervous twit. No wonder he was sweating. He kept looking over his shoulder at the field, as though he expected one of the boys to hurl a football at him. She dialed the hospital, asked for Elena, and was put on hold.</p><p>\u201cHe has them mesmerized, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d she remarked as she waited for the secretary to pick up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe coach. He has those players hanging on his every word. I noticed you were watching them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . . yes, yes, he does.\u201d</p> <p>Elena Miller picked up a phone in the emergency room, and in her usual harried voice snapped, \u201cMiller here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Elena. It\u2019s Dr. Renard. Am I interrupting you in the middle of something important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always in the middle of something important, Doctor, and you forgot to finish your charts. You left two,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you left your mail untouched. Your \u2018in\u2019 box is brimming over, Doctor. Now, aren\u2019t you glad you called? What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did finish my charts,\u201d she argued. \u201cEvery last one of them, so if Murphy thinks he\u2019s going to put me on report, you tell him I\u2019ll have his hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Doctor. Murphy\u2019s on vacation too. What can I do for you?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Michelle explained about the mix-up with the packages. \u201cDo you remember signing for a package that was delivered around five o\u2019clock Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight this minute, I can\u2019t even remember what I ate for supper last night. I do remember Monday was one of those hellacious days in the ER. We had a rush of accidents, and then there was that real bad one out on the highway. There were at least twenty mothers and fathers jamming the halls while the doctors worked on their kids. I certainly don\u2019t remember signing for anything, but it doesn\u2019t matter if I remember or not. If I signed for it, then I put a yellow sticky on your locker telling you I had a package for you. I would have put it inside your locker, but you still haven\u2019t given me your combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d she said. \u201cI keep forgetting. Do you have any idea where the package is now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look around. It\u2019s either in my desk or on top of your locker. What do you want me to do when I locate it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it to the man from Speedy Messenger Service. He\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all right. I\u2019ll be here until six tonight, but not a minute later. Tonight\u2019s bridge night at the church, and I have to be there by six-thirty to help set up. It\u2019s my turn to be hostess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get there before then. Thanks, Elena.\u201d</p><p>As she pushed the \u201cend\u201d button and handed the phone back to Frank, she noticed Theo was walking across the field toward them. Frank seemed to be watching Theo too. He kept his eye on him when he asked Michelle, \u201cWhat did she tell you? Does she have the package?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. Eddie\u2019s going to keep his job. Elena will be at the hospital until six, and she\u2019ll be happy to make the exchange.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say thank you. In fact, his exit was quite abrupt. Pulling the brim of his ball cap down low on his brow, he ran down the steps. His head was turned away from the field. As he was disappearing into the tunnel, she shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear her. Desperate to get away before anyone else got a good look at his face, he ran as fast as he could through the locker rooms and outside, across the parking lot. He was panting from the effort. He fell against the car door, doubled over, and tried to catch his breath while he grabbed at the door handle. He heard a sound behind him and whirled around in a half crouch.</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, sneaking up on me like that? Are you following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing what needs to be done,\u201d he argued. \u201cNo one else was getting anywhere. The doctor won\u2019t ever see me again. Besides, the risk was worth it. I know where the package is. I\u2019m on my way to pick it up right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were told not to interact with the subject. That point was made perfectly clear to you. Now the doctor knows what you look like. You\u2019ve made a stupid mistake, and the others aren\u2019t going to like it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Theo was quiet on the ride back to Michelle\u2019s house. They were both hot and sticky and wanted to shower before he took her to dinner at The Swan. He had offered to take her somewhere else a little more fancy, but she had promised her father that she would help tend bar if he needed her. Wednesday was a busy night for her father\u2019s bar, and because the fishing competition was coming up on Saturday, it would surely be crowded.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t your brother help your dad?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul hasn\u2019t surfaced in the last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your brother disappear a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my father needs him, he\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how does he know your father needs him? Does he call him?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cJohn Paul doesn\u2019t have a phone, and he wouldn\u2019t answer it if he did. He usually shows up on Friday morning to see what Daddy needs him to do. John Paul\u2019s never worked the bar during the weeknights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if your dad got into trouble? What if he got sick or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul would know something was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cESP?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just would know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother sounds strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t strange,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cHe\u2019s just different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your other brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemy? What about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy your standards, no, he isn\u2019t different.\u201d</p><p>Neither one of them said another word for several minutes. Michelle broke the silence when she noticed he was frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kid who kept tripping out on the field today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was wearing his brother\u2019s shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re trying to figure out what you can do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe team needs new equipment,\u201d he remarked. \u201cConrad\u2019s going to talk to the coach over in St. Claire about letting our team use their weight room. None of them should go out on that field until they\u2019re conditioned for it. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need to build up their muscles and their stamina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Otherwise they could get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called them \u2018our team.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. I heard it as clear as a bell.\u201d</p><p>He changed the subject. \u201cWhat did that messenger want? I saw you talking to him on my way to the watercooler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a mix-up at the hospital. I sent him to the ER staff secretary. She\u2019ll straighten it all out.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then changed the subject once again. \u201cHow much money do you think the cash prize will amount to for the fishing tournament?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many will enter this year, but if I were to guess, I\u2019d say two men in a boat, fifty dollars each . . . and last year they had over seventy entries . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if we say eighty people sign up this year, that\u2019s four thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour thousand dollars could buy a lot of shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, the key to the plan is to win.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo kidding. What about my dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d he asked as he pulled into her drive and parked the car.</p><p>\u201cTwo thousand dollars will belong to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll donate it. Your dad\u2019s a softy.\u201d He followed her to the front door. \u201cBut like I said, the key to the grand plan is to win the tournament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s killing you that you can\u2019t just go out and buy the team what they need, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d hit the nail on the head. \u201cYes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I know I can\u2019t do that. Their parents would get their backs up. I\u2019d be stomping on their pride. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you would. You\u2019ll go broke if you keep buying little boys expensive fences and shoes and football pads for the team and heaven knows what else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kid should have to worry about an alligator in his backyard.\u201d</p><p>She turned at the door, put her hands on his shoulders, and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he asked when she sauntered away.</p><p>She looked back, gave him a quick smile, and said, \u201cWhy did I kiss you? That\u2019s an easy one. I kissed you because I think you\u2019re sweet.\u201d</p><p>He reacted as though she\u2019d just insulted him. \u201cThere is nothing sweet about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? You were worried about embarrassing that boy wearing his brother\u2019s shoes, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I was worried.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo, but you were, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . . sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make a lot of money, Michelle, and it sure as certain isn\u2019t because I\u2019m sweet.\u201d</p><p>He was slowly advancing, and with each step he took toward her, she took a step back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how much money you make. You\u2019ve got everybody fooled back in Boston, don\u2019t you? They probably think you\u2019re a killer prosecutor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a killer prosecutor and proud of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were concerned about John Patrick, and that\u2019s why you purchased the fence. You know what that makes you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. I know why you really kissed me, babe. Be honest.\u201d</p><p>He caught her around the waist as she was backing into the library. She was laughing as he pulled her up against him. His chest was like a brick wall. A warm brick wall.</p><p>He leaned down until his mouth hovered just an inch or two above hers. \u201cWant me to tell you why you kissed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting in breathless anticipation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. You want me.\u201d</p><p>He expected a protest, but wasn\u2019t the least disappointed when she said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d She leaned back so she could look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dying to get your hands on me.\u201d He pulled her closer.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his waist and hooked her thumbs in his waistband.</p><p>\u201cI did get my hands on you. You really need to work on that ego. I\u2019ve noticed you don\u2019t have any self-confidence around women. It\u2019s sad really . . . but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d he asked, rubbing his jaw against the side of her face as he waited for the zinger.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still sweet,\u201d she whispered into his ear, then took his earlobe between her teeth and tugged.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI\u2019ll show you sweet.\u201d</p><p>Tilting her head back, his mouth came down on top of hers, and he kissed her with a passionate hunger. The kiss was wet, hot, wild, and thoroughly arousing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then it got better. The expression \u201cputty in his hand\u201d came to mind as she clung to him and allowed him to rob her of every logical thought. The kiss went on and on, and the taste of him was so wonderful, she kept trying to get closer and closer.</p><p>His touch was sinfully carnal, and she never wanted him to stop. He stroked her arms, her back, her neck as he worked his magic, and she was caught up in such an erotic spell that the only thought she could hold on to now was a chant. Don\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She said it out loud a second after he\u2019d pulled back.</p> <p>They were both shaking. \u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d he whispered gruffly.</p><p>He was panting. She was arrogantly happy because she knew she was the reason for his distress, but then she realized she was doing the same thing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d he repeated as he leaned down and kissed her once again. A light, gentle caress that left her wanting more.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is getting out of hand.\u201d</p> <p>Her forehead was pressed against his chest. She bumped his chin when she nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of hands . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou probably should move yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hands.\u201d His voice was gritty.</p> <p>A gasp. Then, \u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>It took about five seconds to extricate herself from his jeans. Her face was burning as she turned and walked out of the room. She could hear him laughing as she climbed the stairs.</p><p>She grabbed her robe, went into the bathroom, and stripped out of her clothes. After she turned the shower on full blast, she stepped into the tub and all but ripped the shower curtain apart as she pulled it closed.</p><p>\u201cReason number one,\u201d she muttered, \u201che\u2019ll break my heart.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>It was a quarter to seven when Theo and Michelle reached The Swan, and the place was hopping. Old vans and rusted-out pickups sporting rifle racks and bumper stickers almost filled the parking lot. I\u2019d rather be fishing seemed to be the bumper sticker of choice, but the one that caught Theo\u2019s eye had the word Gator-Aid painted in bright fluorescent letters. When he looked closer, he noticed the picture of an alligator with a Band-Aid. He didn\u2019t know what that was supposed to mean.</p><p>He also noticed there weren\u2019t any brand-new vehicles in the lot. If there was any doubt that it was a poor area, the proof was all around him. Some of the pickups looked as though they belonged in a junkyard. But if he\u2019d learned anything while in Bowen, it was that people made do with what they had.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she asked him as she led the way around a dented gray van.</p> <p>\u201cHow hard it is to scrape a living here,\u201d he answered. \u201cBut you know what? I haven\u2019t heard any complaints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t. They\u2019re too proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I mention you look pretty tonight?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn this old thing?\u201d</p><p>This \u201cold thing\u201d was a short V-necked blue-and-white-checked sundress that she\u2019d spent twenty minutes deciding upon. She\u2019d spent another twenty minutes working on her hair. She wore it down around her shoulders, and it curved softly around her face. She\u2019d worked hard curling it to make it look as though she hadn\u2019t. Then she\u2019d added some blush to highlight her cheekbones, and brushed on a tiny bit of lipstick and gloss. When she realized she was becoming compulsive about her appearance \u2014 she\u2019d changed in and out of the sundress three times \u2014 and that all the primping was for him, she stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhen someone gives you a compliment, you\u2019re supposed to say thank you. You look pretty tonight,\u201d he repeated, \u201cin that \u2018old thing.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like making fun of me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d lied when he\u2019d told her she looked pretty, but he couldn\u2019t put into words how he\u2019d felt when she\u2019d come downstairs. Dynamite came to mind. Breathtaking was another adjective he could have used, but the one word that kept repeating in his head he was too embarrassed to say. Exquisite.</p><p>She would have had a field day with that compliment, he thought. And what was the matter with him? He was silently waxing poetic. Now, where had that come from?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sin to make fun of anyone.\u201d</p><p>Theo opened the door for her, then blocked her entrance while he read the hand-printed sign on the wall. \u201cNo wonder it\u2019s so crowded tonight. It\u2019s all-the-beer-you-can-drink night.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s always all-the-beer-you-can-drink, as long as you pay for each glass and you don\u2019t drive. The locals know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething smells good. Let\u2019s eat. God, I hope it\u2019s not spicy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s Wednesday, you can have fried catfish and french fries, which I\u2019m sure your arteries will love . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrench fries and fried catfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have that.\u201d</p><p>As they zigzagged their way to the bar, Theo was stopped more often than she was. Several men and women wanted to shake his hand or pat his shoulder as he passed by, and all of them, so it seemed, wanted to talk football.</p><p>The only person who stopped her was a man who wanted to discuss his hemorrhoids.</p><p>Her father was at the far end of the bar by the storage room, huddled with Conrad Freeland and Artie Reeves. Jake was frowning and nodding at whatever Conrad was telling him and Artie, and he didn\u2019t notice her coming toward him.</p><p>Armand, the cook, was working in the kitchen, while his brother, Myron, tended bar.</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s rooked Myron into helping him,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I\u2019m off the hook for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s waving to us.\u201d</p><p>When they finally reached her father, he lifted the countertop and hurried over to Michelle. She noticed Artie and Conrad were both frowning at her.</p><p>\u201cTheo, why don\u2019t you go pour yourself a beer and sit at the bar while I have a word in private with my daughter.\u201d</p><p>The look her father gave her told her she\u2019d done something to displease him. She followed him into the storage room and then asked, \u201cIs something wrong, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna leave, Mike, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong. The boys and I were talking, and we decided we just can\u2019t let that happen. This town needs Theo Buchanan. Surely you can see that. Most of the folks here tonight came out specifically because they want to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want free legal advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome do,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s that sugar mill business and the football season is coming on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, what do you expect me to do? The man lives in Boston. He can\u2019t commute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course he can\u2019t.\u201d He grinned over the foolish notion of flying back and forth to Bowen.</p><p>\u201cWell, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think you could change his mind if you worked at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she asked. Exasperated, she put her hands on her h*ps and waited. Knowing how her father\u2019s larcenous mind worked, she knew whatever suggestion he came up with was going to be a doozy. She braced herself to hear what it was.</p><p>\u201cPut the welcome mat out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConrad and I came up with a good plan, and Artie thinks it might work. Now, Conrad told me that Theo happened to mention you wanted him to stay at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow hospitable was that, Mike?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d managed it, but he\u2019d put her on the defensive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being nice to him now. Honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you made him your gumbo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cConrad\u2019s wife is going to sneak on over to your house with a pot full of her gumbo tomorrow morning, and you can pass it off as your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s dishonest,\u201d she pointed out. And then it dawned on her what her father wasn\u2019t saying. \u201cWait a minute. I thought you liked my gumbo.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d moved on. \u201cWhat about your lemon pound cake? You didn\u2019t happen to make that yet, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took a step toward him. \u201cI\u2019m warning you, Daddy. If you say \u2018good,\u2019 I\u2019m never going to invite you over for supper again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, now isn\u2019t the time to be sensitive. We\u2019ve got a crisis on our hands, and we\u2019ve only got a couple of days to change his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing any of us do will matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with that attitude, it won\u2019t. Get with the program, and don\u2019t be so negative.\u201d</p><p>Her father was so enthusiastic that she felt terrible trying to rain on his parade. \u201cIt\u2019s just that \u2014\u201d</p><p>He started talking at the same time. \u201cMarilyn just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArtie\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She makes a real tasty chocolate cake, and she\u2019s on her way home to bake one tonight. It should be in your kitchen by noon tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she should be insulted or amused. \u201cAnd Theo\u2019s going to think I whipped that up? Exactly when would I have had time to bake him a cake? I\u2019ve been with the man all day, and tomorrow morning I\u2019m supposed to go to the clinic and start sorting through files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand what we\u2019re trying to do. Marilyn\u2019s going to leave a nice happy-you\u2019re-here card so he\u2019ll get the idea how friendly everyone is. Karen Crawford\u2019s smoking a brisket and fixing her potato salad, and of course, she\u2019ll have a nice card all written up. Daryl\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t want to be left out. She\u2019s bringing over a pot of green beans fresh from her garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a nice card,\u201d she remarked as she folded her arms and frowned at her father.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why am I supposed to pretend I made the gumbo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I won\u2019t have Theo thinking you can\u2019t cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took him to McDonald\u2019s.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a comment; it was an accusation.</p><p>Michelle\u2019s appreciation for small-town openness suddenly dwindled. Someone had obviously been spreading the word. Suddenly the big, bad, impersonal city didn\u2019t sound quite so horrible.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to go there,\u201d she argued. \u201cHe likes McDonald\u2019s . . . and so do I. They have great salads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all trying to be friendly.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. When Daddy and Conrad and Artie put their heads together, they came up with some of the most outrageous ideas. At least this one wouldn\u2019t land them in jail.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me to be friendly too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You know what I\u2019m talking about. Make him feel at home, like he belongs here. Take him out and show him the sights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle, are you going to cooperate or not?\u201d</p><p>He was getting testy. He only called her Michelle when he was frustrated with her. She started laughing again, which she knew he didn\u2019t appreciate at all, but she couldn\u2019t help it. The conversation was crazy.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cSince this means so much to you and Conrad and Artie, I\u2019ll cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means a lot to the men and women who work at the sugar mill and the boys on the football team too. You should have heard what Conrad told us about practice today. He said Theo had those boys all revved up and ready to go. He also said that Theo knows a whole lot more about football than he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows more about football than Conrad does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo knows how to organize the boys. He gained their respect just like that.\u201d He snapped his fingers and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve got a whole lot of reasons why I want him to stay, but you know the one reason that tops all the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Daddy. What\u2019s that?\u201d She had already made up her mind that if he said he hoped Theo would marry her and take her off his hands, she would walk out of the bar.</p><p>\u201cHe went out and bought a fence as a birthday present for Daryl\u2019s boy. You don\u2019t meet too many thoughtful men like Theo these days. And think about the money that fence must have set him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my part, but please don\u2019t get your hopes up. Theo\u2019s going to go home, and nothing any of us do will change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that negativity again. We\u2019ve got to give it our best try, don\u2019t we? This town needs a good, honest lawyer, and Theo Buchanan fits the bill.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAll right. How about tomorrow I make my \u00e9touff\u00e9e?\u201d</p><p>He looked appalled. \u201cOh, no, honey, don\u2019t do that. Serve him up Billie\u2019s gumbo. Remember the way to a man\u2019s heart is through his stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love my \u00e9touff\u00e9e.\u201d Her shoulders slumped then. \u201cYou don\u2019t love it?\u201d</p><p>He patted her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re my daughter and I love you. I had to tell you I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how long it takes to make that dish? All day,\u201d she told him before he could offer a guess. \u201cYou could have mentioned you didn\u2019t care for it before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings, you being so tenderhearted and sensitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Daddy, you could have . . . Wait a minute. \u2018We\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brothers and me. They love you too, honey. You\u2019re a fine cook with plain dishes, and your biscuits are still light and fluffy, but we need to dazzle the man now. Like I was telling you, the way to a man\u2019s heart . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know . . . is through his stomach. That\u2019s hogwash, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? How do you think your mama nabbed me?\u201d</p><p>When was she going to learn she could never win an argument with her father, no matter what she said? Finally admitting defeat, she said, \u201cHer world famous bundt cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to nab Theo the way Mama nabbed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. It\u2019s the town that wants to nab him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do my part. I promise. Now, let me see if I\u2019ve got this straight. Doing my part means I don\u2019t cook at all, I lie about the gumbo and tell Theo I made it, and, oh, yes, I\u2019m supposed to be friendly. Do you want me to put a chocolate mint on his pillow tonight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wrapping his arms around her, he gave her a big bear hug. \u201cThat might be overkill. Now, go sit, and I\u2019ll bring out supper for you and Theo.\u201d</p><p>Michelle didn\u2019t have another quiet minute for the next three hours. After she and Theo had eaten, she put on an apron and got to work cleaning the tables and helping carry out pitchers of cold beer. Theo was stuck sitting at the bar between two men clutching papers in their hands. A line had formed behind him. Daddy was leaning over the counter making the introductions.</p><p>More free legal advice, she thought. Myron had disappeared over an hour ago, and since her father was busy trying to manipulate Theo, she took over tending the bar.</p><p>By ten-thirty the kitchen was officially closed and cleaned, and the crowd had thinned out. There were only about a dozen people inside the bar when she removed her apron and went to the jukebox. She put in a quarter she\u2019d taken from the cash register, punched B-12, and then sat down at a corner table she\u2019d just cleared. She leaned her elbow on the table and propped her chin in the palm of her hand.</p> <p>Her gaze kept going back to Theo. The big jerk looked so serious and adorable in his gray T-shirt and jeans. Did he have to be so sexy? And why couldn\u2019t she find something wrong with him so she could obsess about that and get over him. All she could think about was ha**ng s*x with him. Oh, God, did that mean she was turning into a slut? The sex would be amazing. Stop thinking about it. Think about something else.</p><p>Another thought popped into her head that was even more depressing. Great. When he left \u2014 and he would leave \u2014 the town was going to blame her. Oh, they wouldn\u2019t say anything, but they\u2019d all think it was her fault. She hadn\u2019t been friendly enough.</p><p>She wondered how they would all feel if they knew just how friendly she wanted to be. Admit it, damn it. You\u2019re feeling sorry for yourself because he will go back to Boston and his oh-so-sophisticated life there, and you want him to stay in Bowen. Forever.</p><p>Well, hell, how had that happened? How could she have been so stupid? Hadn\u2019t counting up all the reasons why she shouldn\u2019t fall for him meant anything? Evidently not. She\u2019d been too na\u00efve to pay attention to her own cautions. She was a strong woman, so why hadn\u2019t she been able to protect herself from him? Did she love him? Oh, Lord, what if she did?</p><p>Not possible, she decided. Love couldn\u2019t happen this quickly . . . could it?</p> <p>Michelle was so busy worrying she didn\u2019t notice him coming toward her.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you lost your best friend. Come on. Dance with me.\u201d</p><p>Go away and let me wallow in self-pity. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Theo dug a quarter out of his pocket, dropped it in the jukebox, told her to choose, and she promptly punched A-1.</p><p>The music started, but it wasn\u2019t until he had taken her into his arms that she realized that she\u2019d made a big mistake. The last thing she needed now, in her vulnerable, feeling-sorry-for-herself state, was to be touched by him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as stiff as a board. Relax,\u201d he whispered against her ear.</p> <p>\u201cI am relaxed.\u201d</p><p>He gently shoved her head down and pulled her closer until their bodies were pressed together. Oh, boy. Big, big mistake. Too late now, she thought as she snuggled against him and curled her fingers around his neck. \u201cI love this song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds familiar, but that doesn\u2019t make any sense. I don\u2019t usually listen to country western music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Willie Nelson singing \u2018Blue Eyes Cryin\u2019 in the Rain.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He was nuzzling her cheek, driving her to distraction. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice song. I like it,\u201d he said.</p><p>She tried to pull back; he wouldn\u2019t let her. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad song,\u201d she said, cringing over how antagonistic she sounded.</p><p>They swayed slowly to the rhythm of the music.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old story,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the sensitive spot just below her ear, giving her goose bumps. She trembled. He had to know what he was doing to her. Oh, God, she really was putty in his hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about a woman who falls in love with a man and then he leaves her and she\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess . . . crying in the rain?\u201d</p><p>She could hear the laughter in his voice. His hand was gently stroking her back.</p><p>\u201cHow come he leaves her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a big jerk.\u201d Too late she realized she\u2019d said the thought out loud. She quickly added, \u201cIt\u2019s just a song. I\u2019m only guessing. Maybe she actually left him, and she\u2019s so happy to be rid of him she\u2019s crying in the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer, her fingers softly rubbing the back of his neck in tiny circles.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably stop doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d She ran her fingertips through his hair as she asked the question.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do like it. That\u2019s why I want you to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d So she could make him nuts too. That wonderful realization made her feel a little reckless.</p><p>\u201cSo, you probably don\u2019t want me to do this,\u201d she whispered, and kissed the pulse at the base of his neck.</p><p>\u201cMichelle, I\u2019m warning you. Two can play this game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat game?\u201d she asked innocently, and then she kissed his neck again, tickling him with her tongue. She felt a bit daring. Daddy was in the kitchen, and no one was paying them any attention. Besides, Theo\u2019s big body pretty much concealed hers. That made her even more reckless, and she pressed even closer to him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like what I\u2019m doing . . .\u201d</p><p>The challenge didn\u2019t go unanswered. \u201cYou\u2019re bad,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d A breathless whisper.</p><p>\u201cI like the way you smell. When I get close to you, your scent drives me crazy and makes me think about all sorts of things I\u2019d like to do.\u201d She closed her eyes. Don\u2019t ask. For the love of God, don\u2019t ask. \u201cWhat kinds of things?\u201d</p><p>Until that moment, she had foolishly believed she\u2019d been holding her own against a master. She had been the one to start the erotic conversation, and she knew from the way he was holding her that she\u2019d definitely shaken him.</p><p>But then he began whispering in her ear, and she realized she was in way over her head. In a low, husky voice he told her exactly what he\u2019d like to do to her. In his fantasies, she was, of course, the star, and every part of her body, including her toes, were featured players. The man had an active imagination, and he certainly wasn\u2019t shy about sharing. Michelle had no one to blame but herself. She had asked. But that didn\u2019t matter. By the time he finished describing several creative ways he would make love to her, the blood was roaring in her ears, her bones felt as if they\u2019d turned into mush, and she had melted against him.</p><p>The song ended. He kissed her cheek, straightened, and let go of her. \u201cThanks for the dance. You want a beer or something? You look kind of flushed.\u201d</p><p>Kind of flushed? She felt as if it was a hundred fifty degrees inside the bar. When she looked into his eyes, she could tell that he knew exactly what he had just done to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of stuffy in here. I think I\u2019m gonna go outside and get some fresh air,\u201d he casually announced.</p><p>She watched him walk away. He had just pushed the door open and stepped outside when she went running after him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>She caught up with him outside, standing in the moonlight. She poked him between his shoulder blades and said it again, much louder this time. \u201cThat\u2019s it. You win.\u201d</p><p>He turned around. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>She was so angry she poked him in the chest. \u201cI said you win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cWhat did I win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about, but since we\u2019re alone, why don\u2019t I spell it out? This game we\u2019ve been playing. You win. I honestly thought I was holding my own, but obviously I was wrong. I\u2019m just not good at it. Okay? So you win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do I win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. We\u2019re going to have sex, Theo Buchanan. Oops, I mean we\u2019re going to have great sex. Got that?\u201d</p><p>A devilish smile crossed Theo\u2019s face, and then he seemed to stare off into space. Was he already thinking about making love, or couldn\u2019t he pay attention long enough to listen to her concede?</p><p>\u201cMichelle, honey \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not paying attention, are you? I want to have sex with you. The bad kind,\u201d she qualified. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about. The hot, steamy, tear-our-clothes-off, mind-blowing, scream-out-loud sex. Like in the old song \u2018All Night Long,\u2019 that\u2019s you and me, babe. All night long. You name the time and the place, and I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d apparently rendered him speechless. That had to be a first. Maybe she wasn\u2019t so bad at this stuff after all. Theo just stared at her with that lopsided grin in place. She suddenly felt as cocky as a rooster getting ready to crow.</p><p>She folded her arms across her waist and demanded, \u201cSo? What have you got to say to that?\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. \u201cMichelle, I\u2019d like you to meet an old friend of mine, Noah Clayborne. Noah, this is Michelle Renard.\u201d</p><p>He was bluffing. He had to be bluffing. She gave a tiny shake of her head. He nodded. She shook her head again, whispered, \u201cOh, God,\u201d and closed her eyes. This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to turn around. She wanted to vanish into thin air. How long had he been standing there? Her face began to burn. She swallowed, then forced herself to turn.</p><p>He was there, all right. Tall, blond, amazing blue eyes, and a killer smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d she stammered. Her voice sounded like she had laryngitis.</p><p>Until she\u2019d turned, she hadn\u2019t thought it could get any worse. She was wrong about that. Her father was standing in the doorway, just a few feet away from Noah, and he was definitely close enough to have overheard what she\u2019d said to Theo. Maybe he hadn\u2019t heard, though. Maybe he\u2019d just gotten there. She gathered her courage and glanced at him. Daddy looked thunderstruck.</p><p>Michelle came up with a quick game plan. She would simply pretend it hadn\u2019t happened.</p><p>\u201cDid you just get here?\u201d she asked nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Noah drawled. \u201cSo, Theo, are all the pretty ladies in Bowen this friendly?\u201d</p><p>The door slammed shut behind her father as he rushed forward. Now he appeared mortified. \u201cWhen I said \u2018put out the welcome mat,\u2019 I thought you understood what I meant. There\u2019s friendly and then there\u2019s real friendly, and I raised you to know the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Theo was flirting, and I was simply calling his bluff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t bluffing.\u201d Theo shrugged.</p><p>Her foot came down hard on top of his exactly one second later.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were,\u201d she said. \u201cHonest, Daddy, I was just . . . teasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be talking about this later, young lady,\u201d Jake said as he turned and walked back inside.</p><p>Then Noah piped in. \u201cTheo was flirting? You\u2019re kidding about that, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was flirting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the guy standing behind you. Theo Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe. I don\u2019t think he knows how to flirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s really good at it. Honest,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYeah? It must be you, then. I was telling Jake that this is the first time in over five years that I\u2019ve seen Theo wearing anything but a suit and a tie. He\u2019s always been a workaholic for as long as I\u2019ve known him. Maybe you bring out the bad,\u201d he said, drawing the word out, \u201cin him.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back and bumped into Theo. She wasn\u2019t thinking about running, but she didn\u2019t like knowing he blocked her exit. \u201cCould we please change the subject?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Noah took pity on her. \u201cSure we can. Theo told me you\u2019re a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Good, she was back on safe ground. Maybe Noah had some kind of medical problem and wanted her advice. God, she hoped so.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a doctor are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a surgeon,\u201d Theo answered.</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cAren\u2019t you kind of young to be playing with knives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe operated on me.\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugged. Then he moved forward. \u201cDance with me. We\u2019ll find a nice Willie Nelson song and get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>He draped his arm around her shoulder and led her back inside. Theo stood there frowning as he watched the familiarity. Noah was a blatant womanizer. He\u2019d made more conquests than Genghis Khan, and Theo didn\u2019t like seeing him work his charms on Michelle one bit.</p><p>She perked up. \u201cYou like Willie Nelson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. Everyone likes Willie.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at Theo. \u201cYour friend has good taste.\u201d</p><p>Then Noah drew her attention. \u201cCould I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>She was so thankful she\u2019d gotten past her embarrassment, she said, \u201cYou may ask me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any other kind of sex besides the bad kind?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Cameron knew he had screwed up, but he wasn\u2019t going to admit it. He leaned against the paneled wall of John\u2019s library, his head bowed, as Dallas and Preston and John took turns tearing into him.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it will take the doctor to remember she saw you at Catherine\u2019s funeral?\u201d Preston asked as he jumped up from his chair. Slamming his powerful fist into the palm of his other hand, he paced back and forth across the room.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t remember,\u201d Cameron muttered. \u201cI was never anywhere near her at the funeral. Besides, I was sick of waiting, and I think the risk was worth it.\u201d</p><p>Dallas exploded. \u201cHow could it be worth the risk, you ass? You didn\u2019t get the package, and now you\u2019ve got people looking for it. You\u2019re a mess, Cameron. It\u2019s the booze. It\u2019s fried your brain.\u201d</p><p>Preston stopped in front of him. \u201cNow you\u2019ve put us all in jeopardy,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cScrew you,\u201d Cameron shouted back.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d John ordered. \u201cDallas, get Monk on the phone. You need to read him that report.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Monk was sitting in his SUV waiting for the doctor and her lover to come out of The Swan. His vehicle was well concealed between two vans at the back of the parking lot. There were four cars in the next row in front of him. It was hot and muggy, but he didn\u2019t turn on the air conditioner. All four windows were down, and he was being eaten alive by mosquitoes. Compared to standing in the brush watching the doctor\u2019s house with bugs crawling up his legs, this watch was luxurious.</p><p>He was thinking about calling to tell Dallas about the latest developments, but just as he decided to wait until he got back to the motel, his cell phone began to vibrate.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuchanan\u2019s a U.S. attorney.\u201d</p> <p>Monk\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cRepeat, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe son of a bitch works for the Justice Department.\u201d</p><p>Expect the unexpected. Monk took a breath and waited as Dallas read the report. What the hell had the Sowing Club gotten him into? He could hear voices in the background.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Monk asked.</p><p>\u201cAt John\u2019s house. We\u2019re all here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s shouting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreston.\u201d</p><p>He heard another voice yelling. He thought it might be Cameron. Monk was disgusted. They were acting like rats turning on one another for a scrap of meat. If there hadn\u2019t been so much money involved, Monk would have walked away from this mess. Cameron had already become a loose cannon, and from the argument he was listening to now, he knew it wouldn\u2019t be long before the others began to disintegrate.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t immediately run the report,\u201d Monk said. \u201cYou\u2019ve wasted valuable hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me he was a football coach . . . No, you\u2019re right. I won\u2019t make excuses or blame you. I should have run the report much earlier.\u201d</p><p>Monk was somewhat placated by Dallas\u2019s taking accountability.</p> <p>\u201cWhen can you kill him?\u201d Dallas asked.</p><p>\u201cLet me think,\u201d Monk said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to be rushed. These things take time to plan, and I refuse to go off half-cocked. Spontaneity leads to mistakes. But if your report is accurate \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Dallas rushed out.</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps he\u2019s in Bowen simply because of her. Men will do crazy things for \u2014\u201d</p><p>Dallas interrupted him again. \u201cA piece of ass? You think that after he gave that speech in New Orleans, he drove all that way just to get laid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen her,\u201d Monk said. \u201cShe\u2019s quite . . . lovely. Beautiful, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what you\u2019re saying is that this Justice guy is in town just to see her. Right? I mean, it does make sense, doesn\u2019t it? She does his surgery, saves his life, so he falls for her, and since he has to return to New Orleans anyway, he figures he might as well drive out to Bowen and screw her.\u201d</p><p>Monk puckered his lips in disapproval of Dallas\u2019s vulgar vocabulary. \u201cHave you reevaluated, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cJohn\u2019s saying something.\u201d</p><p>Monk patiently waited. He heard Preston arguing, shook his head, and reminded himself once again how much money was at stake.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor\u2019s got to be killed before she remembers where she\u2019s seen Cameron before,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cBuchanan has had death threats, so John thinks we could make it look like a hit on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the doctor just happened to be with him and got in the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming to Bowen tomorrow. You stay on the doctor until I call you. And watch for that package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cAnd, Dallas, just so you know, I\u2019ll be reading those files before I hand them over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still concerned your name is there? It isn\u2019t. I read the damn thing twice. When this is over, you\u2019re going to be set for life. You know that, don\u2019t you, Monk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI am curious about how much money is in that account, however. If it\u2019s as sizable as I imagine, I do believe I\u2019m entitled to a percent. Call it profit sharing, if you like, but since I\u2019m taking all the risks . . .\u201d</p><p>Dallas responded to the greedy bastard\u2019s demand by hanging up on him.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>Theo certainly wasn\u2019t jealous. Teenage boys got jealous, and he was way beyond that stage in his life. He was getting irritated, though. Michelle was laughing and having a good old time dancing with Noah. Theo sat at the bar making notes while a man explained his problem. The guy had purchased a used car that had a thirty-day guarantee. The man paid cash, drove the car off the lot, but two blocks later the muffler fell off and the radiator exploded. Since he hadn\u2019t owned the vehicle for thirty minutes, he had it towed back to the lot and demanded his money back. The owner of the lot explained that the guarantee of satisfaction only covered the tires and the engine. He also suggested that, next time he purchased a car, he read the fine print before signing.</p><p>Michelle laughed again, drawing Theo\u2019s attention. He loved the sound of her voice, and from the way Noah was smiling at her, Theo figured he was enchanted too.</p><p>Once again turning back to the man sitting next to him, he tried to concentrate. When he glanced over at the couple for about the hundredth time, Noah had pulled up his T-shirt and was showing Michelle the ugly scar on his chest.</p><p>He muttered, \u201cEnough,\u201d dropped his pen on the counter, and went over to put an end to the dance.</p><p>\u201cYou trying to impress Michelle with all your bullet holes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already impressed her with my wit and charm,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou were very lucky. That bullet should have killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was lucky,\u201d he agreed. \u201cGod was looking out for me, I guess,\u201d he said. Then he laughed. \u201cI was in church when I got hit.\u201d</p><p>She was sure he was joking. \u201cDid you fall asleep during the sermon and make the minister mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy will want to hear that story,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the kitchen making sandwiches,\u201d Theo answered.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t still be hungry after the catfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe offered, said he was making one for himself. He\u2019s making one for Noah too.\u201d</p><p>Thinking to help her father, she went around the bar and headed to the kitchen. She heard Noah say, \u201cBy the way, Theo, you might want to look at the sign-up sheet for the fishing deal Saturday. The sheet\u2019s tacked to the wall over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I need to look at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been bumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Theo refused to believe him . . . until he looked. His name had been crossed off, and Noah\u2019s was written above it.</p><p>Michelle hurried into the kitchen. Her father handed her a paper plate filled with a double-decker turkey sandwich swimming in mayo and a huge mound of greasy french fries. He carried an identical plate out and set it on the counter.</p><p>\u201cIf Theo stays another couple of weeks, he\u2019ll have to have a bypass,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re killing the man with kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurkey\u2019s not bad for you. You said so yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA jar of mayonnaise on it makes it bad,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a gallon of oil in those fries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what makes them good.\u201d Turning his back on her, he called, \u201cAll right, boys, here\u2019s your snack. I made the sandwiches without any of my hot barbecue sauce, Theo, just in case you were worried.\u201d</p><p>Noah and Theo were looking over the list. She nudged her father and whispered, \u201cDid you trade Theo for Noah as your partner in the tournament?\u201d</p><p>He looked guilty as sin. \u201cHoney, I had to.\u201d</p><p>Incredulous, she asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to answer. \u201cHow friendly was that, making a promise and then breaking it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being practical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>She followed him back into the kitchen. \u201cWrap up my sandwich for me, Mike, so I can take it home with me.\u201d</p><p>She got the foil out and did as he asked. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered me,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>Jake leaned against the island and folded his arms. \u201cThe way I see it, we stand a better chance of winning if there\u2019s four of us trying for the prize instead of just two, and Noah was going to sweet-talk you into partnering with him. I didn\u2019t figure Theo would appreciate hearing that, so I told Noah I\u2019d be his partner. Now you and Theo can spend the whole day together. You should be happy to be included.\u201d</p><p>He was exasperating. \u201cIn other words, that means you think Noah might be a better fisherman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did mention he\u2019s done a whole heck of a lot more fishing in the past four years, but that isn\u2019t the reason why I switched,\u201d he hastened to add when he saw that stubborn glint come into his daughter\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any reason to get in a snit about this. You should be thanking me for paying your fee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fish Saturday. I have a hundred other things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could win the prize. Everyone knows you\u2019re a better fisherman than I am.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t buying it. \u201cThat\u2019s not true, and you know it. Are you trying to play matchmaker? Is that why you want me to partner with Theo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the way I heard you talking to him? I don\u2019t need to do any matchmaking. You\u2019re holding your own just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I was teasing . . .\u201d</p><p>He acted as though he hadn\u2019t heard her. \u201cNoah might be doing a little matchmaking. He told me he\u2019s never seen Theo acting like he does around you.\u201d</p><p>That remark got her full attention. Her father nodded, then went to the refrigerator to get some milk. He poured himself a full glass and took a long swallow.</p><p>\u201cHow does Theo act?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNoah says he\u2019s smiling a lot. I got the feeling that\u2019s a rarity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s on vacation. That\u2019s why he\u2019s smiling. Is your stomach bothering you? You only drink milk when you have indigestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy stomach\u2019s just fine,\u201d he said impatiently, and then went right back to the subject at hand. \u201cAnd when it comes to Theo, you\u2019ve got a reason for everything. So explain this: How come he can\u2019t take his eyes off you? Noah noticed, and after he pointed it out to me, I took notice too.\u201d Before she could argue, he said, \u201cDid you know that Noah works for the FBI? He wears a gun, just like Theo\u2019s. I saw it clipped to his waistband. I\u2019m telling you, Theo has some real influential friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know a lot of people who need help from influential friends.\u201d</p><p>Jake finished his milk and set the glass in the sink. When he turned around, she noticed in the harsh overhead light how tired he looked.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go home now and let Theo and me close up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can, but the next couple of days are going to be busy.</p><p>People are going to be stopping in to sign up and eat, and you know how crowded it gets in here on Thursday and Friday. Go home, Daddy. Get off your feet and rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need your rest too. You\u2019ve got to start working on those papers at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d he said. \u201cI am tired, so I\u2019ll go on home. You shut down at one instead of two.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He opened the back door, then closed it. \u201cOh, I forgot to tell you that Ben Nelson called looking for you. He still doesn\u2019t have any news or any suspects, but he\u2019s going to keep an eye out just in case something else bad happens. Now, I ask you, is that something you want to say to a father? He had me worried sick about you, but then I remembered Theo is staying with you. You turn your deadbolts tonight.\u201d He reopened the door and stepped out into the moonlight. \u201cIt\u2019s a comfort,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a comfort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing Theo\u2019s going to be there with you.\u201d</p><p>Michelle nodded. It was a comfort. She locked the door, flipped off the light, and went back into the bar. Theo and Noah had carried their plates over to one of the round tables and were eating their sandwiches.</p><p>One of the regulars wanted a refill. She noticed how bleary-eyed he was and asked, \u201cAre you driving home tonight, Paulie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnie\u2019s coming by to pick me up after her shift\u2019s over at the plant. She\u2019s my designated driver tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d she said, smiling. She poured another glass of beer, noticed how stuffy it was inside, and turned up the speed on the overhead fan. There were only five customers in The Swan. She made sure everyone was happy, then filled two tall glasses with ice water and carried them over to Noah and Theo.</p><p>Theo pulled a chair out. \u201cSit with us.\u201d</p><p>She handed Noah his water, then sat down between him and Theo and put Theo\u2019s glass next to his plate.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I sent Daddy home, which means I have to close up the bar tonight,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so damned cute that you call your dad \u2018Daddy.\u2019 Is that a southern thing?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Renard thing,\u201d she said.</p><p>Noah had just popped the last of his french fries into his mouth and was washing it down with a big gulp of water when she asked him if he wanted her to accompany him to her clinic to survey the damage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already been there. I think Theo\u2019s right. Kids didn\u2019t do it. It was a one-man operation. And whoever it was got real frustrated looking for something. Did you notice the desk? The lock was destroyed. Somebody took a long time working at that lock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle thinks maybe it\u2019s one of Robinson\u2019s patients trying to steal his file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t a patient simply ask for his records?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cHe could get a copy of his records, but I would keep the original,\u201d Michelle answered.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it was a patient. Patient charts are confidential. Everyone knows that. Whatever is in the charts stays private. And why would a patient go to such extremes tearing the place up? If he wanted his records so badly, all he had to do was break in and lift it out from those boxes. No, I don\u2019t think it was a patient, but what does Robinson say? Did he have any pain-in-the . . . difficult patients?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t returned my call yet,\u201d Michelle told him. \u201cI\u2019ll try again in the morning. He recently moved to Phoenix, and he\u2019s probably busy getting settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you give Noah his phone number and let him talk to him,\u201d Theo suggested. \u201cPeople tend to sit up and take notice when the FBI calls. And on my worst day I couldn\u2019t be as abrasive as he can be. He\u2019s better at coercion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Noah scoffed at the notion. Turning to Michelle, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen Theo make grown men cry. It was kind of funny actually . . . watching a coldhearted killer, who happens to be the head of a crime organization, blubber like a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s exaggerating,\u201d Theo said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Noah argued. \u201cHowever, it is true that the average person doesn\u2019t know what the attorneys over in Justice do. Come to think about it, I\u2019m not so sure I know. Besides making criminals cry, what exactly do you do, Theo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d he answered dryly. \u201cWe drink a lot . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a given.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd try to think of things for you guys to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you do.\u201d Turning to Michelle, Noah added, \u201cThose lazy Justice attorneys make the dedicated FBI agents do all the hard work.\u201d</p> <p>Theo smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s called delegating. We do it so the little people won\u2019t feel left out.\u201d</p><p>The insults began to fly, and some of the outrageous things they said were hilarious. Vastly amused, she sat back and relaxed. When the subject eventually returned to her clinic, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to worry about this any longer. I\u2019ve been blowing this out of proportion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI was so spooked after I saw the mess, I thought I was being followed. You know that feeling you get? It\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d pay attention to that feeling if I were you,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cBut no one was following me,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI would have spotted him . . . wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot if he\u2019s good,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cThis is a very small community. Strangers would stick out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What about a man driving a van with maybe a cable company logo on the side? Would he stick out? And what about all the men and women who come here to fish? If they were dressed in fishing gear and carrying a pole, would you think they didn\u2019t belong?\u201d</p><p>Michelle stood. \u201cI see your point, and I appreciate your taking the time to look at the clinic, but I really believe this was just an isolated incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that belief is based on what?\u201d Theo asked. \u201cWishful thinking?\u201d</p><p>She ignored his sarcasm. \u201cThis is Bowen,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anyone had a problem with me, he\u2019d tell me so. Now that I\u2019ve had time to think about it, I didn\u2019t start jumping at shadows until after I saw the clinic. I overreacted. I will remind you,\u201d she hastened to add when he looked as though he was going to interrupt, \u201cthat nothing else has happened. You want to find a conspiracy, and there just isn\u2019t one.\u201d Turning to Noah, she said, \u201cI do thank you for coming to Bowen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me,\u201d Noah said. \u201cTo be honest, I only did the favor to get a favor. Theo\u2019s agreed to drive back to Biloxi with me. He\u2019s going to give a lecture for me, and I would have driven cross country to get out of that. I still have to go finish the training session, but at least I don\u2019t have to write a speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you have to be back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMonday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She turned away before either of them could see her disappointment.</p><p>Noah watched her walk away. \u201cDamn, Theo, she\u2019s something else. If we were going to stay around for a while, I\u2019d give you a run for your money. I\u2019ve always been a sucker for redheads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sucker for anything that wears a skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. Remember the Donovan case? Patty Donovan always wore skirts, and that didn\u2019t do anything for me.\u201d</p><p>Theo rolled his eyes. \u201cPatty was a transvestite. He didn\u2019t turn anyone on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had good legs. I\u2019ll give him that,\u201d Noah drawled. \u201cSo tell me something. What\u2019s happening with you and Michelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me the topic of the lecture I\u2019m giving,\u201d Theo said in hopes of getting Noah to change the subject. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cAnger management.\u201d</p><p>Theo laughed. \u201cWas this your boss\u2019s idea of a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it was,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know Morganstern. He\u2019s got a twisted sense of humor. He\u2019s making me run the training program to punish me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d Noah paused and then said, \u201cMorganstern could use a man like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the hidden agenda comes out at last. Did Pete ask you to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cHe might have mentioned . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes the way your mind works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d Theo reiterated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re happy where you are?\u201d</p><p>Theo shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m done. All used up,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going back to the office, tie up loose ends, and hand in my resignation.\u201d</p><p>Noah was stunned. \u201cYou aren\u2019t kidding, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not kidding. It\u2019s time . . . past time,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes one of those ideas have red hair?\u201d</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t answer. Before Noah could press, a man came over to the table and asked Theo if he could talk to him about a legal matter.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Theo said. \u201cLet\u2019s sit at the bar.\u201d</p><p>He got up, rolled his shoulders to work the kinks out, and then went behind the bar to pour himself a beer. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d he asked the young man.</p><p>Five minutes later, Theo wanted to punch the man. Noah saw Theo\u2019s expression and went behind the bar to find out what was wrong. He heard Theo say, \u201cJake didn\u2019t suggest that you talk to me, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I heard you were helping people who had legal troubles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Noah asked. He opened a long-neck bottle of beer, tossed the cap in the trash, and walked over to stand next to Theo.</p><p>\u201cThis is Cory,\u201d Theo said. \u201cHe\u2019s got two kids. A boy and a girl.\u201d</p><p>Noah squinted at the unpleasant-looking man. He looked more like a grungy teenager than a father of two children. Cory had long dirty blond hair that hung down in his eyes, and yellow stained teeth.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be twenty-two next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve already got two kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I got divorced from Emily over six months ago because I met another woman I wanted to be with. Her name\u2019s Nora, and she and me want to get married. I\u2019ve moved on, but Emily thinks I ought to keep paying child support, and that don\u2019t seem fair to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to help you figure out a way you can get out of paying child support?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I want. I mean, they\u2019re her kids now. They\u2019re living with her, and like I said, I\u2019m ready to move on.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in Theo\u2019s jaw flexed. Michelle was standing in the kitchen doorway, holding an empty pitcher in her hand. She\u2019d heard the conversation and knew from the way Theo\u2019s back had stiffened that he was angry.</p><p>His voice continued to be quite mild and pleasant as he remarked to Noah, \u201cCory\u2019s ready to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for him to move on?\u201d Noah asked as he set his beer bottle on the counter.</p><p>\u201cSure am,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>Then Noah smiled. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get the door.\u201d</p><p>Michelle started forward, then stopped. Theo moved so quickly she was astonished. One second he was smiling at Noah and the next he was around the bar, had Cory by the nape of his neck and the back of his jeans, and was dragging him across the floor. Noah raced ahead and opened the door, then got out of the way so Theo could toss the man outside.</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s what I call moving on,\u201d Noah drawled as he shut the door behind him. \u201cThe little prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I wonder? How could such a butt-ugly man get two women to sleep with him?\u201d</p><p>Theo laughed. \u201cNo accounting for taste, I guess.\u201d</p><p>The two men were walking toward the bar when the door behind them opened again and three men rushed inside. The last of the three looked like a bouncer who\u2019d taken one too many hits in the face. The man was huge, at least six foot four, and his nose obviously had been broken several times in the past. He was frighteningly mean looking and carried a baseball bat.</p><p>\u201cWhich one of you as**oles is Theo Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>Noah had already turned. He had his eye on the baseball bat. Michelle saw him reach behind his back and unsnap the holster housing his gun.</p><p>The bar emptied. Even Paulie, who had never been known to do anything in a hurry, made it out the front door in less than five seconds.</p><p>\u201cMichelle, go into the kitchen and shut the door,\u201d Theo said before he turned around. \u201cI\u2019m Theo Buchanan. Now, which one of you is Jim Carson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be me,\u201d the shortest of the three announced.</p><p>Theo nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been hoping you\u2019d stop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust who do you think you are?\u201d Jim railed.</p><p>\u201cI just told you who I am. Weren\u2019t you paying attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real smartass, huh? You think you can lock up my money and fix it at my bank so I can\u2019t even get a nickel out? You think you can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did do that,\u201d Theo calmly pointed out.</p><p>Jim Carson looked like his brother. He was short, squat, with eyes that were a little too closely set in his moon-shaped face. He didn\u2019t smile like his brother, though. While Gary oozed false sincerity, Jim was the master of vulgarity. He took another threatening step toward Theo and let loose with a string of grossly obscene blasphemies.</p><p>Then he said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be sorry you interfered in my business. Gary and I are going to shut down the mill, and then this town will lynch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d worry about my neck if I were you. How long have you been telling your employees you\u2019re on the verge of bankruptcy? Imagine how . . . disappointed people will be when they find out what your annual take is and what you have squirreled away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur assets are confidential information,\u201d Jim yelled. \u201cYou might know about our money, but you\u2019re an outsider trying to cause trouble, and if you tell anyone, they won\u2019t believe you. No one will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople tend to believe what\u2019s written in the paper, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote a nice little editorial that\u2019s going to be in Sunday\u2019s paper. Of course, I want it to be as accurate as possible,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, why don\u2019t I fax you over a copy of it tomorrow, and you can check it. Personally, I think it\u2019s some of my best work. I listed every cent in every account that you\u2019ve made over the past five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s confidential.\u201d Jim was shouting now.</p><p>Theo glanced at Noah. \u201cYou know, I should have added their tax returns for the past five years too. I guess I still could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finished, Buchanan. I\u2019m not going to let you cause any more trouble.\u201d</p><p>Jim was so angry, his brow was dripping with sweat. The man had worked himself into a lather, and it was obviously infuriating to him that Theo was unimpressed with his tantrum.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only just started making trouble, Jim. When I\u2019m finished with you and your brother, the employees are going to own the mill. It\u2019s going to happen fast too,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd you will be living on the streets. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to put that baseball bat down now?\u201d Noah asked the giant with the nose splattered all over his homely face.</p><p>\u201cShit, no. I\u2019m not putting this bat down before I use it. Isn\u2019t that right, Mr. Carson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Happy.\u201d</p><p>Theo laughed. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe live in a strange world,\u201d Noah replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to break Buchanan\u2019s legs with this bat, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. I\u2019m gonna hurt you too,\u201d he told Noah. \u201cSo you better stop laughing at me, because you\u2019re gonna be sorry.\u201d</p><p>Noah was now keeping a wary eye on the third man. He was almost as tall as the giant, but had a thin, wiry frame and large cauliflower ears. Both backup men looked like street fighters, but in Noah\u2019s opinion, Cauliflower was the real threat. He probably was carrying a concealed weapon. Oh, yes, he was the one who could give him real trouble, and he was apparently the surprise element Jimmy Boy had brought along in the event Happy didn\u2019t get the job done.</p><p>The bruiser was slapping the butt of the baseball bat in the palm of his hand. The smacking noise irritated Noah.</p><p>\u201cPut the bat down,\u201d he ordered once again.</p><p>\u201cNot before I break a couple of bones.\u201d</p><p>Noah suddenly smiled. He looked as if he\u2019d just won the lottery. \u201cHey, Theo, you know what?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d call Happy\u2019s remarks threats. Wouldn\u2019t you say they were threats? I mean, you\u2019d know, since you\u2019re a lawyer in Justice, and I\u2019m just a lowly little FBI agent. Those were threats. Right?\u201d</p><p>Theo knew exactly what Noah\u2019s game was. He was letting the three men know who they were so they couldn\u2019t say they hadn\u2019t been informed when they were locked up.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d have to say they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, smartass,\u201d Jim said, addressing Noah, \u201cyou get in my way, and I\u2019m going to enjoy hurting you too.\u201d He stabbed the air in front of Noah\u2019s face with his stubby finger.</p><p>Noah wasn\u2019t paying him any attention. \u201cMaybe we ought to let one of them hit us,\u201d he suggested to Theo. \u201cIt would probably look better in court.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can make the case without getting hit.

He took yet another step forward, poked Noah in the shoulder, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll wipe that smug smile off your face, you son of a \u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get a chance to finish the threat. Noah moved so fast, Jim didn\u2019t even have time to blink. But then again, blinking was definitely out of the question. He cried out, then froze and stared with one wide eye at Noah. The barrel of Noah\u2019s Glock was pressed snugly against his other eyelid.</p> <p>\u201cWhat were you going to say about my mother?\u201d Noah asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNothing . . . nothing at all,\u201d Jim stammered.</p><p>Happy swung the bat in a wide arc while Cauliflower pivoted on his heel and reached inside his jacket.</p><p>The loud click of the shotgun as it was being pumped reverberated throughout The Swan. The noise gained everyone\u2019s full attention.</p><p>Noah kept his gun pressed against Carson\u2019s face as he glanced behind him. Michelle was leaning against the counter with a shotgun aimed at Cauliflower. Theo moved in and grabbed the weapon from the thug\u2019s waistband. Then he looked at Michelle.</p> <p>\u201cI asked you to go to the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I heard you ask.\u201d</p><p>Cauliflower tried to grab his gun. \u201cI\u2019ve got a permit for that. Give it back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a stupid thing to say,\u201d Theo muttered. Cauliflower lunged. Theo pivoted and using two knuckles chopped Cauliflower just below his Adam\u2019s apple. The man reeled back, and as he turned, Theo struck him on the back of his neck. Cauliflower collapsed, out cold on the floor. \u201cI can\u2019t abide stupid people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d Noah said. \u201cJim, I\u2019m gonna have to shoot you if Happy doesn\u2019t put that bat down real soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it, Happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, Mr. Carson, you told me \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget what I told you. Drop the bat.\u201d He tried to back away from the gun, but Noah simply followed.</p><p>\u201cPlease put that away. I don\u2019t want you to accidentally shoot my brains out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s assuming you have a brain,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that. What were you thinking, coming in here with your hired hands? Are you so cocky you didn\u2019t worry about witnesses? Or are you too stupid to care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was mad . . . I wasn\u2019t thinking . . . I just wanted . . .\u201d</p><p>He stopped stammering as soon as Noah removed the Glock. Then Jim, making up for lost time, began to blink furiously.</p><p>\u201cIs Harry dead?\u201d Jim asked. \u201cIf you killed Harry . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still breathing,\u201d Noah said. \u201cDon\u2019t make me ask again, Happy. Get rid of the bat.\u201d</p> <p>Happy looked decidedly unhappy as he threw the bat hard at the table next to him. Since he couldn\u2019t break any legs, he decided he wanted to break some property. Then maybe Jim Carson would still pay him. The baseball bat struck the edge of the table, bounced back, and struck Happy\u2019s foot. He let out a yelp and started hopping around as though he were playing a game of hopscotch.</p><p>Theo handed Harry\u2019s weapon to Noah and rubbed the sting out of his knuckles. \u201cPut Jim in the chair,\u201d he added before striding to the bar. He looked at Michelle now. \u201cMichelle, what the hell are you doing with a sawed-off shotgun? Put that down before you hurt someone.\u201d Then he got closer to her and noticed how modified the weapon was. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Daddy\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, holding his patience. \u201cWhere did Daddy get it?\u201d</p><p>He was suddenly acting like a Justice attorney and making her feel as if she were the criminal.</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s never fired the thing. He will occasionally wave it around when he thinks there might be a bar fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul gave it to Daddy for protection. He taught both of us how to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have this. It\u2019s illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll give it to Noah and let him get rid of it for you.\u201d He took the weapon from her. \u201cThis sucker could take down a rhino at a hundred yards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr an alligator,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>\u201cOh? Have there been many alligators fighting in the bar lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, but \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how many years your dad could get for this?\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms across her waist. \u201cWe do things different in Bowen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I heard, Bowen was part of the United States, and that means you follow the same rules. Where did your brother get hold of something like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare think about giving my brother trouble, Theo. He\u2019s a kind, gentle, sensitive man, and I won\u2019t let you \u2014\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t in the mood to hear a glowing testament. \u201cAnswer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where he got it. For all I know, he made the thing, and if you take this one away, John Paul will only give Daddy another one just like it.\u201d</p><p>Theo\u2019s eyelid twitched. She knew she was upsetting him, but at the moment she didn\u2019t particularly care. What was Daddy supposed to do when things got out of hand in The Swan? Wring his hands while they tore his bar apart? Besides, her father would never shoot anyone, but the sound of the shotgun being pumped was always enough to discourage hotheads.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the way things are around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father and your brother are breaking the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shotgun\u2019s mine,\u201d she announced then. \u201cI made it, and I put it under the counter. Daddy doesn\u2019t even know it\u2019s there. So go ahead. Turn me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not nice to lie to an employee of the Justice Department, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just where would your brother learn about weapons like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to talk about it, but he once told Daddy he was part of a specialized team in the marines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecialized? No kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to discuss my family, and it\u2019s really none of your business anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He moved closer, pinning her against the counter. He leaned down until he was just an inch above her and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t push me.\u201d</p><p>It took him all of five seconds to realize he wasn\u2019t going to win. She couldn\u2019t be intimidated, at least by him. She stood her ground and looked him right in the eyes. As galling as it was to admit, he knew he was going to have to be the one to back down. It was a first for him, and it wasn\u2019t pleasant.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call the police?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to have you arrested.\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, she said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about me. I thought you might want the police to come and get the Three Stooges over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh . . . yeah, call them, but wait a couple of minutes. I want to do some negotiating first.\u201d</p><p>Noah had put his gun away and was standing over Jim. Theo grabbed a chair, turned it to face him, and sat down.</p><p>\u201cHave you got your phone with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I do?\u201d Jim asked, antagonistic once again.</p><p>\u201cCall your brother and tell him to get over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d Theo said. \u201cYou\u2019re in a hell of a lot of trouble. You threatened an FBI agent and that means jail time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell it to my lawyers,\u201d Jim blustered, though his face had lost some of its color. \u201cThey\u2019ll fix it so I don\u2019t do a day behind bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know too many attorneys who will work pro bono. I doubt they\u2019ll do anything to help you once they hear you don\u2019t have any money to pay them.\u201d</p><p>Jim pulled out his cell phone and punched in his brother\u2019s number. \u201cHe won\u2019t come,\u201d he told Theo. \u201cGary doesn\u2019t like anything unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. You tell Gary he has ten minutes to get here, or I\u2019ll have the police pick him up at home and take him with you to jail. You boys are either going to negotiate now or sit in a cell and think about it for a couple of months. And trust me, Jim. I\u2019ve got the clout to keep you there.\u201d</p><p>Gary apparently answered his phone. Jim\u2019s voice shook when he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get over to The Swan right away. Don\u2019t argue. Just do it. I\u2019ll explain when you get here.\u201d</p><p>He listened for a few seconds, then said, \u201cHell, no, it didn\u2019t go as planned. Buchanan and another fella are FBI, and they\u2019re threatening to lock both of us up.\u201d He listened for another minute, then shouted, \u201cA bit of bad luck? You call the FBI a bit of bad luck? Stop yapping and get on over here.\u201d He slapped the phone closed and glared at Theo. \u201cHe\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>Noah spotted the police car pulling into the parking lot. \u201cCops are here,\u201d he told Theo.</p><p>Michelle grabbed the shotgun and put it back under the counter on the bracket. \u201cI didn\u2019t call Ben yet,\u201d she said.</p><p>Harry was still unconscious, but he was breathing. Happy was hunched over one of the tables in the corner, his head in his hands.</p><p>Noah went outside. He came in a couple of minutes later with Ben Nelson. He had obviously filled the policeman in on the particulars, because Ben barely spared Harry a glance. His gaze and his smile were on Michelle.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, his concern apparent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Ben. Who called you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWas it Paulie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one called me. I just came by to see you.\u201d</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t like hearing that. Ben was on his way to the bar, but Theo stood, effectively blocking his path. Michelle made the introductions, though it wasn\u2019t necessary. Theo already knew who Ben was. He was the man who wanted Michelle.</p><p>Theo had never paid much attention to another man\u2019s appearance, and he really didn\u2019t know if women would consider Ben handsome or not. He had an easy smile and all of his teeth, and that was about as far as Theo went sizing him up. Ben seemed like a nice guy too. That didn\u2019t matter, though. Theo noticed the way he smiled at Michelle and took an instant dislike to him. He had to force himself not to be hostile as he shook his hand and let him know who was in charge.</p><p>Noah watched the two men with a good deal of amusement. They were posturing like roosters getting ready for a fight. It didn\u2019t take Noah any time at all to figure out why.</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re staying at Michelle\u2019s house.\u201d Ben wasn\u2019t smiling now.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you plan to be in town, Mr. Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how long. Why do you want to know, Chief Nelson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got several nice motels over in St. Claire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo\u2019s leaving Monday,\u201d Michelle announced. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d she added, a challenging note in her voice.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>The noncommittal response irritated her. \u201cHe\u2019s giving a speech in Biloxi.\u201d She didn\u2019t know why she felt compelled to share that information. \u201cSo he will be leaving Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Theo repeated.</p><p>The word had the same effect as the sound of a dentist\u2019s drill. She wanted to cringe. Worried she would say something she would regret if Theo uttered that word one more time, she made a hasty retreat. Grabbing the empty iced tea pitcher, she excused herself and went into the kitchen.</p><p>While Theo explained to Ben who Harry and Happy were, Noah read the thugs their rights and then used Ben\u2019s handcuffs to secure them.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jim Carson?\u201d Ben asked. \u201cAre you going to be pressing charges against him?\u201d</p><p>Theo knew Jim was listening. \u201cI sure am,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want him to stay here until his brother arrives. I want to talk to both of them. If they don\u2019t cooperate . . .\u201d He deliberately left the sentence hanging.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to cooperate,\u201d Jim cried out.</p><p>Ben was a better man than Theo. He shook his hand before he left. Theo decided then that he\u2019d acted like a jealous lover and needed to shape up.</p><p>\u201cThanks for your help,\u201d he called out as Ben followed Happy out the door. Noah had already shaken Harry awake and had half dragged him to the police car.</p><p>Theo glanced toward the kitchen, saw Michelle working at the sink, and then pulled out a chair and straddled it while he waited for the other Carson brother to arrive.</p><p>Michelle had decided she needed to get busy so she could take her mind off of Theo. She filled the stainless steel sink with hot water and soap, put on rubber gloves, and started scrubbing. Her father had already cleaned the kitchen, but she went over every surface again.</p><p>When she was removing her gloves, she noticed a spot of grease up on the copper overhead exhaust. She spent the next half hour taking the unit apart and cleaning every nook and cranny. Getting it back together took twice as long because she had to keep stopping to check the bar in case a customer wanted something.</p><p>On one of her trips, she saw Gary Carson come in, flanked by his attorneys.</p><p>She returned to the kitchen and scrubbed some more. Then she washed her rubber gloves \u2014 how compulsive was that? she wondered, and realized she was more revved up now than weary. What she needed, she decided, was a good, long surgery. When she was cutting, nothing got in her way. She could block the conversation swirling around her, the lame jokes, the laughter \u2014 everything but Willie Nelson because he soothed her \u2014 and she and Willie stayed in that isolated cocoon until she\u2019d put in the last stitch. Only then did she let the world intrude.</p><p>\u201cGet a grip,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><p>Noah was standing in the doorway. He went to the sink and put three glasses on the counter.</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little after one. You look tired.\u201d</p><p>She blew a strand of hair out of her eye as she dried her hands on a towel. \u201cI\u2019m not tired. How much longer do you think Theo will be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want me to take you home? Theo can close up.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah started to leave, then turned. \u201cMichelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday\u2019s a lifetime away.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p> <p>As soon as Monk was back in his motel room, he called New Orleans.</p><p>Waking from a deep sleep, Dallas answered the phone, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe surprises just keep on coming,\u201d Monk said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an FBI agent here with Buchanan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God. Give me the name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it yet. I heard some guys talking about him when they came out of the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you know what he\u2019s doing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but it looks like they were talking about fishing.\u201d</p><p>Apprehensive, Dallas said, \u201cJust hang tight, and I\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, by the way,\u201d Monk said, \u201cI have some other information that may come in handy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt better be good,\u201d Dallas answered.</p><p>Monk gave an account of the Carson brothers and the two bone breakers who had gone into the bar.</p><p>\u201cI heard one of the men tell the policeman that he wasn\u2019t going to kill Buchanan. He just wanted to hurt him. With a little planning, we might be able to use the Carsons as a scapegoat if necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he answered sarcastically.</p><p>Monk hung up the phone, set his alarm clock, and then closed his eyes. He fell asleep thinking about the money.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>For the first time in her life, Michelle couldn\u2019t sleep, and it was all Theo Buchanan\u2019s fault. Everything, including the national debt, was his fault when it was the middle of the night and she was sleep-deprived because she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him.</p> <p>She tossed and turned, beat her pillows, then tossed and turned some more. Her bed looked as though a cyclone had hit. To take her mind off her lustful thoughts, she changed the sheets, then took a long, hot shower. Neither chore made her sleepy. She went downstairs then and drank warm milk \u2014 she could barely get the vile stuff down and wondered how anyone could drink milk warm when it tasted so much better cold.</p><p>Theo hadn\u2019t made a sound since he\u2019d closed his bedroom door. He was probably sound asleep and dreaming the dreams of the innocent. The big jerk.</p><p>Michelle crept back upstairs so she wouldn\u2019t disturb him, brushed her teeth again, then opened one of her bedroom windows so she could hear the sounds of the approaching thunderstorm.</p><p>She put on a pink silk nightgown \u2014 the green cotton one felt scratchy against her shoulders \u2014 then slipped between the sheets and vowed she wasn\u2019t going to get up again. Her nightgown was bunched up around her hips. She smoothed it down, adjusted the spaghetti straps so they wouldn\u2019t droop down over her arms. There, everything was perfect. Folding her hands together over her stomach, she closed her eyes and took deep, calming breaths. She stopped when she got dizzy.</p><p>She felt a wrinkle in the bottom sheet under her ankle. Don\u2019t think about it, she told herself. It\u2019s time to sleep. Relax, damn it.</p><p>Another fifteen minutes passed and she was still wide awake. Her skin was hot, the sheets felt damp from the humidity, and she was so tired she wanted to cry.</p><p>Desperate, she started counting sheep but stopped that game as soon as she realized she was racing to get them all accounted for. Counting sheep was like chewing gum. She never chewed gum because, in a subconscious attempt to get finished, she would chew faster and faster, which of course defeated the whole notion of chewing gum in the first place.</p><p>Lord, the things a person will think about when that person is losing her ever-loving mind. She should have specialized in psychiatry, she decided. Then maybe she could figure out why she was turning looney tunes.</p><p>Television. That was it. She\u2019d watch television. There was never anything good on TV in the middle of the night. Surely someone was selling something on one of the channels. An infomercial was just what she needed. It was better than a sleeping pill.</p><p>She threw the sheet off, grabbed the afghan from the bottom of her bed, and dragged it across the room. The door squeaked when she opened it. Why hadn\u2019t she noticed that noise before? she wondered. Tossing the afghan onto the chair, she went out into the hallway, got down on her knees, and slowly pulled the door closed. She thought the bottom hinge was making the groaning sound and leaned close to listen as she moved the door back and forth.</p><p>That was the one, all right. She decided then to check the top hinge. She stood, grabbed the doorknob again, and moved the door back and forth while leaning in on tiptoes to listen. Sure enough, it was making a little squeaking sound too. Now where had she put that can of WD-40? She could fix this problem right this minute if she could just remember where she\u2019d last seen that can. Wait a minute . . . the garage. That\u2019s where it was. She\u2019d put it up on the shelf in the garage.</p><p>\u201cHaving trouble sleeping?\u201d</p><p>He nearly scared her to death. She jumped, inadvertently pulled the door, and hit her head against it. \u201cOuch,\u201d she whispered as she let go of the handle and reached up to feel if her scalp was bleeding.</p><p>Then she turned around. She couldn\u2019t have gotten another word out if her life had depended on it. Theo stood in his doorway, casually leaning against the frame with his arms folded across his bare chest and one bare foot crossed over the other. His hair was tousled, his face needed a shave, and he looked as though he\u2019d just been awakened from a deep sleep. He had pulled on a pair of Levi\u2019s, but hadn\u2019t bothered to zip them.</p><p>He was simply irresistible.</p><p>She stared at the narrow opening between the zipper, then realized she was staring and forced herself to look away. She settled on his chest, realized that was a mistake, and ended up staring at his feet. He had great feet.</p><p>Oh, boy, did she need help. Now his feet were turning her on. She needed therapy, intense therapy, to help her figure out how any man could make her so nuts.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t just any man, though. All along she\u2019d known how dangerous the attraction was. It was the damned fence, she decided. If he hadn\u2019t bought the damned fence for little John Patrick, she might have been able to continue to resist him. Too late now. She let out a little groan. Theo was still a big jerk, but she\u2019d fallen for him anyway.</p><p>She swallowed hard. He looked good enough to . . . don\u2019t go there. Then she looked into his eyes. She wanted him to scoop her up into his muscular arms, kiss her senseless, and carry her to bed. She wanted him to take her nightgown off and caress every inch of her body. Maybe she would toss him on the bed, take his Levi\u2019s off, and caress every inch of his body. She wanted to \u2014</p><p>\u201cMichelle, what are you doing? It\u2019s two-thirty in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Her fantasy came to a screeching halt. \u201cYour door doesn\u2019t squeak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged, then pushed a strand of hair away from her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you because your door didn\u2019t make any noise when you opened it. How long have you been standing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough to watch you play with your door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt squeaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, the door squeaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Theo. I didn\u2019t mean to disturb you, but since you\u2019re awake . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to play cards?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. Then that slow, easy smile appeared, and she started feeling light-headed.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to play cards. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you ask?\u201d</p><p>The way he was staring at her with that penetrating gaze of his made her extremely nervous, but it was the good kind of nervous she\u2019d felt just before he\u2019d kissed her the night before, which meant that it was bad, because she\u2019d never wanted the kiss to end, and what kind of convoluted sense did that make? She was losing her mind, all right. She wondered if she could schedule her patient appointments from the psychiatric ward.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop looking at me like that.\u201d Her toes curled into the carpet, and she felt her stomach doing back flips.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep. So do you want to do something until I get sleepy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides cards?\u201d she asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could fix you a sandwich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPancakes,\u201d she said then. \u201cI could fix you pancakes.\u201d</p><p>On a scale of one to ten, her anxiety was climbing past nine. Did he have any idea how much she wanted him? Just don\u2019t think about it. Keep busy. \u201cI make great pancakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re not hungry? You\u2019re always hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m drowning here, babe. Work with me. She caught her lower lip between her teeth while she frantically tried to come up with another idea.</p><p>\u201cTelevision,\u201d she suddenly blurted, acting as though she\u2019d just correctly answered the million-dollar question and Regis was handing her the check.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to watch television?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She felt as if he\u2019d just snatched the lifeline out of her hands.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThen you think of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething we could do together? Until you get sleepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to mask her disappointment. She guessed she was going to go back to counting those damn smelly sheep. \u201cOkay. Good night, then.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t go back into his bedroom, though. Pulling away from the doorway with the agility of a big, lazy, well-fed cat, he closed the distance between them in two long strides. His toes touched hers as he reached behind her and opened her bedroom door. He smelled faintly of aftershave, Dial soap, and man, and she found the combination extremely arousing. Who was she kidding? At this point, a sneeze would turn her on.</p><p>He took hold of her hand, but his grip was light. She could have easily pulled away if she\u2019d wanted to, but she didn\u2019t. In fact, she held tight.</p><p>Then he tugged her into her bedroom. He shut the door, backed her against it, and pinned her there with his arms on either side of her face and his pelvis pressed snugly against her thighs.</p><p>The wood was cool against her back, his skin hot against her belly.</p><p>Burying his face in her hair, he whispered, \u201cGod, you smell good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the base of her neck. \u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes . . . yes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he corrected. He was kissing that wonderfully sensitive spot below her ear now, driving her to distraction. Her breath caught in her throat when his teeth gently closed on her earlobe.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI said I wanted to go to bed. And you said . . .\u201d His hands moved to cup the sides of her face. He looked into her eyes for several long seconds, and then said, \u201c. . . okay.\u201d</p><p>She was a goner and she knew it. His mouth covered hers in a long, hot, passionate kiss that let her know how much he wanted her. Her lips parted, and she felt a jolt of pleasure all the way down to her toes when his tongue went in search of hers. Her arms went around his waist, and then her hands began to stroke and caress him. She could feel the hard muscles under her fingertips, and when her h*ps began to move restlessly against him, she felt him tremble.</p><p>The kiss went on and on until she was gripping his shoulders and shaking with desire. It was decadent the way he made her feel, and frightening too, because she had never experienced such passion before, never felt this kind of desperation to hold tight and never let go. Oh, how she loved him.</p><p>They were both panting when he lifted his head. He saw the tears glistening in her eyes and went completely still.</p><p>\u201cMichelle. Do you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>She frantically shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll die if you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>She tugged on his jeans, trying unsuccessfully to get them past his hips.</p><p>\u201cSlow down, sweetheart. We\u2019ve got all night.\u201d</p><p>And that was the problem. She wanted more than one night. She wanted forever, but she knew that wasn\u2019t possible, and so she decided to take what he offered and cherish the moments they did have. She would love him in a way no other woman could, with her heart, her body, and her soul. And when he left her, he would never be able to forget.</p><p>They shared another long, hot, open-mouth, tongue-thrusting kiss that only made them want more. He pulled away, stepped back, and stripped out of his jeans. Her breath caught in the back of her throat. He was beautiful. And fully aroused. The sight of him overwhelmed her because he was so perfectly sculpted.</p><p>In the moonlight, his skin seemed to glisten like gold. She reached for the straps of her gown, but he stilled her hands. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>He slowly pulled her nightgown up over her head and tossed it on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had such fantasies about you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYour body is much better than I imagined. The way you feel pressed against me . . . that\u2019s much better too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what we were doing in your fantasy, and I\u2019ll tell you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019d rather show than tell.\u201d</p><p>His chest hair was tickling her breasts. She liked it so much, she moved against him. She could feel his arousal against her and shifted so that her h*ps cuddled him. It felt so good, so right to be held like this.</p><p>\u201cIn one of my fantasies, I do this.\u201d</p><p>He picked her up in his arms and carried her to the bed. He followed her down on the sheets, nudged her thighs apart, and settled between them. Then he kissed her again, lingering over the task, until she was moving restlessly against him again.</p><p>Then he rolled onto his side and touched her stomach. \u201cAnd I do this.\u201d His fingers circled her belly button, then moved lower. She sucked in her breath. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>His fingers were magical. \u201cYes . . . yes, but if you don\u2019t stop, I\u2019ll . . .\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go on. He was driving her crazy, teasing, probing, preparing her for him. His head dipped and he began to kiss the fragrant valley between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cIn my favorite fantasy, you really love this.\u201d</p><p>He kissed each breast, his tongue stroking each nipple until she was arched half off the bed. Her nails dug into his shoulders, and she kept trying to get him to move so that she could drive him out of his mind with her mouth and her tongue, but Theo wouldn\u2019t budge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In this fantasy, he explained, she came before he did. He kissed away any resistance she might have had, and then he slowly moved down her body, kissing every inch of her stomach, teasing her belly button by gently tickling her with the tip of his tongue, and then he moved lower still between her silky thighs.</p><p>The sensations were consuming. The cl**ax was powerful. She cried out as she clung to him and let his passion devour her.</p><p>Theo was such an amazing lover, so giving, so gentle. Then he began to torment her. He brought her to a fevered pitch a second time, but just when she was reaching the explosive brink, he stopped.</p><p>\u201cHold on, sweetheart. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. \u201cI\u2019ve got to protect you.\u201d</p><p>And then he left. She closed her eyes. Her body felt as though it was on fire, yet she was chilled because his heat was gone. She began to tremble, and just as she was reaching for the covers, Theo came back to the bed and covered her body with his. It seemed he\u2019d been gone for an eternity.</p><p>\u201cNow, where was I?\u201d</p><p>His restraint and control amazed her. Then she noticed the beads of perspiration on his brow. His eyes were hazy with passion, and his jaw was clenched tight, and she saw then the lengths he had gone to for her.</p> <p>His hands began to stroke the passion within her once again. She fought him this time, trying to hold out until he lost his control, but he was stronger. He wasn\u2019t gentle now. She didn\u2019t want him to be. Consumed with the waves of pleasure still coursing through her body, she held him tight as he roughly parted her thighs, then lifted her h*ps and sank deep inside her warmth.</p><p>His head dropped down onto her shoulder. He closed his eyes in sweet surrender, and let out a loud, thoroughly arrogant groan.</p><p>Gripping her, he forced her to stay still. \u201cI can make this last . . . if you . . . cooperate.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him. Lord, he was adorable. Then she moved.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t . . . Oh, God, honey, slow down just a little . . . \u201d</p><p>She moved again, more forcefully this time, arching up against him to take him deeper inside her. He couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. The need became too great. He pulled back, then thrust deep once again, then again and again and again.</p> <p>Theo wanted to tell her how perfect she was, how beautiful, but he couldn\u2019t get the words out. The intensity of the feelings rocketing through his body was too overpowering. She wouldn\u2019t let him slow down. He loved her for that. He buried himself inside her, and with one final thrust and one hell of a shout, he cl**axed while she held him close.</p><p>He felt as though he\u2019d just died and been reborn. The orgasm was the most amazing thing he\u2019d ever experienced. He\u2019d never let himself go like this. He\u2019d always held a part of himself back, but with Michelle, that hadn\u2019t been possible. It took long minutes for both of them to recover. He knew he had to be crushing her, but he couldn\u2019t find the strength to move away.</p><p>Michelle couldn\u2019t stop caressing him. She loved the feel of his smooth skin under her fingertips. He was all muscle and strength and yet so very gentle with her. Her fingers trailed down his spine, then slowly moved back up.</p><p>Her heart beat against her chest as though it were pounding to get out. She laughed over the absurdity of the idea.</p><p>The sound of her lusty laugh made him smile. Bracing his weight with his arms on either side of her, he lifted his head from the crook of her neck so he could look into her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoving you is going to be the death of me. I can see the headlines now: \u2018Sex kills surgeon.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck, leaned up and kissed him. \u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stay strong because we\u2019ve got nine hundred ninety-nine more to go, and I can\u2019t let you fall apart before we\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinished doing what?\u201d</p><p>That sparkle came into his eyes again, and she began to smile in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cActing out my fantasies.\u201d</p><p>She did laugh then. \u201cA thousand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. At least a thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got quite an active imagination. Mr. Buchanan. There are places you can go to get help. They\u2019re called sex therapy clinics.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou were all the therapy I needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was happy I could help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Michelle? Didn\u2019t you ever have fantasies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut mine weren\u2019t as creative. I kept having the same one over and over again.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled the crook of her neck. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a variation on what just happened,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut in my fantasy . . .\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head again. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI scoop you up and toss you on the bed.\u201d</p><p>Then he laughed. \u201cI outweigh you by about two hundred pounds,\u201d he exaggerated.</p><p>\u201cWe surgeons develop incredible upper-body strength from cracking ribs and cutting through bones,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m willing. If you want to pick me up . . .\u201d</p><p>He stopped when she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019d blow a disc,\u201d she explained. \u201cI only told you about the fantasy so you\u2019d know . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t always going to be calling the shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to drive you wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d He kissed her again, hard and fast, then got out of bed and lifted her into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m hot,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers threaded through his tousled hair, trying to restore order to the soft strands.</p><p>\u201cNot that kind of hot, but if you keep that up . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sweaty hot. Let\u2019s take a shower.\u201d</p><p>She was so content and sleepy now, she would have agreed to do anything he suggested. \u201cI\u2019ll scrub your back and you may scrub mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to scrub your front, and you can \u2014\u201d</p><p>She put her hand over his mouth. \u201cI get the picture.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later they were both squeaky clean. The water had turned cold, but that didn\u2019t squelch their passion. Feeling devilish, she leaned up on tiptoes and whispered her fantasy into his ear. She went into detail, and when she was finished, Theo was amazed he could still stand.</p><p>She pushed him back against the tile, then began to drive him out of his mind with hot, wet kisses as she slowly worked her way down his slick body.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have the strength to carry her back to bed. They haphazardly dried each other between ardent kisses. Exhausted from their lovemaking, they fell into bed. Theo rolled onto his back. She propped herself up on one elbow and traced the outline of the tiny scar from his appendectomy.</p><p>Then she leaned down and gently kissed it. His eyes were closed, but he was smiling. \u201cDo you do that to all your patients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss their scars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I have to.\u201d</p><p>He yawned. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the oath I took. Kiss it and make it better.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the sheet up as she rolled onto her back and closed her eyes. She was falling into a deep sleep when Theo nudged her.</p><p>\u201cMichelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found your best feature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked in a sleepy whisper.</p><p>He tugged the sheet down and put his hand on her breast. If she hadn\u2019t been so tired, she would have asked him to explain why men had such an obsession with breasts, but then she suddenly realized just where his hand was pressed and tears sprang into her eyes. How could she not love this man?</p><p>He had placed his hand over her heart.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>Michelle didn\u2019t wake up until ten-fifteen the following morning. She stretched, then rolled over and hugged the pillow Theo had used. She closed her eyes again while she thought about the night they had shared. In the midst of her recollections, the sleep cleared from her mind and the day intruded. It was ten-fifteen, and she was supposed to have met her friends at the clinic at eight. Mary Ann was going to kill her. Was she sitting in her car waiting? No, of course not. She would have driven to the house.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Michelle was ready to go. Dressed in a pair of khaki shorts and a sleeveless blue blouse, she put on ankle socks and one tennis shoe. She ran down the stairs, then paused in the laundry room to lean against the washer and put the other shoe on.</p><p>She went looking for Theo. She found him in her library, sitting in her leather chair, talking on the phone. Noah was with him. He was perched on the edge of the desk. He smiled when he saw her.</p><p>\ufffd\ufffdGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she replied.</p><p>She sat down on the sofa and bent to tie her shoelaces. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Theo hang up the phone, but she was having a little trouble looking directly at him. The memory of what they had done the night before was still acutely vivid in her mind.</p><p>It was only awkward because Noah was there, she thought.</p><p>\u201cSleep well?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I was supposed to be at the clinic hours ago.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get the knot in her shoelace untied and knew it was because she was nervous. Take a breath, she told herself. You\u2019re an adult. Act like one.</p><p>\u201cMary Ann \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs at the clinic. Noah let her and her friend in. They came here looking for you around eight-thirty.\u201d</p><p>She finally got the knot undone and quickly tied the laces. She didn\u2019t hear Theo coming, but suddenly he was standing in front of her. His left shoelace was untied. Without even thinking about it, she reached over, tied it for him, and stood.</p><p>Theo wasn\u2019t going to let her ignore him any longer. He nudged her under her chin to get her to look at him, then leaned down and kissed her. He didn\u2019t seem to care that Noah was there. He took his time, and with very little coaxing he got her to cooperate and return the kiss.</p><p>Without making a sound, Noah got up and left the room. Theo hugged Michelle and whispered, \u201cWant to fool around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we did that last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We can do it again. Besides, that was just a warm-up.\u201d She tried to wiggle out of his arms. He tightened his hold. \u201cMichelle, you aren\u2019t embarrassed about last night, are you?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew to his and she saw how worried he looked. \u201cI\u2019m a physician, Theo. Nothing embarrasses me.\u201d</p><p>Then she kissed him and gave it all she had. Her tongue touched his, once, then once again, and when she pulled back, she was pleased to see that I-want-to-get-you-naked look was back in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI have work to do,\u201d she said as she successfully disengaged herself from his embrace.</p><p>\u201cActually, you don\u2019t. Mary Ann told me that she and Cindy \u2014 I think that was the other woman\u2019s name \u2014 would get the files in order much faster if you stay away. I\u2019m supposed to keep you busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did not say \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she did. She said you\u2019re critical and picky. Those were her words, not mine. Your dad called to tell you John Paul moved your furniture out. He\u2019s going to fix what he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have carried my desk or my sofa by himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy named Artie helped him. So, nothing embarrasses you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you look embarrassed when I kissed you good morning?\u201d</p><p>She headed for the kitchen with Theo right on her heels. \u201cI was thinking about Noah. I didn\u2019t want him to be embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>Theo thought that was hilarious. Noah heard the laughter and poked his head around the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Michelle said as she edged past him to get into the kitchen. She opened the refrigerator to look for a Diet Coke and did a double take. The fridge had been pretty bare the night before, but now it was packed with food and drinks. She found a Diet Coke way in the back, grabbed it, and closed the door. Then she opened the door again to make sure she hadn\u2019t imagined it, spotted the sticks of real butter, and guessed who was responsible.</p><p>\u201cNoah doesn\u2019t know how to be embarrassed. Do you?\u201d Theo asked his friend.</p><p>\u201cEmbarrassed about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex. You know what sex is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. I read all about it in a book once. I\u2019m thinking about trying it out one of these days.\u201d</p><p>They were both having a good old time teasing her. She sat down at the table and only then noticed the triple layer chocolate cake on the counter. Noah grabbed a towel and went to the stove to lift the lid on a large iron kettle. The spicy scent of gumbo immediately filled the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you have time to make this?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cIt sure smells good.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember what her father had told her. Was she supposed to say she baked the cake or made the gumbo? Then Noah asked her if she wanted a slice of home-baked bread. The French loaf was sitting on waxed paper by the sink.</p><p>\u201cIs there a card with the gumbo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see one,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cThen I made it.\u201d She smiled as she told the lie.</p><p>Theo got the milk out of the refrigerator and put it down on the table. \u201cYou were a busy woman last night. Did you bake the cake too?\u201d</p><p>Feeling like an idiot, she asked, \u201cIs there a card with the cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I made that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the bread?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo card?\u201d she asked, trying to maintain a straight face.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t see one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just love to bake bread in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>Theo put a box of Frosted Flakes, a box of raisin bran, and a box of Quaker breakfast bars on the table so Michelle would have a choice. Then he got her a spoon.</p><p>\u201cSo the lady sneaking in the back door with the bread wasn\u2019t fibbing when she said you baked the bread at her house last night and forgot to bring it home?\u201d</p><p>Michelle had gone way past feeling foolish. Where were all the stupid cards? Had her father decided to change his game plan and forgotten to mention it to her? What was she supposed to say now? If she told Theo the truth, her father would think she wasn\u2019t cooperating with his sacred cause to keep Theo in Bowen.</p><p>Daddy wasn\u2019t going to be able to accuse her of not being a game player. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cJust after you fell asleep, I came downstairs, fixed the gumbo and baked the cake; then I got in the car and drove over to . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She suddenly stopped. Theo hadn\u2019t told her the name of the woman who had dropped the bread off, and Michelle couldn\u2019t remember to whom Daddy had assigned the task. Quickly improvising, she continued, \u201c. . . a friend\u2019s house and baked a couple of loaves of bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, yes, I stopped by the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>Theo straddled the chair across from her. Stacking his arms on the back, he said, \u201cSo that\u2019s your story, huh?\u201d</p> <p>She began to smile. \u201cUnless or until you find a couple of \u2018Welcome to Bowen\u2019 cards. In that event, my story will change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Jake I said thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for what?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mike, you want some gumbo?\u201d Noah asked as he searched through the drawers looking for a ladle.</p><p>\u201cFor breakfast? I\u2019ll stick with an energy bar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you, Theo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what goes great with gumbo? Potato chips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have any potato chips. They aren\u2019t good for you, anyway. Too much sodium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will balance out with the sodium in the gumbo,\u201d Noah told her.</p><p>\u201cYou do too have potato chips. Two jumbo-size bags, and they\u2019re the real thing. None of that low-fat cardboard stuff. Did you forget you bought them at the grocery store last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know what goes great with gumbo and chips?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cCold beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d Theo got up and went to the refrigerator. Michelle shook her head. \u201cGumbo, potato chips, and beer at ten-thirty in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s eleven, and we\u2019ve been up for hours. Don\u2019t frown like that, honey. Let us corrupt you. Join in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she a health nut?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Theo replied. \u201cShe lives by the credo \u2018If it tastes good, spit it out.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you boys are having your multiple bypasses, remember this conversation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI talked to Dr. Robinson,\u201d Noah said then. He had found the ladle and was scooping the gumbo into two bowls. Theo already had the sack of chips and was opening it.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>He put the bowls on the table, grabbed two tablespoons, and sat down. \u201cHe could only think of two men who gave him real trouble, and I\u2019m running a check on both of them. An old guy named George Everett was one difficult patient. Do you know him, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverett refused to pay his bill because Robinson didn\u2019t cure him of his indigestion. Everett had a drinking problem, which he also blamed on the doctor. He told Robinson he wouldn\u2019t be drinking himself drunk every night if he weren\u2019t in such terrible pain. Anyway, Robinson turned the account over to a collection agency, and that didn\u2019t sit well with Everett. He got all juiced up and called the doctor and threatened him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other man?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cThe name he gave Robinson was \u2018John Thompson,\u2019 but I doubt that\u2019s his real name. He only saw the doctor once, and that was just a day or two before Robinson closed shop and sent his files to Mike. Thompson\u2019s a druggie from New Orleans. He drove all the way to Bowen in hopes that the physicians here would be more lax, I suppose. Anyway, he told Robinson he had this terrible back pain and needed some prescriptions for pain medication. He wanted the heavy stuff and knew just what to ask for. When Robinson refused, he told me the junkie became enraged and threatened him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he report Thompson to the police?\u201d</p><p>Noah took a swig of beer before answering. \u201cHe should have, but he didn\u2019t because he was leaving Bowen, and he didn\u2019t want the hassle. That\u2019s what he told me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet Thompson tried other physicians in St. Claire,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured too,\u201d Noah said. \u201cSo I checked it out.\u201d He grinned then as he made the comment, \u201cI really love getting doctors out of bed early in the morning. Anyway, if Thompson did go to other doctors, he used a different name. No one remembers treating him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, a dead end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for both of you to close this file,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cAnd stop worrying. I\u2019m going to clean up my clinic, put stronger locks on the doors and windows, and move on. I suggest you do the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Since neither Theo nor Noah argued with her, she assumed they were too stubborn to admit she was right.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna rain.\u201d Theo made the prediction and then took a bite of gumbo.</p><p>\u201cThe sun\u2019s out,\u201d Noah remarked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but my knee aches, so it\u2019s gonna rain. My shoulder\u2019s throbbing too.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cYou two are perfect for each other. A hypochondriac hooking up with a doctor. That\u2019s a match made in heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a doctor,\u201d Theo said dryly.</p><p>Noah ignored the smart-ass comment. \u201cMike, have you ever been to Boston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>She thought about what he was saying for a couple of seconds, then responded, \u201cI\u2019m sure, if I ever get there for a medical conference or a vacation, I\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced back and forth between Theo and Michelle. She\u2019d sounded defensive, but he could see the sadness in her eyes. She was giving up before she\u2019d even gotten started, he decided. Theo\u2019s response was just as interesting. His whole body had tensed.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s two ships passing in the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cLeave it alone, Noah.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then switched topics. \u201cSo tell me, do we still fish Saturday if it rains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFishing\u2019s better in the rain,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I ever going to meet your brother?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. You\u2019re leaving Monday, remember?\u201d</p><p>It was like a sore tooth she kept rubbing. He hadn\u2019t pulled the rug out from under her. She\u2019d known he was going to leave. So why was she feeling so devastated?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll meet her brother at The Swan Friday,\u201d Noah said. \u201cJake told me John Paul works as a bartender and a bouncer on weekends.\u201d</p><p>Michelle shook her head. \u201cDaddy knows John Paul won\u2019t show up this weekend. By now, my brother knows who you both work for, so he\u2019ll stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother wouldn\u2019t happen to be a wanted man, would he?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he got against the FBI?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him that question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich kind of hinges on the fact that I\u2019ll have to meet him so I can ask him the question,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>\u201cMy brother is a very private person,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cIf and when he decides he\u2019d like to meet you, then he\u2019ll find you.\u201d She smiled as she added, \u201cYou won\u2019t see him coming. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p><p>She got up from the table, tossed her empty can in the trash, and then began to gather up the dirty dishes. Theo got up to help. He was filling the sink when the doorbell rang. Noah went to answer it.</p><p>Michelle put the bowls in the sink, then turned back to the table. Theo caught her around the waist and leaned down to nuzzle her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u2019\u2019</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sophisticated enough to play games or come up with a clever lie, and so she simply told him the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re complicating my life.\u201d</p><p>He turned her around to face him. She backed away, but he followed her and pinned her against the sink. \u201cYou don\u2019t regret \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt was wonderful.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite look him in the eyes and focused on his chin instead so she could concentrate on what she wanted to say to him. \u201cWe\u2019re both normal adults with healthy urges, and of course it\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealthy and normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease me. These urges . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember the urges,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe just can\u2019t keep on giving in to these . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrges?\u201d he offered when she suddenly stopped.</p><p>She found herself smiling in spite of her frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re making fun of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>She pushed him back. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you break my heart, Theo. Play your games with the big-city girls back home.\u201d</p><p>He laughed right in her face. \u201cBig-city girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be serious. I\u2019m trying to tell you that we don\u2019t have a future together, so you should just leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>He cupped the sides of her face and kissed her passionately, and when he lifted his head, he saw the tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to cry on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The answer was emphatic.</p><p>\u201cGood, \u2019cause I could have sworn I saw tears just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea you could be so mean. I\u2019m trying to tell you to stop . . .\u201d</p><p>He slowly shook his head.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cNo? Why not?\u201d</p><p>His mouth brushed over hers again in a quick, no-nonsense kiss. \u201cYou\u2019re a smart girl. You figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Noah interrupted when he strolled back into the kitchen. He had a large FedEx box tucked under his arm and was carrying a huge metal pan covered with foil.</p><p>\u201cTheo, grab the box, will you? I found it propped against the door when I opened it. There was this lady standing there with this Cajun fried chicken. She handed it to me and took off before I could thank her. She was a nervous little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMolly Beaumont,\u201d he answered. He set the pan on the table and began to unwrap the foil. \u201cSmells good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there a card for Theo with the chicken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she said you made the chicken, but the pan\u2019s hers and she wants it back.\u201d</p><p>Theo was sitting at the table opening the box. Noah picked up a chicken leg and took a huge bite. Then he nudged Theo. \u201cYou know what else Molly said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked me to tell Coach Buchanan, \u2018Hey.\u2019 Did you hear that, Theo? She called you Coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Everyone in Bowen calls me Coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so now I\u2019ve got to wonder why,\u201d he said.</p><p>Theo wasn\u2019t paying any attention to him. He finally got the box open and let out a low whistle. \u201cNick came through,\u201d he said. \u201cPlaybooks.\u201d He picked one up and thumbed through it.</p><p>\u201cFootball playbooks?\u201d Noah asked with his mouth full.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll explain later. Michelle, you can ride to the clinic with Noah. He\u2019s spending the day with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to waste his time \u2014\u201d</p><p>Theo cut her off. \u201cHe\u2019s going with you.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cWhile you and your friends are organizing the files, I\u2019ll start the cleanup in your office. If there\u2019s time, I\u2019ll paint the walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy for your help, but \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI appreciate it, Noah.\u201d</p><p>Then she turned to Theo and asked him what he was going to be doing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a meeting with the Carsons and their attorney at one,\u201d Theo said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to finish it by two-thirty because I promised Conrad I\u2019d show up for practice at three. If you and Noah need a break, drop by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe principal offered Theo a contract,\u201d Michelle said, smiling now. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t signed it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making that up,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cI think Theo\u2019s holding out for more money.\u201d</p><p>Noah was convinced the two of them were pulling his leg and was waiting to hear the punch line. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stop by. What time is practice over? I\u2019ve promised I\u2019d help tend bar tonight. I should be there by five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to hook up with Mary Ann tonight,\u201d Theo reminded.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re hooking up with Mary Ann?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cShe asked me if I wanted to get together later after her friend\u2019s husband picked her up, and I suggested that she stop by The Swan, and if I\u2019m not busy \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked you to go out?\u201d she asked, clearly surprised.</p><p>\u201cYes, she did. Why is that so difficult to understand? I\u2019m a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t difficult to understand. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s . . . and you\u2019re . . . that is, you\u2019re very . . . \u201d</p><p>Noah was enjoying her discomfort. \u201cI\u2019m very what?\u201d</p><p>The word \u201cexperienced\u201d came to mind along with about a dozen others. Noah was the kind of man who had women like Mary Ann for breakfast. Michelle realized she was being judgmental and that she could be wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re . . .\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d Noah prodded.</p><p>\u201cYour friend has the hots for Noah,\u201d Theo explained.</p><p>Noah nodded. \u201cYeah, she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d she said, clearly exasperated. \u201cJust because Mary Ann was being friendly, you immediately jump to the conclusion that she had the hots for Noah?\u201d</p><p>Theo smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t jump to any conclusions. Honest. Mary Ann said, and I\u2019m quoting here, \u2018Hey, Theo, I\u2019ve got the hots for Noah. So is he married or what?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded again. \u201cThat\u2019s about how it happened.\u201d</p><p>The sad thing was that Michelle thought Theo might be telling the truth. Mary Ann did have the annoying habit of blurting out her every thought. Michelle started laughing even as she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the clinic,\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cJust a second, Michelle,\u201d Noah said as he flipped through the playbook. \u201cTheo, look at page fifty-three. Do you remember \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheodore, take that book away from your friend and get him moving now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Calling him Theodore did the trick.

Vegetables,\u201d he said as he walked through the dining room to get to the front door.</p> <p>\u201cDid you say vegetables?\u201d Noah asked, certain he hadn\u2019t heard correctly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You should see her cut vegetables with a paring knife. It\u2019s incredible. You could put it to music.\u201d Noah followed Theo outside. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s so . . . precise.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cMan, oh man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got it bad.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>Noah and Michelle didn\u2019t make it to football practice. There was simply too much work to get done at the clinic. Her friends amazed her. They got the files back in order and stacked them alphabetically in boxes, so that as soon as the new file cabinets arrived, all she had to do was drop them in the drawers. Theo drove over to the clinic to pick up Michelle, while Noah went back to his motel to shower and change before heading to The Swan to help Jake.</p><p>Michelle felt guilty that neither Theo nor Noah had gotten to fish. When she made that remark to Theo, he told her not to worry. Saturday he would be in a boat from sunup to sundown, and, anyway, the anticipation was almost as much fun as the actual event. He rattled off all the items he thought they should pack in the cooler. Like the Boy Scouts, he wanted to be prepared, and God forbid he should run out of sandwiches and beer.</p><p>He had parked the car in her driveway, and they were just getting out when Elena Miller pulled up in her little hatchback, tooting her horn to get their attention.</p><p>\u201cDr. Mike,\u201d she called as she ran around to the passenger side, \u201cwould you ask your young man to carry this box in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d Michelle asked.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you get my message? I called you from the hospital and left it on your machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you can see, I just got home, Elena,\u201d Michelle answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had it with you doctors cluttering up my ER. This box is full of mail that was scattered all over the counters,\u201d she said, motioning with both hands to the backseat of her car. \u201cI started with you, and next Monday I\u2019m taking on Dr. Landusky\u2019s junk.\u201d</p><p>Michelle introduced Theo to the exasperated woman and explained that the staff secretary was trying to organize the ER.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you have your journals sent to your clinic, Doctor? It really would help if you would just take your mail home every night. Is that too much to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Michelle said, feeling as though she were in school again. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just leave all this stuff in the doctors\u2019 lounge?\u201d she asked when Theo picked up the box and she saw all the magazines.</p><p>Elena shut the door behind Theo and then got in behind the wheel. \u201cBecause I just finished cleaning out that mess,\u201d she said. \u201cYou doctors . . .\u201d</p><p>She was backing the car out of the drive and didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to do better,\u201d Michelle called.</p><p>Placated, the woman waved as she sped down the road. Theo followed Michelle inside. \u201cElena reminds me of someone,\u201d he remarked as he carried the box into the library and put it on the desk. She nudged him out of the way so she could look through it. There were several journals, parcels from two pharmaceutical companies, and a pile of junk mail.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she asked as she dropped the envelopes back into the box. There wasn\u2019t anything that required her immediate attention.</p><p>\u201cGene Wilder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just got a bad perm,\u201d Michelle said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your cooler?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the garage. It needs to be washed, though,\u201d she said as she headed for the steps.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead and take your shower first while I hose it off. Then I\u2019ll clean up. And don\u2019t use all the hot water,\u201d he called after her.</p><p>He\u2019d been a guest in her house for a couple of days, and he was already trying to tell her what to do. She shook her head as she laughed. Nice, she thought. Having him here was very, very nice.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>The deep resonant boom of thunder awakened Theo. It sounded like a firecracker had gone off inside the bedroom. The bed actually shook. It was pitch black outside, but when he turned his head, he could see lightning streaking across the sky.</p><p>A hell of a storm was raging. He tried to go back to sleep, but it was too hot. The air conditioner was humming, but because the window was open a crack, the cold air was being sucked out into the storm.</p><p>Michelle was sound asleep, cuddled up against his side, one hand flat on his stomach. He gently eased her onto her back, kissed her forehead, and smiled when she tried to roll over on top of him. He was suddenly thinking about waking her up and making love to her again, but then he glanced at the glowing green numbers on the clock radio and changed his mind. It was three o\u2019clock. Waking her was out of the question. She needed her sleep, and so did he. They\u2019d gone to bed at ten, but they hadn\u2019t gone to sleep until midnight.</p><p>If he wanted to spend Saturday fishing, he would have to get everything else done tomorrow. He had another meeting with the Carsons and their attorneys to hammer out the details, and when he was finished, he was going to help at the clinic.</p><p>Michelle didn\u2019t want to waste the entire day Saturday fishing until Theo told her about a little side bet he\u2019d made with Noah. Whoever caught the most fish had to pay the loser a thousand dollars.</p><p>She had been appalled by the amount of the wager \u2014 how could anyone bet that kind of money when it could be put to much better use \u2014 but as soon as Theo told her he couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t call the wager off, she got with the program and became determined that he win. Boasting that she had a secret strategy, she explained that her father would take Noah to his favorite fishing spot deep in the swamp, just around the bend from John Paul\u2019s cabin. But on the other side of the bayou was an even better spot where the fish were so plentiful and friendly they would all but jump into the boat.</p><p>When he\u2019d asked her how come she\u2019d never told her father about her special fishing spot, she explained that she didn\u2019t want him going there alone because it was so isolated, and there were predators in the area. He\u2019d translated the remark to mean that there were alligators in the area. She didn\u2019t deny or confirm his suspicion but took his mind off his worry by kissing him as she slowly removed his clothes. Taking his hand in hers, she\u2019d led him to her bed. The diversion had worked like a charm.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d grab that modified shotgun at The Swan and take it along. Then he remembered he was hot and wanted to close the window. He sat up, yawning loudly, and swung his legs over the side. His feet got tangled up in the sheet when he stood. He stumbled, slammed his bad knee into the bedside table, the round brass knob striking that oh-so-tender spot just below his kneecap where he was sure every nerve in his body converged, sending excruciating pain rocketing down his leg. It burned like acid. Muttering an expletive, he sat down hard on the bed and rubbed his knee.</p><p>\u201cTheo, are you all right?\u201d Her voice was a sleepy whisper.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay. I hit my knee on the table. You left the window open.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the sheet back. \u201cI\u2019ll close it.\u201d</p><p>He gently pushed her down. \u201cGo back to sleep. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue. While he sat there rubbing the sting out of his knee, he listened to her deep, even breathing. How could anyone fall asleep that quickly? Then he thought that maybe she was exhausted because he\u2019d worn her out making love, and he felt a little better. With a wry smile, he admitted to himself how arrogant that thought was.</p><p>He got up and limped to the window. He was pushing it down when lightning lit up the night, and he saw a man darting across the road into Michelle\u2019s front yard.</p><p>What the hell? Had he just seen what he thought he\u2019d seen, or had he imagined it? Thunder rumbled, then another bolt of lightning flashed and he saw the man again, crouching down by the sycamore tree.</p><p>He also saw the gun. Theo was already moving back when the shot rang out. The bullet pierced the glass, shattering it as Theo turned and dove for cover. Pain cut through his upper arm, and he thought he might have been shot. He hit the bed, grabbed Michelle as she bolted upright, and rolled with her in his arms to the floor, trying his damnedest to protect her head from striking wood. Pain shot through his arm again as he rolled off her and sprang to his feet, knocking the bedside lamp to the floor in his haste.</p><p>\u201cTheo, what \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay down,\u201d he ordered. \u201cAnd don\u2019t turn the lights on.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to comprehend what was happening. \u201cDid lightning strike the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a gunshot. Someone just took a shot at me through the window.\u201d</p><p>He was up and running. If he had let Michelle go to the window, she could have been killed. It was just a piece of luck that he happened to be looking down when the sky lit up.</p><p>Sprinting toward the guest room, he shouted, \u201cCall the police and get dressed. We\u2019ve got to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Michelle had already grabbed the phone and pulled it down next to her. She dialed 911, then put the receiver to her ear and realized the phone was dead. She didn\u2019t panic. She dropped the phone, reached for her clothes on the bureau, and ran into the hall.</p><p>\u201cThe phone\u2019s dead,\u201d she yelled. \u201cTheo, what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet dressed,\u201d he repeated. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>He had his gun and was pressed against the wall next to the window. He sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to give the bastard an easy target this time. Edging the drapes back with the barrel of the gun, he squinted into the darkness. Another shot rang out just as the sky opened and the rain began. He saw a burst of red as the bullet left the chamber. He pulled back. He stood there, straining to hear every little sound, praying that lightning would strike again and he could see if there were any others lurking out there.</p><p>Was there just one man? God, he hoped so. If he could get one clear shot, maybe he could nail the bastard. He\u2019d never killed anyone, never even fired the gun except in target practice, but he wasn\u2019t feeling at all shy about taking this man out.</p><p>Five seconds passed, then five more. Lightning split the sky open then, and for a heartbeat, it was as bright and clear as day.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Theo muttered when he saw another figure darting across the road.</p><p>Michelle was in the bathroom dressing by the soft glow of the night-light in the hall. She was shoving her feet into her tennis shoes when the nightlight went out. The bulb was too new to have burned out. Racing back into her bedroom, she saw that the clock radio dial was also dark. Either lightning had struck a power line, or someone had cut the power feeding her house. She opted for the second bleak possibility.</p><p>It was so dark without the nightlight, she couldn\u2019t see anything. The linen closet was right outside the guest room. She felt around for the handle, got the door open, and reached up on the top shelf for her flashlight. She knocked over a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a box of Band-Aids. The bottle landed hard on her instep. She kicked it into the closet to get it out of her way, found the flashlight, and then shut the door so she wouldn\u2019t bump into it.</p><p>There were Band-Aids scattered all over the floor. She slipped on one as she ran into the guest room. \u201cThe phone line\u2019s dead and the electricity\u2019s out. Theo, what is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are two men out in front. One\u2019s crouched down low by the tree and isn\u2019t moving. Grab my cell phone and hand it to me. We\u2019ve got to get some help.\u201d</p><p>She was afraid to turn the flashlight on because the drapes were open, and whoever was outside would see the light, so she felt around on the dresser, her frustration mounting with each second.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d she asked. Then she heard the sound of a motor humming in the distance. She ran to the window facing the water and saw the light from the boat coming closer and closer to the dock. She couldn\u2019t tell how many were in the boat, couldn\u2019t see anything but that shimmering beacon that seemed to pulsate with a life of its own as it grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>Theo already had his jeans and shoes on and was pulling a dark T-shirt over his head and trying to keep watch at the window at the same time. Pain shot through his arm when he shoved his hand through the short sleeve, and his skin felt wet and sticky with blood. He touched the injury, felt the jagged piece of glass, and was relieved it wasn\u2019t a bullet hole. Wiping his hand on his jeans, he tugged the T-shirt down, then reached up again and plucked the shard of glass out. It burned as if a hot iron were stuck to his skin.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a boat coming toward the dock,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re with the two in front, aren\u2019t they?\u201d She felt foolish asking the question. Of course there were more of them. Who among her friends would come visiting in the middle of the night during a torrential storm? \u201cWhat do they want?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll ask them later,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s my phone?\u201d he demanded as he fastened the holster to his jeans, then shoved his gun into the leather pouch and closed the snap. He\u2019d already figured out their escape route. They\u2019d have to go out the back window, drop down onto the porch roof, and hit the ground running. With any luck, they could get to his car.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not on the dresser,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAh, hell,\u201d he muttered, for he\u2019d suddenly remembered where he\u2019d put it. It was sitting in the charger next to Michelle\u2019s on the desk downstairs. \u201cI plugged it in by your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cThe steps face the back door, and if one of them is waiting there, he\u2019ll see you. Stay by the window and try to see how many get out of the boat. Has it docked yet?\u201d</p><p>Theo kicked the door shut, then shoved the heavy dresser in front of it in hopes of slowing the men down.</p><p>\u201cOne man just got out of the boat, and he\u2019s using a flashlight. He\u2019s headed for the backyard . . . no, he\u2019s going around to the front. I can\u2019t tell if there\u2019s another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen the window,\u201d he said as he picked up his car keys and shoved them into his back pocket. \u201cWe\u2019re going out that way. Let me go out first so I can catch you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He climbed out the window, swung down, and tried to be as quiet as possible as he dropped to the porch roof. The shingles were slick from the rain, and he almost lost his footing on the sharp pitch as he landed. Bracing his legs apart, he put his arms up and waited for Michelle to jump, all the while praying that lightning wouldn\u2019t strike and give them away. If there were others in the yard or in the boat, they would see them and sound the alert.</p><p>He reached for Michelle just as he heard glass breaking downstairs. It sounded as if it was coming from the back door. The noise was immediately followed by an earsplitting sound of gunfire coming from the front of the house. The bastards were organized. They were simultaneously rushing both entrances. They wanted to trap Theo and Michelle inside.</p><p>Michelle could hear them knocking things over downstairs. How many were there? She tucked the flashlight into the waistband of her jeans and climbed out on the ledge.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d His voice was a low, urgent whisper.</p> <p>She hesitated for a second or two, trying to focus, but then she heard the pounding of heavy footsteps on the stairs. She let go.</p><p>Theo caught her around the waist. She slipped, but he held fast until she recovered her balance. Staying close to him, she scrambled on all fours across the roof. The rain was coming down in sheets now. She could barely see her hands. She reached the edge, tested the gutter, hoping she could hang on as she swung her legs over, but the gutter was loose, and she knew it would make a racket if it fell. There were overgrown lilac bushes all along the side of her house. She put her hand over her eyes as she jumped into the center of the thicket.</p><p>Scurrying to get out of Theo\u2019s way, she ran headfirst into a thick branch. It cut her cheek, and she bit her lip to keep from crying out.</p><p>\u201cWhich way?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe front. Wait here.\u201d He pulled his gun out. He edged his way to the corner of the house, ducked down, and then leaned out. The hood of his car was up, which meant they\u2019d disabled it. He looked across the road, judging the distance to the swamp. He didn\u2019t relish getting trapped and hunted in the maze of dense vegetation, but if they could run across without being seen, then he and Michelle could make their way to the crossroads.</p> <p>A car was parked further up the road. He wouldn\u2019t have seen it if the brake lights hadn\u2019t suddenly gone on. Whoever was waiting inside had his foot on the brakes. A second later the lights went off.</p><p>Theo went back to Michelle. \u201cWe have to try to get to your boat. It\u2019s the only way out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They made it to the edge of the dock before they were spotted. Caught in the glare of a light shining down from the bedroom window, Theo pushed Michelle down as he turned and fired. He didn\u2019t know if he hit anything or not. The light went out, and he heard shouting.</p><p>\u201cGive me your flashlight,\u201d he panted.</p><p>She pulled it out of her waistband. He grabbed it, held his arm out so that it wouldn\u2019t be in front of them. Pushing her down again, he tried to cover her as he whispered, \u201cStay still,\u201d and then flipped the light on.</p> <p>The beam struck one of the bastards running toward them from the house. Michelle saw him clearly and gasped in surprise. Recognition was swift and shocking.</p><p>Theo fired twice before he was forced to turn the light off. Bullets were flying all around them, pinning them down. Theo aimed the flashlight at the other boat, turned it on, and there he was, another man, waiting for them. Squatting down low, he was looking through the scope of a high-powered rifle when Theo fired. The bullet struck the motor. He fired again as the man lunged over the side of the boat into the water.</p><p>Flipping the light off, Theo jerked her to her feet, and shouted, \u201cGo,\u201d as gunshots sizzled and cracked in the air around them, ricocheting off the tree and the dock. Michelle slid across the dock, grabbed hold of the post to keep from falling into the water, and then frantically worked to untie their assailants\u2019 boat. Theo had already untied hers, jumped in, and was pulling on the engine cord.</p><p>She finally got the rope undone, and she pushed the boat as far away from the dock as possible. Theo was shouting at her to hurry. She jumped into her boat and fell back against Theo as he gunned the engine. A hail of bullets slapped the water around them.</p><p>Theo hunched over Michelle, trying to protect her and keep his head down at the same time. Turning the boat to the north, he shoved the lever down. The front end of the boat came out of the water, bounced back, then lurched forward. One bullet sizzled so close to his ear, he thought he felt the heat.</p><p>Looking back, he saw two men with flashlights running along the yard. Then one dove into the water. Theo figured he and Michelle had maybe a thirty-second lead to get away. He sat back on the bench and let her get up.</p><p>As soon as she lifted her head, she realized they were headed away from civilization. \u201cYou have to turn around,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to turn back. They\u2019re going to come after us. Shine the light ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Michelle sat between his knees and directed the beam straight ahead. The light saved them from disaster. Another five seconds and they would have crashed into a dead tree stump sticking out of the water. Theo veered sharply to the left, then straightened the boat into a true course.</p><p>\u201cThank God, you grabbed your flashlight,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a sharp bend straight ahead,\u201d she told him. \u201cSlow down and turn right. Left is another dead end.\u201d</p><p>Clasping his knee to balance herself, she turned and lifted up to look behind them. \u201cI don\u2019t see any lights yet,\u201d she said with a wave of relief so intense it was almost painful. \u201cMaybe they won\u2019t follow us. Maybe they\u2019ll leave us alone now that we\u2019ve gotten away.\u201d</p><p>When she turned around, he pulled her back against him. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to give up. I think they\u2019ve just gotten started. Did you see the scope on that rifle? They\u2019re armed to the hilt. They came to hunt, and they aren\u2019t going to give up without a fight. We\u2019ve got to get to a phone and get help. Show me the quickest way to get back to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bayou is like a big figure eight,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you had headed south from my dock, you would have gone around a wide bend and would have seen The Swan. We have to backtrack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll run into them if we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered hoarsely. She hadn\u2019t been screaming, but her throat felt raw. \u201cThere are at least twenty inlets that loop in and around. Some of them are dead ends,\u201d she warned. \u201cAnd some circle back. If they know about them, they could get ahead of us and cut us off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll slow down, and if we see their lights, we\u2019ll take one of the channels and hide until daylight.\u201d They were approaching another bend. \u201cWhich way?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Everything looks different at night. I think this one circles back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll go left,\u201d he said and steered the boat in that direction.</p><p>\u201cTheo, I could be wrong.\u201d</p><p>Michelle heard the sound of a boat motor roaring in the distance. The sound was getting closer even as they sped around another tree trunk.</p><p>Theo also heard the noise. He spotted a narrow channel, slowed the engine, and turned the boat once again. There were mossy branches hanging down almost into the water. He pushed them out of the way as they passed. Once they had made another turn and he saw how narrow the channel became, he turned off the engine.</p><p>Michelle switched the flashlight off. They huddled together and turned toward the sound. It was as black as the inside of a coffin. The downpour had subsided, and a soft drizzle was falling.</p><p>The swamp pulsated with life. Theo heard something splash into the water behind them. The bullfrogs suddenly stopped croaking, and the crickets fell silent. Something was moving, though. What the hell was it? The boat struck something then. He thought it might be another tree trunk, but he couldn\u2019t be sure. The boat bobbed back, then stopped.</p><p>Michelle reached behind him, pushed a lever, and told him in a whisper to help her swing the motor up out of the water. \u201cIf we have to keep going in this channel, the blade could get caught in the mud. It gets shallow in some of these.\u201d The boat tapped the obstacle once again. \u201cThere they are,\u201d Michelle whispered.</p><p>They could see the light from the motorboat scanning the thicket like a lighthouse beacon, swinging back and forth in a wide arc, searching for them.</p><p>The light didn\u2019t find them. Michelle took a deep breath and slowly exhaled. They had just gotten over another hurdle, and she took a minute to thank God for that blessing. They weren\u2019t out of danger yet, but Theo had been right when he\u2019d told her they could hide out until daylight and then get help. Soon there would be an end to this nightmare.</p><p>The hunters had gone on. The noise from their boat fading now. Michelle guessed that they would continue on for several more minutes before they\u2019d turn around and backtrack, searching more thoroughly.</p><p>Theo\u2019s mind was racing. Were they professional hitters? If so, who had sent them? Could the mob have tracked him to Louisiana? Were they here to retaliate for his part in convicting so many of their leaders? Had his being here put her in danger?</p><p>Michelle heard a twig snap above her. She glanced up at the branches a scant second before she felt a weight drop on her left foot. It took every ounce of willpower she possessed not to scream. Whatever had fallen was now slithering up her leg. She froze, her hand gripping the flashlight in her lap, her finger on the switch.</p><p>\u201cTheo, grab the oar,\u201d she whispered, trying not to move a muscle. \u201cWhen I turn the light on, you\u2019ve got to knock it out of the boat. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand. What it? What was she talking about? He didn\u2019t question her, though. He simply picked up the oar, held it like a baseball bat, and waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>She flipped the switch on. Theo felt his heart lurch in his chest. He almost dropped the oar when he saw the hideous black snake. The monster\u2019s forked tongue was darting in and out, as though he were anticipating the morsel he was going to bite, his triangular flat head poised above Michelle\u2019s kneecap. He seemed to be looking into her eyes.</p><p>Time suspended as Theo swung the oar at the snake and hurled it into the water. He jumped to his feet and grabbed Michelle. \u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he roared. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Michelle scrambled to her knees, her heart racing. She kept her flashlight beam trained on the snake, watching as it skimmed across the water into the bushes on the other side of the muddy bank. Then she scanned the water, reached out, and grabbed the oar that Theo had thrown out. Dropping it on the floor of the boat, she leaned back. \u201cThat was a close call.\u201d</p><p>Theo was slapping at her legs. \u201cDid he get you?\u201d he asked frantically.</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. He was probably more afraid than we were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cottonmouth,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cSon of a . . . they\u2019re poisonous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed. She grabbed his hand. \u201cStop hitting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure there weren\u2019t any others . . . \u201d He stopped when he realized how crazy he sounded.</p><p>\u201cAny other snakes crawling up my pant leg? There aren\u2019t any. Trust me, I\u2019d know. Try to calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so friggin\u2019 calm? That thing was on your leg.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his cheek. \u201cBut you got rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a breath.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t as calm as she sounded. When he put his arms around her, he could feel her trembling. \u201cYou know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. You hate snakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know I was going to say that?\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she pulled away from him. \u201cI just had a feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand into the water to see if he could push the boat away from the bank. His fingers felt as if they were being sucked into the mud.</p><p>Michelle grabbed his arm and pulled him back. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to put your hand in the water, not around here.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to ask why. He pictured an alligator leaping up at him and shuddered over the thought. Grabbing the oar, he used it to push away. \u201cDo you think this way cuts through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived here all my life and I know these waters, but in the dark, I\u2019m still second-guessing myself. I think this one dead ends about a quarter of a mile from here. If we keep going, we could get trapped, and I don\u2019t want to walk through the swamp. It isn\u2019t safe, not at night, anyway. I think we should turn around and go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s got my vote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we cross back over, let\u2019s use the oars and row across. If they\u2019re out there, they won\u2019t hear us.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the other oar and helped him get the boat turned.</p><p>\u201cIf another damned snake lands in this boat, they\u2019ll hear me, all right.\u201d</p><p>Theo changed places with Michelle and used the oars to get them to the opening of the channel. He stopped, then turned to look. \u201cWhat do you think? Can we make it back to your place? If I could get to my cell phone \u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him. \u201cWe went too far downstream. We\u2019d have to backtrack and that\u2019s pushing our luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll head straight across and hope there\u2019s a dock close.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see more than ten feet ahead of him but knew it was too risky to turn the flashlight on now. Michelle climbed over the bench so she could get to the motor. She put her hand on the cord, ready to yank it if they were spotted. She was worrying about everything now. When was the last time she filled the motor with gas? She couldn\u2019t remember. What if they reached the middle and then the spotlight found them?</p><p>They were gliding across the water now. Theo\u2019s powerful arms worked the oars like an expert.</p><p>She could see the light scanning the water. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for us in the channels,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Theo kept rowing but glanced behind him. The beam of light was crisscrossing the water, but the boat wasn\u2019t moving. It was about two hundred yards away.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t seen us yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I turn the motor \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice was urgent. \u201cHang in there. We might make it.\u201d</p><p>A minute later, the beam turned back in their direction. Michelle didn\u2019t wait for Theo to tell her to start the motor. She pulled hard. It didn\u2019t catch the first time. Theo swung the oars in and shoved Michelle down as a bullet whizzed past his head. She yanked on the rope and cried out when the engine sputtered to life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Theo pulled his gun from the holster, shouted for Michelle to keep her head down, just as another bullet struck the water next to them. He propped his elbow on the bench and fired his weapon.</p><p>The bastards were coming fast now. Theo was trying to shoot out the spotlight. The first shot missed, but he heard someone shout, and he hoped that meant he\u2019d hit one of them. He squeezed the trigger again. He was on the mark this time. The bullet shattered the light, giving them maybe five, ten seconds max before one of the hitters turned his flashlight on them.</p><p>Michelle couldn\u2019t judge how close they were to the bank. She tried to reach the throttle to slow the boat down, but it was too late. The boat suddenly lurched up, out of the water, and slammed into thorny bushes. It didn\u2019t stop but bounced twice before striking a tree. The impact threw Theo into the front of the boat. He landed on his left side, slamming his knee into the aluminum. His upper arm, still throbbing from the cut from the window glass, hit the metal rim, tearing his skin and sending a jolt of pain down to his elbow.</p><p>Michelle\u2019s forehead struck the bench and she cried out as she threw her arms up to protect herself.</p> <p>Theo leapt out of the boat, holstered his gun, and pulled Michelle. Dazed from the impact, she shook her head, trying to clear it as she felt around the boat for the flashlight.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he shouted over the roar of the motor coming closer and closer.</p><p>He was lifting her when she found the flashlight. Jerking her arm free, she snatched it. Her heart was slamming against her sternum, and her head felt as though it had been split apart, the pain almost blinding as she stumbled forward.</p><p>Theo wrapped his arm around her, hauled her into his side, and, half carrying her, ran into the brush. He didn\u2019t have the faintest idea where they were headed. Completely disoriented, he ran headlong into spiny branches. He pushed through them with his right arm. He could still hear the motor roaring in the distance and was desperate to get Michelle as far away as possible before the men docked their boat.</p><p>They fought their way through the brush and the soggy undergrowth, stopping twice to listen for signs that they were being followed. Finally, breaking out of the thicket, they stumbled forward into the open.</p> <p>Michelle stopped to get her second wind. She wasn\u2019t sure where they were.</p><p>\u201cShould I risk it?\u201d she asked as she lifted the flashlight and put her thumb on the switch. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll see the light if I only have it on for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>She flipped the switch, then breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cI think I know where we are.\u201d Turning the light off, she whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s about a mile to The Swan.\u201d</p><p>They were standing on the edge of a dirt road which, to Theo, looked like a dozen others he\u2019d driven down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He clasped her hand and started running. If they could get around the bend up ahead before their pursuers reached the road, they\u2019d be in the clear. He kept glancing over his shoulder looking for lights. The only sound was their heavy breathing and the pounding of their feet against the road.</p><p>Michelle turned on the light again, just in the nick of time, because they would have run off the road where it curved. She tripped as she turned, but Theo caught her and kept her upright without slowing down. He looked behind him again, saw the small beam of light strike the road, and increased his speed.</p><p>He was positive they hadn\u2019t seen them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay now,\u201d she panted. \u201cI can run.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her, then took hold of her hand, and continued on. He could see a light twinkling like a star in the distance and headed in that direction.</p><p>The stitch in Michelle\u2019s side was burning now, and her head felt as if it were going to explode. They reached a crossroad, and Michelle doubled over, her hands clasping her knees.</p><p>\u201cThe Swan\u2019s down the road to the left,\u201d she panted. \u201cWe can call the police from there.\u201d</p> <p>The road was gravel and mud. He remembered driving down this lane. As he ran, he constantly scanned the brush on either side, figuring which way they would dive if he heard someone coming.</p><p>\u201cYou doing okay?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she answered.</p><p>She felt like crying out with relief when she saw the dark building ahead of them. The feeling of euphoria was short-lived, for a scant second later, she heard the sound of a car screeching around the curve behind them.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have time to react. One second she was glancing over her shoulder to look for headlights, and the next she was flying off the road into a gully with Theo. Michelle landed hard on her backside. Theo crouched beside her and pulled his gun out, his eyes scanning the road. They were concealed by bushes and scrub.</p><p>Michelle gingerly probed the bump on her forehead, grimacing. Her mind raced. Then she remembered what she wanted to tell Theo.</p><p>She whispered his name. He put his hand over her mouth. \u201cShhh,\u201d he whispered close to her ear.</p><p>The car pulled up next to them. She fought the urge to recoil as she heard a thrashing noise in the bushes next to them. She realized she was holding her breath when her chest began to ache. She slowly, quietly exhaled. Her hand gripped Theo\u2019s knee. More thrashing in the underbrush, then muttering as the man walked back to the car. Gravel crunched under his shoes.</p><p>The damp air was getting to her. Her eyes suddenly began to tear and she needed to sneeze. Please, God, not now. I can\u2019t make any noise . . . not yet. She clamped her fingers over her nose and breathed through her mouth. Tears were streaming down her cheeks, and she pulled her T-shirt up over her mouth.</p><p>Theo heard the car door slam, and then the car moved on. He wasn\u2019t going to take any chances, though. He strained to hear every little sound. How many were there? He knew for certain four men had tried to ambush them. He\u2019d seen two in the front of Michelle\u2019s house and then two who\u2019d driven the boat to the dock. Their goal had obviously been to trap them inside the house, and he swore that as soon as they were safe and out of this jungle warfare, he would get every one of them.</p><p>He finally shifted his position to take the weight off his knees. Putting his arm around Michelle, he bent down and whispered, \u201cThey\u2019re looking for us at The Swan, and we\u2019re going to sit tight until they\u2019re gone. You still doing okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded against him. As soon as he turned back to watch the road, she rested her cheek against his back and closed her eyes. Her heart was slowing down now. She wanted to take advantage of the temporary breather in case they had to start running again. Who were these men, and why were they after them?</p><p>She shifted her weight from one knee to the other. She felt as though she were sitting in compost. The smell of wet, rotten, decomposing leaves was thick and musty. She thought there had to be a dead animal somewhere close because she could smell the foul stench of rotting meat. She wanted to gag.</p><p>It had stopped raining. That was good, wasn\u2019t it? God, how long had they been waiting? It seemed as though an hour had passed since they\u2019d dived into the brush, but then time had pretty much stopped from the moment the first gunshot had been fired.</p><p>She heard the car before she saw the headlights through the branches. It came roaring down the road, passed them without slowing, and sped on.</p><p>Theo chanced it and leaned out to see which way the car was headed. It slowed at the crossroad, then went straight ahead, which meant the men hadn\u2019t given up yet and were searching another back road. He tried but couldn\u2019t see the license plate.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have to give up looking for us soon,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt will be light, and they won\u2019t want to risk being seen by early morning fishermen. Don\u2019t you think they\u2019ll give up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he allowed. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said then as he stood, bracing himself for the pain in his knee. He pulled her to her feet. \u201cStay close to the side of the road and don\u2019t turn the flashlight on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut if you hear them coming, don\u2019t throw me into a ditch again. Just tell me. My backside\u2019s going to be bruised.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound contrite when he said, \u201cBetter a bruise than a bullet.\u201d</p><p>She sneezed. It felt good. \u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCan you run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d she asked, noticing that he was favoring one leg.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m just a little stiff. Let\u2019s move.\u201d</p><p>There was a single light shining from a pole near the opening to the parking lot. Theo wasn\u2019t taking any chances. He pulled Michelle over into the brush and edged around The Swan to the back door. He couldn\u2019t see anything moving inside. The back door was metal, so Theo began to backtrack to one of the front windows, looking down at the ground now for a sturdy rock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to climb in through the window,\u201d he said as he picked up a jagged rock.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna break the glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI know where Daddy hides his spare key.\u201d Theo dropped the rock and walked over to the door. She turned the flashlight on and reached up over the door and picked up the key from the ledge.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a real clever hiding place,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sarcastic. No one would think of breaking in Daddy\u2019s bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul would go after them, and they all know it. Daddy could leave the doors unlocked if he wanted to.\u201d</p><p>It took her two tries to get the key in the lock because her hands were shaking. Aftermath, she thought. Her body was finally reacting to the terror she and Theo had lived through.</p><p>Theo went inside first, squinting into the darkness, then, keeping Michelle behind him, he told her in a whisper to lock the door. He heard the sound of the deadbolt slipping into place. The refrigerator began to hum and vibrate. The phone, he remembered, was in the main room at the end of the bar, just outside of the storage room. He thought he heard a sound, maybe a squeaky floorboard.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he whispered as he pulled his gun out and cautiously walked into the bar.</p><p>The light from the parking lot cast a gray shadow on the tables and the floor. It was still dark in the corners, though. Theo went behind the bar. His eyes had adjusted to the dim light, his gaze now fully directed on the half-opened door to the storage area. It was a perfect place for a man to hide. Would they have left a man behind? No, that didn\u2019t make any sense to Theo, but he still continued to watch the door as he crept along.</p><p>At the center of the bar, he stopped, and then reached underneath the counter to search for Jake\u2019s shotgun. He wouldn\u2019t miss his target with that sucker, he thought as his hand touched the butt of the shotgun. Lifting it off the bracket, he carefully pulled it out.</p><p>Theo was turning away from the counter when he felt the tiniest brush of air on the back of his neck. He knew without turning around or hearing a sound that someone was coming up behind him and coming fast.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p><p>Michelle, run,\u201d Theo shouted. He dropped the shotgun on the counter, then pivoted, his Glock cocked and ready.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see the man\u2019s face; it was too dark. The huge shadow karate-chopped Theo\u2019s wrist, but he held tight to the gun. Then the shadow grabbed Theo\u2019s arm and twisted it back with one hand as the other was coming up fast to nail him under the chin.</p><p>Theo ducked, but not fast enough. The shadow\u2019s knuckles grazed his chin, snapping his head back. Searing pain shot through his jaw. Theo put every ounce of power he had in his left fist and punched the attacker in the gut. He knew then he was in real trouble. His fist felt as though he\u2019d just struck a cement block, and he thought he might have broken his hand.</p><p>Where had the son of a bitch come from? Had he already gotten to Michelle? Enraged, Theo hit again. With the speed of a jackhammer, the man swung his foot up to kick Theo\u2019s knee.</p><p>Michelle turned on the fluorescent lights and shouted, \u201cJohn Paul! No! Let him go.\u201d</p><p>The two adversaries were now engaged in a bear hug, each trying to use his strength to break the other\u2019s back. When John Paul heard his sister\u2019s shout, he let go. Theo didn\u2019t. He tried to hit him again, hoping to smash his face, but John Paul easily blocked the punch with as much effort as it would take to swat a pesky mosquito away. In the process, his hand struck a bottle of whiskey, sending it careening into the other bottles lined up on the shelf against the wall behind the bar.</p><p>Both men took a step back at the same time, sizing each other up. Michelle got between them, glancing from one angry expression to the other, and then decided Theo was the one more out of control. She put her hand on his chest, told him to take a deep breath, and held him until he came to his senses and did as she asked.</p><p>Theo took a long hard look at the man. John Paul looked like a savage. Dressed in a pair of army green shorts, boots, and a T-shirt, he was muscular enough to be the Jolly Green Giant. Only there wasn\u2019t anything jolly about him. The bowie knife sheathed in the lining of his boot and the steely, pissed-off look in his eyes indicated he still wanted to break every bone in Theo\u2019s body. No, he definitely wasn\u2019t the Jolly Green Giant. Bad comparison, Theo thought as he continued to pant for breath from the exertion and the fear that maybe Michelle had been hurt. Her brother could star in a warlock movie. His hair was almost long enough, and he had the scars \u2014 one on his cheek and another one on his thigh \u2014 to make Theo think he was a throwback to times gone by.</p><p>\u201cTheo, I\u2019d like you to meet my brother, John Paul.\u201d Feeling it was safe now to let go of him, she turned to her brother. \u201cJohn Paul, this is \u2014\u201d</p><p>Her brother cut her off. \u201cI know who he is.\u201d</p><p>Theo blinked. \u201cYou know who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d John Paul said.</p><p>John Paul had never backed away from a fight in his life, and when Theo took a step toward him, he took an immediate step forward. Michelle was squeezed between them.</p><p>\u201cIf you knew who I was, why did you jump me?\u201d Theo growled.</p><p>\u201cYes, why did you?\u201d Michelle wanted to know, craning her neck back so she could look into her brother\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat was rude, John Paul.\u201d</p><p>His sister always knew just what to say to make him laugh. It took effort to maintain his angry expression. Rude. Hell, yes, he supposed it had been rude.</p><p>He folded his arms across his chest. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let him take the shotgun,\u201d he explained to Michelle. \u201cHe might be the kind to spook easy and shoot someone, or maybe even shoot himself in the foot.\u201d</p><p>Theo wasn\u2019t placated. He took another step forward. \u201cYou were trying to kick me in my bad knee, weren\u2019t you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>John Paul smiled. \u201cAlways go for the weakest point,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were favoring your leg, so I figured . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew I was a friend of your sister\u2019s, and you were still going to break my kneecap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to break it,\u201d he countered. \u201cI was just going to make you go down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have hurt him,\u201d Michelle said.</p> <p>\u201cMichelle, I don\u2019t need you to defend me,\u201d Theo muttered. His masculinity was taking a beating, and he had had all he was going to take of Mad Max.</p><p>\u201cIf I had wanted to hurt him, I would have. I could have killed him, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you could,\u201d Theo said, as he dropped the gun in the holster.</p><p>\u201cI could have snapped your neck, but I resisted the impulse.\u201d</p><p>It was then, as Michelle was turning to tell Theo to stop baiting her brother, that she noticed the blood on his arm. She turned the bar light on and stepped closer to Theo. In the light she could see a sliver of glass imbedded in the deep cut. \u201cWhen did this happen? You\u2019re going to need stitches.\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to explain. Whirling around, she went after her brother. She poked him in his chest and demanded, \u201cDid you do that? What were you thinking?\u201d</p> <p>Theo smiled. He could have put an end to her tirade by speaking up and telling her that her brother hadn\u2019t caused the injury, but he was getting a real kick out of watching John Paul squirm. Her brother was backing away from her as she read him the riot act. His expression, Theo thought with a good deal of smug satisfaction, was laughable. The guy looked as if he didn\u2019t know what to do. When she was finished blistering him with her guilt trip, her brother appeared to be a little contrite. Not much, but a little.</p><p>In the harsh light, Theo could see a bit of a resemblance between brother and sister. Both had high cheekbones and blue eyes of the identical color, but that was where the resemblance ended. Michelle was beautiful. She had a gentle, loving disposition. John Paul didn\u2019t.</p><p>Theo childishly wanted to keep on hating the man, but he knew he couldn\u2019t because he could see in John Paul\u2019s eyes that he loved Michelle, and Theo figured he was just like any other big brother, doing whatever it took to protect her.</p><p>His magnanimous gesture to give the guy a break was short-lived. John Paul glared at him and demanded, \u201cMy sister looks like she\u2019s been dragged through the mud. What the hell have you been up to?\u201d</p><p>Michelle turned his attention then. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tell Daddy you broke his best whiskey bottle,\u201d she told her brother. \u201cNow, clean it up while I call Ben.\u201d</p><p>She pushed Theo out of her way to get to the phone. She called the police station and asked the operator to put her through to Ben Nelson\u2019s home.</p> <p>Theo told John Paul to turn the light off. Surprisingly he did as he was told, then Theo explained what had happened. John Paul didn\u2019t show any reaction.</p><p>When Theo ended his account of the attack, John Paul asked, \u201cYou think they\u2019ll come back? Is that why you don\u2019t want the light on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably won\u2019t, but I\u2019m not taking any chances. We could get trapped in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we couldn\u2019t,\u201d John Paul argued. \u201cBesides, I\u2019d hear them coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? You\u2019d hear them even if they were creeping up on us?\u201d</p><p>John Paul nodded. \u201cYeah, I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re Superman?\u201d</p><p>Her brother grinned. \u201cPretty much. I\u2019d love it if they tried to come in. It would give me the opportunity to kill a couple of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more fun than a shoot-out,\u201d Theo said, his voice reeking with sarcasm, \u201cbut not with your sister here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>Theo was beginning to feel the effects of the fight. His jaw hurt and his arm was throbbing. He opened the cooler, took out two cold long-neck bottles of beer, and though he wanted to hit John Paul over the head with one of them, he figured that would be a waste of good beer and handed it to him instead.</p><p>John Paul didn\u2019t thank him, but then Theo didn\u2019t expect him to. He opened his and took a long drink.</p><p>Theo heard Michelle talking to Ben and interrupted. \u201cTell him to meet us at the house.\u201d</p><p>She asked Ben to hold on and told Theo they needed to get to the hospital.</p><p>He decided his arm was way down the list of priorities. \u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to your house first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re stubborn,\u201d she whispered, but she gave in.</p><p>Theo wanted to get off his feet so his knee would stop aching. He went over to one of the tables, sat down, then pulled another chair out and propped his foot up on it.</p><p>John Paul followed him, and stood beside him, towering over him.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>John Paul circled the table, pulled a chair out, and sat. He began to ask questions, wanting more details. Theo took another swig of his beer and then explained once again from beginning to end what had happened, only leaving out the part that he had been in Michelle\u2019s bed. He didn\u2019t think her brother would appreciate hearing that.</p><p>John Paul homed in on what Theo hadn\u2019t told him. \u201cWhy were you closing the window in Mike\u2019s room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo? Do you know what make the car was?\u201d Michelle called out.</p><p>\u201cA gray Toyota . . . new,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably long gone by now,\u201d John Paul remarked.</p><p>Theo agreed. He was watching Michelle now, and John Paul patiently waited for him to turn back around so he could tell him he was going to have to beat the hell out of him because he knew damn well that Theo had been in Michelle\u2019s bed. He didn\u2019t care that his sister could make her own choices, and he didn\u2019t care that it wasn\u2019t his business. She was his little sister, and Theo, John Paul decided, had taken advantage of her.</p><p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s a gifted surgeon,\u201d John Paul said with a snarl.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s spent most of her life getting her training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t had much training with men . . . doesn\u2019t know what pricks they can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s na\u00efve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s na\u00efve?\u201d Michelle asked as she hurried to the table.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d her brother said as he continued to glare at Theo. He was angry with Michelle too, he realized, for not only had she allowed herself to become vulnerable by getting involved with an outsider, but damned if she hadn\u2019t chosen a government man. That was almost unforgivable.</p><p>\u201cMike, you and I are going to have to have a talk.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the anger radiating in her brother\u2019s voice. \u201cBen\u2019s getting dressed and will meet us at the house in about ten minutes. He\u2019s also sending out a couple of police cars to try to find the Toyota. I told him I thought there were three or four men, maybe more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least four,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Daddy keeps the Tylenol?\u201d she asked her brother.</p><p>\u201cAbove the sink in the kitchen. You want me to get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. Theo, we should go directly to the hospital,\u201d she said as she walked away.</p><p>\u201cStitches can wait.\u201d</p><p>Michelle came back with a bottle of Tylenol and two glasses of water. Tucked under her arm were two bags of frozen vegetables. She set the Tylenol on the table with the glasses and held up the bags.</p><p>\u201cPeas or carrots?\u201d</p><p>Theo was unscrewing the childproof bottle of Tylenol. \u201cCarrots.\u201d She crunched the bag in her hands to break up the frozen chunks then put the bag on Theo\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She lifted the bag of peas to the top of her forehead. Theo immediately let go of the bottle and pulled Michelle onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt yourself? Here, let me see.\u201d</p><p>The concern in his voice made her feel a little weepy. She took a breath and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just a little bump. Honestly, it\u2019s no big \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he whispered as he gently pushed her hand away and tilted her head down so he could see the injury in the dim light.</p><p>The more John Paul observed, the more depressed he became. He knew from the tender way Theo was touching Mike that the man obviously cared about her, and it was too late to do anything about it. A Fed. How could she have fallen for a Fed?</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Michelle and Theo ignored him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t cut your scalp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a hell of a bump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>He was gently brushing her hair away from her face. John Paul\u2019s disgust was becoming unbearable.</p><p>\u201cMike, get off his lap and sit in a chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your brother likes me,\u201d Theo said with a smile. Because he knew John Paul was glaring at him, he kissed her forehead. \u201cWhen did you hit your head? Was it when the snake fell on you?\u201d</p><p>She slipped off his lap and sat in the chair next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat snake?\u201d John Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cA cottonmouth fell out of a tree,\u201d she explained to her brother. Theo opened the bottle of Tylenol. Michelle put her hand out, and he dropped two capsules into her palm as she said, \u201cTheo, we have to get to the hospital and find that package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? What package?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>Michelle decided she needed to start at the beginning. Propping her elbow on the table, she placed the bag of peas against her forehead and said, \u201cI recognized one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re just now telling me?\u201d He jerked upright, sending the bag of carrots flying. John Paul caught the bag in midair, then reached over and slammed it down on Theo\u2019s knee.</p><p>She cringed because the shout made her head hurt more. \u201cThe man who was running toward us while we were trying to get to my boat . . . he\u2019s the man I recognized. You turned the flashlight on his face, remember? He was the messenger from the Speedy Messenger Service. He came up to me while I was sitting in the bleachers at the stadium watching you work with the football team . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the guy at the stadium, but I didn\u2019t see his face. He was wearing that cap. You\u2019re talking about the guy I shot at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d John Paul wanted to know.</p><p>Theo\u2019s mind was racing. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered impatiently. \u201cI missed. Michelle, I still don\u2019t understand why you waited so long to tell me that you knew one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did I have time to tell you? While they were shooting at us and chasing us? Or when we were hiding in the swamp and you wouldn\u2019t let me talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely certain it was the same man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cYou know what\u2019s really odd? When I was talking to him at the stadium, I had this feeling I\u2019d seen him before, but then I thought I had probably run into him at the hospital. We\u2019re always getting deliveries there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you recognize any of the others? What about the guy in the boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see his face,\u201d she answered. \u201cHe jumped into the water when you shot at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you kill him?\u201d John Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I missed.\u201d</p><p>John Paul looked incredulous. \u201cWhy do you carry a gun if you don\u2019t know how to use it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know how to use it,\u201d he snapped defensively. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to demonstrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have winged him,\u201d Michelle said hopefully, then recognized the irony. She was supposed to be dedicated to saving lives, not destroying them. Getting shot at had certainly turned her moral code upside down.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d John Paul grunted with disgust. \u201cHow far away was this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were getting fired at from both directions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Theo was busy trying to shield me and shoot at the same time.\u201d</p><p>John Paul ignored her explanation. \u201cWhy do you carry a gun?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been ordered to carry one. I get a lot of death threats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d John Paul said.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop fighting with one another? We\u2019re in a mess here. Theo, I think I know what\u2019s going on now. The man, or men, who tore up my clinic were looking for a package. The guy who came up to me at the stadium said another employee of Speedy Messenger had delivered the wrong one to me, and he was trying to get it back. I called the staff secretary and told her to look for it and give it to him. I sent him to the hospital, but never followed up to see if he got the package,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember Elena dropped that box of mail off earlier? I think the men who came to my house last night thought it was there. But I went through the box, and there was no special delivery in it. My guess is that they didn\u2019t find it at the hospital yesterday and they thought she brought it to me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one way they could have known Elena was going to drop anything off,\u201d John Paul said.</p><p>\u201cThey tapped into her phone line,\u201d Theo said. \u201cDamn, why didn\u2019t I check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find it,\u201d John Paul offered.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what to look for?\u201d</p><p>Her brother looked offended. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Theo thought for a second and then said, \u201cWhen you find it, leave it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want them to know we\u2019re aware of it. We might want to give them some false information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me exactly what the guy said to you,\u201d John Paul said, and Theo noticed he wasn\u2019t quite as antagonistic now.</p><p>\u201cHe said there was a mix-up at the delivery service,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cFrank \u2014 that\u2019s the name he gave me \u2014 told me that another messenger named Eddie inadvertently switched labels on two packages he picked up. Whatever I got by mistake is obviously what they\u2019re after.\u201d</p><p>Theo shook his head. \u201cAnd you know it was a mix-up because . . .?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for the light to dawn. \u201cNothing is true until it\u2019s proven, and we aren\u2019t going to believe the package was misdirected until we open it and look inside.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBecause the man shooting at us could have been lying.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJeez, Mike. Use your head,\u201d John Paul said.</p><p>\u201cMy head aches, John Paul.\u201d Upset with herself because she\u2019d been so slow, she sighed. \u201cOf course he was lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Theo qualified.</p><p>\u201cYou just said . . .\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>Theo smiled. \u201cHe could have been telling the truth. It could be a misdirected package. When we find it, we\u2019ll see what it is. Until then . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said wearily.</p><p>\u201cYou remember telling me you had the feeling someone was following you? I think you were right. Whoever he is . . . he\u2019s good. I never spotted him, and I was looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they were watching the house,\u201d Michelle suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about all this?\u201d John Paul asked Theo.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWhen we find that package, we\u2019ll know what we\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going home with me, Mike. I can protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I can\u2019t?\u201d Theo asked, angry now.</p><p>\u201cWhen I shoot, I shoot to kill. I don\u2019t miss.\u201d</p><p>Theo was ready to punch him again, but Michelle put a stop to the hostility.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, gentlemen,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI can and will protect myself. John Paul, I\u2019m going to the hospital with Theo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMike \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay with me,\u201d Theo said, and was surprised when John Paul didn\u2019t argue. Rubbing his brow, Theo added, \u201cNoah\u2019s in New Orleans. I\u2019ll want him to stay there and do a couple of things before he drives back to Bowen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah is \u2014\u201d Michelle began, thinking to explain.</p><p>\u201cI know who he is. FBI.\u201d John Paul snapped the words out, his disdain apparent.</p><p>\u201cSo, in the meantime,\u201d Theo continued as though neither one of them had interrupted his train of thought, \u201cyou keep your dad close.\u201d</p><p>Michelle dropped the bag of peas on the table. \u201cYou think they\u2019ll go after Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just covering every possibility I can think of until I have time to figure out what the next move should be.\u201d</p> <p>Theo finished his beer and set the bottle on the table. \u201cWe should get going.\u201d</p><p>Michelle asked, \u201cJohn Paul, will you get the pickup started? Daddy hasn\u2019t driven it in over a week now. He told me something\u2019s wrong with the starter, and he hasn\u2019t had time to get it fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it started.\u201d</p><p>Exhaustion was finally catching up with Michelle. She slowly stood. \u201cThen let\u2019s get going.\u201d</p><p>Theo handed her the bag of carrots to put back in the freezer as he stood and tested his knee by slowly putting weight on it. The ice pack had helped. His knee didn\u2019t buckle, and it wasn\u2019t throbbing much at all now.</p><p>Michelle held the bag of peas against her forehead as she headed to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWe have to stop by the house first,\u201d Theo reiterated.</p><p>\u201cBecause Ben will be waiting for us? I could call him \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Theo said. \u201cBecause I want to pick up my cell phone, and I need more bullets.\u201d</p><p>He knew what was coming before John Paul opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need more bullets for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like a waste to me.\u201d</p><p>Michelle had had it with her brother. Turning around, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him, Theo. I know you want to because my brother can be a real pain in the backside. But I love him, so don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Theo winked at her.</p><p>John Paul scoffed, \u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d John Paul asked. \u201cIf he shoots, he\u2019ll miss.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p><p>While Michelle stood by the car talking to Ben, Theo went inside her house. He left his shoes by the door so he wouldn\u2019t track in mud, then ran upstairs, stripped out of his clothes, and took a quick hot shower. He was relieved he didn\u2019t find any ticks or leeches. He was back outside ten minutes later, carrying both Michelle\u2019s and his cell phones and her charger. He had already reloaded his gun and stuck an extra magazine in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d he asked Michelle.</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul got your car started,\u201d she told him as she got inside. \u201cKeys are in the ignition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is your brother?\u201d</p><p>She nodded toward the side of the house. John Paul was sprinting toward the pickup he\u2019d left parked on the road.</p><p>Theo intercepted him and handed him Michelle\u2019s cell phone and charger.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201d There was a look of repulsion on John Paul\u2019s face as he stared at the phone.</p><p>\u201cI have to be able to get hold of you. Take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t \u2014\u201d</p><p>Theo wasn\u2019t in the mood to argue. \u201cWhat are Michelle and I supposed to do if we need you? Send up a prayer?\u201d</p><p>John Paul relented. He grabbed the phone and charger and headed for the pickup. He heard his sister call, \u201cYou take care of Daddy, John Paul. Don\u2019t let anything happen to him. And you be careful too. You aren\u2019t invincible.\u201d Theo got in the car and was closing the door when Ben shouted and came running.</p><p>\u201cI think we just got a lucky break,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDispatch just called. There\u2019s a detective from New Orleans waiting to talk to me. Says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what the detective wants? No way New Orleans could have found out what happened last night. Not enough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way back to the station to find out, but I\u2019ve got a feeling this,\u201d he said, waving toward Michelle\u2019s house, \u201cand the detective from New Orleans are connected. They might know something that could help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me at the hospital as soon as you know anything,\u201d he said.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take them long to get to the hospital. Michelle led the way through the back corridor into the emergency room. She hadn\u2019t looked at herself in a mirror, and it wasn\u2019t until she noticed the staff staring at her that she realized she should have taken time to clean up. She thought she probably smelled awful too. Megan, the young, newly certified nurse working the emergency room, did a double take.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you fell in a garbage truck,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat the heck happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFell in a garbage truck.\u201d</p><p>Another nurse named Frances looked up from behind the nurses\u2019 station. She was also young, but had earned the nickname \u201cGrannie\u201d because she acted like a ninety-year-old. Michelle told her she needed a tray prepared for stitches.</p><p>Frances got up and hurried around the counter. Her rubber shoes squeaked with each step she took.</p><p>\u201cYou stay here, Theo,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cI\u2019m going to go into the doctors\u2019 lounge and take a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you. It\u2019s quiet there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ve got to call Noah.\u201d</p><p>Megan was wide-eyed and gawking as they walked past her. Michelle noticed her full attention was directed on Theo now.</p><p>Michelle led the way into the spacious lounge. There were lockers against one wall, a sofa and coffee table on the opposite side of the room, a couple of recliners, and a desk. Just inside the door was a narrow table with a coffee urn and plastic cups. In the corner sat a refrigerator.</p><p>A narrow hallway led to two doors. While Michelle was getting clean clothes out of her locker, Theo opened both doors to see what was inside. Each was a fully equipped bathroom with a shower.</p><p>\u201cNice setup,\u201d he remarked as she passed him on her way into the bath. Grabbing a container of bottled water out of the refrigerator, he sat down at the desk and dialed Noah\u2019s cell phone. A second later he was listening to Noah telling him to leave a message. He had a pretty good idea where Noah was, but he would have to wait until Michelle finished showering to get the phone number.</p><p>Next, he dialed the hospital operator and asked her to page Elena Miller. He heard the sound of papers rustling in the background, then the operator told him that Elena wasn\u2019t on duty yet. Although she refused to give Theo the woman\u2019s home number, she finally agreed to dial it for him. Elena answered on the second ring, and after identifying himself, Theo asked her to describe the messenger who had come by the hospital to pick up the package on Wednesday and to tell him what the man had said.</p><p>Elena couldn\u2019t wait to tell Theo all about the rude man. \u201cHe had the gall to shout at me,\u201d she said.</p><p>Theo made notes on a notepad he found on the desk and asked her several questions. When he was finished, he hung up, then looked up the phone number of the Speedy Messenger Service in New Orleans in the yellow pages he found in the bottom desk drawer and called them. Three people later, he got to the supervisor. The man sounded frazzled and didn\u2019t want to cooperate until Theo threatened to send over a couple of policemen to get the information. The supervisor was suddenly happy to help. He explained that all the deliveries were kept in the computer. He typed in Michelle Renard\u2019s name and told Theo when and where the package was delivered.</p><p>\u201cI want to know who sent it,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>\u201cBenchley, Tarrance, and Paulson,\u201d the supervisor replied. \u201cThe package was signed for at the St. Claire Hospital at five-fifteen according to my records. You want me to send you a copy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>By the time Michelle had showered and washed her hair, she felt pretty good. She thought she looked like hell, but she felt good, and right now, that was all she cared about. She got dressed, combed her hair, wincing when she accidentally hit her tender scalp. Tucking the strands behind her ears, she decided to let it dry on its own. She was walking toward Theo, pulling the drawstring tight on her pants and tying it, as he turned to her.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Noah?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he answered. \u201cI did talk to the supervisor at Speedy. Guess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no Frank or Eddie, right? God, I feel like such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there isn\u2019t any Frank or Eddie, but why would you feel like an idiot? There was absolutely no reason for you to be suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo, I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ve seen that man before. I assumed I had run into him at the hospital, but that obviously isn\u2019t the case. So where did I see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will come to you,\u201d he said. \u201cTry not to force it, and when you\u2019re thinking about something else, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll remember. You know what else the supervisor told me?\u201d</p><p>Michelle crossed the room to the sofa, sat down, and bent over to tie her shoelaces.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe package was sent from Benchley, Tarrance, and Paulson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAddressed to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cI called the firm, but no one is going to tell me anything over the phone, so I\u2019m sending Noah over there. Oh, and I also talked to Elena Miller. She was on a tirade.\u201d</p><p>Michelle nodded. \u201cElena\u2019s always on a tirade about something. What did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe messenger was hostile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she couldn\u2019t locate the package for him, she said he started shouting at her. He threatened her too. She was so furious she was going to call the messenger service and report him, but she got busy and forgot about it.\u201d</p><p>She stood and walked over to the desk. Noticing the way he was staring at her, she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just noticed how tired you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you. You look like you\u2019re about to fall over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look fine. Her complexion was pale and she was tense. She needed to take a couple of minutes to chill out, he thought. Her nervous energy was going to run out, and then she would crash.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheo, we have to get moving. I\u2019ve got to stitch your arm and find that package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stitches and the package can wait a few more minutes. Take a deep breath and try to unwind. You want something to drink? A cola or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloser.\u201d</p><p>She took a step to the side of the desk. \u201cTheo . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloser.\u201d</p><p>The man was irresistible. She knew she shouldn\u2019t allow him to sidetrack her. They both had too much to do. Folding her arms across her chest, she frowned at him. \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to fool around.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her onto his lap. \u201cWhy do you think I want to fool around?\u201d</p><p>His hand had moved to the back of her neck, and he was slowly pulling her toward him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . it\u2019s just a feeling I have that you might want to kiss me,\u201d she said as she placed her hands on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThe thought never entered my mind. We can\u2019t fool around now, sweetheart. We\u2019ve got too much to do.\u201d</p><p>He was nibbling on her neck. She closed her eyes and tilted her head to the side so he could kiss her earlobe.</p><p>\u201cThen I must have misread the signals,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMust have,\u201d he agreed a scant second before his mouth captured hers for a long, scorching kiss. His tongue slid inside her warm mouth, and, oh, God, the slow, lazy penetration drove her wild. He teased and tantalized until she was trembling and gripping his shoulders in a silent demand for more.</p><p>Theo had meant only to give her a quick kiss, but once his mouth touched hers, he simply couldn\u2019t resist. He knew he had to stop before things got completely out of hand, and yet he continued to kiss her until she pulled back.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do this.\u201d She was panting now and sounded dazed. \u201cWe just can\u2019t.\u201d Her forehead dropped on his. \u201cThis has to stop, Theo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d he said gruffly as he tried to get his heartbeat to slow down.</p><p>She kissed his forehead, then moved lower to the bridge of his nose. \u201cThis is a hospital, for the love of God.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him on the mouth. And just when he was beginning to gain the upper hand, she tore her mouth away and whispered, \u201cI work here. I can\u2019t go around kissing people all the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And damned if she didn\u2019t kiss him again. Theo could feel his control slipping. He abruptly pulled back and lifted her off his lap.</p><p>She leaned against the desk in case her legs gave out. Lord, could he kiss, and, oh, how she loved the taste of him. Disheartened, she realized she loved everything about him. His calm, take-charge attitude . . . his self-confidence. He was so comfortable in his own skin, so sure of himself. When he was afraid, he didn\u2019t hide it the way her brother did. He was so secure he didn\u2019t care what other people thought.</p><p>Michelle admired that trait most of all.</p><p>She took a deep breath and headed for the ER. Pushing the swinging door open with the flat of her hand, she went into the hallway. Theo was right behind her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the sexiest walk,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you read the sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo flirting in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>He relented. \u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll start searching for the package in the emergency room first,\u201d he said, suddenly all business again. \u201cI noticed on our way in that it wasn\u2019t busy, so now is the perfect time. I\u2019m going to get some of the staff to help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sew you back together first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Michelle, I want \u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned around and walked backwards as she said, \u201cTheo, I\u2019m in charge here. Deal with it.\u201d</p><p>The shower had revitalized her, but she knew the burst of energy she was feeling was going to be short and the lack of sleep would eventually catch up with her. For that reason she wanted to get the more important task finished. Theo came first whether he wanted to or not.</p><p>She was also feeling relaxed and sure of herself again. She was on safe ground at the hospital and knew that she and Theo could let their guard down here. No one would be shooting at them. There was safety in numbers. She thought it might be a good idea if they slept at the hospital and was going to suggest it when Theo turned her attention.</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d he demanded. \u201cWho do I talk to about getting personnel to start looking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose people have jobs to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could call the administrator. He\u2019s usually here by eight, and it\u2019s almost that now, but he\u2019s not going to cooperate with you. He doesn\u2019t like anything disrupting routine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll cooperate. You\u2019re practically running. Slow down,\u201d he said once again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dragging your feet. Are you afraid of a couple of stitches?\u201d The possibility made her smile. \u201cScared I\u2019ll hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just don\u2019t like needles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d she said. \u201cI faint every time I see one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Michelle.\u201d</p> <p>She thought it was and laughed. Frances, the nurse of the perpetual frown, was standing outside one of the exam areas. She pulled the drape back. \u201cEverything\u2019s ready, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>Michelle patted the exam table while the nurse raised the head so Theo could lean back. He sat down, his attention on Michelle now as she put on a pair of sterile gloves. The nurse distracted him when she came at him with a pair of scissors and took hold of his T-shirt. He reached over and pulled the sleeve up over his shoulder. While she swabbed the skin around the cut with a strong-smelling disinfectant, he picked up his cell phone and started dialing.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t use that cell phone in the hospital,\u201d Frances told him, and tried to snatch the phone out of his hand.</p><p>He wanted to say, \u201cBack off, lady,\u201d but he didn\u2019t. He turned the phone off and put it on the exam table next to him. \u201cGet me a phone I can use.\u201d</p><p>He must have sounded hostile. Though it didn\u2019t seem possible, Frances\u2019s frown intensified. \u201cHe\u2019s an irritable one, isn\u2019t he, Doctor?\u201d</p><p>Michelle was working at the corner with her back to Theo, but he knew she was smiling. He could hear it in her voice when she said, \u201cHe needs a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a phone.\u201d</p><p>Frances finished cleaning the area and left. Theo assumed she\u2019d gone to get him a phone. Then Michelle walked over to him with her hand behind her back. He took exception to the fact that she was treating him like a ten-year-old, hiding the syringe so he wouldn\u2019t see the needle.</p><p>Exasperated, he said, \u201cMake this quick. We\u2019ve got things to do.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t flinch as she injected the lidocaine. \u201cThis should be numb in a minute. Would you like to lie down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it make your job easier or quicker if I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m fine. Go ahead and start.\u201d</p><p>Frances had returned with a clipboard and papers. She\u2019d obviously heard Theo tell Michelle to get started.</p><p>\u201cYoung man, you shouldn\u2019t rush the doctor. That\u2019s how mistakes are made.\u201d</p><p>Young man? Hell, he had to be older than she was. \u201cWhere\u2019s a phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Theo,\u201d Michelle said as she motioned for Frances to move the tray closer to her side. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurry.\u201d Then she smiled and whispered, \u201cSomeone told me that if you want something done right . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be slow and easy. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>In spite of his irritability, he had to smile. He wanted to kiss her, but he knew the nurse from X-Files would probably try to deck him if he did.</p><p>\u201cFrances, are you married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking Michelle should hook you up with her brother, John Paul. You two have a lot in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor, we don\u2019t have paperwork on this patient,\u201d she said curtly.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my phone?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll fill out the forms after I\u2019m finished,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t proper procedure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna count to five. If I don\u2019t have a phone in my hand by the time I\u2019m finished, I\u2019m getting off this table . . .\u201d Theo warned.</p><p>\u201cFrances, please bring Theo a phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one on the wall,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cBut he can\u2019t reach it, can he?\u201d Michelle sounded testy now.</p><p>\u201cVery well, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>Frances delegated the task to Megan, who was leaning over the nurses\u2019 station flirting with a paramedic.</p><p>The phone was an old-fashioned desk model. Megan unclipped the wall phone outlet, snapped the plug in, and handed the phone to Theo. \u201cYou have to dial nine to get outside.\u201d</p><p>Michelle had finished cleaning the wound and was ready to begin stitching. \u201cQuit squirming,\u201d she told him. \u201cAre you trying to get Noah again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to the administrator first and get us some help. If we have to tear this place apart, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. I want to find that package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who has to look . . . maybe you and one other person could help. If you have everyone searching, I won\u2019t know where they looked and where they didn\u2019t. Let me look around the ER and the surgical floor before you call in reinforcements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy just those two areas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause any mail I don\u2019t pick up down here is sent up to surgical. All the surgeons have cubicles upstairs, and that\u2019s where they drop our mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Megan said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken lots of mail up. I go upstairs at least twice a day. I try to be helpful.\u201d Then she added, \u201cThere\u2019s a really cute tech up there. I\u2019ve been trying get him to notice me. I\u2019ll help you, Dr. Mike. Nothing much is happening in the ER, and Frances will page me if she needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. What am I helping you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind a package that was delivered by the Speedy Messenger Service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we get lots of packages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle, honey, are you almost finished?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cWooo! He just called you honey,\u201d Megan crooned.</p><p>\u201cMegan, you\u2019re in my light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Doctor.\u201d As she stepped back, her gaze bounced from Theo to Michelle and back again. \u201cSo what\u2019s the deal?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you start searching through the desks and cabinets down here while Michelle finishes this,\u201d Theo ordered.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe thorough,\u201d Michelle said without looking up.</p><p>The second Megan pulled the curtain closed, Michelle whispered, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have called me honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I undermine your authority?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just that . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan\u2019s sweet, but she tells everything, and I can only imagine what the gossip will be tomorrow. They\u2019ll have me barefoot and pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cThe pregnant part . . . that\u2019s a nice image.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cA woman who could breeze through a snake crawling up her leg can handle a little gossip. You\u2019re tougher than you look.\u201d</p><p>She focused on the task at hand. \u201cOne more stitch and I\u2019m finished. When did you have your last tetanus shot?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss a heartbeat. \u201cYesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you hate shots too, huh? You\u2019re getting one.\u201d</p><p>He reached across to touch her cheek. \u201cYou get flustered when I tease you, and you get embarrassed with compliments. You don\u2019t know what to do with them, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinished,\u201d she announced. \u201cYou\u2019re back together again, Humpty-Dumpty. Don\u2019t get up yet,\u201d she quickly added when he moved. \u201cI\u2019m finished. You\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBandage and shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many stitches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p><p>The curtain parted as Michelle was removing her gloves. Megan interrupted. \u201cDr. Mike, there\u2019s a detective from New Orleans wanting to talk to you and your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a patient,\u201d Michelle snapped, and too late realized she shouldn\u2019t have said anything. She\u2019d sounded defensive, which, of course, only fueled Megan\u2019s overactive imagination.</p><p>Megan pulled the curtain back. \u201cThis is Detective Harris,\u201d she said.</p><p>The woman was tall, strikingly attractive, with an oval face and piercing eyes. As she strode forward, Michelle could see the lines at the corners of her eyes and around her mouth. Dressed in a pair of black pants, sensible black shoes, and a pale blue blouse, she moved toward Theo. When she extended her hand to shake his, Michelle noticed the badge and gun clipped to her belt.</p><p>Harris didn\u2019t waste time on preliminaries. \u201cI want to hear exactly what happened last night. Chief Nelson filled me in on what went down, but I want to hear your version.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Ben?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>\u201cHe went back to your house to finish sweeping the crime scene.\u201d She gave Michelle a cursory once-over before continuing. \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever he bags back to the lab in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>Theo studied Harris while she talked to Michelle. The detective was like a thousand other police officers he\u2019d known. There was a weariness about her as though she\u2019d been exhausted most of her life. Her attitude was brittle and hard.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with the department?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFour years in homicide,\u201d she responded impatiently. \u201cThree years with vice before the transfer.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Vice. That explained it. \u201cSo what brought you to Bowen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll ask the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said agreeably. \u201cJust as soon as you answer mine.\u201d</p><p>Her lip curled in what Theo thought might have been an attempt at a smile. \u201cIf Nelson hadn\u2019t already told me, I would have guessed you were an attorney.\u201d</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t respond to the comment. He simply waited for her to answer his question. She tried to outstare and intimidate him, but she lost on both counts.</p><p>With a sigh, she answered, \u201cI got a tip . . . a good, reliable, inside tip that a hitter I\u2019ve been trailing for three long years is setting up here. I was told he\u2019s in Bowen to do a job, and, I swear to God, I\u2019m going to get him this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ghost. At least, that\u2019s what some of the guys in homicide call him, because he vanishes into thin air every time I get close. According to my informant, he\u2019s calling himself Monk these days. I\u2019ve put him with two murders in New Orleans in the past year. We\u2019re pretty sure he killed a teenager in Metairie, and we think the girl\u2019s father paid for the hit so he could collect insurance, but we can\u2019t prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it was Monk?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cHe left his calling card. He always does,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy informant is close to Monk, knows his routine. He told me that Monk leaves a long-stemmed red rose as proof that he did the job. He always makes the murders look like accidents or suicide, and in every case I\u2019ve been involved in, someone benefits from the death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA father had his child killed so he could get money?\u201d Michelle rubbed her arms as though to ward off a chill. That a father would do such a monstrous thing was staggering. She felt sick to her stomach. That poor child.</p><p>\u201cThe rose was missing from the girl\u2019s bedroom,\u201d Harris continued. \u201cBut there was one petal, still uncurled, half under the dresser. On another case, the crime unit found a thorn stuck in the bedspread. Monk does most of his work at night when his victims are sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was the victim in the second case you mentioned?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cAn old man, a wealthy grandfather whose only relative had a heavy drug problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what you\u2019ve told me about this man,\u201d Theo said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem his style to work with others. He sounds like a loner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil now, he has acted alone, but my gut\u2019s telling me he was at the doctor\u2019s house last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was involved,\u201d Michelle said, \u201cthen he must be after the package. Maybe there\u2019s something inside that will incriminate him or the person who hired him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat package?\u201d Harris asked sharply. She looked as if she was about to pounce on Michelle for withholding information. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Michelle explained, and when she was finished, the detective couldn\u2019t hide her excitement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you can ID one of them?

No one\u2019s seen him before, but now with a description . . .\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to your informant,\u201d Theo said.</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cYou think I have his phone number? It doesn\u2019t work that way. He calls me when he feels like it, and he always uses a pay phone. We\u2019ve traced the calls, but a car never gets there in time. He\u2019s as elusive as the ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Theo said. \u201cWhat about your file on Monk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see it.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his request. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find that package,\u201d she said to Michelle. \u201cNo hint of what might be inside?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get Monk this time. I swear it on my mother\u2019s grave. He\u2019s so close I can almost smell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see your file,\u201d Theo repeated. This time he made sure she understood he wasn\u2019t asking. He was demanding.</p><p>She gave him an icy stare without responding.</p><p>Michelle hurried to diffuse the antagonism. \u201cWe\u2019ll help you any way that we can, Detective.\u201d</p><p>Harris was still looking at Theo as she answered. \u201cThe best way to help is to stay out of my way. I\u2019m running this operation. Is that understood?\u201d</p> <p>When Theo didn\u2019t answer, she cleared her throat nervously. \u201cI\u2019ll put a net around the area and start squeezing. You take the doctor home and stay there. If you hear or see anything suspect, you call me.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out two cards and handed one to Theo and gave the other one to Michelle. \u201cYou can always get me on my cell phone.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take a law degree to know Harris wasn\u2019t going to cooperate. She was playing close to the vest, and in retaliation, Theo didn\u2019t feel the need to share the information he\u2019d collected with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to want to see your file, Detective, and I\u2019m going to want to see what\u2019s inside that package,\u201d he snapped. He wasn\u2019t going to take no for an answer.</p><p>\u201cYou can see what\u2019s in the package,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s something unrelated to Monk, then you can investigate to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if there is information connecting Monk?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m calling the shots. This is my investigation, and I\u2019m not about to let the Feds mess it up. I\u2019ve spent three long years chasing Monk\u2019s shadow, and I\u2019ve got too much invested to let the FBI interfere. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Her contempt was palpable. The unfriendly rivalry between the Bureau and local law enforcement agencies was deep-rooted and a hell of a nuisance, as far as Theo was concerned. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to be diplomatic or play games.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried the FBI will take your case?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I\u2019m worried. Three years,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Monk, and when I do, I\u2019m not going to hand him over to you,\u201d she told Theo.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m an attorney with the Justice Department. I don\u2019t care what you do with him, unless he\u2019s one of the shooters who tried to kill Michelle and me last night. If that\u2019s the case, then you and I are going to have to come to an understanding.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and said, \u201cThe police chief told me you are on vacation . . . that you came here to fish. So go fish and let me do my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I understand why you want the collar, but \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded before he could finish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in, like it or not. You think I\u2019m going to sit around and wait? Maybe I didn\u2019t make myself clear. He tried to kill us.\u201d</p><p>Harris was irate. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you screw up this investigation.\u201d</p><p>Theo wasn\u2019t about to get involved in a shouting match. Forcing himself to speak in a level voice, he asked, \u201cHow many times do I have to say it before you understand? You\u2019re not stopping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I\u2019m \u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cI can stop you, though, and we both know it. One phone call. That\u2019s all it would take.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t bluffing. When it came to push and shove, he had the muscle. She didn\u2019t. Simple as that.</p><p>Harris decided on a more prudent approach. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll share information. I\u2019ll send you copies of what I\u2019ve got on Monk as soon as I get back to the station. And I\u2019ll let you see what\u2019s inside the package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming we can find it,\u201d Michelle interjected.</p><p>\u201cWe have to find it,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cNow, I want something,\u201d Harris said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want forty-eight hours before you start interfering or call in your troops. I guarantee I\u2019ll have Monk behind bars before then. If he\u2019s working with the men who came after you and the doctor, I\u2019ll get them too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty sure of yourself. What aren\u2019t you telling me, Detective? Do you know where Monk is now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty-eight hours,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste any time thinking about it. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four hours, then,\u201d she demanded. \u201cThat\u2019s reasonable.\u201d</p><p>Her neck was getting red from anger, but Theo didn\u2019t give a damn if he was making her life difficult or not.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want? Give me something. My men are closing the net now, and we\u2019ve all worked too damn long to let you take over. Let us get him. Three long years \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Three years,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll give you twelve hours, but not one minute more. If you haven\u2019t made any arrests by then, I\u2019m acting.\u201d</p><p>She checked her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s almost nine o\u2019clock now. Twelve hours . . . yeah, I can live with that. You take the doctor home and stay there with her until nine tonight.\u201d Turning to Michelle, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s get moving. Where do we start looking for that package?\u201d</p><p>Michelle saw Frances motioning to her. She was holding the phone up. \u201cIt\u2019s either down here somewhere or upstairs on the surgical wing. Will you excuse me? I\u2019ve got a phone call.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for permission. As she hurried to the counter, she called out, \u201cMegan, why don\u2019t you and Detective Harris go on up to the surgical floor and start looking. I\u2019ll be up in a minute to help. Frances, you can go ahead and bandage Mr. Buchanan and give him a tetanus shot.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the phone and moved back to get out of Megan\u2019s path.</p><p>\u201cThis way, Detective,\u201d Megan said, leading her toward the elevator.</p><p>Michelle wasn\u2019t on the phone long. She came back to Theo and said, \u201cDr. Landusky found out I was in the hospital and asked me to check a patient for him. Has the numbing worn off? I could give you something if you\u2019re hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee to that paperwork, Doctor,\u201d Frances said before she left them alone.</p><p>Theo was watching the elevator. As soon as the doors closed, he picked up the phone and asked Michelle to give him Mary Ann\u2019s home phone number.</p><p>She rattled off the number. \u201cWhy do you want to talk to Mary Ann?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Michelle\u2019s friend answered on the third ring. She sounded sleepy.</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t waste time chatting. \u201cLet me talk to Noah.\u201d</p><p>Michelle\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cHe went back to New Orleans with Mary Ann?\u201d</p><p>She had her answer a second later when Theo said, \u201cGet out of her bed and go in the other room so we can talk.\u201d</p><p>Noah yawned loudly into the phone. \u201cThis better be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cYeah, all right. Hold on a minute.\u201d</p><p>Michelle heard her name being paged and went back to the counter to pick up the phone. A nurse wanted her to check a chart before she gave the patient medication. Michelle hung up just as Theo was ending his conversation.</p><p>She heard him say, \u201cAfter you check it out, get back here. Thanks, Noah.\u201d</p><p>The second he hung up the phone, Michelle asked, \u201cWhat are you doing? I heard you promise the detective you would give her twelve hours and not do anything until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did say twelve hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d he agreed. \u201cSo you know what that must mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p><p>They were searching the wrong cubicle. Michelle went past her desk and found Detective Harris and Megan sorting through Dr. Landusky\u2019s things.</p><p>\u201cHave you already searched my cubicle?\u201d she asked Megan.</p><p>\u201cI thought this was where you worked,\u201d Megan said. She was sitting on the floor next to the desk, going through folders.</p><p>\u201cMine\u2019s next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, I\u2019m sorry, Dr. Mike. All this time, since I started working here, I thought you were a slob because I thought this was your workspace. Every time I came up here, you were sitting at this desk dictating or writing in one of the charts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used Dr. Landusky\u2019s cubicle because that\u2019s where the nurses and the staff secretaries put his charts, and I covered his practice while he was on vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I\u2019ve been dropping your stuff off here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better keep going, then,\u201d Harris said. \u201cMaybe it was dropped here by mistake.\u201d</p><p>Since Detective Harris was searching the desk, Michelle got down on her knees and began to go through the pile against the wall. \u201cI don\u2019t know how Landusky can work like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always behind on his charts,\u201d Megan volunteered.</p><p>\u201cWill you concentrate on the task at hand?\u201d Harris demanded. She sounded like a schoolteacher reprimanding two errant students.</p><p>\u201cI can talk and look at the same time,\u201d Megan assured her.</p><p>\u201cKeep looking,\u201d Harris urged.</p><p>\u201cCould this be it?\u201d Megan asked a few seconds later. She handed a small yellow envelope to Michelle.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Michelle answered. \u201cIt has to have the Speedy Messenger Service label on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this one?\u201d Megan asked.</p><p>Once again, she passed a package to Michelle. Harris glanced over her shoulder and waited for Michelle to answer.</p><p>The package was a legal-sized, padded manila envelope. Michelle read the name of a law firm in the upper corner just above the label and caught her breath.</p><p>\u201cI think this could be it,\u201d she said as she handed the envelope to the detective.</p><p>Harris acted as though she\u2019d just been given an explosive. She gingerly tested the weight, then slowly turned the package over. The detective took time and care pulling the tab across the top. There was another manila envelope inside. Harris sliced it open with a letter opener.</p><p>Holding the envelope by one edge, she looked around the desk. \u201cThis will work,\u201d she said as she picked up a large binder clip from one of the shelves. \u201cI don\u2019t want to touch the papers inside and mess up any prints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could get you some gloves,\u201d Megan offered.</p><p>Harris smiled. \u201cThanks, but this should work.\u201d</p><p>Michelle leaned back against the wall, a pile of folders in her lap. She watched as the detective used the clip to clasp the corner of one of the sheets and lift it halfway out.</p><p>Megan knocked over a stack of newspapers and charts when she got up on her knees. Michelle helped her restack the pile in the corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Michelle asked the detective.</p><p>Harris looked disappointed. \u201cIt\u2019s some kind of an audit or a financial statement. No names on this page, just initials next to what I think are transactions. Lots and lots of numbers,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like there\u2019s around twelve pages, maybe more, but some of them are stapled together behind this sheet,\u201d she said. Shaking her head, she added, \u201cToo risky to try to pull out.\u201d</p><p>She was slowly pushing the paper back into the envelope. \u201cI\u2019ve got to rush this to the lab. Once they\u2019ve gone over the pages, then I\u2019ll get someone to help me figure out what all these numbers mean.\u201d</p><p>It was a huge letdown not knowing what any of it meant. Michelle moved the folders and got up as Harris walked to the elevator and pushed the button. \u201cThanks for your help,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you apprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised Theo you\u2019d let him see the contents of that package,\u201d Michelle reminded her.</p><p>The elevator door opened. Harris stepped inside and punched the button. As the door was closing, she flashed Michelle a smile and said, \u201cI\u2019ll let him see the papers in twelve hours and not a minute before.\u201d</p><p>Michelle stood with her hands on her hips, shaking her head as the door closed. Megan came up behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect to find in that envelope?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAnswers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen things settle down, will you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Michelle agreed. \u201cIf I ever find out what\u2019s going on, I\u2019ll be happy to fill you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend\u2019s an attorney. He\u2019ll probably know what those numbers mean, and you know he\u2019s not going to let that detective get past him without looking. I\u2019m going to take the stairs down to ER. I don\u2019t want to miss the fireworks.\u201d</p><p>Michelle had one more patient to check; then she would be finished. \u201cTell Theo I\u2019ll only be a minute,\u201d she called out as she turned and headed to CCU.</p><p>Detective Harris wasn\u2019t about to take the chance of running into Buchanan. She got off the elevator on the second floor and took the stairs to the first. Following the exit signs, she found a side door and slipped out without anyone seeing her. She circled the outside of the hospital and was running toward the parking lot with the envelope clutched to her chest when she heard screeching tires behind her. Harris swung around just as the gray Toyota bore down on her.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>The detective wasn\u2019t answering her cell phone, and Theo was furious. He tried twice, and each time he was transferred to voice mail. His messages were to the point. He wanted that package, and he wanted it now. He also left a message for her at her precinct and was just hanging up the phone when Michelle got off the elevator. Even though Theo had heard one version from Megan of what had transpired, he made Michelle go over it again as he followed her into the doctors\u2019 lounge to pick up her clothes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t see the papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t about to let me touch them. She was worried about messing up fingerprints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell she was,\u201d he snapped. \u201cShe was playing you,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s determined to keep me out of her investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor twelve hours anyway,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She had shoved her clothes and shoes into a plastic bag and was now standing at the door. Theo was reaching for the phone. \u201cI guess it\u2019s time to get tough,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cTheo?\u201d</p><p>He finally looked at her. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beat. I\u2019ve got to get some sleep, and so do you. Can we please go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive the woman twelve hours,\u201d she said. \u201cYou did promise.\u201d She yawned. \u201cI know she doesn\u2019t want to cooperate with you and that infuriates you, but I think you should give her a little slack. She has put in three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if she\u2019s put in fifteen,\u201d he countered. \u201cI\u2019m not backing away.\u201d</p><p>He was getting riled up. By the time they reached the car, he was threatening to take the detective\u2019s badge. Michelle let him vent his frustration without interrupting. When he was finished, she asked, \u201cFeel better now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>He handed her his phone. \u201cCall your dad and tell him we\u2019re coming over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we stop by my house first so I can get a change of clothes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>While she dialed, he turned the corner and entered Bowen. Now that he knew his way around, it didn\u2019t seem all that complicated, although he still believed the town could use a couple of signs.</p><p>No one answered at her father\u2019s house. Since he wouldn\u2019t use an answering machine, she couldn\u2019t leave a message. Remembering that John Paul had her cell phone, she dialed the number and waited.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to answer a phone?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d her brother said. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Theo and I are coming over. Where\u2019s Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight beside me. We\u2019re on our way over to your house. Dad heard what happened last night and wants to see you to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell him I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did, but he still wants to see for himself.\u201d</p><p>He abruptly disconnected his phone before she had a chance to speak to her father. She pushed the end button and handed the phone back to Theo.</p><p>John Paul and Jake pulled into the drive behind them. After Michelle calmed her father down, she packed some clothes and toiletries and they headed out. John Paul suggested they leave the rental car in the driveway and ride with him and Michelle\u2019s father so that if anyone came looking, they would see the car and assume Theo and Michelle were inside. Theo wasn\u2019t in a mood to argue with him.</p><p>The pickup needed new shocks. Michelle sat on Theo\u2019s lap by the window and had to duck down every time her brother sped over a bump. As they were crossing the junction, Daddy remarked, \u201cYou both have to be tuckered out, what with those terrible men shooting at you and chasing you half the night.\u201d</p><p>Big Daddy Jake had a sprawling home. From the front it looked like a tract house on a cement slab. John Paul pulled the truck around to the back, and Theo could then see the windows on a second level facing the water. There was also another room, obviously built on as an afterthought, jutting out on the back. Like Michelle, her father also had a big screened porch overlooking the water.</p><p>There were three boats, all small, tied to the dock.</p><p>Daddy didn\u2019t like air-conditioning. He had a couple of window units, but neither was turned on. The floors were old, worn hardwood, the boards warped in the living room. Braided oval rugs were strewn about the floor. It wasn\u2019t stuffy inside, though. The overhead ceiling fan made a clicking sound with each turn and helped carry in a breeze from the water.</p><p>Sunlight spilled in through the windows, casting a bright light on the old furniture. Theo carried Michelle\u2019s bag and followed her down a long hallway. He could see Jake\u2019s big double bed through the open doorway at the end of the hall. Michelle opened the door on the left and went inside.</p><p>There were two single beds with a nightstand between them. The window faced the front yard. It was stuffy and hot, but thankfully there was another air conditioner in the window. Michelle turned it on high, kicked off her shoes, and sat on the side of the bed covered in a blue-and-white quilt. Daddy didn\u2019t care about coordinating colors. The other bed had a red-and-yellow-striped quilt on it. Michelle took her socks off and fell back against the pillow. She was sound asleep in less than a minute.</p><p>Theo quietly shut the door behind him and went back into the living room.</p><p>An hour later, Daddy\u2019s booming laughter woke Michelle. She got up and was walking to the bathroom when Theo came around the corner.</p><p>\u201cDid we wake you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head and backed up so he could get by, but he followed her until he had her pressed against the wall. Then he kissed her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way to start a new day. Kissing a beautiful woman,\u201d he said, and went back into the living room.</p><p>She looked at herself in the mirror and was appalled. Time to bring out the makeup, she decided, and start acting like a woman. He\u2019d called her beautiful? She thought then that Theo needed to wear his glasses all the time.</p><p>In a half hour, she was as good as she was going to get. She wished she\u2019d packed a skirt, but she hadn\u2019t, and her only choices were a pair of navy shorts or jeans. Since it was hot, she opted for the shorts. There wasn\u2019t any choice for tops. She\u2019d packed a pale yellow blouse with a little too much spandex.</p><p>Barefoot, she padded down the hallway with her makeup bag and put it on the dresser in the bedroom. Theo came in to get his glasses. He was talking on the phone as he walked. He gave her a quick once-over, his gaze lingering on her legs, and she heard him ask the person on the other end to repeat what he had just said.</p><p>\u201cI got it. Yeah, her dad got the certified letter about an hour ago. No, Michelle doesn\u2019t know. I\u2019ll let Jake tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBen. He\u2019s still waiting for the crime scene report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want Daddy to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood news,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cWere there people here earlier? I thought I heard the door opening and closing and lots of strange voices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of your dad\u2019s friends brought over the food from your house. There are four pies on the kitchen table,\u201d he added with a grin.</p><p>\u201cBut no cards, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, I want to talk to you,\u201d her father called.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>She and Theo walked into the living room together. She saw the photo album on the table and whispered, \u201cUh-oh. Daddy\u2019s melancholy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks happy to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s melancholy. He only gets the family album out when he\u2019s feeling blue.\u201d</p><p>John Paul was sprawled out on the sofa. His hands were stacked on his chest and his eyes were closed.</p><p>Jake was sitting at a big round oak table in the country kitchen, which opened to the living room.</p><p>\u201cNow aren\u2019t you sorry you didn\u2019t go to the funeral?\u201d he asked his son.</p><p>John Paul didn\u2019t open his eyes when he answered. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be,\u201d Jake said. \u201cYour cousin wasn\u2019t the sourpuss you thought she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said she was a sourpuss. I said \u2014\u201d</p><p>His father quickly stopped him. \u201cI remember what you said, but I don\u2019t want you repeating it in front of company. Besides, I know you\u2019ve got to be feeling contrite now.\u201d</p><p>John Paul didn\u2019t have anything to say about that, unless a grunt qualified as a response.</p><p>\u201cYour cousin was mindful of family after all. Mike, come and sit at the table. I\u2019ve got something important to tell you. Theo, you sit down too. I want you to see some pictures.\u201d</p><p>Theo pulled out a chair for Michelle, then sat beside her. Jake took hold of Michelle\u2019s hand and looked her in the eyes. \u201cBrace yourself, sugar. This is gonna be a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho died?\u201d</p><p>Her father blinked. \u201cNo one died. It\u2019s your cousin Catherine Bodine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead one,\u201d John Paul called out.</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s dead. We\u2019ve only got one cousin in the family on your mama\u2019s side.\u201d Jake shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>\u201cShe left us money. A heap of money,\u201d he stressed, raising his eyebrows.</p><p>Michelle didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cOh, Daddy, that\u2019s got to be a mistake. You\u2019re telling me Catherine left us money? No, she wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just told you she did,\u201d her father countered. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to believe, and it\u2019s a shock, just like I warned you it would be, but it\u2019s true. She left us money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she leave us anything? She hated us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that,\u201d he chided. Pulling his handkerchief from his pocket, he wiped his eyes. \u201cYour cousin was a wonderful woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s called rewriting history,\u201d John Paul muttered.</p><p>Still the doubting Thomas, Michelle shook her head. \u201cThere has to be a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sugar, there isn\u2019t any mistake. Aren\u2019t you curious to know how much money she gave us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, wondering what kind of joke Catherine had played. From what she\u2019d heard about her cousin from her brothers, the woman had a cruel streak.</p><p>\u201cYour dear cousin left each one of us one hundred thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>Michelle\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cOne hundred . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThousand dollars,\u201d her father finished for her. \u201cI just got off the phone with Remy. I called your brother to tell him about his cousin\u2019s generosity, and his reaction was just like yours and John Paul\u2019s. I raised three cynical children.\u201d</p><p>Michelle was having a difficult time processing the shocking news. \u201cCatherine Bodine . . . gave . . . one hundred . . .\u201d</p><p>John Paul laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re sputtering, little sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hush now, John Paul,\u201d his father ordered. In a softer voice, he said to Michelle, \u201cYou see, sugar? Catherine didn\u2019t hate us. She just didn\u2019t have much use for us is all. She was . . . different, and we were a reminder of hard times.\u201d</p><p>Michelle suddenly realized Theo wouldn\u2019t have any idea who they were talking about. \u201cMy cousin was around seven or eight when her mother married a very wealthy man named Bodine. They moved to New Orleans and pretty much severed ties with us. I never met Catherine,\u201d she admitted, \u201cor spoke to her on the phone. I can\u2019t believe she would leave us anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatherine\u2019s mother was my wife\u2019s sister,\u201d Jake explained. \u201cHer name was June, but we all called her Junie. She wasn\u2019t married when she found herself in the family way. Back then, having a child out of wedlock caused quite a stir, but folks forgot about it as time passed. Her father never forgot or forgave her, though. He tossed her out on her ear is what he did. Now, Ellie and I were newly married, so Junie moved in with us. When the baby came, the two of them stayed on. It was crowded, but we all made do,\u201d he added. \u201cThen Junie met that rich fella, got married, and moved away. Junie passed on when Catherine was eleven. I wasn\u2019t going to let that child forget she had family in Bowen who loved her, so I made it a point to call her up at least once a month and visit with her. She never had much to say, though, and I did a lot of bragging about my three so she\u2019d know her cousins. Catherine was real impressed when she found out Mike was going to be a doctor. She was proud of you, sugar. She just never said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatherine didn\u2019t even invite you to her wedding,\u201d Michelle reminded her father. \u201cAnd I know that must have hurt your feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t. Besides, it was a tiny affair in the courthouse. She told me so herself.\u201d</p><p>Michelle had her elbow propped on the table and was twirling a lock of hair around her finger in an absentminded fashion while she thought about the windfall. The money was a godsend. There was more than enough to fix up the clinic and hire a nurse.</p><p>Her father was smiling as he watched her. \u201cThere you go again, twisting your hair.\u201d Turning to Theo, he said, \u201cWhen she was a little tiny thing, she\u2019d wrap her hair around her fingers and suck her thumb until she fell asleep. I can\u2019t remember the number of times Remy or I had to untangle the knots she made.\u201d</p><p>Michelle let go of her hair and folded her hands. \u201cI\u2019m feeling guilty,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I can\u2019t think of one nice thing to say about Catherine, and I\u2019ve already figured out how I\u2019m going to spend some of her money.\u201d</p><p>Her father pushed the thick family album with a black-and-red-checked cover toward Theo. Theo opened it and began to look at the photos while Jake pointed out who was who. Michelle excused herself to get a Diet Coke and carried one back to the table for Theo. He\u2019d put his glasses on and looked quite scholarly.</p><p>Putting her hand on his shoulder, she asked, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d he answered as he turned another page.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Theo doesn\u2019t want to look at our family photos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>She reached over Theo\u2019s shoulder, put her can of Diet Coke on a coaster next to Theo\u2019s, then straightened and turned to her brother. \u201cJohn Paul, fix Theo and me something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s gonna happen,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>She walked over to the sofa and sat down on his stomach. He knew what she was going to do and braced himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sleeping,\u201d he snapped. \u201cLeave me the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his grumbling and pulled on his hair as she leaned back against the cushions. \u201cCan you believe Catherine left us so much money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He sighed loudly, then did as she asked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you think of anything nice to say about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I can. She was a selfish, obsessive, compulsive, greedy \u2014\u201d</p><p>Michelle pinched him. \u201cSay something nice about her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead. That\u2019s kind of nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame on you. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. You\u2019re always hungry. Come help me.\u201d</p> <p>He grabbed her arm when she tried to stand. \u201cWhen is Theo leaving?\u201d</p><p>The question came out of nowhere, catching her off guard. \u201cMonday,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe leaves with his friend, Noah, Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>Even she could hear the sadness in her voice. She didn\u2019t try to be cavalier or pretend she didn\u2019t care, because she couldn\u2019t fool her brother. John Paul knew her better than anyone in the whole world, and he had always been able to see through her defenses. She never lied or played games with him.</p><p>\u201cYou were stupid,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have allowed yourself to become so vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you protect yourself? He\u2019s an outsider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see it coming. What can I say? It just . . . happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo are you gonna fall apart when he leaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. Then she said it again more forcefully. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Theo wasn\u2019t paying any attention to Michelle or John Paul. He had just turned a page in the album and was looking at a faded photo of a beautiful young woman. She was posed standing under a tree, holding a bouquet of daisies in her hand. The woman wore an ankle-length, light-colored organza dress with a ribbon streaming down from her waist. Her short, curly hair framed an angelic face. The photo was black-and-white, but Theo guessed her hair was red and her eyes were blue. If the clothes and the haircut had been more contemporary, he would have thought he was looking at Michelle.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my Ellie,\u201d Jake said. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look at my three, and I see Ellie in all of them. Remy got her laugh, John Paul got her love of the outdoors, and Michelle got her heart.\u201d</p><p>Theo nodded. John Paul was following Michelle into the kitchen, but when he heard his father mention his mother, he paused to look over Theo\u2019s shoulder. Then Theo turned the page, and John Paul moved on. There was a photo of Remy and John Paul when they were little boys and a girl standing between them. The boys looked as though they\u2019d been rolling around in mud and were happy about it. Their grins were ornery. The girl wasn\u2019t smiling and had outgrown the dress she was wearing.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Catherine,\u201d Jake told him. \u201cShe always had to wear a dress, no matter what the occasion. That one was one of her favorites because it had lace on it. I remember she would nag her mama to stitch this or that seam back together. Catherine had a healthy appetite.\u201d</p><p>Theo kept turning the pages. Catherine\u2019s mother must have sent photos after she\u2019d moved, because there were at least twenty of her daughter. In each photo the girl was wearing a dress, but the quality had improved. In one, the child stood in front of a Christmas tree holding two identical dolls in her arms. He turned another page and saw Catherine in a different dress holding two stuffed bears.</p><p>Jake chuckled when he saw the photo. \u201cCatherine always had to have two of everything,\u201d he explained. \u201cSome folks, once they\u2019ve been poor, when they come into money, no matter how young or old they are, well, they just can\u2019t have enough. Do you know what I\u2019m talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Theo answered. \u201cPeople who lived through the Depression were always storing up for the next one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Catherine was just like that. The Depression was just a history lesson to her, but she acted like she\u2019d lived through one. She was worried she\u2019d run out, I suppose, so if she liked a doll or a bear, she made her mama buy her another one just like it in case something happened to the first one. She did the same thing with clothes. Once Junie had money to spend, she made sure her daughter had the finest of everything and she catered to her every whim. Ellie thought Junie was spoiling her out of guilt because she wasn\u2019t married when she had her.</p><p>\u201cI thought she\u2019d outgrow the need to hoard things, but she didn\u2019t. Come to find out, it got worse. She started doing some mighty strange things. She even put in a second phone line. When I asked her why, she said it was in case the first line broke. Said she didn\u2019t want to have to wait on the phone repair people.\u201d</p><p>Michelle interrupted when she came back to the table. \u201cJohn Paul\u2019s warming up the gumbo,\u201d she said.</p><p>Theo was turning the pages back and forth. He looked at the photo of Catherine dressed in an obvious hand-me-down that was too small for her growing body, then flipped back to the photo of Catherine dressed like a princess, clutching the two identical dolls.</p><p>\u201cThe poor thing started putting on the weight after she married,\u201d Jake remarked.</p><p>\u201cHow would you know that?\u201d Michelle asked. \u201cShe never let you come and see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer housekeeper told me,\u201d he said. \u201cRosa Vincetti and I would chat every now and again when she answered the phone. She\u2019s a real nice woman. Very timid, but sweet as can be. She gave me a recipe for homemade pasta, but I haven\u2019t tried it out yet. She also told me she was getting alarmed by Catherine\u2019s weight. Worried her heart would blow up on her, she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatherine was \u2014\u201d Michelle began.</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d John Paul shouted from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d Michelle countered.</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019m normal compared to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, how did you find out we were getting money?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t believe me?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still not convinced, though, are you?\u201d Jake pushed the chair back and stood. \u201cI got a certified letter to prove it. It came about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>Jake went to the kitchen counter, lifted the lid on the elephant-shaped cookie jar where he kept all his important papers, and pulled out the envelope.</p><p>Michelle was sitting next to Theo now, looking through the album. There was a photo of her mother holding a baby in her lap. With the tip of her finger, she touched her mother\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Remy when he was a baby.\u201d</p><p>Two pages later, he was looking at photos of Michelle and laughing. In every photo there was something sticking up or out. Her hair, her shirt, her tongue.</p><p>\u201cI was adorable, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDefinitely adorable.\u201d</p><p>Jake dropped the envelope in front of Michelle. \u201cHere\u2019s your proof, Dr. Smarty-pants.\u201d</p><p>Michelle just shook her head and smiled. \u201cDaddy has lots of cute nicknames for me.\u201d</p><p>Theo was laughing when he glanced over and saw the name of the law firm in the upper left-hand corner of the envelope. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he repeated and slapped the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe connection. It\u2019s the same law firm. Son of a . . .\u201d Turning, he grabbed the letter out of Jake\u2019s hand. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t explained . . .\u201d Michelle started.</p><p>Theo put his hand on hers. \u201cIn a minute. Okay? Where are my glasses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Man, it\u2019s falling into place.\u201d</p><p>Jake and Michelle both stared at him while he read the letter. When he finished, he pushed his chair back and stood. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go to New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>Michelle picked up the letter and quickly read it. According to Catherine\u2019s instructions, her attorney, Phillip Benchley, was hereby informing each of the beneficiaries of the total sum of the estate and the amount of each bequest. The Renard family was to receive four hundred thousand dollars to be divided equally among Jake and his three children. Rosa Maria Vincetti would receive one hundred fifty thousand dollars for her years of loyal service to Catherine. John Russell, Catherine\u2019s husband, would receive one hundred dollars, and the remainder of the vast estate would be given to the Epston bird sanctuary.</p><p>\u201cHer husband gets only a hundred dollars?\u201d she asked, astonished.</p><p>\u201cThey might not have had a happy marriage,\u201d Jake remarked.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d John Paul offered from the kitchen door.</p><p>\u201cRosa sure didn\u2019t like him,\u201d Jake added. \u201cI think it\u2019s nice that Catherine didn\u2019t forget to leave her housekeeper something. She took good care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn must have signed a prenuptial agreement for Catherine to control her own money,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll still try to contest it,\u201d Theo said. \u201cWhat does the man do for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a lawyer,\u201d Jake told him. \u201cHe works for one of the big banks in New Orleans. I\u2019ve never actually talked to the man, and I think that\u2019s a crying shame. Mike and I didn\u2019t even get a chance to speak to him at the funeral, did we, sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Daddy, we didn\u2019t. But that was my fault. I had to get back to the hospital, and you had to drive me.\u201d</p><p>Theo\u2019s cell phone rang and interrupted the conversation. Noah was on the line.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cI just reached St. Claire,\u201d Noah answered.</p><p>\u201cDrive to Jake\u2019s house. Do you know the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d Theo walked through the kitchen and onto the screened porch. He pulled the door shut behind him.</p><p>Michelle assumed he wanted privacy and decided to set the table. John Paul was leaning against the counter, glaring at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she asked as she opened the drawer and got out the place mats.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna let another FBI agent inside this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t give me attitude, John Paul. I\u2019m not in the mood. You\u2019re going to be polite to Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so. Daddy? John Paul . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to go any further. Her brother shook his head in exasperation and then smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re still telling on me, aren\u2019t you, brat?\u201d</p><p>She smiled back. \u201cIt still works, doesn\u2019t it? Thank you, John Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. You\u2019re going to try to remember how to be nice.\u201d</p><p>She went back to the table and put the place mats down. Weary, she sat down and propped her head on her hands. She kept thinking about the hundred thousand dollars, and her guilt was intensifying. Why would such a mean-spirited woman do such a kind thing? And what else had Catherine sent her that was of such interest to the police and the men who would kill to get hold of it?</p><p>Daddy was sitting next to her, going through the album again.</p><p>\u201cPoor Catherine,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have many friends.</p><p>At the funeral . . . there weren\u2019t many people. The only person who shed a tear was her housekeeper. Remember, Daddy? She was crying for Catherine, but no one else was. I feel bad about that.\u201d</p><p>She was remembering the pitiful little procession walking through the cemetery. Rosa was carrying rosary beads and crying. John walked behind the priest and kept glancing back at Daddy and her. Since neither one of them had ever met the man, she assumed he was wondering who they were. Another man looked back too. He was walking beside John, and he . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, that\u2019s the man . . . that was him,\u201d she cried out as she jumped up. In her excitement to tell Theo what she had remembered, she\u2019d knocked the chair over. She impatiently picked it up, then ran through the kitchen. Theo was coming inside. He ended the phone call as she ran into him. Grabbing her, he stepped back onto the porch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember where I saw that man before . . . remember, I told you he looked familiar? It\u2019s the same guy.\u201d Her words were tripping over each other.</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d he said, \u201cand start over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe delivery man who talked to me at the stadium. I told you he looked familiar, and I thought I must have run into him at the hospital, but that wasn\u2019t it. He was at Catherine\u2019s funeral. He was talking with John, and he walked beside him at the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>Daddy hadn\u2019t heard the conversation. He also was thinking about Catherine\u2019s generosity and thinking that Ellie was smiling now because her niece had done such a nice thing for her family. She\u2019d always worried about the selfish streak in Catherine, but now Catherine had redeemed herself.</p><p>He heard Michelle mention John\u2019s name and called out, \u201cI\u2019m thinking I ought to get on the phone and ring up Catherine\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy, don\u2019t do that,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Theo ordered sharply at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Daddy asked. He turned in his chair and looked at Theo. \u201cI ought to tell him thank you for the money. It\u2019s the right thing to do. He was Catherine\u2019s husband, and he had to approve it.\u201d</p><p>Michelle was shaking her head as Theo was walking toward her father. \u201cSir, I don\u2019t want you to call him. Promise me you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a reason, then,\u201d Daddy said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll promise. Make it a good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Theo said. His voice was calm as he continued, \u201cHe tried to kill your daughter.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p><p>Daddy took the news much better than John Paul did. Michelle\u2019s brother wanted to get in the pickup, hunt down the bastard, and blow his head off. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to listen to reason, and he didn\u2019t give a hoot about the law.</p><p>\u201cIf you know he\u2019s the man behind this, then take him out before he has another chance to kill her,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Theo wasn\u2019t fazed by John Paul\u2019s fury. \u201cI can\u2019t prove it yet. It\u2019s all circumstantial,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhich is why I have to go to New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>John Paul looked as if he wanted to hit Theo. Michelle got between the two men and tried to make her brother calm down.</p><p>The doorbell rang, interrupting the argument. While Daddy went to let Noah in, Theo said, \u201cWe hang tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt means you can\u2019t shoot anyone.\u201d</p><p>Theo turned to Michelle. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t leave The Swan until I get back. No ifs or buts about it. I don\u2019t want to be worrying about you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. She patted his chest and stepped closer. \u201cYou be careful too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s any trouble, you do what Noah tells you to do. John Paul, you watch your father\u2019s back. Got that?\u201d</p> <p>Her brother stopped arguing and gave an abrupt nod. Noah was standing by the front door talking to Daddy. The FBI agent hadn\u2019t bothered to shave and looked scruffy in torn jeans and a faded blue shirt. She went to greet him. She could certainly understand Mary Ann\u2019s interest. There was an element of danger about the man that made women want to run from him and try to rehabilitate him at the same time.</p><p>Those blue eyes penetrated as he said, \u201cI heard you had a busy night dodging bullets.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cI heard you had a busy night too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. Your friend told me to tell you \u2018hey.\u2019 I think that means \u2018hi,\u2019\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cI sure didn\u2019t have much fun this morning, though. You\u2019d figure a man on vacation should be able to sleep in. \u201cWhere\u2019s Theo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHe is on the porch with John Paul. Through the kitchen,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Noah headed that way, but she stopped him when she said, \u201cWill you please do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut up with my brother.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cI can get along with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to bet?\u201d</p><p>It was too bad she hadn\u2019t wagered money because she would have won. Less than three minutes had passed when the shouting started. Her brother was doing most of the yelling, but Noah was keeping up.</p> <p>Theo came into the kitchen with Noah\u2019s car keys. Michelle winced when she heard her brother call Noah a grossly obscene name.</p><p>Theo heard it too. Grinning, he said, \u201cI knew they\u2019d get along.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou call that getting along?\u201d \u201c</p><p>You don\u2019t hear any gunshots, do you? Noah likes your brother.\u201d</p><p>Then she heard her brother threaten Noah. His vocabulary was not only colorful, but creative. After that, Noah threatened John Paul in his own rather colorful and creative way. His threat would ensure John Paul would never father children.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can tell he likes him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of them have a great deal in common. What\u2019d I do with my glasses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re on the table. Exactly what could they have in common?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re both mean as snakes,\u201d he said as he picked up the glasses and folded them.</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s not mean. He smiles all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what makes him more dangerous. You don\u2019t see it coming until it\u2019s too late. Some of the stories I\u2019ve heard about him from my brother are chilling, which is why Noah\u2019s going to be watching out for you.\u201d</p><p>He draped his arm around her shoulders and pulled her along to the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told me why you need to go to New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check out some things,\u201d he said, which really wasn\u2019t an answer to her question.</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her. It was a quick brush of his mouth against hers, and it was thoroughly unsatisfying in her opinion. He must have thought so, because after he let go of her and opened the door, he roughly pulled her into his arms and kissed her again. This one was vastly different.</p><p>Smiling, he pulled the door closed behind him. Michelle stood by the window watching until Theo had driven away. He had John Paul on his guard looking out for Daddy, and Noah was supposed to babysit her. Who was going to watch out for Theo? She shook her head. No worry, she told herself. Detective Harris would make the arrests any minute now.</p><p>What more could happen?</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p><p>The Sowing Club had gathered in John\u2019s motel room in St. Claire.</p><p>John was going through the papers, making certain the entire printout was there, while Dallas, Cameron, and Preston silently waited. He finally finished, looked up, and laughed.</p><p>\u201cThe bitch even included a copy of the letter she wrote to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still making a protest,\u201d Preston said. \u201cThe way we got those papers back was too risky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that matter now? We\u2019re in the clear.\u201d</p><p>Dallas disagreed. \u201cNot until we\u2019ve gotten rid of Buchanan and the doctor. And we\u2019ve got to do it tonight, thanks to yet another one of Cameron\u2019s screwups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I panicked. Okay? I saw Buchanan looking out the window, and I thought I could get him, so I shot at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had decided to go in easy,\u201d Preston reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI was desperate to get him . . . for the good of the club,\u201d Cameron stammered. \u201cBesides, Buchanan doesn\u2019t know I shot at him, and it stands to reason that he would assume someone\u2019s after him. Dallas, you did the background check. You\u2019re the one who told us the guy has gotten death threats.\u201d</p><p>Preston nodded. \u201cNo time to waste. We have to kill them tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if the doctor has remembered where she\u2019s seen Cameron,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>None of them looked at Cameron as they thought about that.</p><p>\u201cI told you I was sick of waiting,\u201d Cameron said.</p><p>\u201cYou had no right . . .\u201d Preston began.</p><p>John put his hand up. \u201cLet it go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s done and Cameron regrets his mistakes. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what he said but how he said it, with such feigned kindness, that made Cameron see what was happening.</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2019s right,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cCameron has been our friend for too many years to let a couple of mistakes ruin anything. Forgive and forget. Right, Preston?\u201d</p><p>Preston smiled. \u201cYeah, okay. Want a drink, Cam?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He could feel the bile rising in his throat. \u201cI should pack up and head back to New Orleans . . . unless you\u2019ve changed your mind, John, and want me to stay and help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuchanan and the doctor. You\u2019re going to go after them tonight, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d John said. \u201cBut both of them have seen your face, so you can\u2019t stay around. We\u2019ve gone over this, Cameron. Go home and wait. I\u2019ll call you after it\u2019s finished, and we\u2019ll go out and celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor saw you at the funeral too. How come you\u2019re staying here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo coordinate,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cameron stood. \u201cWhere\u2019s Monk?\u201d he asked, squelching the mounting fear inside him.</p><p>\u201cOut buying some equipment. Why do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>Cameron shrugged. \u201cIs he going to help you get Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dallas answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the FBI agent, the man named Clayborne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us worry about him,\u201d John said smoothly. \u201cYou better get going now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>Cameron went outside and pulled the door closed. Because he thought one of them might be watching him through the crack in the drapes, he strolled to the corner as though he wasn\u2019t in any particular hurry. He turned toward his room and then started running. When he reached the door, he pulled out his gun, cocked it, and rushed inside.</p><p>He half expected to find Monk waiting for him, but the room was empty. He gagged, so great was his relief. He threw his clothes into his overnight bag, grabbed his car keys, and ran to his car. Desperate to get away, he slammed his foot down on the accelerator. The car fishtailed out of the parking lot.</p><p>John had told him to go home and wait. That\u2019s where it was going to happen, he decided. Would his dear friends come after him, or would they send Monk to kill him? Either way, Cameron knew he was a dead man. He pulled onto the highway, checking the rearview mirror every other second to make sure he wasn\u2019t being followed by Monk now. There were no cars behind him. Cameron finally allowed himself to exhale, letting out a long, loud breath. His hands were clammy and shaking. He struggled to hold them steady on the steering wheel, and then he began to cry.</p><p>He had to go to his apartment because he had money stashed under one of the floorboards, and he would need it when he left town. He had time, he told himself. They would need Monk to help them with Buchanan. Yes, he had time.</p><p>Cameron was quivering so badly now he knew the only thing that would calm him down and help him think was a drink. He pulled off the highway at the next exit and started looking for a bar.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</p><p>Phillip Benchley was not a happy camper. The attorney had just stepped onto the first tee of the back nine at the prestigious New Orleans Country Club when he was summoned to the clubhouse to meet with an attorney from the U.S. Department of Justice.</p><p>Impatient but polite, he announced, \u201cMy friends are waiting,\u201d as he walked into the locker room and sat down on a bench to retie his black-and-white saddle golf shoes. \u201cI would appreciate it if you would make this quick.\u201d</p><p>Theo introduced himself. The second Benchley heard that the case he wanted to discuss involved John Russell, his manner improved and he actually smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re investigating John Russell? Oh, I\u2019d love it if you could get that prick. The sheer arrogance of the man is unbelievable. When Catherine Russell called me and asked me to change her will, it took all I had not to cheer. She never should have married that man. Never,\u201d he repeated. \u201cNow, tell me, what can I do to help you nail him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told FBI agent Noah Clayborne that you sent Dr. Michelle Renard a package from Catherine. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>Benchley nodded. \u201cYes, I did, but, as I explained to him, if you\u2019re wanting to know what was inside, you\u2019ll have to ask the doctor. Catherine gave me a sealed envelope and instructed me not to open it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe envelope was taken away before Michelle could look at it,\u201d he said. \u201cCatherine didn\u2019t give you any hint of what was inside? Anything about a financial statement or an audit? Anything at all?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll tell you this. Whatever it was must have been explosive, because Catherine assured me that once John knew about it, he wouldn\u2019t dare contest the will. She was very sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe signed a prenup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did, but John\u2019s an attorney and he\u2019s smart. He wouldn\u2019t have let that much money slip through his fingers. He would have taken it to court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you waited six weeks from the time of her death to read the will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been doing your research. Again, I was following Catherine\u2019s instructions.\u201d He smiled as he added, \u201cShe was a bit vindictive, and she told me to wait so that John\u2019s bills would pile up. He lived the high life, was indiscreet, and used her trust money to buy his mistresses presents. When Catherine found out about his adultery, she called me and told me she was changing the will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you attend the funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to the mass,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t go to the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichelle said there was only a handful of mourners. Did you know any of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew the housekeeper, Rosa Vincetti. I met her when I came to the house to discuss the changes in the will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about John\u2019s coworkers or friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of men and women from the trust department where he works were there. I talked to one man, and he introduced me to the others, but I don\u2019t remember their names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about John\u2019s friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember there was a woman standing in the back of the church. She told me she was Catherine\u2019s interior designer but that she had also redecorated John\u2019s office. As I was leaving the church, she chased me and handed me one of her cards. I thought that was most inappropriate, and as soon as I got back to the office, I threw the card away. The only other person I remember seeing was Cameron Lynch. He\u2019s a close friend of John\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a stockbroker,\u201d Benchley said. \u201cA very successful broker,\u201d he stressed. \u201cI had heard of him, but I\u2019d never met him until the day of the funeral. I remember thinking that he was an alcoholic. It wasn\u2019t a charitable thought, granted, but he smelled like booze, and his eyes were bloodshot. I\u2019m certain he was hungover. He also had that look about him \u2014 you know what I mean, the gray skin, red nose, puffy eyes, indicating he had been a heavy drinker for some time. Cameron stayed close to John and sat in the pew with him like he was family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid John speak to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? He looked right through me, and I must say, I did get a chuckle out of that. The man despises me, and that couldn\u2019t make me happier.\u201d</p><p>heo was almost finished. He asked a couple more questions, then thanked Benchley for his help and left. The attorney had thoughtfully called his secretary and gotten the addresses Theo needed.</p><p>He had at least two more stops before he could head back to Bowen.</p><p>Theo needed to make sure Cameron Lynch was the man Michelle and he had seen the night before. He drove to the brokerage firm and went into the lobby. He had already come up with a good lie to tell the receptionist so she would find a photo for him, but that wasn\u2019t necessary. As soon as he walked through the doors, he saw a eight-by-ten color photo of Cameron Lynch on the wall. Theo came to a dead stop. There was a grouping displaying all the brokers in the firm. Cameron was in the middle. Theo glanced at the receptionist. She was talking into her headset but smiling at him. Theo smiled back. Then he lifted the photo off the wall, turned around, and walked out.</p><p>He needed help with the next stop. He called Captain Welles, the man who had introduced him at the awards ceremony, and asked him for assistance. Then he drove to Cameron Lynch\u2019s apartment, located in a sleazy neighborhood adjacent to the newly refurbished warehouse district. He parked his car down the street and waited for two detectives from the captain\u2019s precinct to arrive.</p><p>The two men pulled up behind him fifteen minutes later. Detective Underwood, the senior of the two, shook Theo\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cThe captain told us you\u2019re the man who got The Count. It\u2019s an honor to meet you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then Detective Basham stepped forward. \u201cI heard your speech at the banquet.\u201d</p><p>Theo had removed the photo from the frame. He handed it to Underwood and said, \u201cThis is the man I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe captain said we\u2019re taking Cameron Lynch in for attempted murder and that you\u2019ve got a witness,\u201d Basham said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m one of the witnesses. Lynch tried to kill a friend of mine and me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe did a sweep of the neighborhood, and his car isn\u2019t here,\u201d Underwood said.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you want us to do this?\u201d Basham asked. \u201cCaptain said you had special instructions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssume he\u2019s armed and dangerous,\u201d Theo said. \u201cWhen you cuff him, read him his rights and take him in, but don\u2019t book him yet. I want him locked in an interrogation room so I can talk to him. I don\u2019t want his name in the computer, not yet anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stake out the place. You want to wait with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got another stop to make, but as soon as you have him, call me on my cell phone or at a bar in Bowen named The Swan. Hopefully, you won\u2019t have to wait long. I think he\u2019s on his way home.\u201d</p> <p>It seemed logical. Lynch wouldn\u2019t want to stay in Bowen, not after he\u2019d been spotted, and he wouldn\u2019t know that Theo had made the connection. Theo wrote down his number and handed it to the detective, then reiterated that he wanted to be called, no matter what time, the second they had Lynch.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, we\u2019ll call,\u201d Basham promised.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Theo said as the two men walked away. He picked up his notepad, flipped through the pages until he found what he was looking for, and then asked if either one of them could give him directions to the address Benchley had given him.</p><p>Underwood told him the quickest route to take and then remarked, \u201cThat\u2019s a bad-ass neighborhood. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>Theo drove through the heart of New Orleans, slowly negotiating his way through the narrow streets. He was sure he\u2019d gotten lost, but once he turned the car around, he spotted the street he was looking for. Two blocks later he found the address. He parked the car, then picked up his phone and called Noah.</p><p>\u201cFind out anything?\u201d Noah asked.</p> <p>Theo told him about Cameron Lynch. \u201cAsk Ben Nelson to look for a \u201992 blue Ford Taurus.\u201d He gave him the license number and told him to tell Ben that if he found the car, to proceed with extreme caution.</p><p>\u201cYou think he can handle it?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Theo answered. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing. Just make sure he knows Lynch is one of the shooters. I want that bastard locked up and isolated until I can interrogate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that Lynch is still hanging around Bowen. He\u2019s got to know you can ID him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s there either,\u201d Theo said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he\u2019s on his way home. What\u2019s Michelle doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a funny woman,\u201d he said. \u201cShe fell asleep sitting at the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a long night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you,\u201d Noah pointed out. \u201cAnyway, she\u2019s getting ready to go to The Swan with Jake and me . . . and his laugh-a-minute son. Have you heard from Detective Harris yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t, and I\u2019ve left her three messages. The first two were sort of polite, the third wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I was in New Orleans this morning, I went over to her precinct like you asked,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI talked to her captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get a copy of the file on Monk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe captain told me Harris was out on an investigation. He wouldn\u2019t give me any indication of where she might be. He made it clear he didn\u2019t want me interfering. The twelve hours will be up soon. When are you heading back to Bowen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got one more stop, and then I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d Noah said. \u201cMichelle\u2019s calling me.\u201d</p><p>Theo grabbed his notepad and glasses and stared at the tiny ranch house in front of him. The little patch of yard was meticulously cared for with flowers lining either side of the sidewalk leading up to the door. The house needed paint, and the wood around the windows was rotten. Termites, he thought as he walked to the door. The fact that the yard was well-tended and the house ignored suggested to him that the occupant took care of what she could afford.</p><p>He rang the bell and waited. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the curtain move in the front window. He rang the bell again.</p><p>A woman called out through the door. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Rosa Vincetti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you police?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m a friend of Jake Renard.\u201d</p><p>The woman opened the door a crack with the security chain in place. \u201cI\u2019m Rosa,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>She was obviously frightened. He should have taken the time to shave. \u201cJake Renard told me that he often talked to you on the phone when he called Catherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cMr. Renard loved Catherine.\u201d</p><p>Theo couldn\u2019t see the woman\u2019s face. She was hiding behind the door. There was a light flickering behind her. He thought it might be a candle burning.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t with the police?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m an attorney,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Rosa shut the door, slipped the chain back, and then opened it again. She stepped back so Theo could come inside. Theo stayed on the porch. Concerned she would panic when she saw his gun, he explained quickly why he had to carry the weapon. And when he finished, he once again assured her he wasn\u2019t a policeman, and he hadn\u2019t driven to her house to cause her any trouble.</p><p>Rosa was a surprise. She was much younger than he\u2019d expected, around fifty he judged, and almost as tall as he was. Streaks of gray highlighted her dark hair. Heavy brows framed midnight black eyes. There were tears in those eyes now as she once again motioned for him to come inside.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Theo Buchanan,\u201d he said as he walked into her living room.</p><p>She was already nodding. \u201cI know who you are. I prayed to God, and He sent you to me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to say to that, and so he simply nodded. \u201cPlease sit,\u201d she said and pointed to a gray brocade sofa, \u201cand tell me why you have come here.\u201d</p><p>Theo waited until she had taken her seat across from him. An oval glass table was between them. Theo leaned forward with his arms on his knees and told Rosa how he had met Michelle Renard. He was trying to put her at ease and help her understand his relationship to the Renard family. Rosa listened intently.</p><p>She obviously was a deeply religious woman. Signs of her faith adorned every surface in her home. Against the wall behind her was a long sofa table that had been converted into an altar with a lace runner on top. At one end, two votive candles burned, and at the other end was a framed picture of the Blessed Mother. Black rosary beads were draped over the frame.</p><p>Theo explained what had happened the night before and how he and Michelle had been ambushed. \u201cCatherine sent Michelle a package,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>He kept his excitement hidden. His guess had been right.</p><p>\u201cI believe the men who came after Michelle and me were trying to get that package,\u201d he said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t successful,\u201d he added. \u201cThe police have it now.\u201d</p><p>Rosa stiffened. \u201cDid you have a chance to read the papers?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m sure that John Russell is behind this, and I want to get him. To do that, I\u2019m going to need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an evil man,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe will go to hell when he dies. He killed her, you know.\u201d</p><p>She said it almost casually, as though the startling news had been in the papers for weeks.</p><p>\u201cHe killed Catherine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. I don\u2019t have any proof,\u201d she hastened to add. \u201cBut in my heart I know he did it. The ambulance people who came to the house . . . one of them told me she choked to death on caramels.\u201d She was shaking her head. \u201cI knew the truth then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t eat caramels. She had a loose bridge and she constantly fretted that it would break. She would never leave the house to go to a dentist, so she was extremely careful. Mr. Russell brought her a box of chocolates every night, and then he left to be with his whores, but Catherine only ate the soft candies. She never would have touched a caramel.\u201d</p><p>She made the sign of the cross and folded her hands as though in prayer. \u201cYou must find proof and arrest John Russell. It would be a sin to let such an evil man get away with murder. You must do this for Catherine and me.\u201d</p><p>Theo nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to try,\u201d he promised. \u201cCatherine found out about John\u2019s affairs, didn\u2019t she? That was the reason she left him only a hundred dollars in her will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she heard him on the phone. He called her terrible names when he was talking to his mistress. She cried for days,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd then one night she heard him talking to a man about a deposit he had made in an account outside of the United States. She heard him tell the man not to worry, that no one would know because all the records were in his computer at home.\u201d</p><p>Theo began to make notes as Rosa fed him the information she\u2019d been given by Catherine.</p><p>\u201cHow did she break into his files? How did she come up with the right password?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn gave it to her,\u201d Rosa said. \u201cOf course, he didn\u2019t know it at the time. She listened to his phone conversations, and twice she heard him refer to the Sowing Club. The next day, after he had gone to work and I had sent the maid to the grocery store, I helped her go down to the library. She typed in the words but was denied access. The spelling, you see, was incorrect. Catherine was a very smart woman,\u201d she added. \u201cThe second time she typed in the correct spelling, and the files opened up to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s sowing, as in sowing wild oats, instead of sewing, as in stitching clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Catherine told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you what was in those files?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said her husband was doing illegal things with money.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his jaw. \u201cWhy did she instruct her attorney to wait until after her death to send copies of the files? Why didn\u2019t she just have John arrested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me understand,\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cCatherine had many fine qualities, but she was also a very controlling woman. She wanted things done just so, and she wanted her husband to respect his marriage vows.\u201d She shook her head as she added, \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t let him go, but after she died, she wouldn\u2019t let any other woman have him. She was going to use the papers she\u2019d given Mr. Benchley to make him . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cToe the line?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you meet any of John\u2019s friends?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe never invited anyone to the house. I think he was keeping Catherine isolated. He was ashamed of her, but even after she took to her bed and stayed in her room, he still didn\u2019t have friends to the house.\u201d</p><p>Theo closed his notepad. \u201cMay I ask you a personal question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so afraid of the police?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her hands. \u201cMy son got into trouble last year. The police . . . they came to the house in the middle of the night and dragged him out of his bed. He was taken to jail, and I was very afraid for him. Catherine called her attorney, and he gave her the name of someone else who could help my boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA criminal attorney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d she said. \u201cMy son is out on probation now, but every night when he doesn\u2019t come home, I think he\u2019s been taken away again. He runs with bad people, and I pray to God every night that He will look out for him. He\u2019s a good boy,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut he\u2019s a follower and does whatever those bad people tell him to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of trouble did he get into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs,\u201d she said, and then she crossed herself again. \u201cHe was taking money from people and giving them drugs. He\u2019s stopped that,\u201d she hastened to add. \u201cHe promised me and he stopped.\u201d</p><p>Theo nodded. \u201cI understand,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make things more difficult for you, but there\u2019s something I need, Rosa . . . and you have it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</p><p>God love Catherine Russell and her obsession with having two of everything. Theo had banked on her compulsion when he\u2019d gone to see Rosa. Catherine hadn\u2019t let him down. She had indeed made another copy of the files and given them to Rosa for safekeeping.</p><p>Theo hadn\u2019t expected to hear that Rosa believed John had killed his wife, but then he realized he shouldn\u2019t have been surprised at all. The man was capable of anything.</p><p>The copies of all the papers Catherine had sent to Michelle were on the seat beside him. Theo knew he\u2019d need a couple of hours to break the codes. He hadn\u2019t done more than glance through them when he was with Rosa, but he understood enough to know he could nail the son of a bitch for tax evasion, extortion, fraud, insider trading, and more. Detective Harris had told Michelle that the sheet she\u2019d pulled from the envelope looked like a financial statement, and she had been right about that. The other papers were filled with the breakdown of each transaction. All of them, Theo was sure, were illegal, and as he drove toward Bowen, he added up all the charges he could file. There was enough to put Russell behind bars for the rest of his life. Theo was going to add the charge of attempted murder \u2014 he was certain John was one of the shooters the night before \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t prove it . . . yet. He also wanted justice for Catherine, and he needed time to figure out how to get the evidence he would need to prove the woman had been murdered.</p><p>Had John killed her, or had he hired it out? Was that why Detective Harris was in Bowen? She\u2019d told Theo she had an inside tip that a hit man was in town. Had Monk killed Catherine, and was he now helping John get incriminating evidence back?</p><p>Where the hell was Cameron Lynch? Underwood had promised to call him the second they picked up Lynch. He was the key, Theo had decided. If he could turn him, he could get all of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He thought about the transactions listed in the papers again. There was a letter in brackets beside each entry, indicating the person responsible for that contribution. There was a C, most likely Cameron Lynch. J was for John Russell, but who were P and D? The Sowing Club. What a cute name for their crooked little group. Four men who had illegally accumulated millions of dollars.</p><p>\u201cTwo down and two to go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Then he laughed. Catherine had also made a copy of the letter she\u2019d written to John, and Theo pictured how her husband must have reacted when he read the letter and found out what she had done.</p><p>Oh, Catherine. You were such a devious woman.</p> <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</p><p>The Swan was packed. The crowd, mostly fishermen, was so dense and loud, Michelle could feel the floor trembling under her feet. She and Noah worked behind the bar, filling drink orders. Noah made the job easy. No matter what alcoholic beverage anyone ordered, he served a draft of beer. The only other choice he allowed was a soft drink.</p><p>John Paul managed crowd control and bussed tables from the supper traffic, while Daddy sat at the end of the bar by the kitchen door with his Big Chief tablet and a ballpoint pen. He\u2019d cleaned out an old metal tackle box and was using it as his safe for the tournament money so it wouldn\u2019t get mixed up with the cash taken in at the bar. All the latecomers who wanted to sign up for the tournament formed a line that reached to the parking lot. Each man paid his fee in cash \u2014 Daddy wouldn\u2019t take checks or credit cards \u2014 signed his name in the tablet, and was then given a ticket with a registration number on it. The fishermen would hand in the ticket at five o\u2019clock tomorrow morning and receive a tag. Anyone who tried to sneak out earlier to get a head start would automatically be disqualified by not receiving a tag.</p><p>There were quite a few outsiders from neighboring parishes. Preston and Monk easily blended in. Like at least half the crowd, they wore ball caps and jeans and guzzled beer while they stood by the jukebox, pretending to be waiting for an empty table.</p><p>They acted as though they were having a good old time. Preston struck up a conversation with three men nursing beers at a nearby table. He told them a fishing story about the big one that got away. Monk joined in by showing off a couple of lures he\u2019d purchased at the tackle shop down the road. He wore an oversized fisherman\u2019s vest to conceal his gun. Unlike Preston, he wasn\u2019t willing to go into the bar unarmed with an FBI agent less than twenty feet away.</p> <p>Preston was better at chitchat than Monk. They both laughed and drank, even flirted with a couple of available women who hit on them, but never did they let Michelle out of their line of sight while they waited for Theo Buchanan to walk through the door.</p><p>John, Dallas, and Preston had made the decision that it would be safer and easier if they hit both Michelle and Theo at the same time. The plan was to lure them outside, then take them at gunpoint into the swamp and kill them. Cameron was out of the picture. Monk had already been instructed to follow him back to New Orleans after he finished his job in Bowen. Although Monk usually decided the method, in this case Dallas explained that they would need a quick death certificate to withdraw their money from the Sowing account. Since everyone at his firm knew how distraught and depressed Cameron was over his pending divorce, Dallas thought Monk should use Cameron\u2019s gun to kill him and leave a suicide note behind.</p><p>Monk was no longer willing to work on credit. After all, the stakes were higher now. When John protested that there was no way they could get the money in cash so quickly, Monk decided to negotiate. He knew all about their dirty dealings and the money they had waiting for them, so instead of his fee, he offered to help them out this time for Cameron\u2019s cut of the funds. As far as John and Preston and Dallas were concerned, time was critical. They had to agree to his terms.</p><p>So where was Theo Buchanan? Had it not been three deep at the bar, Preston would have tried to strike up a conversation with Michelle or her father. He\u2019d ask her who her fishing partner was \u2014 he\u2019d seen Buchanan\u2019s name next to hers on the sign-up sheet \u2014 and then casually inquire where Buchanan was.</p><p>It was too loud and crowded to talk to her now. Preston would have to wait until the traffic thinned out a little. He figured that most of the fishermen would head home by ten because they had to be back at The Swan with their boats and fishing gear at five A.M. The tournament would officially begin at five-fifteen.</p><p>John and Dallas were in a rental car at a crossroad a half a mile away. They were waiting for Preston to call them. The longer they waited, the more anxious and trigger-happy they became. What the hell were Monk and Preston doing?</p> <p>John opened a bottle of water and took a drink. \u201cNo matter what, we do this tonight. I don\u2019t care who gets in the way. If we have to kill everyone in that bar, then, by God, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ve got the firepower, and I want this finished. Why hasn\u2019t Preston called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the cars in the lot. He\u2019s waiting for his opportunity,\u201d Dallas said.</p><p>At almost nine o\u2019clock, the bar was still teeming. The jukebox was blaring \u2014 Elvis was singing about his blue suede shoes \u2014 and the customers had to raise their voices to be heard over the music. Had Michelle not been at the end of the bar by the phone serving customers, she wouldn\u2019t have heard it ringing.</p><p>She put the receiver against one ear and held her hand over her other ear so she could hear the caller. She still had trouble understanding and walked into the storage room. Cherry Waterson was on the line, calling from the hospital. The woman was hysterical. Michelle couldn\u2019t make any sense out of what she was saying and finally demanded that she put a nurse on the line.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, after giving the nurse orders, Michelle hung up the phone and ran to Noah. \u201cWe have to go to the hospital now.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t need to hear the details. The look on Michelle\u2019s face told him it was serious. He dropped the bar towel, whistled, and motioned to John Paul. They followed Michelle into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d her brother asked.</p><p>\u201cI need your car keys,\u201d Noah said.</p> <p>\u201cJohn Patrick got in the way of a dart. It\u2019s imbedded in his chest,\u201d she blurted as she unlocked the back door and opened it. \u201cGotta go.\u201d</p><p>John Paul tossed Noah the keys.</p><p>Michelle grabbed Noah\u2019s phone and was calling radiology as she walked. Noah shouted to John Paul just as he closed the door, \u201cCall Theo. He\u2019s on his way here. Tell him where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>Preston had pushed his way through the throng and was now hovering close to Jake Renard, pretending to study the sign-up sheet tacked to the wall. He strained to hear every word as John Paul told his father what had happened. The second he heard that Michelle was on her way to the hospital and that John Paul was going to call Theo and tell him to meet Michelle there, Preston set his glass down on the bar and headed for the door.</p><p>Across the room, one of the old men was telling Monk a fishing story. He\u2019d invited Monk to join him and his friends at the table, but Monk stayed where he was so that he could watch the parking lot through the front window.</p><p>\u201cI sit all day at a computer,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat were you saying about that speckled trout?\u201d</p><p>The old man shook his head because Monk obviously hadn\u2019t been listening, and then once again launched into his story from the beginning. Monk nodded a couple of times so that he would appear interested. When he saw Noah and Michelle get into an old pickup, he immediately headed for the door. The old man shouted something to him, but Monk ignored him and kept going. His hand was in his vest pocket.</p><p>Out in the parking lot, Preston was walking to his car with his head down in case Michelle or the FBI agent happened to be looking back. Monk caught up with him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they going in such a hurry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the hospital,\u201d Preston answered. \u201cAnd Buchanan\u2019s on his way. If Clayborne drops the doctor off, then we can get Buchanan and her there. It shouldn\u2019t be crowded this time of night. Most surgeons operate early in the morning.\u201d</p><p>John changed the plan. When Preston called him and told him the news, he said, \u201cDallas and I will wait in the car in the hospital parking lot and grab Buchanan when he arrives. If he gets there ahead of us, Dallas will go in and lure him out. You and Monk go in and keep tabs on the doctor. When she\u2019s alone, you grab her and meet us like we planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that,\u201d Preston shouted. \u201cI heard her brother say she\u2019s going to operate on some kid. I think we should do her there. We\u2019ll get the FBI agent too if he hangs around.\u201d</p><p>John gritted his teeth. \u201cAre you out of your mind? Do you know how many people will be in there with her? For God\u2019s sake, use your head. We want to make this look like a professional hit on Buchanan, remember? And we want the police and the FBI to think the doctor got hit because she was with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Clayborne?\u201d</p><p>John considered the question for several seconds and then said, \u201cIf the agent gets in the way, you\u2019re going to have to kill him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, if anyone could hear us . . .\u201d Dallas raged.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d John snarled. Then he continued his conversation with Preston. \u201cWhat kind of car is the doctor driving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old red pickup truck.\u201d</p><p>John punched the end button and dropped the phone in his lap as Dallas muttered, \u201cSlow down. The hospital is right around the corner.\u201d</p><p>He realized he was speeding and slowed the rental car. \u201cWhat was Preston arguing with you about?\u201d Dallas asked.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to go in shooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did this get so screwed up? You\u2019re talking about killing two, maybe three people, and I\u2019m going along with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell we don\u2019t. We could pack our bags and fly to the Caymans. We could get the money now, split it three ways, and then disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to have Cameron\u2019s death certificate to get the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonk could get it to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re feeling guilty about killing strangers, but you aren\u2019t having any trouble with killing Cameron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe became a dangerous liability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d John said. \u201cAnd so have Buchanan and his friends. Let\u2019s finish this tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should call the whole thing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d John shouted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s out of control,\u201d Dallas shouted back. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all your fault, you bastard.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s hand gripped his gun. He had the nearly overwhelming urge to put the barrel against Dallas\u2019s temple and pull the trigger. He took a deep breath instead.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare fall apart on me,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, there\u2019s Preston\u2019s car. He and Monk must already be inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe parking lot\u2019s almost empty. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>John was craning his neck to see the doctors\u2019 lot. Then he smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s the pickup truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClayborne obviously didn\u2019t drop her off and go back to The Swan. He\u2019s inside with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s in the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull in next to that purple van behind the line of trees.\u201d</p><p>John swung the car into the spot, pushed the button to bring the window down, and turned the motor off.</p><p>Dallas reached into the backseat for a black windbreaker and put it on. The pocket contained a small semiautomatic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to go over every possibility in my head,\u201d Dallas said. \u201cBuchanan and the doctor shouldn\u2019t be difficult. Clayborne\u2019s going to be the tough one. He\u2019s trained, and he\u2019ll be looking for trouble. If it goes bad and Preston and Monk and I have to hit them inside, he\u2019ll go down shooting, and he\u2019ll try to take us with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll take him out first. Remember, the element of surprise will be on your side. He won\u2019t see it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll . . . anticipate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be able to lure Buchanan outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying that if something goes wrong then \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d John said impatiently. \u201cMonk will be thinking the same thing you are. You and he can maybe get Clayborne between you. Preston can get Buchanan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou prick. You should go in with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor knows who I am. It\u2019s too risky. She could be standing in the hallway and spot me right away. No, I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d</p><p>Dallas reached over and snatched the key out of the ignition. John was highly insulted. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m going to run out on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hear shooting, you just might.\u201d</p><p>John put his hands up. \u201cFine. Take the keys, but keep them where you can get to them quickly.\u201d</p><p>John saw a car coming down the drive, and even though the trees hid them from view, he still ducked down. The car drove on. They had a perfect vantage point. The ER entrance was right in front of them. Buchanan would either park his car in the visitors\u2019 lot or pull in and park next to the doctor\u2019s truck in the adjacent lot. Either way, he wouldn\u2019t see Dallas or John.</p><p>\u201cIf I have to go in after him . . . it could blow up in my face,\u201d Dallas worried.</p><p>\u201cThink about the money,\u201d John whispered, his voice as smooth as satin. \u201cJust think about the money.\u201d</p><p>Slumping down in their seats, they silently waited.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY</p><p>Theo had made one more detour before he drove to the hospital.</p><p>He stopped at a Pak Mail store, made copies of the papers Rosa had given him, and then, using the store phone, he called his superior in Boston and told him what had happened. As he was talking to him, he had one of the store\u2019s employees fax the papers to his boss.</p><p>Then he called the local FBI branch, got their fax number, and sent copies to their office as well. And because he was tired and feeling a little paranoid, he faxed a set to his home.</p><p>By the time he reached the outskirts of St. Claire, the signal on his cell phone was fading. The battery was almost out of juice. He wanted to call Ben and ask him to meet him at the hospital so he could give him copies too, his intent to include the chief in the investigation. Theo decided he would have to wait and call him from the hospital. While he waited at a stoplight, he stacked the papers and put them into the glove compartment.</p><p>Now that he felt he had covered all the bases \u2014 his boss was going to fax a copy to a friend at the IRS \u2014 Theo once again went over the conversation he\u2019d had with Rosa Vincetti. The poor woman was terrified of the police, and based on her past experience, he certainly didn\u2019t blame her. They had broken down her door in the middle of the night and, with their guns drawn, had rushed through her home, dragged her son out of his bed, handcuffed him, and taken him away. Ever since that night, Rosa had been living in terror that it would happen again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid Catherine know about your fear of the police?\u201d he\u2019d asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, she did,\u201d she\u2019d answered. \u201cI told her everything. We were very close, like sisters. She depended on me.\u201d</p><p>Then, as Theo was leaving, Rosa told him she kept expecting to read about John\u2019s arrest in the papers because Catherine had told her that the copies she\u2019d made of her husband\u2019s secret files would put him in prison for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you supposed to do with your copies?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She told me to keep them in a safe place. I\u2019ve been praying . . . and waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod to tell me what to do,\u201d she answered.</p><p>After assuring her that the papers were safe with him, he\u2019d thanked her and left.</p><p>He was just a couple of blocks away from the hospital when he glanced at the digital clock on the dashboard. Nine-fifteen. Time flies when you\u2019re having fun, he thought. No wonder his stomach was growling, and he was yawning every other minute. He hadn\u2019t had anything to eat or drink all day. He needed food and caffeine. Maybe after he checked on Michelle and talked to Noah, he could grab something in the hospital cafeteria.</p> <p>He drove along the hospital drive, noticed there weren\u2019t any cars under the canopy outside the emergency entrance, pulled up just beyond the No Parking sign, and parked the car in the slanted slots reserved for police.</p><p>A male nurse was coming out of the entrance as Theo was going in. \u201cHey, buddy, you can\u2019t park your car there. You\u2019ll get ticketed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI vehicle,\u201d Theo called back.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d John muttered when he saw Buchanan park his car next to the building and go inside.</p><p>Dallas opened the car door. \u201cCall Preston and Monk. Have them meet me in the stairwell, north side. I want to synchronize this just in case Buchanan gives me trouble.\u201d</p><p>As Dallas slammed the door and took off running, John made the call. After he disconnected, he reached into the backseat and pulled his laptop into the front. Then he opened the glove compartment, got out the other set of keys he\u2019d requested when he\u2019d rented the car, and put the car key in the ignition.</p> <p>Dallas was only just now beginning to distrust him. John smiled as he thought about that. All of them \u2014 even cynical, burned-out Cameron \u2014 for all their illegal wheeling and dealing, were na\u00efve when it came to understanding John\u2019s capabilities. They actually believed that he couldn\u2019t get the money without them. What was even more amusing to him was the fact that his worker bees thought he would share the fortune. Ah, trust. What a wonderful weapon.</p><p>He leaned back and waited. It was a beautiful sultry night. Maybe it all would work out and he wouldn\u2019t have to go to his contingency plan. Preston was acting like a hothead now, though. John was pretty sure Preston wouldn\u2019t be able to stop himself from shooting someone. It would go bad then. Maybe all of them would die.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that be a stroke of luck.</p><p>Theo was going to take the stairs to the second floor, but as he was crossing the hallway to get to the stairwell door, Elliott Waterson shouted at him.</p><p>\u201cCoach? My parents are upstairs.\u201d</p><p>The teenager was standing inside the elevator, holding the door open. He obviously thought that Theo had come to sit with Cherry and Daryl while John Patrick was in surgery.</p><p>Theo joined him. \u201cHow are you holding up, Elliott?\u201d</p><p>The teenager began to cry. He looked like he\u2019d been through a war. His eyes were swollen, his nose was red, and there was a sad and haunted look about him.</p> <p>His head bowed, he whispered, \u201cDid you hear what I did to my little brother?\u201d He began to sob then. \u201cI hurt him, Coach. I hurt him bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was an accident, Elliott.\u201d</p><p>Theo knew that Michelle had rushed to the hospital and that the patient was John Patrick, the little boy who wanted him to shoot Lois, but when Michelle\u2019s brother had called, he hadn\u2019t given any details about the extent of the injury or how it had happened. Still, Theo knew Elliott would never intentionally hurt his brother. Elliott was a decent kid and came from a loving, close-knit family.</p><p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean to hurt John Patrick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s my fault and now he\u2019s gonna die.\u201d</p><p>Elliott nearly knocked Theo over when he threw himself against him. He was sobbing uncontrollably now, his face buried in Theo\u2019s shoulder. Elliott was a big, strapping boy who outweighed Theo by at least thirty pounds, but he was still a kid who needed to be comforted.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go find your mother,\u201d Theo suggested.</p><p>Barely coherent, Elliott stammered, \u201cI never should have . . . I didn\u2019t mean to . . .\u201d</p><p>Theo\u2019s heart ached for him. He put his arm around him and patted. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a promise; it was a prayer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have hope, Elliott.\u201d</p><p>He realized then that the elevator wasn\u2019t moving. He stretched his other arm around the teenager so he could reach the button.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom told me not to get him the dartboard. She said he was too little and he could cut himself on those sharp darts, but John Patrick really wanted it for his birthday present, so I got it for him anyway. Mom was really mad at me,\u201d he stammered. \u201cI should have taken it back . . . but I didn\u2019t. I hung the board with some rope off the big tree in the front yard. I put it down low so John Patrick could use it, and when it started to get dark and he got tired of playing with it and climbed up in the tree like he likes to do, I picked up the darts and I started throwing them. I got back real far, and I was really hurling them.\u201d</p><p>Theo winced. He knew what was coming. Elliott was too distraught to go on. The elevator doors opened, and Theo pulled him along as he stepped out.</p><p>Noah was leaning against the wall facing the elevators. When he saw Elliott with Theo, he immediately went down the hall to get the boy\u2019s parents.</p><p>\u201cJohn Patrick jumped down out of the tree just as I hurled a dart,\u201d Elliott sobbed. \u201cI got him in the chest, maybe his heart . . . I don\u2019t know, but he didn\u2019t cry. He just looked so surprised. I was screaming \u2018no\u2019 and running to him \u2019cause I knew what he was going to do. He tried to pull the dart out . . . but it didn\u2019t come out . . . just the fuzzy end . . . and he closed his eyes and went down on the ground. He . . . just . . . crumbled. I thought he was dead. Daddy saw it happen too. He had just gotten out of the van and was going up the steps. John Patrick\u2019s gonna die, isn\u2019t he, Coach? I know he is.\u201d</p><p>Theo didn\u2019t know what to say that could possibly console the boy. He cleared his throat and then said decisively, \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go find your mother.\u201d</p><p>There were signs on the wall directly ahead of him across from the elevator. Surgery was to the left down a long hallway. Noah had gone right, and Theo pulled Elliott along as he turned to follow. Noah stepped out of an open door and moved out of the way as Cherry and Daryl came hurrying toward Theo.</p><p>When Elliott saw his mother, he let go of Theo and ran to her. She put her arms around him and hugged him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear about John Patrick,\u201d Theo said to Daryl.</p><p>The father looked as though he had aged ten years since they\u2019d met. \u201cI know, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a little boy,\u201d Cherry cried.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s strong,\u201d Daryl told her. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been in surgery?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cA half hour now,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cAny word yet? A progress report?\u201d</p><p>Elliott had let go of his mother and was now standing beside her, holding her hand. Cherry looked dazed.</p><p>Daryl answered the question. \u201cDr. Mike sent a nurse in a few minutes ago to tell us it\u2019s going well. Did you hear that, Elliott?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou had just gone downstairs to look for the minister when that nurse came in. Dr. Mike said that John Patrick\u2019s guardian angel was looking out for him because the arrow missed hitting an artery. The nurse was guessing it would be another hour at least before the operation is finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may have to give my boy a transfusion,\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>\u201cSo we were thinking we ought to go down to the lab and give them some of our blood,\u201d Daryl said, \u201cin case John Patrick needs it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going to take your blood, Daryl,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cNot with your recent surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask them all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give my blood too,\u201d Elliott said. He stepped away from his mother, straightened, and wiped his eyes with the backs of his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your other boys?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cDown in the cafeteria,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cI should check on them. Henry must be getting fretful. It\u2019s past his bedtime, and I didn\u2019t think to bring his little blanket he likes to hold up against his nose when he sucks his thumb.\u201d She started crying.</p><p>Daryl put his arm around her. \u201cHenry\u2019s just fine. The reverend\u2019s wife is going to take the little ones home and put them to bed,\u201d he explained to Theo. \u201cThey should be here any minute, so let\u2019s get going to the lab, Cherry. I want to get back here before the doctor comes out.\u201d</p><p>Daryl was agitated. Theo understood the father\u2019s need to do something, anything, to help his child. Waiting would have driven Theo crazy, and he couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine the anguish John Patrick\u2019s parents were going through.</p><p>\u201cMaybe one of us ought to stay here,\u201d Cherry said as the elevator doors opened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here,\u201d Theo said. \u201cI\u2019ll page you if anything happens.\u201d</p><p>Noah had hung back, but as soon as the elevator doors closed, he walked over to Theo. \u201cThe mother looks like she\u2019s in shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad was it? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looked bad, but I honestly don\u2019t know. It got crazy here. I was watching Mike through the window. She was standing at the sink scrubbing her hands and arms and looking at the X rays another doctor was holding up for her. There were nurses and doctors and technicians rushing back and forth. Everyone seemed to be shouting orders, everyone but Mike. She was as calm and cool as a summer breeze.\u201d His voice was filled with admiration. \u201cShe sure knows how to handle herself in a crisis. I guess that\u2019s why she became a surgeon.\u201d</p><p>Theo nodded. \u201cShe was that way last night when the bullets were flying all around us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of bullets flying, did you get everything done in New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Theo said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe what I found out.\u201d</p><p>He then told Noah about the Sowing Club and the millions of dollars tucked away in a Cayman Islands account. When he was finished taking Noah through the steps that had led him to Cameron and Rosa, he added, \u201cI want to get John Russell, but I have a feeling there\u2019s more to his crimes than what\u2019s in those records. As soon as the detectives pick up Cameron Lynch, I\u2019ll talk to him. He\u2019ll tell me what I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what Nick\u2019s told me about your powers of persuasion, I don\u2019t doubt you\u2019ll get him to talk. I want to look at those papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left copies in the glove compartment of your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that smart?\u201d</p><p>Theo smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t I mention copies went out to my boss, the IRS, the FBI, and my home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t mention that. You said the initials next to those transactions were J, C, P, and D,\u201d Noah said. \u201cToo bad John didn\u2019t put their full names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Catherine did. Maybe there was an explanation with the papers she sent Michelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Russell is obviously J, and Cameron Lynch is C. So who are P and D?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the riddle, and I bet I\u2019ll have the answer soon. Detectives Underwood and Basham have a couple of other detectives running all over New Orleans talking to some of John\u2019s associates. It won\u2019t be long before we have the names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Detective Harris knows who they are. Has she called yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cGuess she isn\u2019t a woman of her word. It\u2019s been over twelve hours, and didn\u2019t she promise to give you a copy of the file then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll probably be furious when she finds out I got a copy from Rosa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not going to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sharing information with her. I\u2019m going to let Underwood and Basham make the collars and take the credit.\u201d</p><p>He heard his name being paged over the speaker, saw the phone on the wall directly across from the elevator, and walked over to answer it. As soon as he identified himself, the operator put him on hold. Two seconds later, Detective Underwood came on the line.</p><p>The conversation was very informative. Then Theo said, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll be waiting. Let me know.\u201d He hung up and turned to Noah. \u201cPreston and Dallas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? That was quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the detectives got the names from John\u2019s ex-girlfriend. A woman named Lindsey. She was trying to get in John\u2019s house, said she\u2019d left some clothes. She told him she had met Cameron but never the others. She\u2019d heard John talking on the phone, though, and remembered the names Preston and Dallas because they called often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo last names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. And guess what? Another man called once looking for Dallas. His name was Monk. She remembered the phone call because John was so deferential to him, like he almost was afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Noah said. \u201cDid Lindsey ever talk to him or any of the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Theo answered. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t allowed to answer the phone, said John told her he didn\u2019t want people to know he was shacking up with her so soon after his wife\u2019s death. She also told the detective they were supposed to get married, but John came home a couple of nights ago, told her to pack up and get out. He wasn\u2019t nice about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why she\u2019s so chatty now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I figure they\u2019ll have Preston and Dallas under wraps before midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be sooner,\u201d Noah said. \u201cHow did Detective Underwood find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I\u2019d be on my cell phone or at The Swan. John Paul or Jake must have told him I was at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all we have to do is hang tight a little longer. It\u2019ll be over soon.\u201d Theo yawned loudly and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI need some caffeine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s some coffee in the waiting room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to check on Michelle first. Can I go inside there?\u201d he asked, tilting his head toward the wide double doors with the sign above stating in bold red letters, \u201cNo Admittance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can. I did. You can look through the window and see Mike. She\u2019s in the operating room on the left around the corner where it dead ends. Just don\u2019t let anyone see you. The nurses tend to shout. I\u2019m going to make a couple of phone calls,\u201d he added as he turned and headed down the hallway to the waiting room. \u201cWant me to bring you some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Theo answered. \u201cI\u2019ll get my own.\u201d He had his palm on the door, ready to push, when he suddenly stopped and turned around. \u201cHey, Noah, you know what\u2019s really odd?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe channels Catherine used . . . sending the files to an unsuspecting relative she\u2019d never met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Paul told me she was an odd duck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo maybe that\u2019s your answer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Maybe,\u201d he said, but he wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>He pushed the door and stepped into the forbidden area, feeling a little like a kid sneaking into an R-rated movie. He half expected someone to start shouting at him or grab him by the collar and toss him out.</p><p>He was inside a wide hallway with several sets of swinging doors and an elevator. Turning into a hall to the left, he went around the corner. There was a gurney against the wall where the hallway dead ended, and to the right was the surgical suite Michelle was using.</p><p>It was at least twenty degrees colder here. He could hear music as he walked closer, and he recognized the voice. Good old Willie Nelson, Michelle\u2019s favorite. Theo felt a stirring of a memory too elusive to catch hold of. There was something familiar about the smell and the song and the cold. Maybe it was because of his own surgery.</p><p>He looked in through the square window and was surprised at how small the room was. It was crowded with people. He counted six, including the guy sitting behind the patient\u2019s head checking dials on the machines next to him. He couldn\u2019t see John Patrick, a nurse blocked his view, but he got a glimpse of Michelle\u2019s forehead when the nurse handed her an instrument and she turned slightly. As he watched her, he could feel the tension easing away. He began to relax, took a deep breath, and realized he was suddenly feeling good because she was close.</p><p>\u201cMan, I do have it bad,\u201d he whispered as he turned and walked back through the swinging doors. Was he becoming obsessive about Michelle? No, of course not, but the world did seem a little brighter, and definitely better, when he was with her.</p> <p>Now, Catherine was the epitome of an obsessive personality. That thought led him right back to the riddle he\u2019d been trying to solve. Rosa had told him that Catherine had wanted to use the files as a threat to control John\u2019s behavior while she was alive. Why hadn\u2019t Catherine simply directed her attorney to give the papers to the police after her death? Was she worried that Benchley wouldn\u2019t follow through, or had Rosa\u2019s distrust of the authorities rubbed off on her?</p><p>Theo could understand why Catherine chose Michelle. Catherine knew how smart her cousin was. Every time Jake called her, he did a lot of boasting, and Catherine, knowing what Michelle had already accomplished in her life, surely knew that her cousin would understand what all the numbers and transactions meant. Catherine might not have thought that Jake would figure it out \u2014 his good-old-boy fa\u00e7ade fooled a lot of people into believing he wasn\u2019t as intelligent as Theo knew he was. Catherine wouldn\u2019t have known that about him, but she certainly would have known how persistent he could be, because he never gave up on her. He called her once a month to check on her, refusing to be put off by her cold, indifferent manner. Catherine probably assumed that Jake would make certain Michelle gave the papers her full attention and got them to the right people.</p><p>But she\u2019d circumvented the police and given her second copy to Rosa. Now, why would she do that?</p><p>The answer was suddenly glaringly obvious. Because she knew that Rosa would never go to the police. And that meant . . .</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He was berating himself for taking so long to figure it out. Sorry, Catherine. I\u2019m dense, okay?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to tell Noah. Shoving the swinging door open, he ran into the hall, and in his haste, he bumped into one of the supply carts, sending it careening into the opposite wall. A stack of towels fell on his feet as he grabbed the cart to keep it from falling over. Squatting down, he was scooping up the towels in his arms when he heard the bing of the elevator followed by the swooshing sound the doors made when they opened.</p><p>Detective Harris stepped out of the alcove that led to the elevator. She turned away from him and headed toward the waiting room.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t wearing sensible shoes today. She was moving fast, the way most overworked policemen instinctively do because they are always behind, and her heels clicked against the linoleum floor like castanets.</p><p>Theo walked forward as he called out to her. \u201cHey, Detective, are you looking for me?\u201d</p><p>She had almost reached the waiting room. Startled, she whirled around as she shoved her hand into her pocket, and then smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d</p><p>Noah stepped into the hall behind Harris as she hurried toward Theo.</p><p>\u201cSurgery,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll be right with you. I\u2019ve just one quick call to make.\u201d He turned to the wall phone next to him, picked it up, dialed the operator, and spoke in a low voice. Then he hung up and smiled again.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a detective. I know how to find people.\u201d Then she laughed. \u201cA man at The Swan told me you were here and Admitting told me you were on this floor. It didn\u2019t take much investigative work. I\u2019m a little late. It\u2019s been more than twelve hours, but I got detained. I did keep my word, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d show. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got copies of the papers from that package, which I\u2019m letting you read out of the goodness of my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cJust remember, it\u2019s my investigation,\u201d she added quickly.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t touch it,\u201d he promised. \u201cSo where are the files on Monk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you didn\u2019t believe me when I said I\u2019d spent three years chasing the ghost. I\u2019ve got two huge cardboard file boxes in the trunk. It\u2019s going to take you a couple of weeks to go through all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trying to make me sorry I asked for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She visibly shivered. \u201cGod, it\u2019s cold up here. It\u2019s like a tomb. So what do you want to do?\u201d she asked. \u201cTransfer the boxes to your car now, or do you want me to drop them off someplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could transfer them now. I could start looking through them tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you make any arrests yet?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed slightly. The question obviously irritated her.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cHe got away. He does it to me every damned time. Vanishes into thin air. We tracked him to a motel in St. Claire. We surrounded it, and then we closed in. His car was there, parked right in front of his door, but he was gone. He had to leave fast, though. He didn\u2019t have time to pack his equipment or his clothes before he took off. I\u2019m hoping my people will get lucky this time and find a print. They\u2019re working on it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I could drive over and take a look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, as along as you don\u2019t interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already promised I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can look. It\u2019s the St. Claire Motel, on Fourth and Summit.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the button for the elevator and waited. Looking up, she saw the number four was lit. They waited side by side for several seconds. She punched the button again.</p><p>Impatient now, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s take the stairs. It\u2019s quicker, and I want to get back to New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a guess. It\u2019s gonna be late by the time you drive back.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at the numbers again. The light was still on four.</p><p>\u201cNew Orleans doesn\u2019t sleep. The Quarter will be buzzing when I get there.\u201d Theo stepped away from her as she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Turning to take the lead, she suddenly stopped. Noah was standing in front of her, his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>\u201cHello there,\u201d he said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Theo said. \u201cI\u2019d like to introduce you to Detective Harris. Detective, this is Noah Clayborne,\u201d he said as he put his hand on her shoulder. \u201cNoah works for the FBI, but he\u2019s also a good friend.\u201d</p><p>Theo stepped behind her as Noah said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Detective. I was just . . .\u201d</p><p>Theo took another step back. \u201cHey, Dallas,\u201d he said.</p><p>She instinctively turned. Even as she did, she realized what had just happened. Her eyes widened and she jerked back, but it was too late. Theo shoved her into the elevator doors, face-first, making it impossible for her to fire the gun he knew she had hidden in her pocket.</p><p>Noah stepped forward, forced her arm back and up into an unnatural position, then struck her wrist hard to get her to let go of the weapon. The gun dropped to the floor, and Theo kicked it away.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your friends?\u201d Theo demanded. He slackened his hold so he could force her to turn around. She took advantage, and cursing, she whirled and tried to slam her knee into Noah\u2019s groin.</p><p>\u201cIs that nice?\u201d he asked as he dodged the knee. \u201cWhere are your friends?\u201d He repeated Theo\u2019s question in a much more unfriendly tone.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t talking. Her lips pinched tight, her jaw clenched, she glared at Noah with loathing.</p><p>Theo looked up at the elevator numbers again. Still locked on four.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the stairwells,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must have blocked the elevator so I\u2019d have to take the steps. They may not know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they?\u201d Noah asked Dallas. His hand was around her neck, his thumb pressing into her flesh as he held her off the floor against the elevator.</p><p>She turned to the left and screamed at the top of her lungs, \u201cPreston!\u201d And then swinging to the right, \u201cMonk! Now!\u201d</p><p>Theo\u2019s fist silenced her. Her eyes closed instantly, and when Noah let go of her, she collapsed to the floor, unconscious. Noah tilted his head toward the hallway and whispered, \u201cGet ready,\u201d as he quickly patted Dallas down for weapons. He found the Glock in its holster and removed it. He shoved her onto her back and was about to search for another weapon in an ankle strap under her slacks, when he heard the faint squeak of a door opening. He pointed toward the waiting room, indicating to Theo that that was where the sound had come from.</p><p>Theo had heard it. He nodded and took a step closer. Noah found the ankle strap, lifted the gun, and shoved it into the waistband of his jeans. He went back to the pockets in her jacket, pulled out four magazines, and stood. He moved quickly, silently to Theo\u2019s back. He shoved two of the magazines into Theo\u2019s back pockets, then handed him Harris\u2019s Glock so that he would have a weapon in each hand. Barrels pointed to the ceiling, they waited, hidden by the recess in front of the elevator doors.</p><p>Theo heard the soft click of a door closing. It came from the exit just beyond the waiting room. Monk. Then another click, at the opposite end of the hall by the OR doors. Preston had to be the man at the other end of the hall. Where was John? Was he in the elevator? Or was he in the stairwell?</p><p>He strained to hear footsteps. Nothing. Not a sound. Were they waiting for Noah and him to step out into the hall?</p><p>His heart was pounding in his ears; his breathing was harsh.</p><p>\u201cAmbush,\u201d Noah whispered. \u201cLet them come to us.\u201d</p><p>Theo shook his head. He didn\u2019t care that he was trapped. He couldn\u2019t wait. Wouldn\u2019t. The elevator was still locked on the fourth floor. There were two men waiting to blow them away, but these men wouldn\u2019t wait long, and if Michelle or one of the nurses came out to talk to the Watersons, they\u2019d kill her.</p><p>\u201cMichelle.\u201d He whispered her name. Noah nodded, letting him know he understood.</p><p>Theo tucked one of his guns under his arm, reached down, and grabbed one of Dallas\u2019s shoes. Then he threw it into the hallway. Preston immediately opened fire. Three shots. Then silence again.</p><p>They both heard the wail of sirens getting closer and closer. \u201cPolice?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Theo nodded, letting him know he\u2019d told the operator to call them, then whispered, \u201cCan\u2019t wait,\u201d because he knew that Preston and Monk and John had also heard the sound. They might think the noise was from an ambulance, but they would still want to move quickly to get the job done. No, they wouldn\u2019t wait much longer. Theo took a step toward the hallway. Noah nudged him.</p><p>\u201cBack to back,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOnly way we do it. Move out together. On three?\u201d</p><p>Their guns up, they each took a deep breath. Noah turned his back to Theo\u2019s and whispered, \u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Theo saw Dallas move. She was swinging up onto her knees. She\u2019d reached the gun Theo had kicked aside and was taking aim at Noah.</p><p>Theo fired. The blast shook the elevator doors. The bullet struck Harris in the hollow just below her throat. Eyes wide in disbelief, she fell back. Her eyes closed a second later, and she was dead. Her head dropped to her chest as she slumped against the elevator doors.</p><p>Noah barely spared her a glance before continuing his countdown. \u201cTwo . . .\u201d He turned again, his shoulders touching Theo\u2019s now.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Theo whispered.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>Theo and Noah rushed into the hallway. Each found his target, homed in, and fired.</p><p>Noah winged Monk, but the killer didn\u2019t slow down. He got the door open and dove into the stairwell. Noah kept going, running now, safe in the knowledge that Theo was protecting his back just as he was protecting his. When he got to the door, he flattened himself against the wall, reached in, and fired again. Monk was waiting for him. He fired at the same time. His bullet tore a groove in the door as Noah jumped back. A hail of bullets followed until the wall across from the door was riddled with holes, and plaster bits flew out in every direction. The air was gray from plaster dust. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The noise was deafening. The blasts echoed in his ears, but he thought he heard a woman scream. He couldn\u2019t be sure. Noah glanced over his shoulder, saw Theo running, his guns firing again and again as the man he was chasing ducked behind the OR doors.</p><p>Go to the right. Go right. Away from Michelle. Theo surged forward, through the doors. He dropped to the floor, rolled, praying to God that Preston was trying to get to the exit.</p><p>The Glock in his left hand was empty. He couldn\u2019t waste time reloading. The doors leading to ICU were swinging. Preston was there, waiting, Theo was certain. He scrambled to get to his feet, saw a blur streak past the window, and knew he had to get around the corner and out of the line of fire.</p><p>He made it, but only just barely. A bullet missed his face by an inch. A nurse ran out of the OR, screaming.</p> <p>\u201cGet back,\u201d he shouted as he ejected the empty magazine from the gun, grabbed another one from his back pocket, and snapped it in place. The nurse disappeared into the OR as he pressed his back against the wall and waited. He could hear Willie singing.</p><p>His shoulder rubbed the wall as he edged closer to the corner. He accidentally hit the light switch, and just as the song ended, the hallway went dark. The light spilling through the window of the OR was sufficient for him to see. Where had Preston gone? Had he already gotten a hostage? Or had he found another way out? He\u2019d have to come this way, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><p>Where the hell were the police? Never around when you need them, he thought. Come on, Ben. Get your ass in here. Save the day.</p><p>You\u2019re not getting past me, Preston. No way. Stay inside, Michelle. Don\u2019t come out until this is over. He remembered the gurney and moved back until his foot touched it. He hooked his leg around the metal bar and pulled the gurney close to the corner.</p><p>Come on. Come on. Make your move.</p> <p>Michelle had just put in the last stitch and was waiting for that beautiful first cough after the anesthesiologist had removed the tube. The child had come through the surgery like a champion. Barring any complications, John Patrick would be climbing his favorite tree again within a month. Providing, of course, that his mother would let him out of her sight.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetie. Cough for me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She heard a tiny little groan followed by a dry cough a second later.</p><p>\u201cGood to go,\u201d the anesthesiologist said. He pulled his mask down and grinned. \u201cThis is one lucky boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat job,\u201d she told the team.</p><p>Suddenly, gunshots rang out in the hallway. Chaos followed. One of the nurses screamed and ran to the door to find out what was happening, ignoring both Michelle\u2019s and Landusky\u2019s shouts to come back. Then Michelle heard Theo shout to the woman to get back.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Theo. Is he hurt?\u201d Michelle demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What in God\u2019s name is going on?\u201d</p><p>No one had an answer. Their concern was for the patient now.</p><p>John Patrick was breathing on his own, the sound nice and clear. Landusky quickly helped Michelle roll the table over against the wall by the doors. A nurse moved the IV stand. She put it to the side, and then she and another nurse leaned over the boy to protect him from harm if anyone rushed into the OR firing a weapon. Landusky had the same idea. He stood behind John Patrick\u2019s head, cupped his hands on either side of the boy\u2019s face, and hunched over him. The others squatted down behind the foot of the table and waited. A technician put her hands over her ears and was silently crying.</p><p>Michelle had already grabbed the heavy fire extinguisher, holding it like a baseball bat. She stood to the side of the door but far enough away so that if the shooter slammed the door against the wall, it wouldn\u2019t block her. Then she turned the lights off and waited. She wouldn\u2019t allow herself to think about Theo. She had only one thought now and that was to keep the gunman out of the OR.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone fires a gun in here, the whole floor could blow up,\u201d Landusky whispered. \u201cThe oxygen tanks and the \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d she whispered. She and everyone else in the OR were well aware of the danger.</p><p>She pressed forward to listen. What was that soft whirring noise? It sounded like a centrifuge spinning. Oh, God, her Willie Nelson tape was automatically rewinding. When it reached the beginning, it would start playing again. The recorder was on top of a table against the wall on the other side of the doors. A sterile sheet covered it.</p> <p>She wanted to shout to Theo. She couldn\u2019t, of course. Let him be okay. If he\u2019s hurt . . . if he\u2019s bleeding while I\u2019m hiding behind this door . . . Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t think about it. Where was Noah? Why wasn\u2019t he helping Theo? Was he out there too? Theo, where are you?</p><p>Theo hunched behind the gurney. He was ready. He sensed rather than heard the man coming, and Theo kicked the gurney with all his might as Preston sprinted around the corner. He was firing into the center of the corridor. The gurney crashed into him, but it didn\u2019t slow him down. He easily blocked the gurney with his arm, then threw his weight into it and sent it hurling into Theo, slamming him back against the wall.</p><p>Theo went down hard. As Preston was trying to shove the gurney out of his way so he could get a clear shot, Theo rolled under the table and fired. The bullet struck Preston in the left thigh. And that didn\u2019t seem to slow him down either. His empty magazine clattered to the floor, and he was snapping another one into the weapon as Theo, roaring like a bear on the attack, lifted the gurney with his shoulder, grabbed it with one hand, and used it as a battering ram, forcing Preston back. Theo shot through the pad falling from the gurney. Preston pivoted and the bullet creased the top of his shoulder.</p><p>The bastard didn\u2019t even flinch. What the hell was it going to take to bring him down? As Preston was diving around the corner, Theo aimed and fired again. Click. Nothing happened. The magazine was empty. He reached behind him to grab the second one Noah had shoved into his pocket, loaded it in the gun, then dove as Preston opened fire on him.</p><p>One bullet skimmed Theo\u2019s forehead. How many bullets did he have left? Theo wondered. If he was lucky, maybe two. Three was pushing it. He felt a flash of searing pain in his arm as he dove again to get out of the line of fire.</p><p>The gurney lay on its side. Thank God, he thought as he scrambled to get behind it.</p><p>Preston lunged to get Theo in his sights, but Theo lashed out with his foot and nailed him in his knee. And still he didn\u2019t go down. He staggered back, firing into the ceiling.</p><p>The doors around the corner suddenly exploded. Preston didn\u2019t look behind him to see who was coming. He was just a couple of feet away from a darkened room, saw the swinging doors, and knew it was time to get the hell out. He rushed into the OR, hoping there was another way out on the other side.</p><p>Preston stopped and squinted into the dark, listening as he edged away from the doors. He turned toward Michelle, the barrel of his gun pointed in her direction.</p><p>She could hear him panting. He was too close. Another step and he\u2019d bump into her. She knew she\u2019d have to step back to get a good swing at him. But he\u2019d hear it, she thought.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t he moving? Did he know she was there? Just one step forward.</p><p>She needed a distraction. Something . . . anything to get him to turn away from her so she could strike. Willie Nelson came to her rescue. \u201cTo all the girls I\u2019ve loved before . . .\u201d The instant the song started, Preston whirled around and fired again and again at the tape recorder. Michelle swung the extinguisher, slamming it into his jaw.</p><p>\u201cHit the lights,\u201d she shouted as he staggered backward into the hallway. She went after him, struck him again on the side of the head. The second blow seemed to do the trick. He went flying back and landed with a thud against the wall.</p><p>Michelle stopped. Theo sprang in front of her as Preston was bringing his gun up. Theo fired and hit him in the abdomen.</p><p>He was using his back to push Michelle into the OR and out of danger.</p><p>Preston fell to his knees as Noah ran toward him shouting, \u201cDrop the gun.\u201d</p><p>Preston turned toward Noah and took aim. He never got to pull the trigger. Noah fired. One bullet through the temple. Preston pitched forward facedown on the floor. A pool of black blood rapidly formed a puddle around him.</p><p>Michelle nudged Theo forward to get him out of the way of the doors as she called out, \u201cIt\u2019s clear. Get the patient to recovery.\u201d</p><p>Theo leaned against the wall, then slowly slid down into a sitting position as Noah squatted next to Preston and lifted the gun from his hand.</p><p>Everyone started shouting and talking at once then. Theo closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He could hear the squeak of the rollers as the nurses pushed John Patrick\u2019s bed out and around Preston.</p><p>Michelle knelt down beside Theo. She\u2019d peeled her gloves off and was gently probing the cut below his eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old for this,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Noah asked as he reholstered his gun.</p><p>\u201cYes. Did you get the one she called Monk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he shouted. He was trying to dodge Michelle\u2019s hand so he could see Noah.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how he did it, but he got away. I know I winged him,\u201d Noah said. \u201cAll the exits are blocked, and they\u2019re making a sweep of each floor, but he\u2019s long gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA patient up on four was looking out his window and saw a man run across a bed of flowers up the hill. The patient said he was bent over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about John Russell? Any sign of him?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Noah answered.</p><p>\u201cYou tore your stitches,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d whispered the news and it sounded like a scolding. He was looking at Noah, wondering what the white streaks were on his face when she\u2019d interrupted. He finally looked at her face. And when he saw the tears streaming down her cheeks, he was astonished. She wasn\u2019t so tough after all. Not with him, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He tried to wipe a tear from her cheek. She pushed his hand away. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to sew you back together again.\u201d She was trembling now like an alcoholic who\u2019d gone too long without a drink. \u201cLook at my hands. They\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re gonna wait before you pick up a needle and go to work on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou threw yourself in front of me so he\u2019d shoot you. That was very heroic, you big jerk. You could have been killed.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her push him away this time. Cupping her face with his hands, he whispered, \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</p><p>Always have a contingency plan.</p><p>When two police cars came zooming down the drive to the hospital with their lights flashing and their sirens blaring, John knew it was time to leave. He ducked down in his seat \u2014 an unnecessary precaution, but instinctive all the same \u2014 and turned the ignition on. He waited a couple of seconds, until he saw the policemen running into the hospital. Then he slowly backed the car out of the parking spot, turned, and eased out of the lot.</p><p>He didn\u2019t really care if his friends were dead or alive. Why would he? His plans weren\u2019t going to be affected, no matter what the outcome.</p><p>Even if the police took them alive and they told them everything they knew, it would be too late. And if by some miracle one or two of them escaped, well, that just didn\u2019t matter either. John had enough time to get the money from the Sowing Club account transferred to the account in Switzerland he\u2019d set up years ago. He had his laptop with him \u2014 he found it curious that Dallas hadn\u2019t questioned him as to why he\u2019d brought it along \u2014 and all he had to do was to get to a phone line, type a few commands on his computer, and he would be set for life.</p><p>Getting away quickly was all he cared about now. Within the next few minutes, one of those policemen might come running outside and try to block the main entrance leading into the hospital drive.</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d he whispered. There might already be a police car there now. Too risky to chance being stopped, John decided. He backed the car into the lot again, turned around, and then drove at a snail\u2019s pace down the tarred service road behind the hospital.</p><p>And that was when he spotted Monk hobbling up the hill toward the street. One hand was clutching his side. Had he been shot? It looked as though he had.</p><p>John chuckled. The opportunity was simply too good to pass up. No one was around. No one would see. He owed Monk a considerable amount of money. \u201cHmmm,\u201d he whispered again. Do it, his mind screamed. Do it now.</p><p>He seized the moment. Turning the car sharply, he drove over the curb, then pressed his foot down on the accelerator. Monk heard him coming and turned. When he saw John, he stopped and waited.</p><p>He thinks I\u2019m going to pick him up. He increased his speed as he got closer. The expression on Monk\u2019s face when he realized what was going to happen was hilarious. He looked positively shocked.</p><p>John miscalculated, though. He thought Monk would dive to the left and turned the wheel ever so slightly so he could hit him straight on, but Monk leapt the other way, and the car only brushed him as it sped past.</p><p>He didn\u2019t dare risk backing up and trying again. \u201cOh, well, you do what you can,\u201d he said as he hit the curb and bounced into the street. Cutting through a run-down neighborhood, he reached the main street six blocks away from the hospital and knew then he was safe.</p><p>He picked up his cell phone, dialed the pilot he\u2019d hired months ago, and told him he would arrive at the municipal airport in forty-five minutes. He turned left at the stoplight and headed in the opposite direction from New Orleans. He\u2019d never be able to go back, of course. Even though he had a new identity \u2014 the passport was in the case with his computer \u2014 he knew he would never return to the United States.</p><p>No great loss, he thought. After all, he had millions of dollars to keep him happy. John wasn\u2019t one to gloat, but he did just that now. He had, after all, gotten away with murder.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</p><p>Michelle finished writing orders and then went into recovery to look in on John Patrick. The nurse had led his parents in, and Daryl and Cherry stood holding hands by their son\u2019s bedside. Elliott was outside the door, too upset to do more than peek in at his brother.</p><p>\u201cThe worst is over,\u201d Daryl said. Then he looked at Michelle. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through the wringer tonight too, haven\u2019t you? The police blocked off the steps and the elevators, and we knew something terrible was going on, but we didn\u2019t know how bad it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t know,\u201d Cherry said as she dabbed at the corners of her eyes with a tissue.</p><p>\u201cWe could hear the gunshots. Everyone in the hospital could hear them, but we knew you wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to John Patrick.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDr. Landusky will be here through the night,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you\u2019d rather I stay \u2014\u201d</p><p>Daryl wouldn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cYou did your part, and we don\u2019t know how we\u2019re ever going to repay you. You go on home.\u201d</p><p>Michelle took the steps down to the emergency room to get Theo. The notion of sleeping for a week sounded glorious. She wondered if he was as tired as she was. She had already stitched his arm again, but he was waiting in the ER, sitting on an exam table with an ice pack on his knee while he talked on the phone.</p><p>He hung up as she walked in. \u201cDetectives Underwood and Basham picked up Cameron Lynch. He was in the mood to talk,\u201d he added. \u201cFirst thing he said after they read him his rights was that he wasn\u2019t going to take the fall for murdering John\u2019s wife. He called it a mercy killing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that made it okay?\u201d she asked, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of spin he\u2019s putting on it,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>\u201cThe bottom line is that he was motivated by money.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and pulled her into his side and held her around her waist. He needed to have her close, to touch her. There was a moment upstairs when he had thought he was going to lose her, and he knew he would never ever forget that terror.</p><p>He kissed her on the side of her neck. A nurse was standing at the counter watching. He didn\u2019t care, and from the way Michelle leaned into him, he knew she didn\u2019t care either.</p> <p>Noah walked into the ER then.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got all over your face?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>He went to the mirror above the sink to look. \u201cPlaster chips and dust I guess,\u201d he said as he turned the water on and grabbed a towel.</p><p>Theo told him about Cameron while Noah washed his face. \u201cJohn\u2019s already moved the money out of the Cayman account. He did it with his computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he transfer it?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know yet, but Underwood has people working on it. It\u2019s an interesting group,\u201d he commented.</p> <p>\u201cThe Sowing Club? What\u2019s interesting about four deviants?\u201d Noah asked. He wiped his face dry with the towel and dropped it into the sink. Then he turned around, folded his arms across his chest, and waited for Theo to explain.</p><p>\u201cWhen John first set the account up, he told his friends that all four of them would have to go to the bank to get any money out. It was a safeguard, he\u2019d explained, but that obviously wasn\u2019t the truth. He played them from the beginning, and Dallas and Preston and Cameron were fools to keep on trusting him after he manipulated them into helping hire the hit on his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he need their cooperation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDallas was the connection to Monk,\u201d Theo said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why he wanted to involve the other two. They had all the bases covered. John worked the banking end. He was a lawyer and a VP in the trust department. Cameron used his brokerage firm to screw clients out of their retirement money, Dallas was police, and Preston worked in the D.A.\u2019s office and took care of any problems with the law.</p><p>\u201cDallas was actually telling the truth about the ghost. She did keep a file on him and all his past deeds, just to cover herself. Underwood has the file now. He said Monk killed a young girl a while back and that the father hired him to do the job. There\u2019s enough evidence to arrest the father, and they\u2019ve got detectives picking him up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he rots in prison,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>Theo nodded. \u201cUnderwood thinks Monk has flair.\u201d He lifted the ice pack and put it on the table behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he mean by \u2018flair\u2019?\u201d Michelle asked. She saw Theo grimace as he lifted his leg. She grabbed the ice pack and put it back on his knee.</p> <p>\u201cHe always places a rose near the victim, usually on the bed, because he prefers killing them at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Detective Harris wasn\u2019t lying about that,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cShe was smart,\u201d Theo said. \u201cShe stuck close to the truth as much as possible so she wouldn\u2019t get tripped up on lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know Harris was one of them?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen Noah was in New Orleans, I had him check her out,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was odd that her captain wouldn\u2019t tell Noah anything about the case she was working on. Noah\u2019s used to dealing with antagonistic detectives who don\u2019t want the FBI working with them, so he assumed the captain was being evasive on purpose. I thought maybe the captain didn\u2019t know what Harris was up to, but I didn\u2019t take that any further. I just filed it away and moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have taken the time to talk to some of the other detectives,\u201d Noah said. \u201cTo find out how they felt about working with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably would have closed ranks on you,\u201d Theo said.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how you put it together, Theo,\u201d Michelle said.</p><p>\u201cCatherine told me,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was a smart woman, so I finally realized why she\u2019d made it so complicated. She didn\u2019t have the attorney give the papers to the police because she knew one of the members of the Sowing Club was a detective. She gave the second backup copy to Rosa because she knew the housekeeper would never go to the police. I honestly don\u2019t know what she thought Rosa would do, though. Maybe mail the files . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He yawned then and said, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019d narrowed it down to Preston and Dallas, knew one of them was a policeman, and then Harris showed up wearing a jacket when it was blistering hot and muggy outside. When she stepped into the hall and turned, her back was to me and I saw her reach behind and unsnap the strap on her gun, but she kept the other hand in her pocket. I figured she was carrying extra firepower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure would like to know where John Russell is hiding,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Theo nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll get him eventually.\u201d Then he yawned. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s going to sleep in your guest room,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as a precaution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that John or Monk \u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cNo, but I\u2019ll sleep easier, and so will you.\u201d</p><p>They headed for the exit. Theo looped his arm around Michelle\u2019s shoulder as they walked along.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to stop at the motel and pick up some things,\u201d Noah said. \u201cHow\u2019s that kid doing, Mike? Give me some good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she answered. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as bad as it looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still chafed you let Monk get away?\u201d Theo asked.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be in two places at once,\u201d he replied. \u201cI knew I had to get back and save your sorry ass, and the police had the stairwells blocked off. I figured they\u2019d get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saved your sorry ass,\u201d Theo corrected.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you did. Where are my car keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left them in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, how do you know you shot Monk?\u201d she asked. \u201cDid you see him fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t go down,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut there was blood on the door and on the stairs. I either got him in the hip or the side. He went up to the roof, crossed over, then down the fire escape.\u201d He turned to leave. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you wait a minute and make sure I can get the pickup started?\u201d Michelle asked.</p><p>She was glad she\u2019d asked, because Noah had to hot-wire it to get it going. Theo insisted on driving and didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble using his right leg to work the clutch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep until noon,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. You\u2019ve got to get up and go fishing.\u201d</p><p>Michelle groaned. \u201cI\u2019m staying home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to go with me. You\u2019re my partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a boat, remember? Mine\u2019s buried in the shrubs somewhere, and we wouldn\u2019t have a chance of winning without one. The best fishing spots are deep in the swamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad made John Paul loan us one of his. It\u2019s already docked behind The Swan.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like hearing that. \u201cI want to stay in bed, but I\u2019ll leave the decision to you. You\u2019re company, after all.\u201d She moved closer, put her hand on his thigh, and tried to sound sultry when she whispered,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tough one,\u201d he drawled. \u201cLet\u2019s see. I could either get up before dawn \u2014 and I really like doing that \u2014 and sit in a boat all day long worrying about snakes falling on my head while I\u2019m sweating through my clothes and slapping at mosquitoes, or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said, smiling now.</p><p>\u201cI could spend the day in bed fooling around with a beautiful, na*ed lady. Yeah, that\u2019s a tough one, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about me being naked?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look that made her heart race. \u201cHoney, that\u2019s a given.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing. After everything we\u2019ve \u2014\u201d</p><p>She put her hand over his mouth. \u201cI remember what we did.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly realized he\u2019d made a wrong turn. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMcDonald\u2019s. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have plenty of food at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cheeseburger will hold me until we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p><p>A minute later he understood why she was suddenly being so cooperative. She knew McDonald\u2019s was closed. By the time they got home, he was in too much of a hurry to get her undressed to think about food. She wanted to shower, and that was fine with him, as long as he could get in the shower with her.</p><p>They fell into bed together and made love again. He pressed her down into the mattress, held her hands prisoner above her head, and told her all the loving words he needed to say and she needed to hear.</p><p>Then it was her turn. \u201cSay it,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She wanted to be practical. \u201cWhen you get home and get back into your routine \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll look back on this as a . . . fling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to have our first fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled up in her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He was so pleased he kissed her; then he rolled onto his side and pulled her up against him. She cried all over his chest. He knew why.</p><p>She thought he would return to Boston and go on with his life . . . without her.</p><p>He would have gotten angry if he hadn\u2019t remembered that the woman he loved didn\u2019t know squat about men. He waited until she was finished crying and was hiccupping. Stroking her back, he said, \u201cI dated Rebecca for a year before she moved in. We lived together for another year before we got married, and you know what?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head so she could see his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know her as well as I already know you. Life\u2019s too short, Michelle. I want to be with you. I want to grow old with you.\u201d</p><p>She desperately wanted to believe him. She knew he was telling the truth, but she was also convinced that, once he returned to his job in Boston and his friends and family, he would realize he belonged there.</p><p>\u201cMarry me, Michelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go back to Boston. If you feel the way you do now in six months, then ask me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay away from you that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be sensible about this. Six months,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He pushed her on her back and rolled on top of her, bracing his weight with his arms. God, how he loved her. Even when she was being stubborn.</p><p>He stopped arguing. He had other things on his mind now. He began to nuzzle her as he nudged her thighs apart.</p><p>\u201cYou win, sweetheart. Six months.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</p><p>He lasted three long miserable weeks.</p><p>Then he called the movers, put his boats up for sale, packed the trunk of his car, and drove to Bowen. He stopped by The Swan first, shook Jake\u2019s hand, and formally asked for permission to marry his daughter.</p><p>Then he went home. To Michelle. He knocked on the door, and when she answered, he pulled her into his arms and told her, in no uncertain terms, that he had no intention of staying away from the woman he loved for six months. He was there to stay, and she was going to have to deal with it.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t arguing with him \u2014 she was too busy trying to kiss him \u2014 but Theo was on a roll and couldn\u2019t stop. He told her he would open an office in Bowen and give the sleazy attorneys in St. Claire some competition, that he would also do some government work in New Orleans a couple of days a week \u2014 Justice wasn\u2019t going to let him go \u2014 and that he had enough money invested to keep their heads well above water.</p><p>He could actually retire now, thanks to his sister, Jordan. He and the others in the family had invested in her company, and she had made them a small fortune. And one last thing, he added as he dodged her hands, he had already called Conrad and informed him that he would be signing the coaching contract.</p><p>Then he kissed her and told her how much he loved her.</p><p>\u201cI came to Bowen in search of what I had lost. I wanted to feel that passion and energy again. Now I feel alive. My life is here with you, Michelle. I\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down her face. \u201cI love you, Theo.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her tight. \u201cIf you ever send me away again, I swear I\u2019ll do something so embarrassing, you\u2019ll never live it down. The people in Bowen will be telling our grandchildren about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a doctor,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cNothing embarrasses me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? So then if I call the hospital while you\u2019re making rounds, you won\u2019t be embarrassed when I have the operator page Dr. Smarty-pants?\u201d</p><p>She pulled back so she could look into his eyes. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never send you away again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>The tension eased out of his shoulders and he relaxed. \u201cI want you to go with me to my brother\u2019s wedding next weekend. It\u2019s in Iowa. I want you to meet my family, and they\u2019ll all be there. Okay, sweetheart?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTheo, are you sure \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cYou can get Landusky to cover for you, can\u2019t you? Your dad told me you still haven\u2019t taken a vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you talk to Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped by The Swan on my way here. Will you marry me, Michelle?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d As simple as that. The joy she felt was overwhelming, and she began to cry.</p><p>\u201cI asked your dad for permission to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cried.\u201d</p><p>She got teary-eyed again.

Everyone\u2019s been trying to help you catch a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s why there weren\u2019t any \u2018Welcome to Bowen\u2019 cards with all that food. How come you didn\u2019t figure it out? Everyone knew we belonged together, everyone but you.\u201d</p><p>Before she could get upset over the conspiracy, he kissed her again. Then he checked the time.</p><p>\u201cGotta go, sweetheart. I don\u2019t want to be late for practice.\u201d</p> <p>She stood on the porch watching as he drove away. Then she sighed. She had a wedding to plan. She thought about all the things she would need to get done and decided that if she rushed, she could throw it together in six months. That was doable. Yes, six months.</p><p>They were married in three.</p><p>The wedding was elegant. The reception was a blowout. Michelle\u2019s brothers, Remy and John Paul, were groomsmen, and Theo\u2019s sisters, Jordan and Sydney, were bridesmaids. His brother Nick was Theo\u2019s best man, and Mary Ann was Michelle\u2019s maid of honor.</p><p>The bride was radiant, but terribly nervous as she held on to her daddy\u2019s arm on that long walk down the center aisle of the church. When the groom stepped forward, looking so devastatingly handsome in his tuxedo, and winked at her, she began to relax.</p><p>Daddy had wanted to rent a fancy ballroom in one of the expensive New Orleans hotels, but Theo and Michelle wouldn\u2019t hear of it. They wanted the reception to take place at The Swan.</p><p>Since they wouldn\u2019t compromise, Daddy gave in and decided then to use a little bit of his inheritance from Catherine to spruce the place up. He left the swan on top of the building alone because he felt the wing hanging down gave the place a little added charm, but he paved the parking lot, rented a big white tent, and filled it with flowers and tables covered in white linen cloths.</p><p>He hired a band too, but at the last minute Theo\u2019s brother Zachary had to fill in for the drummer, Elton Spinner, who had flown the coop as soon as he heard how many law enforcement officers would be attending the affair. It seemed that Elton still had that warrant hanging over his head.</p><p>Theo stood next to his brother Nick, watching Michelle dance with their father. Laurant, Nick\u2019s bride, was dancing with little John Patrick; Noah and Mary Ann were glued to each other as they swayed to the music, while Daddy twirled Theo\u2019s mother around and around.</p> <p>\u201cAny word yet on John Russell? Or Monk?\u201d Nick asked. \u201cNoah told me they\u2019re following every lead . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re closing in. It won\u2019t be long before they get both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an optimistic outlook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s my wedding day. I\u2019m allowed to be optimistic.\u201d</p><p>Nick changed the subject to a more pleasant one. \u201cNoah and Jake won that tournament?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they did. They donated the cash to the football team. All the players are getting new cleats, and Jake\u2019s trying to figure out a way he can advertise The Swan on the side of the shoes.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled. \u201cSo, now you\u2019re a football coach on top of everything else, huh?\u201d</p><p>Theo couldn\u2019t take his gaze off his beautiful bride long enough to look at his brother. \u201cYeah, I am. Go figure.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be nice having a doctor in the family. So tell me,\u201d he said, elbowing his brother to get his attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d what happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you end up being a coach?\u201d</p><p>Theo grinned. \u201cThere was this kid . . .\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</p><p>It was another glorious night in paradise. The air was crisp and clean; the sky was filled with stars shining down on the golden city.</p><p>Dressed in a silk robe and suede slippers, John stood on the terrace of his palatial penthouse apartment, looking out at the night. Life didn\u2019t get any better than this. He took a drink of the warm brandy in the crystal snifter and sighed with contentment. The sweet fragrances of the night swirled around him.</p><p>This was utopia. He had a new life, a new identity, and so much money he would never have to touch the principal. He could live like a king on the interest alone. And that was more glorious to him than his surroundings.</p><p>Behind him, he heard the rustle of clothing and knew the woman was getting dressed. She called out to him. He glanced back just as she blew him a kiss and walked out the door. This one, he thought, had been better than any of the others, and he knew he would have her again. She was so creative in bed, so brashly uninhibited. Perhaps he would call her tomorrow, but then he remembered the blond he had scheduled to entertain him. What was her name? He couldn\u2019t remember. He did remember how she had intrigued him. She reminded him a little of Dallas, and perhaps that was why he wanted her. A remembrance of the past. The Sowing Club. It seemed a lifetime ago, yet it had only been a little over six months since he\u2019d climbed into that plane. Dallas and Preston were dead. He\u2019d read about them in the paper, and he often found himself wondering exactly how they had died. Had Buchanan killed them, or had the other one shot them? What was his name? Clayborne. Yes, that was it.</p><p>Ironic, he thought, that the weakest member of the club had survived. Poor, poor Cameron. John knew how claustrophobic he was. How was he enjoying prison life, he wondered, and then he smiled. Had his mind snapped yet?</p><p>Monk was probably dead. John had seen the blood on his shirt. He wouldn\u2019t have risked getting medical aid, and John thought he probably crawled into a hole somewhere like a wounded animal, hiding while he died.</p><p>He finished his brandy and put the glass on the table.
