Colt was in bed.</p><p>He was even laying face down on a puffy tie-dyed quilt with a woman beside him. However, he was not basking in the afterglow of red-hot sex, rather, he was grimacing in pain from the sensation of a red-hot poker jabbing him in the butt for the millionth time.</p><p>\u201cFuck. That hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost done. Two more quick stitches and you\u2019ll be good to go,\u201d Doctor Monroe trilled in that annoyingly chipper voice of hers.</p> <p>Go. Right. Where the hell was he supposed to go?</p><p>Snip snip. Murmured words. Everything was going fuzzy. With his previous substance abuse issues he\u2019d refused the torturous Doc\u2019s Lorelei James</p><p>painkillers, so he figured the adrenaline high was wearing off and he was about to crash. Hard.</p><p>Great. Just what he didn\u2019t need. To look even more pathetic, helpless and weak.</p><p>\u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d</p><p>Colt lifted his head and glared at the woman with the whiskey-rough voice who\u2019d dared to speak to him. Any other time the remorse swimming in those amazing sapphire eyes would sway him to be soft and sweet with her.</p> <p>Not now. Maybe not ever again.</p><p>He kept his tone cool, even when he wanted to scream his fool head off at her. \u201cNot so bad? For who? Jesus Christ, Indy, you shot me in the ass. It don\u2019t get a whole lot worse than that.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident.\u201d</p><p>Colt grunted.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come barging in like that anyway?\u201d India\u2019s pulse skipped when he cranked his head around and glared at her.</p><p>Again.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? Three punks were hassling you. You were by yourself. At night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo? It\u2019s not the first time, nor will it be the last. Besides, I had it under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure didn\u2019t look like it. Why didn\u2019t you shoot them with the nail gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have if I\u2019d thought of it.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Monroe said, \u201cWell, whatever her intentions were, you\u2019re very lucky she had a bad angle and the nail only went through the dermis and not into the bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d The smell of antiseptic burned strong for a second.</p><p>The sound of ripping paper was followed by the snapping removal of latex gloves. Dr. Monroe said, \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want a painkiller, Colt? That local anesthetic will wear off in another two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that.\u201d She patted him on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll swing by tomorrow to check on you to make sure there\u2019s no infection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that what the tetanus shot was for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The only reason I\u2019m not admitting you to the hospital is because of the...delicate nature of the wound\u2019s location. The gossipmongers in this town would have a field day with this incident, especially in light of your previous reputation, so I understand why your brother thought it\u2019d be best if you were treated here.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThat said, if you feel feverish and uncommonly sore at any time in the next twelve hours, you\u2019d better get this butt to the ER. Pronto.\u201d</p><p>India said, \u201cWhat does he do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep. As much sleep as he can get. Motrin every six hours, if he\u2019ll take it.\u201d Doctor Monroe stood and fastened the metal clasp on her black medical bag. She said in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019m going to suggest you leave him be, India. Is there someone else who can keep an eye on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? He\u2019s in my guest room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you seem to...agitate him and he needs to rest.\u201d</p><p>Heat scorched her cheeks. Dammit. She wasn\u2019t completely inept when it came to caring for another person. She could do this Florence Nightingale shit.</p><p>Cam McKay ambled over. \u201cAfter I drop the doc off, I can come back and watch him tonight if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop whispering. I\u2019m right here in the room,\u201d Colt snapped.</p><p>India and Cam exchanged a look. When Colt attempted to lift up off the mattress, Cam put his hand in the middle of Colt\u2019s back and gently held him down. \u201cWhoa. Take it easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wouldn\u2019t want to agitate you any more than I already have,\u201d India retorted sweetly.</p><p>Colt locked his gaze to hers. She withheld a shiver at the command in the dark blue depths. \u201cIndia stays. She\u2019s the one who went all psycho carpenter on my ass, she can damn well take care of me.\u201d He flashed her a smile reminiscent of a shark about to bite. \u201cI sorta like the idea of you playin\u2019 fetch and carry for me, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that it\u2019s settled, we\u2019re off.\u201d Cam set Colt\u2019s cell phone within reach. \u201cI\u2019ll check on you later.\u201d To India, he said, \u201cYou need anything, call my cell, not the station, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She followed Cam and Doc Monroe down the staircase that opened into the back parking lot. She slid the deadbolt on the door and flipped the lock.</p><p>Man. What a wacky night. India sucked in a deep breath to quell her sudden bout of nerves. It didn\u2019t make sense she was jumpy. She\u2019d been alone with Colt McKay hundreds of times in the last three years.</p><p>But not after you shot him in the butt.</p><p>The whole thing bordered on surreal. Three guys had stumbled in demanding matching tattoos. She\u2019d told them to leave, pointing to the sign she didn\u2019t ink anyone under the influence. After sweet-talking her didn\u2019t work, they\u2019d become belligerent. India had dealt with enough drunks she took it in stride when they threatened her with macho bullshit. As if that Neanderthal behavior would somehow get her to change her mind? Please.</p><p>She\u2019d just about convinced them to leave, when Colt and Cameron burst in. Colt\u2019s hostile posture was bad enough, but Cam had just gotten off duty with the Crook County Sheriff\u2019s Department and still wore his uniform. And his sidearm.</p><p>The guys panicked and ran out the back door, knocking over a makeshift sawhorse table loaded with tools.</p><p>Cam gave chase as well as a prosthetic-wearing cop could.</p><p>In the melee, Colt bent over to pick up the tools and India grabbed the big framing nail gun. As she was trying to avoid stepping on screws scattered like tacks, she tripped over the compressor hose and fell...right into Colt. More specifically, right into Colt\u2019s butt. Upon contact with a solid surface, the nail gun\u2019s triggering mechanism released a three-inch screw. Right through Colt\u2019s Wranglers, penetrating the bottom of his left butt cheek.</p><p>Colt hadn\u2019t screamed in agony. He\u2019d just dropped to his hands and knees, asking her to put the nail gun on the counter.</p><p>By the time Cam returned, Colt\u2019s wound was seeping blood.</p><p>Cam, being the levelheaded sort, tried to convince Colt to go to the hospital. Colt refused.</p><p>After a few minutes of fruitless arguing, Colt did the damndest thing. He pushed to his feet, snagged a pair of pliers from the jumbled tool pile and headed up the back staircase to India\u2019s apartment, almost at a dead run.</p><p>Cam and India raced after Colt and wrangled him to the closest horizontal surface\u2014the bed in the spare bedroom\u2014and Cam called his good buddy Doctor Monroe. India wondered just how good of \u201cfriends\u201d Cam and the doctor were because the doc showed up within ten minutes.</p><p>After Doctor Monroe pulled the nail out, she administered a local anesthetic and a tetanus shot, which appeared to cause Colt more discomfort than the injury.</p><p>India forced herself to watch him get stitched up even though it was only three stitches. Blood and needles were part of the tattoo business and had never bothered her. So why did the sight of Colt\u2019s blood cause her stomach to heave?</p><p>You weren\u2019t close to barfing. You sucked down too many Red Bulls, that\u2019s all.</p><p>If that was true, why was she cowering outside the room?</p><p>Guilt? Fear he\u2019d light into her now that they were alone?</p><p>Screw that. Colt couldn\u2019t make her feel any worse than she already did.</p><p>She snuck back in and perched on the folding chair next to the bed Doc Monroe had vacated.</p><p>Colt\u2019s hair was damp and disheveled. The muscles in his jaw were bunched tight. His chest rose and fell quickly with every shallow breath. His entire body rivaled the bedside table for rigidity.</p><p>India wished she could soothe his pain. Would it relax him if she smoothed the frown lines from his feverish brow? If she ruffled her fingers through his glossy black hair would his eyes close in bliss? If she rubbed his broad shoulders would he groan with satisfaction? If she placed her lips on his would he welcome her kiss?</p><p>Kissing him? Where the hell had that idea come from? Colt was her buddy, her best pal, her sounding board, her client. Not to mention her A.A. sponsoree. She shot him a quick glance.</p><p>Sometimes that fact was a damn crying shame.</p><p>No doubt Colt McKay was a fine-looking man. Too good looking to be honest. He had the face of an angel\u2014a fallen angel to be sure\u2014a sinful smile rivaling the devils for temptation, the muscled body of a disciplined athlete, and more charms than a damn jewelry store. He was, simply put, perfect.</p><p>Perfectly off limits, not that he\u2019d ever given any indication he\u2019d be interested in her beyond friendship.</p><p>There\u2019s the real reason to cry.</p><p>Colt\u2019s fiery blue eyes focused on her.</p><p>She had no earthly idea what raced through his brain when he looked at her like that, but she liked it. She set her hand on his shoulder, jerking it when he flinched. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. It just surprised me, that\u2019s all. You never touch me like that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Do you want me to touch you like that? \u201cI\u2019m...\u201d India blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cDammit, Colt. I\u2019m sorry. So freakin\u2019 sorry. I\u2019m such a klutz. I didn\u2019t mean to shoot you in the butt.\u201d</p><p>He merely stared at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could kiss it and make it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. Does it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not gonna pucker up, I\u2019d be grateful for some Motrin.\u201d</p> <p>India leapt to her feet. \u201cNo problem.\u201d She hustled to the nightstand for a glass of water and shook out two orange pills.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Colt popped the pills and took a big drink. The second gulp left him sputtering and water droplets clung to the bristle on his cheeks.</p><p>Without thinking, she wicked the moisture away with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cGod. Your hands are so cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d India moved her hand but Colt caught her wrist.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. It feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. My face is on fire.\u201d</p><p>When she stroked his face, from his forehead to his chin, he expelled a long sigh. India couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away from how Colt\u2019s sharp facial features contrasted with his full lips. For the longest time she just touched him, studying him, sort of like she was seeing him for the first time.</p><p>Finally, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. You\u2019re never quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019ll be better by meeting night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me about anything but A.A.\u201d He shifted his position.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the last tattoo you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing too exciting. Another college girl bringing in a Chinese symbol her friend had found online that \u2018means\u2019 something significant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words...\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplete and total bullshit. For all I know\u2014and all she knows\u2014I could\u2019ve tattooed the Chinese symbol for outhouse above her butt.\u201d</p><p>Colt laughed softly.</p><p>Encouraged by his laughter, she kept talking. \u201cA couple days ago a big, burly biker came in and wanted a bumblebee done on each thigh above his kneecaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn an outburst of passion, some hot chick swore he was the</p><p>\u2018bees knees\u2019 so he demanded the moment be forever immortalized on his hairy skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kiddin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m kidding. Damn, you\u2019re gullible, McKay.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a droll look. \u201cGullible ain\u2019t a word that\u2019s ever fit me, Indy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine it has.\u201d She placed her palm on his cheek.</p><p>During the three years Colt belonged to A.A., he\u2019d told her some of the things he\u2019d done while drunk or high or both. Granted, his past was tame compared to the shit she\u2019d pulled, not that she\u2019d shared the worst of it with anyone and she suspected he held secrets pretty close to his incredible chest too.</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you look at me like that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cUmm. Like what?\u201d Like I wanna lick you up one side and down the other?</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m a lab rat.\u201d</p><p>India let her thumb arc over his cheekbone. \u201cNot a lab rat. A guinea pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. That\u2019s so much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sketched a new tattoo design I\u2019d like to try on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Maybe once my ass is healed you can turn the puncture wound into one of them cool, fake bullet holes you see on motorcycles and pickup tailgates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m an artiste. I have something way better in mind.</p><p>Something hip-fun-sexy-cool.\u201d</p><p>Suspicion clouded Colt\u2019s face. \u201cI already told you. You ain\u2019t tattooing the area around my nipples. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this new pattern is so awesome. Turquoise and orange outlined in black and red, that looks like flames\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, no how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Indy, I said no. Why are you so dang fired up about doin\u2019 this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have great nipples.\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s ardent gaze dropped to her chest. \u201cBein\u2019s that I haven\u2019t seen your nipples, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t return the compliment, sugar.</p><p>But we could rectify that right now. Take off your shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha.\u201d To hide the fact he\u2019d caught her off guard, and that single hot look caused her nipples to stand at attention, she snipped,</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll just use my super cool new design on your cousin, Blake.</p><p>I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be up for it. Especially since he\u2019s already here building some shelves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe while he\u2019s debating ink colors, you could convince the slob to pick up his goddamn tools so innocent bystanders don\u2019t get nail shot in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Whenever India brought up Blake West\u2019s name, Colt became bad-tempered. Not a reaction she understood since Colt and Blake were related and hung out on occasion.</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re busy playin\u2019 with Blake\u2019s nipples, you could pierce them. With little tinkling golden bells. So he can\u2019t sneak up on his flock of sheep when he ain\u2019t pretendin\u2019 to be a carpenter.\u201d</p><p>Why had Colt gone beyond peevish to pissed off? \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. I\u2019m tired. My ass hurts like a mother and I\u2019m supposed to be resting. So shut the light off when you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Colt dismissed her by facing the wall.</p><p>Jerk. She had half a mind to retrieve the nail gun so she could nail his smart mouth shut.</p><p>You have no right to be indignant.</p><p>Still, Colt\u2019s erratic behavior stung. He was usually so even-keeled. So sweet and thoughtful with her. India retreated to her room.</p><p>She stared at the glow-in-the-dark stars glued to her walls and wondered if Colt would freak out when she told him about her date with Blake tomorrow night.</p><p>Way to act like a jealous asshole. If Indy hadn\u2019t guessed you are goofy in love with her before, she\u2019ll know for sure now.</p><p>Colt snorted. Right. He\u2019d eat his hat if that happened. India hadn\u2019t a clue how he felt about her. She\u2019d chalk up his reaction to stress. Or pain. Or frustration.</p><p>Which was fine with him. Better she pick any one of those excuses rather than know the truth: he\u2019d fallen for her so hard he hadn\u2019t looked at another woman in the three years since she\u2019d come into his life.</p><p>He knew it was stupid. Indy was his best friend. Their friendship was the most important thing in his life and he\u2019d be a fool to jeopardize it.</p><p>The fact she maintained their friendship after hearing about his sordid past, made him extra cautious not to screw that up, like he\u2019d screwed up every other relationship. Plus, since she was his A.A. sponsor, it\u2019d put her in a sticky situation if they started knocking boots. India was too important to the local organization to chance taking a tumble with the infamous former bad boy loser Colt McKay.</p><p>If you\u2019re such a loser, why does India end up with you all the time anyway?</p><p>Good question. They were together at least three times a week\u2014not all of them A.A. related. Colt knew her love life was as pathetic as his. Did her feisty, in-your-face personality scare men away? Or was it the tattoos, piercings, and hard-edged eyes that kept men wary? Hell, it was hard to pick which of those characteristics was his favorite when it came to Indy.</p><p>Yeah, they were a pair all right.</p><p>Sprawled in an unfamiliar bed, dissecting why his life was a mess even when he was clean and sober, Colt squinted at the caller ID when his phone vibrated. \u201cHey Cam. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust checking in. How you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured. Anyway, I called Dad and told him I\u2019d run into you at the diner and you were on your way out of town for the weekend.</p><p>So you\u2019re clear until Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Dad say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 worth repeating.\u201d</p><p>With some of the family issues he\u2019d had recently, it was a relief Cam had his back, since his other brothers probably would say something smart about his weekend getaway. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019m working a twelve-hour shift from noon to midnight tomorrow. You need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Extra clothes. Bring me a pair of sweats since the ones that were in my gym bag stink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI moved it to the fenced lot behind the building. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to make sure it was outta sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a cop. I did actually think about stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the only thing I can do.\u201d The second the words left his mouth Colt wanted to suck them back in. His piss-ant injury was nothing compared to what Cam had suffered. In combat. On the other side of the planet. Alone. Or what he suffered every day, dealing with his handicap, physically and emotionally. \u201cShit, man, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 to be sorry about, bro. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Colt was bored out of his fucking mind.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to sleep. But every time he\u2019d dozed off, oh-so-helpful India popped in to check on him. And for some bizarre reason, checking on him meant touching him. She\u2019d place her cool hands on his forehead. On his cheek. Then on the back of his neck.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d barged in, he barely stopped from demanding she wrap her hands around his cock because that\u2019s where he was the most feverish.</p><p>Yeah, he was definitely punchy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colt\u2019s cell phone vibrated.

Ranchin\u2019 with the family ain\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>Cam snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s rich, coming from you. How you feelin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I could\u2019ve been facin\u2019 forward and she could\u2019ve shot me in the dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. Anyway, thought I\u2019d give you a heads up. Blake will be there tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn India\u2019s apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is he doin\u2019 some remodeling for her after hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They, ah, have a date.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in Colt\u2019s gut tightened. \u201cGolden boy ain\u2019t pouring drafts tonight at the Rusty Spur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you hear this gossip? The diner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in the diner today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell? You\u2019re in there like three times a day.\u201d Cam had a thing for sweet, shy Domini, the cook/waitress/hostess at Dewey\u2019s Delish Dish, the restaurant next door to the tattoo shop.</p><p>\u201cThere are other places in town I can get dirty looks with my morning coffee,\u201d Cam said without humor. \u201cAnyway, I ran into Blake at the Super-Value. He was buying flowers, I asked him what for, and he mentioned his date with India.\u201d</p><p>Just what Colt didn\u2019t need, to hear Indy and Blake laughing, having a good old time, while he was hiding in the spare bedroom.</p><p>Or worse, feeling like a pervert at hearing them squeaking the mattress springs.</p><p>\u201cWhy you tellin\u2019 me this?\u201d Colt snapped.</p><p>A weighted pause hung. Finally, Cam sighed. \u201cColt, man, it\u2019s me. No bullshit between us, remember? I know you\u2019ve got it bad for her. Probably have for years, huh? I just didn\u2019t want you to be caught off guard. Thought maybe you prefer to clear out.\u201d</p><p>Right then, Colt decided rather than let his imagination run wild about what Blake and Indy had done, he\u2019d stay and learn what they were doing firsthand. \u201cThanks. I appreciate the warning, but I\u2019ll stick around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure that\u2019s the smartest choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But depending on what happens with them...it\u2019ll give me a reason to move on, either way. Time to fish or cut bait, know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya. Just don\u2019t do anything stupid that\u2019ll bring me there in an official capacity tonight, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. And, uh, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob. Think you\u2019ll feel up to working out this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I ain\u2019t sittin\u2019 on a rowing machine, I oughta be good. Why? You ain\u2019t thinkin\u2019 of pussing out on me, are ya, matey?\u201d</p><p>Cam laughed. \u201cNo chance, rummy. I can still whip your shot-up ass on the treadmill, even with a peg leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it.\u201d Colt hung up. He slowly rolled over and glanced at the clock. Roughly an hour before India closed up shop. Maybe if he was lucky he could get a little shut-eye.</p><p>The outer apartment door slammed ten minutes later, followed by the squeak of his door being opened. \u201cColt? You asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Look, I think you need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest, yeah I know. You\u2019ve barged in here like a hundred times today. You are single-handedly keeping me from getting any rest.\u201d</p><p>India blinked. \u201cBut, that\u2019s not what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Doc Monroe mentioned if I didn\u2019t have enough downtime there was a higher chance of infection and complications.\u201d Colt raked a hand over his stubbled jaw. \u201cSo soon as you feed me, I\u2019d appreciate it if you piped down so I can conk out for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to come up with dinner for you? Tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t like I\u2019m up to cookin\u2019.\u201d Might make him a jerk, but Colt loved her wide-eyed expression of alarm. It wasn\u2019t his fault he was laid up; it was hers. And he had no intention of letting her off the hook so easily. Especially about Blake.</p><p>\u201cAh. I have plans tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I hope you\u2019re makin\u2019 me something good to eat, because I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cNo. I mean I have plans to go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut as in...out to grab us some food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...no. Out as in, out on a date.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cYou have a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, tonight.\u201d</p><p>Colt laughed. He kept laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so damn funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. Whoa.\u201d He clutched his stomach. \u201cYou really had me goin\u2019 there for a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you going? What the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. Stop kiddin\u2019 around, Indy. It hurts when I laugh.\u201d</p><p>India actually stomped her foot. \u201cYou find the fact I have a date... funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He laughed harder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sugar, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop laughing.\u201d India crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019m single, I\u2019m fun, and it\u2019s Saturday night. It is not that far out of the realm of possibility that some man would want to take me out and show me a good time.\u201d</p><p>Instantly Colt sobered. \u201cWhere\u2019s this mystery man takin\u2019 you for the rip-roarin\u2019 good time in the Sundance metro area?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut...where? Not out dancin\u2019, \u2019cause you don\u2019t dance. Not out drinkin\u2019, \u2019cause you don\u2019t drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are lots of other places we can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Name one.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened. And closed. Opened and closed again. She looked like an air-starved trout, not that he\u2019d voice the comparison out loud.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it you, complaining to me, just last Saturday night, that there was nothin\u2019 to do in this town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m curious as to what\u2019s changed in seven days.\u201d</p><p>Those beautiful sapphire eyes sparked danger. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s it matter to you?\u201d</p><p>Colt reined in his temper. Barely. \u201cTwo reasons. One, because damn near every Saturday night for the last two and a half years, I\u2019ve heard you whine about the lack of entertainment options. I\u2019ve offered to take you to rodeos, church socials, tractor pulls, community dances, demolition derbys, casinos, on horseback rides, fishin\u2019, campin\u2019, huntin\u2019 and concerts. What have we ended up doin\u2019 nearly every Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>She kept her mulish mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cWatchin\u2019 movies or playin\u2019 cards or cooking dinner. So yeah, maybe I am interested in what kind of fun and games this guy has offered you that I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>India glared at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waitin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. He\u2019s cooking me dinner and then we\u2019re watching a movie at his place.\u201d</p><p>He grinned even when he considered what a rat bastard his cousin Blake was and how much he\u2019d like to kick his ass.</p><p>\u201cOh, wipe that smile off your face, McKay. You said there were two reasons. What\u2019s the other reason you\u2019re being so damn snoopy about my personal life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m snoopy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither that or you\u2019re living vicariously through me.\u201d</p><p>Colt opened his mouth to protest, then clamped his teeth together, choosing to glower at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Did I hit too close to home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>She stalked closer. \u201cNo. You thought it was so damn funny that a man would actually want to spend time with me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly have I been doin\u2019 with you every weekend for the last two and a half years, huh?\u201d Besides spinning my wheels?</p><p>\u201cSpending time with me, but it\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we are not dating.\u201d She lifted both pierced eyebrows, drawing his attention to the sexy silver hoops. \u201cOmigod, Colt. All this time, you haven\u2019t thought we were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I ain\u2019t that stupid,\u201d he retorted. \u201cI just find it ironic that after you shot me in the ass, and I\u2019m layin\u2019 here in your house, in pain, you\u2019ve got no problem leavin\u2019 me here while you\u2019re flitting off to go on a damn date.\u201d</p><p>India did her trout impression again.</p><p>Jesus. Way to sound like a needy, bitter bastard, McKay.</p><p>\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t think, which is typical behavior for you, Miz Impulsive, so I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go. I\u2019m tired.\u201d Colt shut his eyes and rolled to his side, giving her his back.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go,\u201d he repeated. \u201cShut the door on your way out. Oh, and have a freakin\u2019 awesome time on your date.\u201d</p><p>He heard her shallow breathing as she debated on berating him or leaving him.</p><p>Guess which one she chose?</p><p>The door snicked softly as she let herself out.</p><p>Colt felt neither vindicated nor relieved.</p><p>Damn him. Her first real date in forever and Colt McKay had sucked all the fun out of it before she\u2019d even left the house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>India threw the hairbrush in the sink. She snatched the gel from the cabinet and squirted the orange goo in her palms, rubbing it vigorously into her hair. Bah. It didn\u2019t help. She still looked like a porcupine who\u2019d lost a fight with a weed whacker. Plus, she needed to recolor the tips. The fuchsia was fading into a hideous bubblegum pink.</p><p>What the hell did it matter what her hair looked like? It wasn\u2019t like they were going to be in public.</p><p>She froze. Was that why Blake wanted to cook for her at his place? Because the colorful tats and piercings were what most folks noticed and he was embarrassed by it?</p> <p>Not Colt.</p><p>Why had everything circled back around to him?</p><p>Because you hurt him. And not just from shooting him in the butt with the nail gun.</p><p>That stupid voice in her head was mistaken. She had not hurt Colt McKay\u2019s feelings by agreeing to a date with Blake. She and Colt were friends. That was it.</p><p>Right?</p> <p>Wrong. Colt\u2019s been more to you than just a friend, no matter how you slice it. And he deserves better than you running off for a date\u2014a date you didn\u2019t want in the first place\u2014with his cousin.</p><p>Blast it. Why had India said yes to Blake West? Sure, he was cute, golden curls, a brawny build and a bright white smile. He reminded her of the shaggy-haired surfers she\u2019d grown up with in California. Blake was a cheerful guy, happy to help out his cousins Chet and Remy West whenever they were shorthanded in their construction business. Blake was sweet. He didn\u2019t have a horndog reputation. He was low-key, just the type of guy India wanted.</p><p>With one teensy-tiny little problem: when Blake West wasn\u2019t tending his sheep, he tended bar.</p><p>India avoided bars and nightclubs even eight years into her sobriety, so hooking up with bartender Blake wasn\u2019t a smart move.</p><p>Plus, she had a sneaking suspicion as laid-back as Blake appeared, he wouldn\u2019t go for a casual relationship. He was the kind of guy who\u2019d want exclusivity and promises, promises she couldn\u2019t give him or any man.</p><p>Could you give those promises to Colt?</p> <p>Yes.</p><p>No.</p><p>Dammit! She was not listening to the voices arguing in her head. Colt was her friend. And she was not going to cancel her date because of one ornery cowboy who was being a pain in her butt. He was a guest in her house. Her house, her rules, she could do whatever the hell she wanted.</p><p>She picked up her cell phone and dialed Blake\u2019s number. \u201cHey, Blake. No, Alfredo sauce sounds great. Look. I just wondered...if you wanted to come over here after dinner? Why? Well...\u201d India laughed. \u201cYou busted me. That\u2019d be great. I\u2019ve even got a fresh batch of apple dumplings from the diner.\u201d She hoped she still had time to pop downstairs and raid the pie case before Domini sold out.</p><p>\u201cI might be a little late, just wanted to warn you. Good. I\u2019m looking forward to it too. Bye.\u201d</p><p>India grabbed her purse and raced down to the diner to pick up dumplings. She might as well grab dinner for Colt.</p><p>Four dumplings, one quart of chicken and wild rice soup, a grilled tomato and cheese sandwich later, India booked it back to her apartment.</p><p>She burst into the guest bedroom, startling Colt out of sleep.</p> <p>\u201cChrist, India. Do you have to scare the livin\u2019 hell out of me every goddamn time you open the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I just wanted to get the food to you while it was still hot.\u201d She set everything on the dresser and spun around to give him a once-over. \u201cSoup is kinda hard to eat laying down. Let me help you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. Just hold on.\u201d Threading her fingers through his, she pulled him to a sitting position. \u201cThere. That wasn\u2019t so bad.</p><p>Let\u2019s get you to the chair. Stand up on three. Ready? One. Two.</p><p>Three.\u201d India jerked, hoping to take some of the strain. But she jerked too hard and he crashed into her.</p><p>\u201cShit. Too fast. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d Oh, he was a substantial guy. She braced her legs and smashed her face into his chest while maintaining a death grip on his upper back.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019m I so dizzy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLow blood sugar. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s hands reluctantly landed on her hips. Almost against his will, he allowed her to hold him up.</p><p>As India\u2019s nose brushed Colt\u2019s pecs and her hands were spread across that incredibly muscular back, she felt his fingers squeezing her hipbones. A powerful sense of...longing overtook her. He was so solid and warm and he smelled all musky good like a man should and she absolutely did not want to let him go. Ever.</p><p>\u201cIndy?\u201d he said her name in a husky whisper.</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can make it to the chair now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d She released him and settled him in the seat. \u201cDo you need an extra pillow for your butt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab the TV tray and be right back.\u201d After she\u2019d arranged the soup and sandwich and refilled his water, she felt him staring at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do all this.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse raced when she gazed into his compelling blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to. I\u2019m sorry about leaving you here alone tonight. I should\u2019ve cancelled the date\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who oughta be apologizing. I was a total dick.</p><p>Who you date and what you do on your dates ain\u2019t any of my business.\u201d He gave her a head to toe inspection. \u201cYou look great, by the way. I\u2019ve always loved that shirt on you. Brings out the color of your eyes.\u201d He smiled. \u201cAnd sometimes, it matches the color of your hair.\u201d</p><p>She self-consciously adjusted the vivid blue satin strap on her baby doll blouse. \u201cUh. Thanks. I thought I might dye the ends blue tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my favorite.\u201d Colt stirred his soup and blew on a spoonful before popping it in his mouth.</p><p>Favorite what? Color on her hair? Or kind of soup? Soup, probably. \u201cWould you like crackers?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you need ketchup for your sandwich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cYou\u2019ve been cookin\u2019 for Eliza again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and we both know grilled cheese is about the extent of my culinary expertise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit hovering and get goin\u2019. You don\u2019t wanna be late.\u201d</p><p>Lightly, she said, \u201cSeems like you\u2019re trying to get rid of me.\u201d</p><p>His laser-sharp gaze pierced hers again. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other and the air crackled with energy.</p><p>Colt cleared his throat. \u201cJust so you know, I probably won\u2019t be around in the mornin\u2019 if you choose to, ah, not come back here. You don\u2019t have to worry about me blabbing your personal business and I\u2019ll lock up for you since I already have a key.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cOmigod. You don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to sleep with Blake on the first date, do you?\u201d</p><p>Pause. His eyes tapered to fine points. \u201cYou\u2019re goin\u2019 out with Blake? As in my cousin Blake? As in the guy whose nail gun took a chunk out of my ass?\u201d</p><p>She winced. Crap, she\u2019d forgotten to tell him that. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you agree before or after his machinery maimed me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore. Look, he asked me while he was putting up shelves in the shop. I\u2019ve cancelled on him two times already, so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t back out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do. He\u2019s interested in getting a tattoo on his\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colt held up his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna know where you\u2019re tattooing him, to be real honest.\u201d</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>\u201cYou go on and have fun. Much as I complain about him, Blake is a really good guy. He\u2019ll treat you right.\u201d</p><p>She was tempted to snap off, how nice that I have your approval, but that\u2019d be bitchy and she\u2019d acted bitchy enough. And truthfully, she didn\u2019t want his approval. She much preferred his smartass disapproval or his...jealousy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wait up,\u201d she said half-jokingly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. With you gone for a few hours, I\u2019ll probably finally sleep like the dead. I won\u2019t notice if you do come home in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>Six hours later, India slammed the door a little harder than necessary when she and Blake returned to her apartment.</p><p>They finished off the caramel apple dumplings at her dinette table. Coldplay drifted from the stereo. A sharply scented lemon verbena candle filled the air.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you taking a look at it, Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my pleasure.\u201d Blake scraped his fork across the empty plate. \u201cAlthough, I\u2019d hoped the invitation into your bedroom would be extended in a different context, India.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI imagine you did. But I\u2019m not looking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a relationship, yeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know that\u2019s what I was going to say?\u201d</p><p>Blake looked at her from beneath incredibly long black eyelashes. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the same old tune, you\u2019re just a different singer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou run into this problem a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I said, \u2018Blake, baby, let\u2019s burn up the sheets for just one night?\u2019\u201d</p><p>He stood so fast his chair crashed to the floor.</p><p>India laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You think I\u2019d turn you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019ll admit you don\u2019t seem like a one-night stand kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. I totally am that guy, it\u2019s just the ladies don\u2019t give me a chance.

How old are you?\u201d He shook his finger at her.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t pull that \u2018never ask a woman her age\u2019 crap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty...something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, you don\u2019t look a day over twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you attend the same cowboy charm school as your cousin Colt? Or is it inbred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCowboy charm is part of our DNA, darlin\u2019. None of us can help it.\u201d Blake\u2019s smile faded. \u201cSpeaking of Colt...can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she lied.</p> <p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you two dated? I mean, you are together all the time.\u201d</p><p>All the time was stretching it...wasn\u2019t it? \u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight sound like I\u2019m pandering to you, bein\u2019s we\u2019re on a date and all, but that\u2019s probably a good thing you\u2019re staying just friends.\u201d</p><p>That got her back up. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStubborn people like you two would kill each other.\u201d He smiled. \u201cColt\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s a great friend, actually, but I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to tell you that.\u201d</p><p>No, she already knew. India smiled and changed the subject.</p> <p>\u201cSo how do you want to do this? I\u2019ve got all the stuff in my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, let\u2019s get to it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang.</p><p>Quiet.</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang. Then, \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>A feminine giggle.</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang.</p> <p>Murmured voices.</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang.</p><p>Colt closed his eyes and tried to block out the images of India and Blake. Naked. On the other side of the wall. Naked. Right behind his head. Naked. Rolling around together on the bed. Naked.</p><p>India and Blake going at it like animals. Naked.</p><p>Fuck. Think of something else. Think of water rippling in your favorite fishing hole.</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang.</p><p>Thinking quiet, serene thoughts didn\u2019t work. Maybe he should imagine chaos.</p><p>Think of bawling calves and the frantic momma cows answering moos during branding.</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang.</p><p>Nope. That didn\u2019t do the trick either.</p><p>Think of how India\u2019s sweat-slicked skin would feel sliding beneath yours, her heels digging into your ass as you ride her hard enough to break the damn headboard, not just rattle it.</p><p>Yeah. That was helping. Not.</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how much more of this he could take. He should\u2019ve left when he had the chance, now it was too late. It\u2019d been too late when he\u2019d heard the apartment door slam. When he\u2019d heard the bass tones of Blake\u2019s voice mixed with India\u2019s laughter. When he\u2019d heard the seductive notes from the CD player. When he\u2019d caught a whiff of the candle burning in the living room. When he\u2019d heard India\u2019s bedroom door slam.</p><p>Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>The headboard banging had gotten progressively louder for the last twenty minutes. Twenty very long, very loud minutes.</p><p>It appeared his little cousin was quite the stud.</p><p>Yeah? Then how come you don\u2019t hear India shrieking with orgasmic pleasure? She would be if you were in her bed.</p><p>For Christsake. He\u2019d gone from perverted to pathetic. And the sad thing was, he wasn\u2019t only thinking about tonight. He was thinking about all the nights, over the last few years he\u2019d been pining over a woman who\u2019d never see him as anything but a drunk on the lifelong road to recovery. Or worse, her good friend.</p><p>Enough was enough.</p><p>Wincing, Colt rolled to his feet and snagged his iPod from the dresser. He cranked it to high and lowered onto the bed, placing his feet by the headboard. Nine Inch Nails drowned out everything and he was able to sleep.</p><p>Early the next morning, Colt stumbled out of his room. Despite his intent to crawl in his truck and head home, a shower was a necessity.</p><p>As he crossed the living area, he noticed India\u2019s bedroom door was ajar. He peered through the crack and saw India sprawled in the middle of the bed. Alone. Alone and apparently buck-assed nekkid.</p><p>Red satin sheets were twisted around her long legs and long arms, covering her torso, but hinting at the curves beneath.</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t gawk at her body to see if she was, in fact, pierced everywhere she\u2019d hinted at being pierced. A man could only stand so much temptation. He backtracked to the bathroom.</p><p>The hot water lasted all of five minutes. And did the woman own every blasted lotion and potion known to mankind? He counted fourteen different health and beauty product bottles\u2014after he\u2019d knocked them all into the tub. Twice.</p><p>Still, he felt a million times better after an ice shower. His injury itched, so he took that as a sign of recovery.</p><p>He needed his caffeine fix and didn\u2019t want to stop at the Conoco and chance running into a member of his family. He plugged in India\u2019s fancy coffeemaker and dumped a capful of coffee beans into the grinder. While that machine whirred, he washed the glass coffee pot and the plastic filter basket. It took four cupboards before he found where India had moved the box of paper coffee filters. He filled the water reservoir, reassembled the various parts and hit start.</p><p>Colt picked up the trash in his prison room while he waited for the coffee to brew. When he returned to the kitchen, India stormed out of her bedroom.</p><p>Pity she\u2019d put on a robe.</p><p>\u201cThe one day I get to sleep in and you\u2019re up at the butt crack of dawn making enough noise to wake the dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. It\u2019s different when you\u2019re disturbed out of your beauty sleep. Sucks, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, all I did was make coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain what you were doing in the shower? \u2019Cause it sure as hell sounded like you were throwing rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think your poor head was hurtin\u2019 and it was a hangover talkin\u2019.\u201d Colt clucked his tongue. \u201cMaybe you oughta get to bed earlier if you\u2019re so cranky in the mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what time I went to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno, maybe it was the slamming door at midnight that tipped me off. Or maybe it was your headboard banging against my wall until the wee hours. I got tired of it around one a.m. and listened to my iPod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Blake finished\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. I don\u2019t wanna know about Blake\u2019s big finish because I had enough of the pre-game.\u201d Colt sidestepped her.</p><p>\u201cYou think I slept with him.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, determined not to let it show how much her horizontal mattress mambo with his cousin bothered him.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Her hand circled his wrist and India yanked him around to face her.</p><p>Colt looked into her angry eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a judgmental jerk, Colt McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I didn\u2019t pass judgment. I just pointed out the obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I didn\u2019t even mention the candles and soft music and the laughter that preceded all the bedroom noises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagnanimous of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah! You thought wrong.\u201d India\u2019s finger drilled him in the chest. \u201cAnd it pisses me off that you think so...lowly of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else am I supposed to think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat there\u2019s a logical explanation.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cFor havin\u2019 a man in your bedroom? After midnight? With the bed slamming against the wall? Sugar, sex isn\u2019t the logical answer, it\u2019s the only answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all men have sex on the brain twenty-four hours a day.\u201d</p><p>Tired of her baiting him, Colt crowded her. \u201cAny man with half a fucking brain, who is lucky enough to be in your bedroom at any time, ain\u2019t thinkin\u2019 about nothin\u2019 but how perfect it\u2019d feel to have your hot little body under his. Or on top of his. Or in front of his.</p><p>Over and over. And if it\u2019d been me? Twenty-four hours would be the minimum amount of time I\u2019d keep you in my bed.\u201d</p><p>India stared at him. \u201cIs that what you were thinking about, Colt? Us having sex?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Goddammit, that was all he could think about. Why in the hell couldn\u2019t she see it?</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer, she blurted, \u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with Blake last night, or any other night. Those banging noises you heard? Was him hammering\u2014\u201d</p><p>He actually heard himself growl.</p><p>\u201c\u2014my headboard back together. The last time I moved my bedroom furniture, the bed frame snapped from the headboard base and I asked him to fix it\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colt pushed her against the wall and smashed his mouth down on hers, taking the hot, wet kiss that he\u2019d been dying for.</p><p>God. The softness of her lips. The feel of her fingers twining in his damp hair. The taste of her was as potent and intoxicating as he\u2019d imagined. The warm wetness of her mouth, the eager touch of her tongue to his was like a drug. Colt was half-afraid to open his eyes and find this was a damn dream.</p><p>India wrapped her arms around his neck and pulled him closer, opening her mouth for total access.</p><p>His hands moved from her shoulders to caress her neck. He feathered his thumbs along the length of her jaw, still kissing her senseless, sucking her soft, sexy moans into his lungs like air. His cock was already straining at the waistband of his sweatpants and he\u2019d barely begun.</p><p>She placed her hands on top of his, breaking the kiss to say,</p><p>\u201cTouch me. God, put your hands all over me.\u201d</p><p>Colt was captivated by the sight of her smaller hands guiding his bigger hands down her body. When the base of his palms reached the barrier of her robe, India slid her fingers beneath the lapels and ripped it open.</p><p>Sweet Jesus, her nipples were pierced. With little silver hoops that accentuated the rose-colored tips. His mouth watered. His cock twitched. He groaned and bent his head to taste, helpless to resist.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes.\u201d India arched into him, her hands dropping to squeeze his hips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her skin had warmed the metal. He traced the tiny ring with the very tip of his tongue, then drew the beaded nipple into his mouth.</p><p>With his each rhythmic suck, she dug her fingernails deeper into his skin.</p><p>As Colt kept nuzzling her breasts, kissing a line up her bared throat, using his teeth and his tongue and his lips, somehow one of India\u2019s hands had moved to his groin.</p> <p>His breath stalled and he groaned.</p><p>She took that as a positive sign and she went from rubbing the length of his shaft, to curling her fingers around the base and stroking upward.</p><p>The softness of the fleece beneath the heated grip of her palm felt good, too damn good, because it\u2019d been too damn long since he\u2019d experienced a woman\u2019s touch. She had to stop.</p><p>Colt attempted to knock her hand free, but she\u2019d latched onto his hip with her other hand and held him in place.</p><p>That tingling sensation started and his balls tightened.</p> <p>No, no, no, no. Too soon. He couldn\u2019t blow this fast. He couldn\u2019t embarrass himself by shooting within a minute of her hand touching his cock.</p><p>Before Colt so much as said her name, he began to come.</p><p>Hot spurts shot out the end of his dick, soaking the waistband of his sweatpants. He froze, mortified by being so quick on the trigger. He didn\u2019t even enjoy the first orgasm he\u2019d had in years that hadn\u2019t been brought about by his own hand.</p><p>Luckily it didn\u2019t last long. Colt jerked away from her, ignoring the pain in his ass as he spun around.</p><p>Fuck. Way to be a loser.</p><p>\u201cColt?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t respond, just kept walking toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I came in the blink of an eye? Yeah, I\u2019m really goddamned sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was going to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSave it.\u201d He struggled to slip on his right boot without bending over, by bracing his hand on the wall.</p><p>Then India was in his face. \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Embarrass you and myself? Too fuckin\u2019 late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look embarrassed?\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s gaze traveled the length of her body and back up to her face. \u201cNo, you look beautiful. Jesus, you always look so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He should\u2019ve been hanging his stupid head in shame. Somehow he\u2019d managed to get one boot on. He switched his stance, trying to block her out.</p><p>But India wasn\u2019t about to be deterred. She ducked under his arm so she was closer than before. His determination to ignore her was temporarily sidelined when he noticed the gap in her robe had widened, granting him an even better view of those exquisitely pierced nipples.</p><p>\u201cFine, you\u2019re embarrassed. So I\u2019ve got nothing to lose by asking you to tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since you\u2019ve had sex?\u201d</p><p>Thump. His heel hit the floor as he got the left boot on.</p><p>\u201cA year?\u201d</p><p>Colt laughed.</p><p>\u201cTwo years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry three years.\u201d</p><p>India stared at him with confusion, then understanding dawned.</p><p>\u201cYou mean, you haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad sex since I went through treatment? Nope. I\u2019ve been celibate as long as I\u2019ve been sober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy choice?\u201d</p><p>How the hell was he supposed to answer that? \u201cI hardly remember the last time I had sex. I was drunk. Or high. Or both. So I guess you can say I hardly remember what sex is like or what I\u2019m supposed to do besides come in my pants like a teenage boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you talked about this at meetings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s goddamned business but mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But you could\u2019ve talked to me. One on one. We\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>Colt laughed again, but it held a bitter edge.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t meant to be funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why it is.\u201d He grabbed the plastic grocery bag that held his toothbrush, iPod, extra clothes and started downstairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just leaving?\u201d</p><p>Was that a regretful note in her voice? He didn\u2019t turn around until he reached the landing at the bottom. \u201cDo you want me to stay and finish what we started?\u201d</p><p>India actually backed up a step. A look of surprise\u2014or was it horror?\u2014crossed her face.</p><p>Enough. Her expression told him everything he needed to know: it was time for him to move on, much as it pained him.</p><p>\u201cBut you could stay and we could talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 left to say. See you around.\u201d</p><p>Halfway home Colt realized he never did get a cup of coffee.</p><p>That harsh dose of reality had been enough to kick start his day.</p><p>Thursday evening in the gym, Colt and Cam were sweating and grunting, trying to outdo each other. The best five-mile running time went to Colt, but he admitted there was little victory in beating a man with half his leg gone.</p><p>Cam out bench-pressed Colt by almost fifty pounds. Their sets of crunches were declared a tie, by the Kewpie-doll manning the desk, who couldn\u2019t keep her jailbait eyes off either of them.</p><p>As was their post-workout ritual, they\u2019d toweled off and sat on the wooden bench in the locker room. Colt downed half his water bottle in one gulp. \u201cSo, anything interesting happen in the world of law enforcement today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. How about in the world of the McKay gas baron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you. No one\u2019s ever gonna let me live that down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to? Christ, Colt, you\u2019re the one makin\u2019 the rest of \u2019em look dumb.\u201d</p><p>Colt mopped the sweat from his forehead. \u201cYeah, well it was pretty much dumb luck.\u201d</p><p>Years ago Colt had purchased a small tract of land from a little old ranch widow. At the time it\u2019d taken all his money and some fancy talking to the banker to fund what his family called his \u201cpity\u201d</p><p>venture. He figured he\u2019d hold onto the acreage and figure out if improvements would make it suitable for grazing, if not, he\u2019d sell it.</p><p>A few years passed and a surveyor approached him about testing for methane gas. Colt agreed only because it cost him nothing and he\u2019d managed to retain all mineral rights from the original seller, that sweet old lady, who\u2019d since passed away.</p><p>The surveyor made a startling discovery. Methane gas, in a place where methane gas was not supposed to be. So Colt signed off for a hefty chunk of the profits, and let the company set up a drilling site.</p><p>They hit Wyoming gold.</p><p>After his initial bragging about his cash windfall, and faced with his family\u2019s resentment that the land wasn\u2019t part of the McKay Ranch, hence they got no cut of the profits, he\u2019d taken great pains to downplay his income. Within six years of purchasing the crappy land no one had wanted, Colt earned enough money to survive on his own without his portion of the McKay Ranch or the earnings from it.</p><p>Round about that time, his brother Colby returned to Wyoming after a rodeo career-ending injury. At first, Colt was excited to have his brother back helping with the ranch. But that excitement dimmed when their father gave Colby a large chunk of the responsibilities that\u2019d belonged to Colt.</p><p>Rather than see it as an easing of his workload, Colt saw it as an indictment of his abilities. He began to spend more time in the local honky-tonks. Drinking, chasing women, trying to build a reputation to rival his brother\u2019s and cousin\u2019s.</p><p>It worked, but not in a good way. Colt couldn\u2019t remember exactly when things had spiraled out of control. The year between his younger brother Carter\u2019s wedding, and his cousin Dag\u2019s death, Colt had alienated his family. He worked on the ranch when he felt like it, because he didn\u2019t need the money or the hassle. He drank, started doing drugs, and slept with whoever offered.</p><p>What did his loving brothers do when he\u2019d started that downward spiral? Not a damn thing. Part of him wondered if they wanted him to die\u2014because he was worth far more to them dead than alive.</p><p>The weight machine clanged in the other room, drawing his attention back to Cam who was saying, \u201c...ain\u2019t been in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I spaced out. What\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWondered what was keeping you busy at your place because you ain\u2019t been in town all week.\u201d Cam wiped the sweat dotting his neck. \u201cIndia mentioned you missed the Tuesday night meeting.\u201d</p><p>Unreal. He\u2019d been sober three years and missed one meeting in the last two and a half. \u201cAnd here I thought that was supposed to be confidential information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. She told me you\u2019re not returning her phone calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? She ain\u2019t my keeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe drop any hints on whether you knew if I\u2019d fallen off the wagon or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Where\u2019d you see her? At the diner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in the diner since Friday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? They stop givin\u2019 law enforcement officers free coffee or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d Cam muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Cam braced his elbows on his knees and pointed his face to the floor. \u201cEvidently Domini saw me giving Doc Monroe a ride home Friday night after your unplanned piercing. The arctic princess blasts me with an icy glare if I so much as step foot on the welcome mat in Dewey\u2019s. Then she starts cursing at me in Ukrainian and stomps off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. I didn\u2019t realize you and Domini were datin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing; we\u2019re not. I\u2019m not dating the good doc either.</p><p>She and I are just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Domini is jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know. Meantime, I\u2019ve been forced to drink the black sludge from the Conoco station.\u201d</p><p>Colt fiddled with the cap on his water bottle. \u201cYou could remedy the jealousy situation and ask Domini out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cam laughed. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about her has you runnin\u2019 scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. She deserves better than half a man.\u201d</p><p>Colt widened his eyes in mock shock. \u201cDid part of your dick get shot off at the same time as your leg and your hand?\u201d</p><p>The look on Cam\u2019s face was hilarious. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you ain\u2019t half a man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do I have to offer her?

Maybe you should quit mooning around India and do something about it.\u201d</p><p>Colt chugged the last of his water. \u201cI have done something about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I realized India ain\u2019t ever gonna see me beyond a drunk she\u2019s counseled or her best bud, so I asked someone else to the community dance Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallon Jacobson.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cNo fucking way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s so not your type. She\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>Irritably, Colt said, \u201cShe\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice. Normal. Quiet.\u201d He sipped his water. \u201cKinda plain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. That\u2019s just not the type of woman you\u2019ve chased after in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve done any chasin\u2019 I figured my tastes have changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you hook up with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was in the hardware store Monday mornin\u2019. We got to talkin\u2019 and the next thing I knew I was askin\u2019 her out.\u201d His determination to move on had happened far quicker than Colt planned. \u201cMaybe you should ask Domini and we can make it a double date.\u201d</p><p>Cam scowled. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m a one-legged dancing machine these days. Thanks, but I\u2019ll pass from that public humiliation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can run five miles but you won\u2019t two-step? That\u2019s sad, man. Lemme know if you change your mind.\u201d Colt stood. \u201cI\u2019m gonna hit the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Later.\u201d Cam grabbed his duffel and headed for the exit\u2014the opposite direction of the showers. He never took off his prosthetic in public.</p><p>When Colt climbed into his pickup, his cell phone buzzed in the seat. He didn\u2019t have to pick it up to know who\u2019d called him.</p><p>Three times.</p><p>India.</p><p>Seeing her name\u2014and no one else\u2019s\u2014pop up on the screen, strengthened his resolve to put physical and emotional distance between them.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cCome on, come on, come on, pick up,\u201d India muttered as she paced in her kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThe number you\u2019ve reached is unavailable. At the tone, please record your message. Beep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Colt. It\u2019s India. But you knew that. Anyway, I-umm, hope you\u2019re okay. We missed you at the meeting Tuesday night, and I\u2019m...well, I\u2019m worried about you. I\u2019ve been trying to reach you since Monday.\u201d Stupid, India, he knows that, courtesy of the twenty increasingly paranoid messages you\u2019ve left him.</p><p>\u201cBeep. End of message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d India hit redial and waited for it to kick over to voice mail. She half-listened to the same canned response. Finally, the beep sounded.</p><p>\u201cLook. I understand that you\u2019re embarrassed about what happened Sunday morning. But I don\u2019t see where you get off blowing three years worth of our friendship just because you\u2019re embarrassed. We\u2019ve always been able to talk through anything, and this shouldn\u2019t be an exception. You\u2019re making this so hard on\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dammit. Should she have said hard-on? Should she have said blowing? Shit shit shit. Think back. Did she say come? Or get off?</p><p>At any point?</p><p>\u201cBeep. End of message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Infuriated, she pressed redial. This time she was ready for the beep.</p><p>\u201cQuit being such a dickhead, McKay. Call me.\u201d She snapped the phone shut. Hah! That\u2019ll get his attention.</p><p>But hours passed and still no word from Colt.</p><p>India crawled in bed and stared at the shimmery silver canopy.</p><p>For the hundredth time, she wondered how everything had spun out of control. Sure, she understood his anger at her accidentally shooting him in the butt and his frustration at being stuck in her apartment. India even understood him being pissed off about her going out on a date with his cousin and how he could\u2019ve jumped to conclusions when Blake was hammering her headboard with such vigor.</p><p>What she couldn\u2019t understand? Why sexy-as-sin, charm-the-panties-off-any-woman-with-a-pulse Colt McKay hadn\u2019t gotten laid in three years. That boggled her mind.</p><p>The McKay men were all notoriously good-looking. Every.</p><p>Single. One. Since her sister, Skylar, was married to one of those hunky McKay men, and those cowboy beefcakes congregated on a regular basis, India had plenty of room to judge. In her eyes, Colt was the best looking of all of them. Period.</p><p>Not only was Colt a shining example of masculinity, he was sweet. Smart too, but he preferred to hide his brainpower under beguiling smiles and cajoling words. He was fun to be around, thoughtful, insightful...so it made zero sense he wasn\u2019t getting any.</p><p>Neither are you.</p><p>And when had smokin\u2019 hot bad cowboy Colt started leveling his intense I-wanna-fuck-you-now stare...on her? And using a seductive masculine growl instead of words?</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t she put off by the changes?</p><p>Because it seems right. Natural. And about goddamn time.</p><p>India closed her eyes and relived the brief interlude in the kitchen. Her hand rubbing on his cock empowered her. She never remembered feeling such a thrill at a man\u2019s loss of control. Wanting to see how he could take control of her. To see how far he could push her before she lost it.</p><p>Hell, she\u2019d been tempted to drag him into her bedroom and see how wild they could be together. But she\u2019d backed off. Partially out of guilt for his injury, partially out of self-preservation, fearing a spontaneous tumble would irreparably damage their friendship\u2014a friendship she valued above all others.</p><p>And look what that self-preservation had gotten her...the man had cut off all communication anyway. She could\u2019ve had a mind-bending orgasm or twenty and ended up with the same result.</p><p>Frustrated, India covered her head with a pillow and tried to sleep. She\u2019d definitely get in touch with him tomorrow.</p><p>India hadn\u2019t seen or talked to Colt for six days, which sucked, but not as bad as the impending humiliation sucked. She sighed.</p><p>Loudly.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Domini said.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go to this stupid dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. You are always making me do things I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>India cocked an eyebrow at her. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings.\u201d Domini waved her off distractedly. \u201cAnyway, you have to put in an appearance. This is a fundraiser for the community and you need to show your support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy donating a free tattoo to the highest bidder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter that than a week\u2019s worth of cooking lessons.\u201d</p><p>India knew who\u2019d submit the winning bid for the private lessons, no matter how much it cost, even if he had to rig the results.</p><p>\u201cJust promise you won\u2019t ditch me. I probably won\u2019t know many people.\u201d The folks she knew through A.A. were an odd lot, she wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d admit to knowing her outside the meetings.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know everyone,\u201d Domini said. \u201cIsn\u2019t your sister going to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sky Blue just donated a gift basket to the auction. Skylar and Kade don\u2019t have time to turn around since the twins came along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Then you are welcome to hang out with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and who else? Because if Cat is going to be there? No thanks, I\u2019ll pass.\u201d Domini\u2019s boss was a real piece of work.</p><p>\u201cCat is out of town on another trip to Denver, remember?\u201d</p><p>Domini sniffed. \u201cIt\u2019s Nadia, Anton and me. With him I\u2019m guaranteed a dance partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil he hits the sugar crash stage from too much Kool-Aid.\u201d</p><p>India turned sideways in the mirror. The skinny jeans looked good, but the shirt? No way. \u201cI don\u2019t know which one of us is more pathetic, Dom. You, for having a six-year-old boy as a date, or me, for even trying to cover up my tattoos with this long-sleeved blouse.\u201d</p><p>Domini moved in behind her. Man, the woman was tall. In bare feet she towered over India\u2019s five-foot-four by a good six inches.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you cover your skin in tattoos and then freak out about people looking at them? Show them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d India unbuttoned the plain white blouse and tossed it on the bed. She rummaged through her closet until she found her favorite sleeveless shirt, a delicate silk, covered with a bold oriental floral pattern. As she pulled it on over her head, she noticed Domini looking at her chest. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis may be none of my business, but did it hurt when you umm...pierced your bradavka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>A blush stole across Domini\u2019s cheeks, turning her icy blue eyes even more vivid. \u201cYour nipples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I don\u2019t remember, it\u2019s been so long. Why? You thinking of having it done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, I don\u2019t know. I would like to know if it makes...things more pleasurable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings...meaning sex?\u201d</p><p>Domini nodded, blushing harder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an added bonus if your breasts are sensitive. Especially if you have a lover who knows what he\u2019s doing. Who understands your balance point between pleasure and pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a lover give me what I really want.\u201d She looked away.</p><p>India waited, hoping Domini would say something else. When she didn\u2019t, India let it drop. \u201cAre we ready?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>They opted to drive to the community center. Upon seeing all the trucks and cars spilling out into the street and filling up the parking lot of St. Winifred\u2019s Catholic Church, they figured they might\u2019ve been better off walking.</p><p>The band had set up in the back. Tables along the near wall were piled with cookies and bars; on the far wall the tables were crammed with auction items.</p><p>Nadia waved and Domini headed to the table. India hung back, her eyes scanning the crowd for a familiar face.</p><p>No, for the familiar face.</p> <p>Lots of dark-haired men, but not the one she was looking for.</p><p>She bulled her way through the crowd, smiling at the folks she knew, ignoring the pointed stares of the ones she didn\u2019t. She finally saw a face she recognized. Buck McKay, her sister\u2019s brother-in-law.</p><p>Sometimes India forgot Buck and Kade were identical twins because their personalities were so different. Heck, to her, they didn\u2019t even look that much alike. In the last year, Buck had grown a soul patch and shaved his hair to stubble. Good thing the man had a gorgeous skull. He had a gorgeous everything.</p><p>Not as gorgeous as Colt.</p><p>Dammit. She was trying not to obsess about him.</p><p>Buck opened his arms in welcome and she hugged him. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here, Buck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSame goes. Normally, it\u2019s not my thing. But I promised Hayden if he helped me fix fence for two weeks without complainin\u2019, we\u2019d bid on the fly-fishin\u2019 weekend. He upheld his end of the deal, so I\u2019m upholding mine.\u201d He set his hand on the slender shoulder of the boy beside him. The kid\u2019s slight build and fair complexion made him look about seven, but his eyes behind thick glasses were wise for such a young age.</p><p>\u201cThis is my buddy Hayden. Hayden, this is India Ellison. She\u2019s Skylar\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Hayden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou own India\u2019s Ink, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m eighteen, I\u2019m going to get a tattoo just like Buck\u2019s.\u201d He gave Buck a look of absolute adoration.</p><p>India smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s never too early to start thinking about the perfect design. I\u2019ll look forward to seeing you in a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you grab us each a cup of punch before the band gets started?\u201d Buck suggested. Hayden took off like a shot.</p> <p>\u201cWhat a cutie. He seems like a nice kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s great.\u201d Buck\u2019s gaze followed the boy across the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done. Don\u2019t know if I ever said thank you for givin\u2019 me a dose of tough love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m just glad to see it\u2019s working out.\u201d A few months back, during a dinner at Sky and Kade\u2019s place, Buck had spent the evening whining. His twin was happily married. His cousin Colt had built a new place and sold the Boars Nest to Cam.</p><p>Poor Buck was left homeless and lonely\u2014a fact he\u2019d bitched about until India snapped. If he was so damn lonely, there were plenty of boys in the Little Buddies program who needed time and attention from an adult male. It\u2019d shocked her a few weeks later when Kade mentioned Buck had taken her advice and signed up for the program.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini\u2019s idea. But I\u2019d hoped to run into Colt. Have you seen him?\u201d</p><p>Buck\u2019s eyes avoided hers. \u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s around.\u201d</p><p>When he stayed mum, India demanded, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. I figured you and Colt must\u2019ve had a fight or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s here with a date.\u201d</p><p>A sucker punch couldn\u2019t have hurt worse. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Pause. \u201cThat motherfucker.\u201d Buck looked at her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>India shook her head.</p><p>\u201cJust say the word and I\u2019ll kick his ass.\u201d Buck swore and wrapped his arm around her shoulder. \u201cAh, honey, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s been dodging my phone calls all week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid bastard.\u201d</p><p>That caused a small smile. For the hundredth time India wished she could fall in love with Buck McKay. He wanted the same thing she did\u2014what Kade and Skylar had\u2014true love, mutual respect, great sex, a real home, sweet kids, the whole shebang. Buck looked out for her, treating her like a little sister, which was the problem.</p><p>It\u2019d feel incestuous if they became more than friends.</p><p>It should feel incestuous with Colt too, since they\u2019d been friends longer, but somehow...it didn\u2019t.</p><p>She pulled back in mind and body. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Hayden bounded up. Refusing his gentlemanly offer of his punch, India retreated to the shadows by the bathroom.</p><p>Her eyes continually scanned the crowd for Colt. Finally she caught sight of him on the dance floor. God. He was stunning.</p><p>Absolutely freakin\u2019 stunning. He spun the woman in his arms around twice and kept zipping along the outskirts so she didn\u2019t get a good look at his date\u2019s face.</p><p>Why does it matter what she looks like?</p><p>It just did.</p><p>When they performed the forward turn, India scrutinized her.</p><p>The woman was tall. Sturdy. Blonde, with a wide smile that almost hid her horse face. She was maybe five or six years younger than Colt. She dressed in the style of a ranch woman, dark jeans, a brightly colored blouse dotted with geometric shapes and rhinestone snaps. Well-worn ropers the same turquoise as her shirt.</p><p>Sad thing was, if Colt married her, local people would assume Colt had settled, especially in light of his reputation of preferring good-looking, wild women\u2014of which this prim and proper lady was neither.</p><p>Oh, Ms. Horse Woman would pop out a couple of halfway cute kids, be the perfect FFA mom, she\u2019d help Colt run the ranch at top efficiency. She\u2019d...fit in, in ways India never would. It made India sick, because she figured Colt would be back on the booze within six months of committing his life to such a lackluster woman.</p><p>Colt needed someone like India in his life.</p><p>Right. He\u2019ll be dropping on bended knee after you called him a dickhead.</p><p>A fake smile creased Colt\u2019s face as he danced the woman backward and the couple disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>When the song finished, the lights clicked on and the auctioneer randomly selected prizes for bidding. First, a massage package donated by AJ McKay, of Healing Touch Massage, which earned a respectable bid of two hundred dollars. The band kicked off another song. As soon as it ended, the auctioneer took the stage.</p><p>And so it went for three more tunes.</p><p>Skylar\u2019s basket sold for three hundred bucks. The private cooking lessons with Domini, head cook at Dewey\u2019s Delish Dish, fetched fifteen hundred dollars from an anonymous bidder. Domini was clearly flustered by the attention, but extremely pleased.</p><p>Buck placed the winning bid on the fly-fishing trip. He and Hayden waved to her as they claimed their prize and headed out.</p><p>After a snappy rendition of \u201cOh Lonesome Me\u201d the moment India dreaded arrived. She kept to the back of the room, hidden in the alcove by the drinking fountain.</p><p>The auctioneer snapped the paper in his hand. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be.</p><p>This is an interesting prize, a one of a kind tattoo, courtesy of India\u2019s Ink. Who\u2019ll start the bidding?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>India wanted to throw up.</p><p>\u201cCome on, folks, this is for a good cause. Shall we start the bidding at one hundred dollars?\u201d</p><p>More silence.</p><p>\u201cHow about fifty dollars?\u201d</p><p>She had to force her feet to stay in place and not run out the back door in sheer mortification.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give ya twenty,\u201d some guy shouted from the front row and the whole room erupted into laughter.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, folks. Minimum bid is fifty dollars. Do I hear fifty dollars?\u201d</p><p>Then, \u201cI\u2019ll bid one thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>A collective gasp rippled through the crowd.</p><p>The auctioneer pointed. \u201cI have a bid of one thousand dollars.</p><p>Going once. Going twice.\u201d Crack.

She didn\u2019t know whether to confront him here, or put the anger whammy on him when he least expected it. Her temper was a vile thing. Letting it fly was always a last resort, especially in public, since she usually picked up the nearest heavy object and let it fly too.</p><p>Colt snatched the choice away when he snuck up behind her and drawled, \u201cI didn\u2019t think dances were your thing, India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything about me.\u201d She whirled around.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s yours?\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here by myself because no one asked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure my cousin Blake would\u2019ve been happy to escort you.</p><p>Or aren\u2019t there any headboards here that he needs to fix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hilarious, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Colt flashed his teeth. \u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expected better from you.\u201d</p><p>People around them were starting to stare.</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>Through clenched teeth she said, \u201cMeaning, I don\u2019t need your fucking pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I feel sorry for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no one else bid on my prize, and you\u2019re throwing cash around like\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my money and I can do what I want with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you buying the tattoo package as a gift for your date?\u201d</p><p>He scowled.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not exactly the tattoo type, is she? And God forbid anyone else in this town would admit in public they\u2019d pay to cavort with a low-class ink slinger like me.\u201d</p><p>Fury darkened his eyes. \u201cWatch it.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an innocent look. \u201cDid I insult her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t my date you\u2019re insulting, it\u2019s yourself, and that pisses me off worse, so knock it the hell off.

I\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were too busy to come to a meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut me some slack.

Forget it. All of it. Have a lovely evening with your horse-faced honey.\u201d</p><p>Colt laughed and said, \u201cOh, no you don\u2019t,\u201d as he snatched her elbow. \u201cWe ain\u2019t close to done with this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. Just leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d</p><p>Stupid tears flooded her eyes. She couldn\u2019t blink them away fast enough and the stupid jerk saw she was about to bawl like a stupid baby.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus, are you cryin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She jammed her wallet in her back pocket and attempted to flee.</p><p>\u201cDammit. Don\u2019t you walk away like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you humiliated me enough tonight?\u201d India dodged people congregating in the hallways, fully aware they were gawking at her. And him. And them.</p><p>\u201cCome back here.\u201d</p><p>Burning gazes of strangers raked her inked skin as deeply as if they were wielding tattoo needles. Disgusted glances at her piercings pricked her as sharply as if they were holding a piercing gun. Normally she could give a rip about the stares, but tonight she had a hard time holding her head up, which pissed her off.</p><p>She didn\u2019t get far before Colt clamped his fingers around her biceps. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Indy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sugar, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>More tears surfaced.</p><p>He dragged her downstairs. Smart people scattered at seeing the intent on Colt\u2019s face and the fury in his every movement.</p><p>Taking a quick look around, he pulled her into a closet in the middle of the hallway. Then he stepped in front of the door, blocking her exit. \u201cStart talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>India mimed zipping her lip and tossing away the key.</p><p>\u201cYou are the most annoying woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d Colt advanced on her. \u201cFor the record? There are lots of things I feel for you, but pity ain\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders hit a wall.</p><p>\u201cStill ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 to me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Colt was a breath away. \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea on how you can put that smart mouth of yours to better use.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. In protest or invitation? Dammit. Lately whenever they got within kissing distance all she could think about was locking lips with him. For hours. Days maybe.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. If you wanna talk so bad, why don\u2019t you tell me one of the things you feel for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t handle it right now because you\u2019re mad and confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad? Yes. Confused? Where do you get off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, at yourself. Why are you pushin\u2019 me away with one hand, and pullin\u2019 me closer with the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Then she noticed her right palm was flat against his chest shoving, while her left hand was bunched in his T-shirt pulling. \u201cNice try at changing the subject, but I know the real reason you won\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dating... void over the last few years, your silver tongue has tarnished and you aren\u2019t very good with words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d His eyes never left hers. \u201cI wish you weren\u2019t bein\u2019 so damn difficult because we both know the real reason you\u2019re fightin\u2019 with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish granted.\u201d She sidestepped him.</p><p>A hand clamped on her shoulder. He used the momentum to spin her against the wall again.</p><p>\u201cLet me go. You\u2019ve made it clear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d His hands braceleted her wrists and he held them firmly by her sides. Colt eliminated the gap between their bodies and nestled his cheek against hers. Whiskers scraped her jaw, his soft lips brushed the side of her neck, his hot breath skittered across her damp skin with every exhalation.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll make it a damn sight clearer of what I feel for you. I wanna touch you, Indy. Right here. With your back up to the wall. I wanna suck your nipples through your flimsy shirt. Taste how anger changes the sweet flavor of your skin. When that ain\u2019t enough contact, I\u2019ll lift up your shirt so I can pull those pretty pink nipples in my mouth, rollin\u2019 my tongue around the hoops. I\u2019ll suck hard, suck deep, suck for a good, long time.\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s words set her blood on fire.</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t all. I wanna go down on you. Yank off your jeans.</p><p>Rip aside your panties and finger you until you\u2019re nice and wet.</p><p>Then I\u2019ll drop to my knees and taste you. Gently at first. Lick a path from the top down to where you\u2019re weepin\u2019 for me.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s knees threatened to buckle as he tormented her with erotic images.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll swirl the tip of my tongue around your opening, never going higher, sometimes slipping just a little too far back. Nipping that tasty tender flesh between your thighs with my lips and teeth.</p><p>Then I\u2019ll jam my tongue as deeply inside you as it\u2019ll go. I\u2019ll do it again and again and again. Licking you from the inside out. But I\u2019d stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll pull back and cool you down.\u201d He blew a stream of air across her neck. Chills beaded her skin. \u201cCan\u2019t you feel it? My breath blowing on the hottest part of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you can\u2019t stand it, when you\u2019re grinding your wet sex against my face, demanding release, then I\u2019ll give you what you crave. My thumbs will spread you wide. I\u2019ll set my mouth on you and I\u2019ll suck until you explode on my tongue. And I\u2019ll lap up your sweet juices like candy.\u201d</p><p>India panted. She clenched her thighs together, hoping the pulsing tremors would break free into a full-fledged orgasm.</p><p>He dragged openmouthed kisses across her throat to her ear and whispered, \u201cYou still thinkin\u2019 I ain\u2019t good with words?\u201d</p><p>She glimpsed fire burning in his eyes before he crushed her lips beneath his and kissed her until she thought her head would explode from the sheer hedonistic pleasure of it.</p><p>Eventually she recovered her sanity. \u201cIs this some kind of game to see if you can get me hot and bothered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t the only one who\u2019s hot and bothered.\u201d Colt released her right hand and placed it over his fly.</p><p>India felt his hardness straining against the zipper of his Wranglers. She stroked him until air hissed through his teeth. \u201cColt.</p><p>What are we doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoin\u2019 straight to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why doesn\u2019t this feel wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t. Stop.\u201d Colt pushed back, putting a few feet between them. \u201cI can\u2019t do this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant you when I can\u2019t have you and be miserable because I can\u2019t stay away from you. I\u2019ve tried. And what\u2019s the first thing I do when I see you? Run the other direction? No. I haul you off and maul you.\u201d</p><p>While India stared at him, he stared at the cement floor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to stay away from me, Colt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSayin\u2019 stuff like that is not helpin\u2019 this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Colt left without another word.</p><p>India\u2019s urge to cry was almost as strong as the one to run. Her fingers had circled the door handle to chase after him, when she heard a lilting voice say, \u201cColt?\u201d on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, Fallon. I was just comin\u2019 to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Because I\u2019ve been looking all over for you.\u201d</p><p>Fallon?

They were so busted.</p> <p>\u201cBecause someone told me they saw you and that tattooed woman sneaking in there together.\u201d</p><p>That tattooed woman.</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout half a dozen different people. Are you denying it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s to say those people might\u2019ve been mistaken about what they\u2019d seen, or what they thought they\u2019d seen?\u201d he countered.</p> <p>Not exactly a lie on Colt\u2019s part.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth. Were you in there alone?\u201d</p><p>The tension crackled through the wooden door slats and India held her breath.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. You were in there with her. When you were supposed to be on a date with me. People warned me about you, \u2018Don\u2019t go out with Colt McKay, he\u2019s a womanizer and a player of the worst sort\u2019 but did I listen to them? No.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s stomach churned.</p> <p>\u201cDid you honestly believe no one would see you taking her into a supply closet for a quickie? Are you that much of a sex maniac?</p><p>Good Lord. You have to know I am not the kind of woman who does that sort of thing on the first date.\u201d</p><p>Tell her you haven\u2019t been on a date in your sober state. Tell her you haven\u2019t had sex in three years.</p><p>He stayed mum.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe I thought you\u2019d changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLive and learn, I guess,\u201d Colt said bitterly. \u201cYou ready for me to take you home?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. Cruelly. \u201cRight. Like I\u2019d be seen with you again.</p><p>It\u2019s probably just as well I caught you cheating right away, rather than finding out later what kind of sneaky man you are. And if she\u2019s the kind of woman who lets you screw her in public? Then you two deserve each other.\u201d</p> <p>Her angry bootsteps faded down the hallway.</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t call after her.</p><p>Poor Colt. India really had no idea what to do.</p><p>You could\u2019ve defended him.</p><p>Yeah, popping out of the closet with her lips swollen from his hard kisses would\u2019ve been a sure-fire way to defend Colt\u2019s honor.</p><p>When India finally found the guts to open the door, Colt was long gone.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe I thought you\u2019d changed.\u201d</p><p>Story of his life in recent years.</p><p>Colt chinked his glass of Diet Coke to his reflection in the sliding glass door as a sarcastic self-toast. Well done. He wasn\u2019t surprised Fallon had lashed out. He\u2019d hurt her; her natural instinct was to strike back.</p><p>His natural instinct was to hole up with a bottle.</p><p>Not possible, but his body still craved a drink so badly his teeth hurt.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to get out of an unhealthy situation with India, only to find himself defending her at the first opportunity.</p><p>The silence in the community center after the auctioneer announced India\u2019s prize package tied Colt\u2019s guts in knots. India might act tough, but beneath that hard outer shell was a softie trying to find her place within a community that didn\u2019t easily welcome strangers.</p><p>Or didn\u2019t readily believe long-time citizens could change.</p><p>They were both screwed. No wonder they\u2019d been together these last few years. And Fallon, while trying to make it an insult, had it exactly right: they did deserve each other.</p><p>How could he convince India that statement was true?</p><p>The high point of the night had been the ten minutes of heaven he and India carved out in the supply closet. Nothing else mattered but the need pulsing between them. Each kiss, each touch, awakened the sexual beast sleeping inside him.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019d been content living a celibate life. He\u2019d needed to learn who he was as a man, not a male who only thought with his dick.</p><p>So what now that the beast was fully awake?</p><p>Sate it. With lots and lots of sex.</p><p>Colt knew if he drove back into town and trolled the bars he could have a woman in his bed within an hour. But there was only one woman he wanted in his bed.</p><p>India.</p><p>Avoiding her had only produced a sharper ache. Lining up a date with another woman only proved he\u2019d compare every female to the tattooed smart mouth who\u2019d stolen his heart. Goddamn, she could piss him off one second and fire his blood with lust the next.</p><p>Drown your sorrows. You deserve to cut loose and try and forget about her.</p><p>Nights like this were the worst, being unsure and frustrated only increased his cravings for alcohol.</p><p>So booze was out. Sex was out. Sleep was a lost cause. That left one thing.</p><p>Colt changed into workout shorts. In the spare bedroom, he slipped on his boxing gloves and beat the stuffing out of the punching bag until he was sweaty and too exhausted to think.</p><p>The next morning the phone rang as Colt came inside from stacking wood. Only three people called him before eight on Sunday. India, his cousin Chassie, and his mother. Lately Chassie didn\u2019t bother phoning first, she barged right into his house. He didn\u2019t need to look at the caller ID today. \u201cHey, Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning!\u201d</p><p>Carolyn West McKay was the cheeriest morning person on the planet. He poured the last of the coffee in his mug and listened to her chatter like a chipmunk. She\u2019d get to the point of the call eventually. But she had this perverted sixth sense\u2014if she thought you were trying to speed her along, she\u2019d find irrelevant things to yammer on about.</p><p>\u201c...just wanted to double-check that you were coming for an early family supper tonight.\u201d</p><p>Finally. \u201cHow early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Cam is coming when he gets off shift. Wish Carter and Macie and their boys could be here. Keely too. It\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve had a family dinner.\u201d Her weighted pause actually caused Colt to hold his breath. \u201cIs there a chance you\u2019ll be bringing a date?\u201d</p><p>Shit. He wasn\u2019t surprised word of his date with Fallon\u2014and the fiasco afterward\u2014had already fueled the gossip channels. Still, that was fast, even by Sundance standards. \u201cNope. No date. Sorry to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. No, son, I\u2019m not disappointed. I\u2019m looking forward to catching up. You\u2019re not around as much since you built that house out in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere in Wyoming is out in the middle of nowhere,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s only thirty miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you\u2019re three thousand miles away,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Sometimes I wish I was.</p><p>As he hung up, he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d looked forward to Sunday dinner with the family, instead of feeling a sense of dread.</p><p>The McKay house was complete chaos. Kids running around, babies crying, his mother and his sisters-in-law jabbering like they hadn\u2019t seen each other in months.</p><p>He\u2019d been hanging out with his nephews in the family room, when he realized he was the only male adult in the room. He tracked his brothers and his father outside, lounging against the split rail fence running along the front of the house, drinking beer and shooting the shit. Even after three years of sobriety, they weren\u2019t comfortable popping a top or two around him. Which was just another reason Colt only stayed long enough to be polite. Not that he contributed much to any conversation.</p><p>Carson said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell Charlie was thinkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Quinn and Bennett say something?\u201d Colby asked.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I don\u2019t think they knew.\u201d</p><p>Cord tipped his long neck beer bottle toward Colby. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you fifty bucks Aunt Vi had something to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>They chinked bottles.</p><p>Colt shifted his stance and dropped his water bottle, reminding Cord, Colby and his father he was not part of the fence.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about it?\u201d Carson McKay demanded.</p><p>\u201cSo they bought a pair of llamas, big deal,\u201d Colt said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it affects us. Besides givin\u2019 us ample opportunity to razz our cousins to no end with the question: Is your mama a llama?\u201d</p><p>Laughter broke out. Cord\u2019s son Kyler\u2019s obsession with that book as a toddler meant they\u2019d all been forced to read it until they could recite the thing from memory. That\u2019d been a happy period in Colt\u2019s life, one of the memories of that time not tainted by alcohol.</p><p>\u201cSeems Ky\u2019s reading skills will come in handy with the new baby.\u201d</p><p>All gazes zoomed to Cord.</p><p>He grinned like a loon. \u201cAJ\u2019s pregnant. She wanted to wait until she\u2019s past the first trimester to tell folks, bein\u2019s it\u2019s her first baby and all, but I can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>Carson clapped Cord on the back. Colby said, \u201cCongrats. Man, must be something in the water. Channing, Macie and AJ are all pregnant at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeast they\u2019re not all gonna pop durin\u2019 calvin\u2019 season,\u201d Carson said.</p><p>If both his brothers\u2019 wives were pregnant during the busiest time of the year, it meant Colt would shoulder a bigger chunk of the responsibility.</p><p>Big surprise. Didn\u2019t it just figure everyone in the family assumed he\u2019d be around to pick up the slack? Hell, when push came to shove, only Cam and Carter owned less of the McKay herd than he did. They both had other jobs. Colt\u2019s sullen side silently retorted that no one expected them to do more than their fair share. In fact, with Cam\u2019s war injury he couldn\u2019t do much. And Carter split his time between here and his in-laws\u2019 place in Canyon River.</p><p>\u201cColt?\u201d</p><p>He shoved aside his sour thoughts and focused his attention on Colby. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter told me to tell you that you could stay at his and Macie\u2019s place durin\u2019 calvin\u2019 so you don\u2019t have to drive so far.\u201d</p><p>Would it be petty to point out neither Colby nor Cord offered up their places for him to crash?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Jesus. He was stuck in \u201cfeel sorry for me mode\u201d tonight. It\u2019d be best to smile and suck it up, rather than point out neither of them had to give up their comfy beds for a month. Every year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna do that, I\u2019m sure Cam\u2019ll let you bunk with him for the duration.\u201d</p><p>Cam wouldn\u2019t look him in the eye.</p><p>And right then, Colt had enough. \u201cI appreciate it, but it ain\u2019t gonna be necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Cord frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s a long damn drive. Especially with the weather bein\u2019 shitty that time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you guys\u2019ll handle the weather and the calvin\u2019 just fine without me.\u201d</p><p>Shocked silence.

What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you gonna be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in Hawaii.\u201d</p><p>His dad demanded, \u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 over there for a month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSittin\u2019 on the beach, whale watchin\u2019, surfing. Maybe I\u2019ll learn to scuba dive. Or golf. Whatever people do when they\u2019re on vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery fuckin\u2019 funny,\u201d Cord said.</p> <p>\u201cMight be if I was kiddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>They all stared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just schedule a damn vacation durin\u2019 the most important time of the year in the cattle business.\u201d</p><p>Colt shrugged. Maybe it was childish, but he felt the need to push them. See if anyone would voice the questions and contempt he saw in their eyes. If he\u2019d ever truly be forgiven or if they were waiting for the other boot to drop. Or for him to revert to his formerly destructive behavior.</p><p>Cam scratched at the label on his beer bottle.</p><p>Colby spoke first. \u201cThat\u2019s just great, Colt. Once again you\u2019ll be off fuckin\u2019 around while the rest of us are bustin\u2019 our asses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, I thought you\u2019d changed,\u201d Cord said. \u201cBut we\u2019re back to the same old bullshit.\u201d</p><p>There it was. The word that damned him either way\u2014change.</p> <p>If he did change, it was wrong. If he didn\u2019t change, it was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s it such a big deal for you to stay with Cam or at Carter\u2019s? It ain\u2019t like you\u2019ve got a family to go home to every night.\u201d</p><p>A beer bottle flew and crashed into the side of the barn, shattering the illusion of stillness.</p><p>All eyes zoomed to Cam.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sick and tired of the \u2018holier than thou\u2019 attitude in this family. So Colt screwed up. Every one of us has screwed up at one time or another. How long are you gonna make him pay for it?</p><p>Jesus, he hit the skids over four years ago. He\u2019s been on the straight and narrow for the last three. During which time, he\u2019s been busting his ass on this ranch, despite having to listen to you berate him and complain about him, or ignore him, or belittle him. None of you have ever been lily white and you\u2019ve got no business judging him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t here, Cam.\u201d</p><p>Cam whirled on Colby. \u201cGuess what? Neither were you! You were off rodeoin\u2019 and playin\u2019 cowboy while Colt was here, actually being a goddamn cowboy, day in, day out, for twelve fuckin\u2019 years.</p><p>Don\u2019t forget you couldn\u2019t do shit for months while you recovered from your rodeo injury\u2014months in which, once again, Colt had to do not only his work, but your work.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. Colt had never seen Cam so furious.</p><p>But Cam wasn\u2019t finished. He turned his ire on Cord. \u201cDidja forget you got pissed off at Dad and left for a coupla years? Who picked up the slack then? It sure as fuck wasn\u2019t Colby the rodeo king, or Carter the college boy, or Keely the baby girl or me.\u201d</p><p>Without moving his angry gaze from Cord, Cam pointed at Colt. \u201cIt was him. But you forgot that little factoid, didn\u2019t you? And isn\u2019t it convenient that you all expect Colt to stick around, year in, year out, and do every shit job you don\u2019t want to, because he doesn\u2019t have a...family?\u201d Cam faced Colby again. \u201cThat \u2018you don\u2019t have a family\u2019 comment is the single shittiest thing I\u2019ve ever heard anyone say. Ever. You\u2019re supposed to be his family. So are you.\u201d He pointed to Cord. \u201cAnd you,\u201d he said to Carson. \u201cAnd me. But when Colt really needed his family to support him and help him? Were any of you there? No. The only person who gave a shit about him...was Kade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Carson said.</p><p>\u201cHow could you all rally around me, offering me support, when you didn\u2019t do the same thing for Colt? When he was hurting just as bad? When he\u2019s the one who\u2019s always deserved it way more than I ever did. Because he had no choice but to stick around and live this life, when I had the luxury of leaving it behind.\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s eyes burned. Leave it to the one-legged man to make a stand for him when no one else in his family ever did.</p><p>Ugly, thick silence lingered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised you\u2019ve got nothin\u2019 to say. You oughta be hanging your heads in shame. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d Fabric snapped as Cam jerked his coat off the fence. He limped to his truck. After he opened the door he looked at Colt. \u201cSorry, bro, I know you didn\u2019t ask for this, but it needed to be said. It needed to come from someone with an outsider\u2019s perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an outsider, Cameron. You might\u2019ve been gone for a few years, but you\u2019ve always been part of this family.\u201d</p><p>All eyes turned to Carolyn McKay. No one had heard her come out onto the porch.</p><p>Cam shook his head. \u201cThanks for the invite to supper, Ma, but I\u2019ve lost my appetite.\u201d</p><p>She twisted a dishtowel in her hands, tears streaming down her face as she watched Cam drive away.</p><p>Great, his mother would probably blame him too.</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t make eye contact with anyone as he climbed in his pickup and started the long, lonely drive home.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>He\u2019d hit the outskirts of Sundance, when his cell phone vibrated. He had half a mind to let it go to voice mail. Another confrontation today would do him in but he checked the caller ID</p><p>anyway. Kade and Skylar\u2019s home number. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt? Omigod, I\u2019m so glad you answered. I was afraid you were still avoiding me, and\u2014Eliza Belle! Get down right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndy? Why are you callin\u2019 from Kade\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSky and Kade planned a romantic getaway and Grama Kimi caught the flu. And rather than let them cancel their first trip alone since the twins were born, I said I\u2019d watch the girls. Only they\u2019re screaming, all three at the same time\u2014\u201d an ear-piercing shriek echoed in the background, \u201c\u2014and I can\u2019t do this by myself! This is insane. How can anyone take care of a two and a half year old and six-month-old twins? Can you please please please come and help me? I\u2019ll pay you, I promise I\u2019ll do anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014No! Eliza, do not put that in your mouth!\u201d</p><p>Colt grinned for the first time in hours. \u201cTake a deep breath, sugar, I\u2019ll be there in thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Thank you, thank you, thank you, I owe you. Big time.\u201d</p><p>Dial tone.</p><p>\u201cYes, Miz India Blue, you surely do owe me.\u201d</p><p>He spent the remainder of the drive figuring out all sorts of inventive ways India could pay off her debt.</p><p>\u201cI wanna cookie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna cookie...please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, Eliza, the last thing you need is more sugar.\u201d India had Shannie cocked on her left hip and Peyton screamed from her high chair.</p><p>A mulish look settled on Eliza\u2019s face. \u201cMama\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama is not here.\u201d Please, Colt, hurry. Surely it\u2019d been longer than a half hour. She had no idea why her sweet nieces had morphed into monsters.</p><p>\u201cI gonna call her,\u201d Eliza announced.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d India snatched the cordless receiver and put it on top of the refrigerator next to the other cordless receivers she\u2019d confiscated. Eliza had already tried to throw India\u2019s cell phone in the toilet in the guise of \u201cwashing\u201d it.</p><p>Right. Eliza\u2019s devilish smile belied her innocent baby blues.</p><p>The girl was the spitting image of her father in looks and her mother in temperament.</p><p>Peyton continued to scream. Shannie kept trying to pull out India\u2019s earrings. Eliza stood on her booster seat and hoisted herself on the table, crawling toward the package of animal crackers.</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t, missy.\u201d India scooped her up and set her on the floor. \u201cNo more. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>Startled by India\u2019s unusually stern tone, Eliza began to cry, which made Shannie start bawling.</p><p>Wonderful.</p><p>\u201cI heard there was a party goin\u2019 on in here with four wild girls.</p><p>To be honest, I expected some of ya\u2019ll to be wearin\u2019 less clothes.\u201d</p><p>India spun around and saw Colt leaning against the doorjamb.</p><p>She wanted to smack him for looking so damn good when she looked like a train wreck. She wanted to burst into tears for his good humor when hers was gone. Mostly, she wanted to kiss him for showing up and saving her sanity when she had no one else to call.</p><p>\u201cUnka Cole!\u201d Eliza jumped from the chair and ran toward him full bore. He barely managed to keep her from racking him.</p><p>\u201cHey, short stuff.\u201d He picked her up and propped her on his hip. \u201cWhy the tears?\u201d</p><p>Eliza, that shameless charmer, laid her head on Colt\u2019s chest and sighed. \u201cI hungry.\u201d</p><p>Lord have mercy. The man was about four seconds from melting.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall for it,\u201d India warned. \u201cShe is a c-o-o-k-i-e monster today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh, I not a monser,\u201d Eliza said. \u201cI jus\u2019 lub cookies.\u201d</p><p>Colt grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s a smart cookie too.\u201d He looked from Shannie to Peyton, who\u2019d both gone quiet. \u201cSeems you\u2019ve got it all under control now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA temporary delusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave they had supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiz Eliza has if you count the box of sugary disks she\u2019s stuffed in her sweet face like a rabid squirrel. I was about to heat up the twins\u2019 baby food, when I lost complete control of the situation and called you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s your first mistake. Never show \u2019em fear.\u201d Colt gave Eliza a smacking kiss on her cheek and she giggled. \u201cYou wanna color at the table while Auntie Indy and me feed your sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d</p><p>He looked at India over Eliza\u2019s head. \u201cThe coloring books are...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll over the floor in the living room. There\u2019s some on the stairs I think.\u201d</p><p>Colt swung Eliza around for a piggyback to the living room and she squealed with delight.</p><p>India tried to put Shannie in her high chair, but Shannie arched her back and held tighter to the big hoop earrings in India\u2019s ear. The kid was part crow; mesmerized by shiny objects. India took out two jars of pureed green beans and two jars of carrots and put them in a shallow pan of water already on the stove.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Eliza, here you go. Your colors and your favorite \u2018My Little Pony\u2019 coloring book. Make me something purty as you.\u201d</p><p>India turned and Colt was right there. In her face. Close enough to kiss.</p> <p>He cringed when he saw Shannie\u2019s death grip. \u201cHoly crap\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d Eliza repeated.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got hold of your earrings good, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually I don\u2019t wear jewelry around the girls, but I forgot today until it was too late. Eliza\u2019s the reason I let my lip piercing grow shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wondered about that. Damn shame. It was sexy as hell. I spent lots of hours wondering what it\u2019d be like to kiss you with that.\u201d He held out his hands. \u201cHey, baby girl. Come see your uncle.\u201d</p><p>Shannie flashed a gummy grin, let go of India\u2019s earrings, and practically dove at him.</p> <p>\u201cDo all females fall into your arms so easily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all.\u201d Colt granted her a molten look. \u201cSome take a little more coaxing. And that\u2019s when the fall is so much sweeter.\u201d</p><p>Now India didn\u2019t know which was worse; dealing with three screaming kids, or one scheming man.</p><p>But damn, what a man. If she pressed her lips together, she could still feel the surety of his mouth on hers as he\u2019d leveled her with a steamy kiss last night.</p><p>\u201cNeed a bib?\u201d</p><p>Crap. Was she...drooling? Her back snapped straight. \u201cWhy in the hell would I need a bib?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell,\u201d Eliza mimicked.</p><p>\u201cNot a bib for you, for Peyton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Colt smiled and popped Shannie in her high chair. He chatted at both baby girls, as well as Eliza. His ease with the kids didn\u2019t surprise India; that was why she\u2019d called him.</p><p>Bibs on, food warmed, India grabbed the rubber-coated baby spoons from the dishrack. \u201cWhich one do you want?\u201d</p><p>Without looking away, Colt said, \u201cEliza, does Shannie still spit her food everywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll feed Peyton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken,\u201d India taunted.</p><p>\u201cA chicken says, bawk bawk,\u201d Eliza offered.</p><p>India and Colt both laughed.</p><p>Shannie managed to eat half her jar of beans, the rest she sprayed all over India. But Peyton wasn\u2019t a picnic; she cried and rubbed carrots in her eyes, which made her scream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give Peyton a quick bath if you watch Shannie and Eliza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>By the time India undressed the fussy baby, ran the bath water, scrubbed her, rinsed her, dried her, diapered her, clothed her and returned to the kitchen, half an hour had passed and Shannie was crying in her high chair.</p><p>India said, \u201cTrade ya,\u201d handing Peyton to Colt and lifting Shannie out. She shot a look at an entirely too quiet Eliza...who blinked at her impishly as she bit into a cookie. In fact, Eliza had a whole stack of cookies in front of her.</p><p>\u201cColt! Where did Eliza get\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were counting them, and since she\u2019s bein\u2019 so good and such a helpful big sister, entertaining Shannie Banannie, I let her have a couple extras, right, cookie monster?\u201d</p><p>Eliza giggled.</p><p>\u201cYou are a s-u-c-k-e-r, Colt McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Totally when it comes to these darlin\u2019 girls.\u201d He rubbed his cheek over Peyton\u2019s head. \u201cBabies smell so great after a bath, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Seeing Colt\u2019s softer side always made her melt a little. Where else did he show such sweetness?</p><p>He shows it with you all the time.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWill you heat up two bottles while I bathe Shannie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Thud. Eliza stood in front of her, cookie crumbs all over her face and clothes. \u201cInnie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna baf with Shannie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But no splashing.\u201d</p><p>Serious contemplation occurred before Eliza grudgingly said,</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d and flounced up the stairs.</p><p>Bathing two kids took twice as long, especially when the older one insisted on \u201chelping\u201d. The living room was quiet when the three of them trooped back downstairs.</p><p>The TV was on low. Peyton\u2019s bottle was empty. She was sound asleep and drooling on Colt\u2019s shoulder. Colt didn\u2019t mind. He wore a look of contentment India had never seen, nor expected to see. The thought he\u2019d make a terrific father flashed through her mind, and she tamped down envy for the lucky woman who bore his children because he\u2019d make a terrific husband too.</p><p>Eliza bounded over and jumped next to him on the couch.</p><p>Right next to him.</p><p>Peyton stirred and Colt gently rubbed her back.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to put her down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ll do it. Shannie\u2019s bottle is in the pan.\u201d He stood and Eliza immediately scooted into his spot. \u201cI\u2019ll read you a bedtime story when I get back if you pick a book, cookie monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. I not sleepy.\u201d</p><p>But Eliza didn\u2019t last long. Both she and Shannie conked out at the same time. Colt tucked her in while India laid Shannie in her crib and grabbed the baby monitor.</p><p>India flopped on the couch and closed her eyes. A few minutes later the floorboards creaked. \u201cMan, this parenting stuff has me whupped.\u201d</p><p>The couch cushions moved slightly as Colt sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cHow long did you sign on for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday and tomorrow. Sky and Kade will be back late tomorrow night.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. I see the girls for a couple of hours every week and I think they\u2019re all sweet smiles and cute clothes. But then, I see what it really takes to take care of them every day...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what? It seems like too much work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The exact opposite. It seems like the only kind of work that\u2019s worthwhile.\u201d</p><p>Neither one spoke, but it wasn\u2019t an awkward silence.</p><p>Finally, Colt said, \u201cYou see yourself havin\u2019 kids some day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think I\u2019m ready now if I find the right man, but yeah, definitely some day. A couple. Or more.\u201d Pause. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to have kids. I feel like I\u2019m finally at the time and place in my life where I\u2019m ready for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you asked Fallon out? Because she\u2019s wife and mother material?\u201d</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>\u201cLook. I\u2019m sorry. None of my business who you date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it should be your business.\u201d</p><p>A funny tingle started in her chest but she still didn\u2019t open her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I dragged you into a pile of shit last night. I swear to God I didn\u2019t bid that high to embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause people in this town have no fuckin\u2019 idea how talented you are. It pissed me off.\u201d</p><p>A beat passed. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet, but since you have so much credit with me, that means I\u2019m going to be pushing for the starburst nipple design.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly.</p><p>India wasn\u2019t about to let him off the hook. \u201cAs far as Fallon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you ask her out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Colt, that\u2019s crap. Why\u2019d you ask her to the community center dance where everyone could see you two were on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she wasn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took that the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else am I supposed to take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I thought if I was with someone who wasn\u2019t like you in any way, I wouldn\u2019t...compare.\u201d</p><p>That hurt. She might\u2019ve actually winced. Then she felt him move next to her and his breath fanned her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDammit. I\u2019m doin\u2019 this all wrong. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and opened her eyes.</p><p>Colt was right there, with his head next to hers on the couch.</p><p>\u201cEvery single woman comes up short when I compare them to you.</p><p>And before you ask, I ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 about you bein\u2019 short in stature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. And that\u2019s what this crazy week has proven to me. I don\u2019t want to watch you datin\u2019 other guys. I don\u2019t want you to watch me datin\u2019 other women. I don\u2019t want to have to drag you into a supply closet to kiss you and then apologize for doin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be just your friend any more, Indy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I think we can be so much more.\u201d</p><p>Her heart beat a mile a minute. She took a chance and blurted,</p><p>\u201cI want that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Colt\u2019s eyes searched her face. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince that night I shot you with the nail gun.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSo I guess I can quit bitchin\u2019 about that, huh?\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for a long time, not touching, just looking at each other, and just breathing the same air.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe start dating. Official like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDating? Like you pick me up at my place, hold the door for me and take me out for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d Colt paused. \u201cHow long has it been since you dated?\u201d</p> <p>Would Colt be pleased or pissed if she told him the last relationship she\u2019d been in was purely sexual? When India thought about it...had she ever really just \u201cdated\u201d a man?</p><p>No. She\u2019d had sex with plenty of guys, hooked up with more than her fair share, but flowers, dinner, and moonlit walks? Not so much a priority in her younger years when she was drunk or high.</p><p>Since she\u2019d cleaned up, fixing herself was more a priority than getting fixed up with some man. And in the three years since she\u2019d starting hanging out with Colt, she\u2019d been content to be with just him. She hadn\u2019t needed or wanted any other man.</p><p>So what did that say about their friendship?</p><p>It\u2019s always been more than just a simple friendship and you were too stubborn to admit it.</p> <p>\u201cIndy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done the dating thing since I was a teen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, I was about to say the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? We\u2019re a pair, huh?\u201d</p><p>Colt eased back. \u201cWhich makes it all the more important that we do this right. Goin\u2019 on dates. Takin\u2019 it one step at a time. I\u2019ve screwed up everything that matters in my life in some way or another, India. Our...relationship is too important to throw away on a quick tumble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you agree to go slow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo slow, as in...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust dating. No sex.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been more serious in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>India stared at him with such confusion he almost laughed. \u201cTo answer the question I see in your eyes, yes, I wanna get nekkid with you. I can\u2019t wait to get nekkid with you. We are so gonna set the mattress on fire when we do get nekkid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut for the past three years you\u2019ve thought of me as Colt, your buddy. Or your Saturday night movie pal. Or the alcoholic you\u2019ve counseled. Or the tattoo guinea pig. Or the guy you call when you need help with your sister\u2019s kids. Or Colt, the cowboy.\u201d He touched her face. \u201cI am all of those, but I want you to see me as a man first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever any doubt in my mind you\u2019re all man, Colt McKay.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face with one hand and kissed her.</p><p>India\u2019s lips parted, but he didn\u2019t delve into temptation. Instead, he feathered his lips across her trembling mouth, as if gauging the best way their lips fit together for a soft exploratory kiss. Or for an openmouthed, tongue clashing, passionate kiss. Or for a playful, biting kiss.</p><p>Her breath stuttered when he finally slid his tongue into her mouth. He stroked and licked and tasted without hurry. Without mercy. As if kissing her were the end-all, not just the means to the end.</p><p>Colt kissed the corners of her smile, outlining the shape of her upper lip and lower swell with an insistent swipe of his tongue. He nipped and nuzzled and seduced, and yet his hands never moved from her jawbone.</p><p>\u201cMore. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWantin\u2019 more ain\u2019t a bad thing,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s why we oughta take it slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never been like this for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d He moved back slightly, keeping his cheek pressed into the cushion.</p><p>\u201cReal.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>India chewed her lip. Indecision warred in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSugar, you know you can tell me anything and I ain\u2019t gonna judge you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just...\u201d She inhaled. Exhaled. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about some of this stuff in meetings. How so many activities and events in our former lives as users were tied to booze.\u201d A long pause ensued as India struggled to keep going.</p><p>Colt reached for her hand. \u201cNo hurry. We don\u2019t have to talk about this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we do. And I\u2019m relieved to finally be talking about it, to be honest because I\u2019ve never been able to tell a man the truth about my past. Some of the things I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p><p>\u201cJust like you, I\u2019ve had no real relationships in my sobriety, Colt. I\u2019ve held back...because I\u2019m ashamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho you were then, ain\u2019t who you are now, Indy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell myself that, and you can tell me that, because we\u2019ve walked in those shoes. But we both know that\u2019s not always the case with other people in our day-to-day lives. Even people who supposedly care about us.\u201d</p><p>His thoughts flashed to his family and their continued skepticism of him.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you share that humiliation, there\u2019s the chance the person will use it against you at the first opportunity. Or they\u2019ll cut you out of their life entirely. So how do you ever trust someone?</p><p>Without giving them the power to destroy you?\u201d</p><p>Colt knew exactly what she meant. Part of him realized it was a trust issue everyone had on some level. But a larger part of him understood addicts harbored dark secrets that would shock and sicken some people who\u2019d never had to deal with an inner demon hell bent on self-destruction.</p><p>Twelve-step meetings were a safe haven, a place to talk to folks who\u2019d also hit rock bottom. But in some ways, those meetings provided attendees a false sense of security. If you\u2019re in a roomful of drunks and addicts, and they\u2019re accepting of your sordid history, well, then maybe there\u2019s a chance others will accept you as you are now, and not judge you on what you\u2019d done in the past.</p><p>Wrong. It didn\u2019t work that way.</p><p>Colt saw India\u2019s chest rising and falling as if she\u2019d run a race.</p><p>He let his thumb drift over the back of her knuckles. \u201cBreathe. Slow and steady.\u201d</p><p>After a few minutes, she\u2019d calmed down.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d</p><p>A soft laugh. \u201cSo the question of the day is...will you still be here after I make my confession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I told you, Indy, I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She locked her gaze to his. \u201cIf we\u2019re going through with this crazy dating idea of yours, then this is something you should hear.</p><p>You should also know I\u2019ve never told this to anyone I care about.\u201d</p><p>Rather than let loose a whoop because she admitted she cared about him, he said, \u201cSkylar doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just a couple of detox counselors in California and...the other people involved, but I doubt they remember and they were just as stoned out of their gourds as I was.\u201d</p><p>Then Colt knew her impending confession would be ugly. He didn\u2019t say a word. He just held her hand, and her gaze and hoped it\u2019d be enough.</p><p>\u201cDuring my using years, I traded sex for drugs. And a couple of times when we couldn\u2019t make rent, I charged for sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sugar. That had to\u2019ve been rough.\u201d</p><p>The wariness didn\u2019t leave her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a blur. I\u2019ve never been sure if it\u2019s because I blocked it out, or if it was because of the drugs and booze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably some of both. How\u2019d it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy I was with at the time, Larry, a loser I\u2019d hooked up with in art school, was a small time dealer. We\u2019d get high on whatever product wasn\u2019t selling. His boss would come around to collect the money, and usually we\u2019d snorted or smoked or shot up more than Larry\u2019s cut. So, the boss would take the difference out on trade. Since Larry didn\u2019t have shit, I was the commodity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did this go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of months. Then I OD\u2019d. I don\u2019t really know how I made it to the hospital, but when I woke up, Skylar was there and Larry was long gone. She sent me to detox. By some miracle I hadn\u2019t contracted AIDS or hepatitis or an STD during my blackout sexual hi-jinks. She took me in for a while. I stayed clean, but I got a job at a bar and started drinking. Heavily. And you pretty much know the rest of the story.\u201d</p><p>In and out of jail. In and out of treatment programs. Another OD. When they\u2019d met three years ago, she\u2019d been clean and sober for five years.</p><p>It amazed him, how India turned her life around. She\u2019d taken her passion for art and turned it into a career. After her mother died, she\u2019d moved away and started over thousands of miles away.</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t have the balls to do that. His life had taken a downward spiral for a year or two, but he\u2019d never contemplated shucking it all and starting over out of Wyoming.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful quiet, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinkin\u2019 about how brave you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor telling you my dirty little secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But mostly because you haven\u2019t let your past experiences paralyze you.\u201d He studied her, wondering if he\u2019d overstep his bounds if he voiced the issue on his mind.</p><p>\u201cJust ask me the question I see in your eyes, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Colt gave her half a head butt. \u201cSmartass woman, makin\u2019 fun of a poor, dumb cowboy like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast thing you are, Colt, is dumb. So ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are okay with sex now? No guilt, no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014feelings of shame that make it impossible for me to enjoy sex? I love everything about sex. I\u2019m just a lot choosier about who I have sex with. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the years I\u2019ve known you, I don\u2019t recall you ever talkin\u2019 about a specific man, or a relationship, or sex and I wondered if this thing with your past might\u2019ve affected it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in that no one knows. After I first moved here, I kept a long distance, fuck buddy type thing with a guy from Denver for a while. But it didn\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy tightened his gut. \u201cHow come I never knew?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s easier all around if I keep my personal life out of the meetings. When we were together at A.A., especially in the beginning, I was focused on keeping you sober. It was important you saw me as a survivor, not as a woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI might\u2019ve been a drunk, Indy, but I ain\u2019t never been blind to the fact you\u2019re all woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet-talkin\u2019 cowboy. There\u2019s been no one since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one? Not even a one-nighter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. To be crude, I\u2019ve been getting off with BOB, my battery operated boyfriend, or my own hand.\u201d She gave him the same questioning look he\u2019d given her. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well acquainted with my own hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen dating Rosy Palm, have you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cExclusively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m talking about when it comes to sex with a person.</p> <p>You\u2019ve made no bones about the fact you were a serious horndog with a bad reputation before you had a drinking problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. I didn\u2019t particularly care which woman I ended up fucking at the end of the night, just as long as I got laid. Just as long as I satisfied her to the point she\u2019d tell every other chick in four counties what a stud Colt McKay was, so I wouldn\u2019t have to work at all to coax any woman I wanted into my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And it worked. For years. Might sound cocky as shit, but I barely had to wink at a woman and I could have her on her knees or on her back in no time flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the easy pickin\u2019s get old?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cAre you kiddin\u2019 me?\u201d</p> <p>India whapped him on the arm. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess it did. It all changed when my brothers started pairing off. I was jealous, but rather than try to settle down, I got wilder. In my way of thinkin\u2019, if one woman was good, two would be even better. I\u2019d make them jealous of my lifestyle. I\u2019d be the Hugh Hefner of the notorious McKay clan, charming, sexy, with a rocket in my pocket ready to blow at the first spark and a legion of women lined up to light that match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides getting hooked on all the booze I had to drink to maintain the illusion?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI woke up in the middle of a pile of nekkid bodies. Not all of them female.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He closed his eyes. Way to toss that embarrassing fact out there like a rotten fish, McKay.</p> <p>A cool hand touched his cheek. \u201cNo judgment, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing, because I don\u2019t remember a damn thing. I could\u2019ve had sex with any one of those guys, or all of them. I blacked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that the first time you\u2019d blacked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish. So, I was totally hungover, I couldn\u2019t find my clothes, had no fuckin\u2019 clue where I even was. I managed to hit a familiar road outside of Wheatland, more than a hundred miles from my house\u2014with no memory of how I\u2019d gotten there. When I got home, I found out my mother and my aunt spent the day cleaning my house.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talkin\u2019 bags of beer bottles and cans. Bags of liquor bottles. Empty condom wrappers, empty condom boxes. Hell, we even left used condoms all over the whole house. Even though it was a pigsty, I was livid. Probably out of embarrassment, but at the time, it felt like a total breach of privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t some fifteen-year-old kid. I was a thirty-year-old man, who owned a house and held a job that required more responsibility than I ever wanted. I was a landowner in my own right, outside of the McKay Ranch, with money in the bank, and a brand new truck. I had the adoration of women and the envy of men.</p><p>Who the fuck was my mommy to stick her big goddamn nose into my business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Colt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called her up and said all that shit to her. Really let her have it. And by that time of day, I\u2019d sobered up some, which upset her even more, which pissed my father and my brothers off and they all but kicked me out of the damn family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin Dag basically killed himself in a stupid fuckin\u2019 accident. But it was almost like...he\u2019d wanted to die. I figured it\u2019d be the best thing for me\u2014and everyone else in my family\u2014if I followed his lead. It wasn\u2019t the cold bucket of water Kade dumped on me that woke me up. It was the truth that Kade seemed to be the only person who cared whether I lived or died, when he should\u2019ve hated me for fucking up things with Skylar.</p><p>\u201cMight sound sappy as shit, but I wanted to be the kind of man Kade was. A stand-up guy. He and Keely and our cousin Nick West got me into rehab. A month later I came back here and met you.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other in silence for several long minutes.</p><p>\u201cTalk about spilling our guts, huh?\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Mine hurt a little, to tell you the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Pause. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSo the question is...you still up for datin\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. But no sex? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. To start with, just havin\u2019 you in my arms all night tonight would be good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has been a while since you\u2019ve had sex, if you think cuddling is a good substitute for it.\u201d</p><p>Colt laughed.</p><p>\u201cWould there be kissing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. Only over our clothes, not on bare skin.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have our clothes on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll our clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can take your socks off as long as you don\u2019t put your cold feet on me.\u201d</p><p>Her surprised look morphed into a shrewd one. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll literally only sleep with you tonight. On one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have an end date for the moratorium on sex.\u201d</p><p>He considered it. \u201cTwo weeks. From last night. That sound fair?\u201d</p><p>India rolled her eyes. \u201cI was hoping for two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe glad I didn\u2019t go with my original plan of two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just cruel, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve\u2014we\u2019ve\u2014waited this long, a couple of weeks will be a snap.\u201d He ran his knuckles down the side of her neck.</p><p>India leaned forward and kissed him. \u201cI\u2019m gonna so love tempting you into giving in before the official time is up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can try. But I can be damn stubborn.\u201d</p><p>A cry sounded from the baby monitor. Then silence. When he looked back at her, she was yawning.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s call it a night. How about you check on the girls, I\u2019ll set the alarm system and track down blankets and pillows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d India popped up off the couch like a jack in the box.</p><p>Less than five minutes later, they looked at the couch and then at each other. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we do what parents with little kids do. We fall into bed, exhausted, with thoughts of raunchy, hot sex the furthest thing from our minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work. But if you snore, I\u2019m punching you in the nose.\u201d</p><p>Colt tumbled them onto the couch, wrapped her in his arms and felt at home for the first time in years.</p><p>\u201cBut I really am a princess,\u201d India read. She covered her hand with her mouth and yawned.</p><p>The book jiggled and an impatient Eliza said, \u201cInnie. Read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza, we\u2019ve read this book twice already. It\u2019s boring me.</p><p>Can\u2019t we read something else?\u201d Headlights swept across the living room windows. \u201cHey. I think your mom and dad are home.\u201d</p><p>The book flew and Eliza slid off the couch. She ran to the foyer and jumped up and down in front of the window.</p><p>The door opened and Eliza launched herself at the first person through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><p>Kade dropped the overnight bag and scooped Eliza into his arms. \u201cWhatcha doin\u2019 up, girly? It\u2019s past your bedtime.\u201d He kissed her cheeks and her forehead and the crown of her head.</p><p>Lord. He was so wrapped around her finger it wasn\u2019t funny.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissed you too, princess. Let\u2019s move outta the way so Mama can get in.\u201d</p><p>The second Skylar came in Eliza wiggled to be let down and threw herself at Sky. \u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d She lifted Eliza and the little girl clung to her neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be missed.\u201d</p><p>India hung back while Eliza chattered away at her amused parents.</p><p>\u201c...an\u2019 unka Cole an\u2019 me frowed rocks.\u201d</p><p>Kade looked at India. \u201cColt was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came by to help out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the girls give you enough trouble so you had to call in reinforcements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My God, at one point I think we all were crying at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Skylar laughed. \u201cNot as easy as it looks, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said it was, Sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShannie and Peyton asleep?\u201d Kade asked.</p><p>\u201cI put them down about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple hours before they\u2019re up again,\u201d Sky said.</p><p>\u201cThanks for pinch hitting, India. We really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you guys had a good time?\u201d</p><p>Kade grinned. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d</p><p>Skylar blushed and handed Eliza to India. \u201cGive your Auntie Indy a bye-bye kiss and Daddy will tuck you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnka Cole kiss Innie bye-bye too.\u201d</p><p>India whispered, \u201cYou are a traitor, Eliza Belle. See if you get cookies from me again.\u201d Then she blew a raspberry on her neck.</p><p>Eliza giggled and held her arms out to Skylar. \u201cMama tuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be up in a minute,\u201d Kade said to Skylar\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m pooped. I don\u2019t know how you guys do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it day by day. Sometimes hour by hour.\u201d</p><p>Almost word for word on how to deal with addiction, but India doubted Kade would appreciate the comparison. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwins were a surprise, that\u2019s for damn sure. Not that I\u2019m complainin\u2019.\u201d He smiled. \u201cMuch as I love our girls, I love spendin\u2019 time alone with my wife, so thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys deserve it.\u201d She picked up her overnight bag. \u201cAnd you\u2019re welcome. See you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh, not so fast. Tell me about this goodbye kiss Uncle Colt laid on you that impressed Eliza.\u201d</p> <p>Dammit. \u201cIt was no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it ain\u2019t gonna bother Colt if I tell him you said that kiss wasn\u2019t a big deal?\u201d</p><p>India spun around. \u201cDon\u2019t say that to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour words, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. It was a big deal, okay? A very, very big deal. And while I\u2019m confessing, you should know he spent the night here too.\u201d</p> <p>Kade\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWere you two havin\u2019 wild monkey sex while you were supposed to be watchin\u2019 our kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Colt and I aren\u2019t having sex, which is why the kiss was such a big deal.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cColt and I have had our...issues come to a head in the last two weeks. We\u2019ve been friends for so long that it shocked both of us to figure out we don\u2019t want to be friends anymore...ah hell, we\u2019re dating, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince last night. He came over and helped me with the girls, because I was stressed. After they were in bed, we ended up talking for hours. Which was different than all the other times he and I have talked for hours. Then this morning, he played outside with Eliza while the twins napped. But he did lay a sloppy, wet kiss on me before he left and Little Miss Tattle-Tale saw it.\u201d</p><p>Kade didn\u2019t utter a word, which bothered India worse than if he would\u2019ve chewed her out. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this.\u201d</p><p>Not good. \u201cJust spit it out, Kade.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re family, Colt is family. There\u2019s more at stake here for everyone than the two of you datin\u2019 for a while and then callin\u2019 it quits. I\u2019m as close to him as I am to Buck. I don\u2019t wanna see him get hurt. He\u2019s been hurt enough.\u201d</p><p>India looked away.</p><p>Kade put his finger under her chin and lifted her face back up.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna see you get hurt either. You\u2019ve had your share of hurts too, Indy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just be careful, okay? Be mindful. And just so you know, I\u2019m gonna tell him the same thing. Even if it pisses him off. Ever since he sobered up, he\u2019s wary of family getting into his personal business.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. She\u2019d figured that out before he\u2019d shared some of his backstory with her.</p><p>She opened her mouth. Closed it. But ultimately blurted, \u201cColt was involved in a big fight with his family last night before he came over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh hell. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He said something to his dad, Colby and Cord said something back, and then Cam jumped in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Evidently Cam told everyone off. Then he took off.</p><p>Colt wasn\u2019t real anxious to get to the ranch today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine. Is that why he was hanging around, teaching Eliza to throw rocks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeaching her? That kid is a deadeye. She was teaching him.\u201d</p><p>Kade grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might give him a call tomorrow to see if he\u2019s all right.</p><p>And remind him of our date.\u201d She winked. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt my feelings at all if you hinted around to him that I\u2019d liked to be romanced. Flowers, poetry, expensive chocolate, hand holding at the movies, walks in the park, fine dining...you know, normal, traditional dating stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t you at all, Indy,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s who I\u2019d like to be with him.\u201d</p><p>The dumbfounded look on Kade\u2019s face was priceless.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Dating Week One</p><p>The back door opened. India craned her neck and her stomach performed a loop-de-loop when Colt sauntered inside.</p><p>The man simply didn\u2019t play fair. He wore a pair of faded Levis that hugged his every thigh muscle. Her gaze followed the contours of the black long sleeved T-shirt molded to his broad chest and wide shoulders, giving him the appearance of a sleek, black panther. He exuded confidence, sexiness and raw magnetism.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t supposed to sleep with him? For two weeks?</p><p>Right.</p><p>Be interesting to see which one of them broke first.</p><p>When he grinned and stalked her, India felt kinship with prey and fought against taking cover. \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust anxious.\u201d He grabbed her hand and brought her fingers to his lips, in a gesture both corny and sweet. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Pizza Barn in Moorcroft.\u201d</p><p>Why were they going out of Sundance? Was Colt embarrassed to be seen with her?</p><p>He must\u2019ve seen the questions in her eyes. \u201cHave you been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I wanted to take you someplace neither one of us have been for our first date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re determined we\u2019re really gonna do this dating thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned I suck at dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, you haven\u2019t dated me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known you for three years. What\u2019s so different about dating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen no way do I want to date you, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a gentleman for two weeks, then all bets are off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I refuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late. You already agreed to my terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was under duress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know my kisses fluster you that much.\u201d He smooched her nose. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The Pizza Barn didn\u2019t exactly drip romance. The square table was standard, covered with a red and white checked tablecloth.</p><p>Plastic flowers jammed in a Perrier bottle coated with dripped wax was centered between a shaker of Parmesan cheese and crushed hot peppers.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what you want?\u201d</p><p>India batted her lashes and cooed, \u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>When the waitress came by, Colt offered India a smug smile and recited their usual pizza order. \u201cA large pepperoni with green olives and two mugs of rootbeer.\u201d</p><p>After she\u2019d dropped off their drinks, she\u2019d warned them it\u2019d take at least an hour to get their pizza. India said, \u201cWhy do you think the wait is so long? There\u2019s hardly anyone in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they want customers blowing tokens in the arcade.</p><p>Which is a great idea.\u201d He scooted out of the booth. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s check out the games.\u201d</p><p>Colt dragged her to the arcade and bought twenty bucks worth of tokens. She watched as he played every game from simulated golf to shooting hoops. Damn man made every shot. He was probably a helluva basketball player in his day.</p><p>When he hopped into a virtual NASCAR machine, complete with padded seat, steering wheel, goggles and gearshift, she allowed a weary sigh to escape.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you wanna play?\u201d Colt indicated the empty machine next to his. \u201cOr are you afraid I\u2019ll beat you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ll beat me,\u201d she retorted as she slid into the seat.</p><p>\u201cI suck at this kind of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you play video games in high school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Unless you count the time my boyfriend dragged me out of the fall festival and down the street so he could challenge the high score on Pac-Man at Burger King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her hand over her heart. \u201cNo kidding. I never fully recovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet the game was the only place he scored that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that right.\u201d Well, they\u2019d scored some premium grass right after that, but it wasn\u2019t something she wanted to confess to Colt. She blew out an impatient breath after struggling with the mass of wires attached to the goggles.</p><p>\u201cHere, lemme help you.\u201d Colt brushed her hair from her face; his touch lingered on the curve of her neck. India held perfectly still, hoping he\u2019d kiss her. But he only eased the helmet on with a friendly pat on her helmeted head. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He dropped four tokens in the slots anyway. The racetrack roared to life inside her goggles and she was lost to everything but the thrill of the chase.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t much of a contest. Colt won every game. Evidently gentlemanly behavior didn\u2019t include allowing your date to win even one race.</p><p>India ripped off the goggles with mock disgust. \u201cI give. Now can we play a game that I might have a chance at beating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>She spied the skee-ball racks in the corner and grabbed his hand. \u201cLike that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, have you ever played?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But how hard can it be? Bowling with croquet balls?\u201d She preened a bit. \u201cI rock at croquet. Bet I can kick your butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you willin\u2019 to bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just an expression Colt, don\u2019t be so literal.\u201d</p><p>His answering chuckle was low and sexy. \u201cJust as I suspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t willin\u2019 to put your money where your sexy mouth is.\u201d</p><p>He thought she had a sexy mouth? \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mr. Moneybags, you\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName your bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne dollar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine . Two dollars.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a kiss?\u201d</p><p>Her midsection tightened and blood rushed into all the places blood wasn\u2019t supposed to rush on a first date. \u201cThree dollars?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA slow kiss,\u201d he said, acting like he hadn\u2019t heard her.</p><p>\u201cFive bucks.\u201d</p><p>He erased the gap between them, forcing her to meet his twinkling eyes. \u201cOne slow, deep, wet, kiss, for as long as I want.</p> <p>That\u2019s my final offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I get to pick where you kiss me, slow and long and deep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrnery woman. You\u2019re hell on my intention of bein\u2019 a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I preferred a gentleman, I\u2019d be dating your cousin Blake.\u201d</p><p>Shit. That was the wrong thing to say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThink? Yeah, I get that a lot from you. Just forget it.\u201d He scowled, shoving a hand through his hair. \u201cLet\u2019s just play the damn game and have some damn fun.\u201d</p><p>For the next ten minutes, India watched him from the corner of her eye. Didn\u2019t seem like he was having fun. At all . He cursed every time the ball landed in the lowly five-point hole, which was a lot.</p><p>She had to do something to make up for her bout of bitchiness.</p><p>She could be fun. Playful.</p><p>As Colt was about to toss the ball, she tickled his left side, from his hip to his ribs. He faced her with a look of utter disbelief, forgetting about the forward motion of the ball. It flew from his hand and bounced off the top of the metal cage, rebounding toward them.</p><p>India yelled, \u201cDuck!\u201d and jerked him down, keeping an eye on the ball as it bounced on the red carpet and narrowly missed smashing his foot.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell were you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaving you from the run-away ball.\u201d Why wasn\u2019t he pleased by her quick thinking?</p><p>\u201cYou were saving me?\u201d he echoed. \u201cIt was your fault that the damn thing got away from me in the first place. Were you hopin\u2019 to distract me so you\u2019d win by default?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was trying to be spontaneous and fun. Jesus. Now do you believe me that I suck at this dating stuff?\u201d</p><p>A beat passed. Colt bestowed that bad boy grin that wreaked havoc on her at the most basic level. \u201cWell, if the datin\u2019 stuff doesn\u2019t work then we can go to plan \u2018B\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots and lots of kinky, wild sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned I\u2019m an alternative plan kind of chick?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cThought that might spur your interest. Let\u2019s stick with plan \u2018A\u2019 for now. Maybe we\u2019d better sit down.\u201d</p><p>As Colt led her back to the table, they passed a walled-off area she hadn\u2019t noticed. Apparently he hadn\u2019t noticed either because when he did, he almost dislocated her arm dragging her inside the small space. \u201cHoly crap. I haven\u2019t seen one of them in years.\u201d</p><p>India wasn\u2019t sure what he was gawking at. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Eight Ball Express. It\u2019s a classic pinball machine.\u201d He dropped her hand, staring at the machine with reverence. \u201cJust one game.\u201d</p><p>When Colt plugged the tokens into the slot, his eyes lit up as brightly as the lights on the machine. His concentration through the cachink cachink of the metal ball, the buzzers, the trilling bells and constant flipper action was impressive. But after ten minutes, India was bored. She sighed heavily.</p><p>He glanced at her for all of one second. \u201cAin\u2019t this great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s hard, holding in all my excitement.\u201d</p><p>The machine beeped some kind of tinny, victorious sound. He punched the air and said, \u201cHigh score!\u201d</p><p>He grinned in the boyish way that had her returning his smile without hesitation. \u201cI see that. Does that mean you\u2019re finished?\u201d</p><p>Colt latched onto her hips and thrust her in front of him. \u201cUh-huh. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d Colt guided her fingers to the circular buttons on either side of the machine, snuggling his body behind hers.</p><p>\u201cThese are flippers, they keep your ball in play.\u201d He pressed her fingers and the small mechanical arms moved. \u201cSee? Now get ready.\u201d He pulled back on the silver knob on the right side, which connected to a shiny spring.</p><p>India watched the metal ball travel up the canal and bounce around the posts at the top, before continuing down the middle and out of sight.</p><p>Not a good sign. \u201cSorry. Told you I was bad at this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, but next time, hit your flippers.\u201d Colt released the spring again, sending the next ball to the left side. India continually pushed the buttons.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cSlow down. Not yet. Wait for it.\u201d</p><p>His husky voice sent a shiver up her spine. She completely forgot what she was doing until the flash of the silver ball caught her eye as it rolled down the center.</p><p>Colt groaned.</p><p>India groaned. \u201cI did it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d His warm breath fluttered over her neck. \u201cJust takes practice.\u201d He flicked the ball high, murmuring encouraging comments in her ear.</p><p>Whoa. Tandem pinball had serious benefits. Colt did a little hip wiggle, positioning his hard body firmly into her backside and a blast of pure sexual heat rocketed through her. She closed her eyes to savor the moment.</p><p>Colt\u2019s disgruntled snort forced her eyes back open.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe key to this game is concentration. I know you can do it.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen you with a tattoo gun. Focus.\u201d His hands tightened over hers on the flippers.</p><p>She imagined his warm, rough palms sliding up her arms and across her chest. First he\u2019d squeeze her breasts, then pluck her nipples between his fingertips. He\u2019d keep smoothing those wicked hands down her stomach until they landed on her hips. His fingers would meet in the center of her body; one quick tug and the top button on her jeans would pop open\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you even watchin\u2019? Because you didn\u2019t use your flippers once\u2014\u201d</p><p>She spun around so quickly he staggered, grabbing onto her shoulders for balance. \u201cActually, I wasn\u2019t paying attention. It\u2019s distracting when you\u2019re pressed against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I liked it. A lot.\u201d</p><p>The scant space between them crackled with energy. Neither spoke, neither broke eye contact. Several long seconds passed before Colt lowered his mouth to hers.</p><p>India\u2019s head buzzed while his lips moved back and forth.</p><p>Lightly. He kept the kiss soft, sensual. Rough thumbs caressed her cheekbones before his fingers tunneled into her hair.</p><p>He canted her head to his liking. Teased her with soft lips and sharp nips of his teeth and warm breath, sweet there-and-gone kisses. His hands began traveling down her body. He slicked the very tip of his tongue across the seam of her lips and her mouth opened to him.</p><p>India boldly thrust her tongue in further, hoping for a stronger, more complete flavor. He tasted faintly of root beer and toothpaste; with an underlying hint of spice she\u2019d associated as uniquely his.</p><p>Colt gripped her hips and pressed his pelvis closer as he maneuvered her against the pinball machine.</p><p>A sharp pain jabbed her spine. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d he muttered against her throat, hoisting her on top of the pinball machine. Urging her knees open, he positioned himself between her thighs and clamped his mouth over hers with renewed fervor.</p><p>Lights flashed, bells clanged and India knew it wasn\u2019t from the arcade games. His cunning hands and hot mouth unleashed a steel ball of desire and it broke free to ricochet wildly in her blood. She wanted the heat bubbling under her skin to ignite his. She let her head fall back as he trailed openmouthed kisses down her neck.</p><p>His hot breath scorched her. He yanked her shirt down, exposing more skin to run his tongue and his teeth over without impediments.</p><p>She shivered and squeezed her thighs tightly, trying to line up the wet, aching part of herself with his cock.</p><p>He circled his arousal against her, finding the perfect friction, and took the next kiss down to where she felt it in the very depths of her soul.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d A gravelly voice barked. \u201cI warned you kids once about messing around in here.\u201d</p><p>India opened her eyes and focused on Colt. She\u2019d never seen such hunger on a man\u2019s face. Hunger for her.</p><p>The intruder shuffled closer and said, \u201cWell, hell, you two aren\u2019t exactly kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re aware of that.\u201d Colt kept his gaze on India as he helped her slide off the machine.</p><p>She stood next to him on wobbly legs.</p><p>\u201cYou oughta act better than this. It\u2019s those damn teenagers I usually hafta worry about.\u201d The man\u2019s jowls shook. \u201cFound a used condom behind that pinball machine. Had to close the place down to clean every horizontal surface.\u201d</p><p>He glared at the pinball machine behind India, looking like he expected her to pull out a bottle of Windex, a roll of paper towels and wipe her butt prints off the machine. His bulk shifted as he waited for an explanation for their behavior.</p><p>But India shot the man a flinty eyed stare. \u201cSo, we got carried away. I swear we weren\u2019t to the condom stage...\u201d</p><p>Yet.</p><p>The unspoken word hung in the sexually charged air.</p><p>The fat man snarled, \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>Two weeks would kill him. Hell, they hadn\u2019t passed the two-hour mark without mauling each other. In public. Getting kicked out of an arcade for lewd behavior. For Christsake, they were adults!</p><p>Yeah. He sucked at this dating stuff as much as India did.</p><p>Which reinforced his determination to see it through. To the end.</p><p>Twelve days. Two hundred and eighty eight hours.</p><p>Not that Colt was keeping track.</p><p>They returned to the table as their pizza arrived. For the next hour, the conversation wasn\u2019t different than the other times they\u2019d gone out as friends.</p><p>With the exception they were holding hands.</p><p>With the exception they were making googly eyes at each other and lacing their banter with sexual innuendos.</p><p>With the exception Colt\u2019s cock was as hard as a hockey stick.</p><p>Nah. That wasn\u2019t anything new.</p><p>On the way back to Sundance, India scooted next to him on the bench seat. She fiddled with the radio. The temperature. The position of the air vents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was nervous. Interesting.</p><p>Colt pulled up to the back of the building.</p><p>India said, \u201cIs this where you tell me you had a great time and you\u2019ll call me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have a great time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a fantastic time.\u201d He curled his hand around her jaw and turned her face to his. \u201cI\u2019d like nothin\u2019 better than to come in, but we both know it\u2019s better if I say goodnight here.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him with sweet regret. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the meeting tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And afterward, I want to do something with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot do something to me?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cHold that thought for another twelve days. How about if we go out for ice cream?\u201d</p><p>A devious smile lit up her face. \u201cWith the no sex rule, you seriously think you can handle watching me lick an ice cream cone for more than thirty seconds?\u201d</p><p>The reality of her pink tongue lapping. Her mouth sucking.</p><p>Watching her throat muscles as she swallowed the creaminess. No way. \u201cPoint taken. How about a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if you leave it up to me?\u201d</p> <p>Colt frowned.</p><p>\u201cInnocent fun. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo peeking, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>After the A.A. meeting, India had commandeered his truck and blindfolded him. She held his hands as she helped him out of the passenger side. She kept holding his hands as they walked up a small incline. They were outside, on grass, not gravel. He was trying like hell not to be freaked out. He was hoping like hell this wasn\u2019t some bizarre game of trust she\u2019d concocted because he hadn\u2019t participated in the one at the meeting again.</p><p>\u201cReady? Keep your eyes closed.\u201d</p><p>The silken scarf slipped from his eyes, teasing him with the aroma of her perfume.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. You can open them.\u201d</p><p>His eyes blinked a couple times. He looked around. Two swing sets, a jungle gym, a sandbox and monkey bars. They were in City Park.</p><p>\u201cA playground. You brought me to a playground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Pull up a swing.\u201d India ran to the swing on the left and hopped on the rubber seat. She wrapped her hands around the chains and started to move, pumping her legs.</p><p>He ambled over and plopped next to her, straddling the swing so the chain followed the line of his spine and he could look at her.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna swing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019d rather watch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Each pass took her swing higher. The metal bars bounced and the chains squeaked.</p><p>India\u2019s movements hypnotized Colt. The wind ruffling her coal black hair, the ends colored a vivid blue, which emphasized the paleness of her skin. The scarf fluttered behind her in a jaunty wave as she swung forward.</p><p>His stomach fluttered. God. She was so beautiful. So happy in her own tattooed and pierced skin. So honest and thoughtful and crazy fun. So...India.</p><p>So mine.</p><p>She slowed and stopped by letting her combat boots drag in the shallow dent in the dirt, facing him in mirror position. \u201cDon\u2019t you like to swing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen so long I don\u2019t remember.\u201d He grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cSo...come here often?\u201d</p><p>India returned his grin. \u201cNo. Sky won\u2019t let me bring Eliza yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you brought me instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, I just don\u2019t understand why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis might sound silly and sappy and stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>She poked her fingers through the chain links. \u201cYou know all those romantic comedies where the man and woman end up in a park having a heart to heart on the swings? Or the swing set is their special meeting place from their childhood and they reconnect there as adults? Or where they had their first kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like that.\u201d</p><p>Colt waited.</p><p>\u201cMy memories of schoolyards are mostly bad. Hanging around, looking for drugs, getting into trouble. I\u2019d like to have a good memory. Something romantic like in the movies.\u201d She finally looked at him so earnestly his heart melted. \u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh hell, sugar, c\u2019mere,\u201d he managed over the lump in his throat. He scooted forward and yanked her chain, bringing her swing closer to his. \u201cI\u2019m not really romantic leading man material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are to me,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Colt touched the side of her face. \u201cKnow one of my favorite things about you? You live in the moment. Without apology. With gusto. It\u2019s a helluva thing to see.\u201d</p><p>She appeared poleaxed by his words.</p><p>When he leaned forward to kiss her, he urged, \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Her dark lashes fanned her cheek.</p><p>He brushed his lips over hers. \u201cYour mouth is so soft. Such a perfect fit for mine.\u201d At first, Colt kissed her with passion and promise, then he gentled the kiss into something wholly different.</p><p>Sweetness. Tenderness.</p><p>India sighed in his mouth.</p><p>His smile broke their lips free. \u201cSo in any of these romantic comedies, do they end up doin\u2019 it on the swing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity. That, I\u2019d pay to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we oughta jot that down on our kinky sex fantasy list to try, once we actually start having sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a...list of that kinda stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you can bet your sweet behind I\u2019m startin\u2019 one right now.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>They held hands as they walked back to the truck. \u201cThank you for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. What are we doin\u2019 tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. We can\u2019t have a date every night of the week, Colt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I think I\u2019m supposed to play coy, bat my lashes, and pretend to be \u2018busy\u2019 washing my hair for the next two nights to keep you interested.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThe datin\u2019 handbook clearly states we spend as much time together as possible to keep me interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a handbook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve got an advantage over me because I\u2019m flying blind here, Colt.\u201d India gave him all-too brief a kiss before she hopped out of the cab.</p><p>He was damn tired of saying goodbye to her from the driver\u2019s seat of his truck. And it was only their second date.</p><p>Colt put India out of his mind during the hours he spent working on the ranch. She\u2019d kept her tattoo shop open late some nights, so she\u2019d bailed on him for a third date.</p><p>When he\u2019d called after breakfast and asked her plans for the evening, she\u2019d offered some half-assed excuse. He couldn\u2019t imagine she\u2019d actually attempt the \u201cplaying hard to get\u201d angle.</p><p>Instead of brooding and pacing in his empty house, he headed to the community center. He ran. Lifted weights. It helped if he focused on the pain of pushing himself to the limit and couldn\u2019t flash back to the way India felt in his arms. The sweet, addictive taste of her mouth. The intoxicating scent of her hair and her skin.</p><p>Her soft, breathy moans when he kissed her. The husky, sexy timbre of her voice in his ear.</p><p>Think of something else or you\u2019re going to get a hard-on in the gym.</p><p>Workout complete, he looped a towel around his sweaty neck and cut through the main hallway to the men\u2019s locker room for a cold shower.</p><p>But it seemed as if those reminders were stuck on a continual mental loop. India\u2019s taste. Her scent. Her laugh. Her voice. Her instructions for everyone to sit down and listen up or no one would get a cookie.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Colt shook his head. Pathetic. Hearing her phantom voice.</p><p>Except...he took another step and heard it again.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ginny. Poke a hole in the cup first. Then put in the gravel.\u201d</p><p>His heart kicked harder than when he\u2019d been running flat out on the treadmill. India was here? He followed the sound of her voice, coming from inside a small room. He hesitated outside the door, in case he was delusional and hearing things.</p><p>\u201cOnce you get the soil in the cup\u2014Jeremy honey, only fill it halfway, no, don\u2019t pack it so tight\u2014we\u2019ll put in the seeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I spilled\u2014\u201d a girlish voice wailed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Becca, don\u2019t cry. I\u2019ve got lots more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wanted to take it home to my mommy tonight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still can. We have time, sweetie, don\u2019t worry. Go grab another cup and start over. I\u2019ll be right there to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia? Ruger threw a rock at Anton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo throwing rocks, Ruger.\u201d</p><p>Colt poked his head in and saw...total chaos.</p><p>At least ten kids, a mix of boys and girls, around seven years old, were flinging dirt all over a long table. A few boys were throwing small marble-sized gravel at each other. One red-haired girl poured water on a pile of dirt while an Indian girl stirred it into mud. A bespectacled kid was methodically stacking empty Styrofoam cups in precise rows. Some youngsters were actually sitting still, awaiting additional instructions.</p><p>But India wasn\u2019t fazed. She stopped the rock fight, the mud-pie makers, and managed to get the cups back in the plastic bag, all while directing the kids in the next step of the project.</p><p>Colt was absolutely stunned. This was the woman who\u2019d called him in a panic? About three kids? And she was juggling...ten? A disconcerting thought on its own, but not as confounding as why hadn\u2019t India just told him about this when he\u2019d called her this morning?</p><p>\u201cWhose daddy are you?\u201d</p><p>India looked over at him and froze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not anybody\u2019s daddy.\u201d He glanced down at the tow-headed boy. \u201cI was just passing by and wondered what you guys were doin\u2019. Looks like fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re planting flowers!\u201d the mud-pie maker exclaimed, throwing her hands up, flinging mud everywhere.</p><p>\u201cCool. Can I watch?\u201d He stepped inside, bracing himself for India\u2019s reaction.</p><p>She didn\u2019t growl or demand he leave, like he\u2019d expected, she smiled the angelic smile that twisted his guts into a pretzel. \u201cSure.</p> <p>Come on in. You can even help.\u201d</p><p>The bespectacled boy asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt. What\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHayden.\u201d He gave Colt a thorough once-over. \u201cHey, are you Buck\u2019s cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I am. Do you know him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh. He\u2019s my big buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for Buck. So, Hayden, think you can help me make one of these things?\u201d</p><p>Hayden beamed. \u201cYes. It\u2019s quite logical, really.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the kids started talking all at once, offering suggestions. Crowding him, but he didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>India clapped her hands. \u201cOkay, munchkins, listen up. Once everyone has soil in their cup, we\u2019ll move to the next step, the fun part; planting the seeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrot seeds?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEww. Gross. I hate carrots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Anton. Sunflower seeds.\u201d</p><p>Chatter rose again, but India focused her charges\u2019 attention to the task at hand. Colt labeled each child\u2019s name on their individual cups with masking tape.</p><p>After the seeds were planted, and another thin layer of soil sprinkled on top, and each cup was watered, the kids lined up at two sinks and washed up.</p><p>As India tried to get a handle on the mess, Colt handed out cookies.</p><p>During the brief lull, he managed to sidle closer to her.</p><p>She spoke before he did. \u201cSurprised to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t know you did this sort of thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNormally, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d you end up doin\u2019 it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorture and bribery.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNot true. I\u2019m filling in for Domini. I usually help out during the fair and do face painting and airbrush tattoos. That\u2019s a little more one on one, rather than ten on one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t seem like you had a problem. You\u2019re really good with kids, India.\u201d</p><p>Parents started showing up, whisking their children away. Colt got into a lengthy conversation with Hayden\u2019s mother in the doorway. When he returned to the empty room, India was stacking supplies in the corner cupboard. \u201cDo you need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve got it.\u201d For the next few minutes she ignored him completely.</p><p>Colt placed his hand on her arm. \u201cIndia? What\u2019d I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>She slammed the cupboard door. \u201cDid you have fun showing your cowboy charm to that hot-looking redhead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I was just talkin\u2019 to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Forget it. See? It was nothing.\u201d She stomped to the sink in the corner and turned the water on full blast.</p><p>India was...jealous? It shouldn\u2019t make him grin, but it did.</p><p>India splashed cool water on her face, as close as she could get to a cold shower. The man set her blood on fire with a smoldering look. In a roomful of first graders. And did he have to spread that sexy sweetness all around? He\u2019d just smiled at the hot mama and she\u2019d practically fallen at his feet.</p><p>Not Colt\u2019s fault. You know he didn\u2019t do anything wrong beside stand there and look good.</p><p>Argh.</p><p>She\u2019d be better off dating a toad instead of a prince.</p><p>Prince? Right. He\u2019s just a man. You\u2019ve spent way too much time reading fairy tales to your nieces.</p><p>India reached for the bar of soap and the scent of musk and cotton surrounded her.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you scrub up,\u201d he said over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cColt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hands are better than one. How about if you hold the soap and I\u2019ll do all the dirty work?\u201d His low, seductive voice whispered across her damp skin. Strong arms circled her waist and he tugged her to his chest, his hips tight against her backside. He nestled his chin in the slope where her shoulder met her neck and he removed the soap from her tentative grip.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move. She didn\u2019t want to move.</p><p>When Colt\u2019s hands began creating suds, she forgot to breathe.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>His long, tanned fingers worked the hard bar of soap into creamy softness. The soft lather contrasted with the coarse edges of his fingers. He gathered her right hand inside his, scrubbing the thick soap into her palm, then slowly across her knuckles. He massaged the bubbles from her wrist to her fingertips, threading his fingers through hers, back and forth, his wide palm cradling the back of her hand.</p><p>With Colt\u2019s body heat scorching her, she barely noticed the soapy swirls spinning down the drain. How could such simple contact be so unbearably erotic? She sagged into him, her hand slipped from his grasp.</p><p>\u201cIndia?\u201d His husky voice sent a shiver zinging through her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and her cheek scraped his scruffy beard.</p><p>Colt switched hands, repeating the process, with more excruciating slowness. Long, sensual strokes. Light. Then firm. Oh-so-painstakingly adept.</p><p>Desire swamped her, left dampness on her belly, her spine, between her legs. His breath crested over the wet spots beading on her neck.</p><p>After sluicing warm water from the ticklish bend in her elbows, to her fingertips, Colt ripped off a paper towel and dried her as thoroughly as he\u2019d washed her.</p><p>She hissed at the abrasive feel of the towel\u2019s nap on her moist, over-sensitized skin.</p><p>He turned her around. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne very long day.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were blue flames of pure desire. As he traced a rivulet of water trickling down her cheek, India was shocked the heat between them didn\u2019t evaporate the tiny droplet into steam.</p><p>Colt angled his head, slanting his mouth over hers.</p><p>India felt his breath on her lips. Anticipation hummed between them like an electric current. Her heart raced, her blood ran fast. Her lashes fluttered, her mouth parted slightly. She leaned in, a silent plea for him to close the distance.</p><p>He\u2019d almost made contact; she\u2019d nearly experienced the warmth of his tempting mouth, the flicker of his velvety tongue against hers, when Cam\u2019s booming voice echoed into the small space. \u201cColt! I thought that was you.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of Cam\u2019s voice, India jumped back and lost her balance. Rather than letting her smack her head into the bottom of the cabinet, Colt caught her, losing his footing in the process, and hitting his chin on the cupboard door.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\u2019 \u201cGives the phrase, \u2018taking it on the chin\u2019 new meaning.\u201d</p><p>She tried to get him to lift his face. When he finally did, she gasped, \u201cOmigod Colt, you\u2019re bleeding.\u201d She handed him the paper towel. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme see it,\u201d Cam barked.</p><p>Colt whirled around. \u201cIt\u2019s just a scratch, leave it be. What the devil were you doin\u2019 sneakin\u2019 up on us like that anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sneaking. I didn\u2019t see India behind you. She\u2019s such a little bitty thing she gets lost in your shadow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bite me, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Cam and Colt said, \u201cGladly,\u201d in stereo. Then they laughed in stereo.</p><p>\u201cNow I know you\u2019re fine if you can slip in a lewd comment.</p><p>That\u2019s my cue to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll leave,\u201d Cam said.</p><p>\u201cWait, just a damn minute. Both of you.\u201d He faced Cam.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you barge in here in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tracked you down to ask if you wanted to come over and watch ESPN tonight. The Broncos are playing. Kansas City.\u201d</p><p>Colt seemed torn.</p><p>India kissed his cheek. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>He pulled the paper towel away. \u201cSee? It already stopped bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Thanks for your help tonight. Now go cheer on the Broncos.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Dating Week Two</p><p>\u201cHey, India, can I talk to you for a second?\u201d</p><p>She turned from her conversation with Bert Spotted Tail and smiled. \u201cSure. Almost done here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hurry.\u201d What a lie. It took every ounce of control not to drag her away from the old coot who\u2019d been monopolizing her time for the last twenty minutes.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t for that coot, you wouldn\u2019t even know her.</p><p>Bert called out, \u201cHeya, Colt, one of these days we\u2019re gonna get you to participate in the circle of trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it.\u201d</p><p>The circle of trust was an exercise where one person stood in the middle of a circle of people and fell back trusting someone in the circle would catch them. Colt didn\u2019t trust anyone so blindly. So while they\u2019d been doing this exercise for the last few months, Colt stood on the sidelines. He took some crap about it, but he didn\u2019t care. No way was he taking some psychiatrist\u2019s version of the Nestea plunge.</p><p>\u201cYou playin\u2019 in the basketball game for at-risk youth tomorrow night?\u201d Bert asked.</p><p>With this dating business, he\u2019d forgotten. \u201cYeah. Thanks for the reminder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sweat. You oughta bring India. In fact, if you promise to come, I\u2019ll save you a courtside seat, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re asking me on a date, Bert.\u201d</p><p>A date? Like hell. Colt growled. India and Bert both gave him a strange look.</p><p>\u201cShee. I\u2019m too old to be tryin\u2019 to win the tattooed hand of a wild thing like you. But back in my heyday...I was as rough and rowdy as a mustang. Sorta like McKay.\u201d Bert\u2019s contemplative gaze pinged back and forth between Colt and India. \u201cMaybe you oughta be datin\u2019 him.\u201d</p><p>India lifted her pierced brows at Colt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rather than snap, she is dating me, Colt said, \u201cI\u2019m tame as a trail pony these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them docile lookin\u2019 ones still gotta lot of buck left in</p><p>\u2019em, boy. You just hafta pick the right kinda rider to let the beast loose.\u201d</p><p>Colt couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow night. And put on a good show, will ya?</p><p>I bet twenty bucks on your team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about this charity basketball game,\u201d India said to Bert as Colt headed to the kitchen.</p><p>He rechecked the coffee pot he\u2019d unplugged ten minutes ago.</p><p>Although it\u2019d been a short meeting, it seemed he waited for hours for the attendees to leave. From the moment they\u2019d arrived.</p><p>Might\u2019ve made him selfish, but for the first time in years, Colt hadn\u2019t paid attention to what his fellow A.A. members discussed.</p><p>His focus was on one thing.</p><p>India.</p><p>The outer door slammed, signaling Bert had left. He heard India moving closer, each combat booted footstep across the tile floor pulsed in his groin.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you need?\u201d</p><p>The second he got a whiff of her wildflower scent, he spun around and erased the distance between them in two steps. Curling his hands around her face, he pushed her against the pantry door, crushing her mouth beneath his.</p><p>The instant her lips parted, he canted his head and thrust his tongue deep, kissing her with all the pent-up passion, need and longing he\u2019d held in for the last day.</p><p>As he filled his mouth with her taste, he rested his thumb in the arc of her throat where her heart raced. Stroking that sweet, sensitive section of skin in tiny circles, as if he had his hand on the sweet spot between her legs.</p><p>She twisted her mouth free. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw more of you when we weren\u2019t dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you want to stop dating me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that.\u201d Colt clamped his lips to hers again. He\u2019d intended to seduce her with a sweeter kiss, but the heat between them expanded, burning hotter than his first attempt.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Damn, I love the way you taste right here.\u201d He placed his mouth beneath her ear and sucked.</p><p>\u201cColt McKay. Stop right now or I\u2019m going to punch you.\u201d</p><p>That grabbed his attention. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me a hickey in a church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the one who wanted to take this slow. Yet, you\u2019re mauling me at the first opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere haven\u2019t been many opportunities. That\u2019s why I\u2019m takin\u2019 advantage of it when I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you issuing a challenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d India gave him a look that\u2019d melt ice. She undid the first two buttons on her blouse.</p><p>Whoa. Was she wearing a bra?</p><p>By the fourth button, his answer to the bra question was a definite no. Damn.</p><p>He managed to ask, \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving you an opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor my balls to explode?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWant me to keep going?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cHow far would you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say all the way, but that\u2019s not an option, is it?\u201d</p><p>Hell yeah. No. Dammit. Say no. Colt rubbed the underside of his jaw. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Up went the buttons. \u201cYou\u2019re a cock tease, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he aped.</p><p>\u201cYes, you. Attacking me with all those hot kisses. Talking to me about your balls. I\u2019m going home to take a cold shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll both be coming if you and I are alone in a room with a bed after avoiding temptation for more than a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia. For shame. Dirty talkin\u2019 me in a church. Maybe we\u2019d better lock up before we get struck by lightning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019d feel that sizzle of electricity before I died.\u201d</p><p>Outside, Colt led her to his truck. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t. Not even if I beg you to ride me all night long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, did you always have sex on the brain and I just never noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You just bring out the beast in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a plain mean thing to taunt a guy with who hasn\u2019t had sex in the last three years.\u201d He opened the truck door. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019d be better if I walked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell. You ain\u2019t walkin\u2019 alone at nine at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sundance. What can happen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 if you\u2019re ridin\u2019 in my truck, now get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d India stepped up on the running board and crawled across the bench seat.</p><p>Hoping to lighten her mood, he said, \u201cI wish you were wearin\u2019 a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you were wearing a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly hell, India Blue Ellison, are you an ornery woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA horny woman.\u201d</p><p>At the back of the building, Colt shut off the engine and looked at her. Her mood had changed in the two-minute drive, nothing new; India\u2019s moods were as unpredictable as the Wyoming weather.</p><p>\u201cNow what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Doesn\u2019t this feel...weird? Last week, I had a great time with you. I see you tonight at the meeting, expecting it to be the same. But it\u2019s different. Then Bert is trying to set us up on a date...\u201d</p><p>He watched her fingers pinch the seam on the seat cover.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t even tell him we are dating,\u201d she finished in a rush.</p><p>Colt snatched her restless hand. \u201cIs that what\u2019s bothering you?</p><p>That we didn\u2019t come out and tell anyone at A.A. that everything has changed between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Look, I know it\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid if you\u2019re upset. C\u2019mere.\u201d He tugged her until she was practically in his lap. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve done something wrong. So I\u2019ll do anything to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m open to suggestions.\u201d</p><p>India swung her leg over his until they were matched groin-to-groin and chest-to-chest. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s mess around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. Then she kissed him. Her hands clutching his hair, her crotch grinding on his, her nipples rubbing with enough friction he swore her piercings scratched his chest through their clothing.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten used to being the aggressor, so her dogged seduction was incredibly potent. Each teasing, tantalizing kiss destroyed his resolve to maintain a cool head, especially when the head in his Wranglers burned hot as a branding iron.</p><p>India\u2019s lips followed the slope of his jaw to his ear. \u201cSo strong.</p><p>So smooth. Did you shave just for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. You smell good too.\u201d She nuzzled his neck. \u201cYou know my favorite thing about you wearing aftershave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnticipating how it\u2019ll smell on my skin. After you\u2019ve rubbed your face and mouth all over my chest. And my neck.\u201d</p><p>His cock twitched. Her little chuckle meant she knew it. Felt it.</p><p>Sassy wench.</p><p>\u201cUnbutton my blouse, Colt.\u201d</p><p>Good thing he was dexterous. All her rubbing and nuzzling could\u2019ve distracted a lesser man.</p><p>Once her shirt was undone, she leaned back until her spine met the steering wheel. \u201cIf I ask nice, will you put your mouth on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want, Indy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. God yes. Ever since that morning you sucked my nipples, I\u2019ve been dying to feel your lips and tongue on them again.\u201d</p><p>Colt growled. He yanked the shirt open and jerked it down, immobilizing her arms.</p><p>Her complaint of, \u201cHey!\u201d was lost the second his mouth enclosed the bared tip.</p><p>Her skin was so warm and silky under his callused hands.</p><p>While he suckled the right nipple, the fingertips of his left hand stroked the underswell of her left breast. He\u2019d always been a fan of big tits, but this handful of perfection was more than enough to satisfy him.</p><p>He slowly freed her nipple, tugging on the ring with his teeth, and watching her shadowed face to gauge her reaction.</p><p>\u201cColt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, my aftershave does smell good on you.\u201d Colt rubbed his cheek and jaw across her chest, and used his chin to separate her cleavage, kissing the inside of each breast. \u201cKinda makes me wonder where else it\u2019d smell good.\u201d He rained kisses, brushing his smoothly-shaven cheek over her arched neck. \u201cMmm.</p><p>Here\u2019s another good spot.\u201d</p><p>India groaned. A shiver rippled through her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bettin\u2019 the best place is that tender spot right between your thighs. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re welcome to test it out.\u201d</p><p>He trilled his lips to her left nipple. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t shaved. I\u2019d like you to feel my whiskers on your delicate skin as I\u2019m markin\u2019 you with my scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s tongue toyed with the nipple ring. He licked circles around her areola just to watch it pucker into a tight point. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get off with you. Like this, fully clothed. With your mouth sucking my nipples as I\u2019m rocking on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be the second time you\u2019ve made me come in my pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen next time you can come in my hand. Or in my mouth. Or in my pussy. But damn you, Colt, I\u2019m so wet and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He slammed his lips to hers to shut her up. Jesus. If she continued that tempting talk he\u2019d come without her touching any part of his body. Keeping hold of her shoulders, he angled his pelvis so all their good parts rubbed together.</p><p>She arched in complete abandon. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want my mouth? Here?\u201d Colt scraped his teeth down her neck. \u201cOr here?\u201d He latched onto her right nipple. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere. Oh. Damn. Can I move my hips faster without smashing your cock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove as fast as you want. The faster, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d</p> <p>The air in the cab seemed to increase by a thousand degrees.</p><p>Heavy breathing distorted the stillness and steamed up the windows.</p><p>Perspiration coated her skin as he feasted on her. When he felt her thighs tighten, and heard her soft gasp, he bit down on the captive nipple.</p><p>India came in a bucking, noisy explosion of heat and sound that sent Colt straight over the edge.</p><p>It\u2019d taken him longer than a minute, but not by much.</p> <p>She slumped forward, burying her face in his neck. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to drive home in those sticky jeans, you\u2019re welcome to come in and take them off.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cGenerous of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>Colt pulled her sleeves back up, freeing her arms. He fed her a long, deep, wet kiss while he buttoned her shirt.</p><p>Looking as dazed as he was, he traced the outline of her bottom lip, while he stared into her eyes. When her saucy tongue darted out to lick the callused pad, his hand fell away.</p><p>She smirked.</p> <p>\u201cI know that look. You still think you can convince me to give in to your hot sexy body before the two weeks is up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an optimist.\u201d She bestowed a smacking kiss square on his mouth. \u201cSee you tomorrow night at the basketball game.\u201d</p><p>India arrived at the high school parking lot to find it jam-packed. Inside, she saw Bert pointing to the empty space beside him in the front row of the bleachers.</p><p>\u201cThanks for saving me a spot,\u201d she said, squeezing the gnarled hand resting on his cane. \u201cI had a late client. It hasn\u2019t started, has it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>India scanned the teams on opposite sides of the court. Her gaze zeroed in on the tall, dark-haired man, wearing an electric blue tank top and shorts. Talk about muscular legs. And arms. And chest.</p><p>How much weight had he been lifting with Cam?</p><p>Colt sensed her gawking at him. He trotted over, the warmth in his eyes made her tingly all over. \u201cGlad you made it.\u201d</p> <p>Concentrate on his eyes and not his nearly nude body.</p><p>He grinned as if he\u2019d read her thoughts.</p><p>The whistle blew and he scrambled toward his teammates.</p><p>India muttered, \u201cI am in way over my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is too, if it\u2019s any consolation.\u201d</p><p>She faced Bert. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Bert clutched her hand on his cane. \u201cI like you, India. That\u2019s why I sent Colt to you in the first place. He wouldn\u2019t open up to me the way he has with you. You were good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, let\u2019s get this event started!\u201d</p><p>India half-listened to the opening remarks of the MC. After a precocious nine-year old girl warbled \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d</p><p>they sat down. She tried to watch the action unfold, but ignoring Bert\u2019s curious stare proved impossible. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs awkward as this might be, I\u2019m recommending you terminate your role as Colt\u2019s sponsor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear me out before your wicked glare singes what little hair I have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know you\u2019re doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was my idea after he called and told me you two were dating.\u201d</p><p>So Colt had listened to her concerns last night.</p><p>Why are you surprised? Colt always listens to you.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re important to the program, India. But you\u2019re also important to him.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be easier all around. You\u2019ve been so busy taking care of others I\u2019m worried you\u2019re not taking care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Bert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all said that, India. We\u2019ve all been there, thinking we\u2019re \u2018cured\u2019 and trying to hide the difficulties from our peers. No one ever is cured. You remember that. And if it gets to the point you need help...my door and my ears are always open to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Bert slammed his cane into the floor and pointed. \u201cHey! Will you look at that? Number thirty-six fouled him!\u201d</p><p>She shifted her attention to the court.</p><p>The match was a charity event and the men were supposed to be playing for fun, but the taunts and cheap shots screamed the aggressive nature of the game. Colt was out there in the thick of it, sweating, grappling for the ball. His competitive streak had him jabbing his elbow in his opponent\u2019s ribs whenever the ref wasn\u2019t watching.</p><p>During a lull in the game, India studied the local people filling the bleachers. Kids munched popcorn and sipped soft drinks from red wax cups. Mothers bounced babies, holding conversations with other mothers who did the same. Men, young and old, shouted approval or dismay at the official\u2019s calls while teenagers ducked under the risers to steal a kiss away from prying parental eyes.</p><p>Odd, she didn\u2019t see any of Colt\u2019s family members in the stands.</p><p>Why weren\u2019t they here rooting for him?</p><p>The third quarter ended. A pregnant woman waddled toward one of Colt\u2019s teammates. The man\u2019s face clouded with concern as he stroked her distended belly. Then he brushed her curls from her face and watched her holding the small of her back as she disappeared out the side door.</p><p>What would it be like to have a man look at her as if she hung the moon and stars? To have her belly round with his child? A burst of intense longing filled her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Dr. Brewer and his wife, Susie,\u201d Bert commented.</p><p>\u201cNice couple. They just moved back to Wyoming last year. He\u2019s a veterinarian and she teaches at the reservation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know everything about everyone in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but Jay\u2014Dr. Brewer\u2014and Colt have been friends and rivals since high school. Why they haven\u2019t killed each other is a mystery, because they both play rough and don\u2019t know the meaning of the word quit.\u201d</p><p>Like Bert needed to warn her about Colt\u2019s tenacity.</p><p>The buzzer sounded and the teams took the floor for the last quarter. India automatically zeroed in on Colt.</p><p>God, he epitomized the perfect male animal, all sweaty, scowling and masculine.</p><p>It was a five-point ballgame. The level of aggression on the court increased. One player from the opposing team fouled out and a scuffle erupted.</p><p>With seven minutes left to play, the score tied, and the other team in control of the ball, Colt leapt into the air to block a pass.</p><p>The next thing happened in some kind of sick, slow motion.</p><p>An airborne Colt, still clutching the stolen ball, lost his footing and sailed toward the announcer\u2019s stand. The back of his head clipped the corner of the long metal table and he slammed into the floor. He lay motionless as the entire gymnasium watched in horror.</p><p>The ball slowly rolled to the center of the floor. The referees blew the whistle, the time remaining on the scoreboard stopped ticking.</p><p>The crowd grew quiet.</p><p>Officials, teammates, and opposing players surrounded Colt.</p><p>The only thing visible from their seats were the soles of his tennis shoes.</p><p>\u201cWhy is Colt still lying on the floor?\u201d Bert demanded, his concern echoing hers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She hopped up on her chair for a better view.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><p>The man Bert pointed out as Jay Brewer trotted away from the team\u2019s chairs and disappeared back inside the circle of people.</p><p>She waited several agonizing seconds before scrambling down from the chair. \u201cI\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on.\u201d India sidled between two very sweaty, tall men and one shorter, bald man in a shiny suit. She peered around a referee and watched Dr. Brewer shine a penlight into Colt\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Colt murmured something and shook his head.</p><p>That\u2019s when India noticed the red spots dotting the white linoleum. Her vision grayed and she bumped into the official standing in front of her.</p><p>\u201cHey! Who are you? You shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed her panic, ignoring the red smears beneath Colt\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m his, umm...girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Brewer glanced up at her admission and motioned her over.</p><p>India dropped to her knees. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppears to be, but he won\u2019t let me call an ambulance. He\u2019s worried Cam will freak out when he hears the call go through dispatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake the call. Obviously he isn\u2019t thinking clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe,\u201d Colt ground out from his prone position on the floor, \u201cis perfectly capable of makin\u2019 his own decisions. And I\u2019m not goin\u2019 to any damn hospital.\u201d His eyes opened. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I just need about three hundred aspirin and a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the blood? How bad is Mr. Tough Guy bleeding?\u201d</p><p>Colt grimaced, squeezing his eyes shut again. \u201cWhat blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, what blood?\u201d Dr. Brewer echoed.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d She pointed to the red splotches on the floor. \u201cThat blood.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Brewer peered over the top of Colt\u2019s head. \u201cThat\u2019s not blood.\u201d</p><p>The bald man crouched down and admitted sheepishly, \u201cThat\u2019s my blackcherry Icee. He knocked it over when he hit the table.\u201d</p><p>India chose to feel relieved instead of stupid.</p><p>\u201cMcKay, sit up so I can see how bad it is. I\u2019d be surprised anyone with a head as hard as yours can bleed at all.\u201d</p><p>One of Colt\u2019s teammates assisted the doctor in getting Colt upright. \u201cIn my opinion, he needs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re my veterinarian and not my doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sort of are acting like a jackass.\u201d</p><p>The crowd around them snickered.</p><p>\u201cJust help me up.\u201d Colt struggled to his feet.</p><p>Two teammates supported him and the crowd cheered at Colt\u2019s apparent recovery. He paused outside the locker room door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The pain in his eyes nearly had her carrying him to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming in there to make sure you don\u2019t pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you this is the men\u2019s locker room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>His breath tickled her ear and his voice dropped to a growl.</p><p>\u201cSo, the first time you see me completely naked, ain\u2019t gonna be in front of a bunch of other guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later, after the game ended and the crowd disappeared, India paced until Dr. Brewer ambled out. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as I initially believed, but he insists he\u2019ll be better off with you than at the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Brewer measured her thoughtfully. \u201cAre you up for taking care of him tonight? Because he\u2019s as grouchy as a grizzly with a sore paw. And we both know he won\u2019t take pain meds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I get elected as bear bait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Colt. He said that you...\u201d Dr. Brewer looked around and lowered his voice. \u201cYou already played Nurse Ratchet when you shot him in the butt with a nail gun and you owe him big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that? Haul him to the morgue. He\u2019ll need funeral arrangements, not medical care when I get finished with him.\u201d</p> <p>The doctor chuckled and rummaged in his coat pocket for a sheet of paper. \u201cMy home phone number is at the top. Call me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife doesn\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife is used to it, although human patients are a novelty.</p><p>This late in her pregnancy she can\u2019t sleep. Which means I don\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A freshly showered, but very slow moving Colt exited the locker room. He managed a half-smile before he sagged against the brick wall. \u201cDid Jay talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be in the hospital, not having me play nursemaid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll just go home alone and sleep it off. Ain\u2019t like it\u2019d be the first time.\u201d</p> <p>Guilt kicked in. \u201cColt. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes opened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just worried and I\u2019m not qualified\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter if you\u2019re qualified, I just want you with me.\u201d He winced.</p><p>\u201cStay put. I\u2019ll get my car.\u201d India turned around as the side door slammed.</p><p>Cam strode toward them, an imposing figure in his khaki uniform. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>India froze. Even Colt snapped to at Cam\u2019s commanding tone.</p><p>\u201cI lost my footing in the game and smacked into the table. No big deal, besides I\u2019ve got a helluva headache.\u201d</p><p>When Cam moved, India noticed Domini was right behind him.</p><p>\u201cI heard about it on the scanner.\u201d Cam gave Colt a head to toe inspection. \u201cYou refused to go to the hospital. Big surprise.</p><p>Although, I\u2019m startin\u2019 to think maybe you\u2019re not the best thing for him, India. Every time I\u2019ve seen you two together in the last two weeks, he ends up injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Colt snapped. \u201cIt has nothin\u2019 to do with her.\u201d</p><p>Cam put up his hands in mock surrender. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be. Why are you here anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to India.\u201d Cam motioned Domini closer. \u201cI wondered if she could stay with you tonight. That asshole ex-husband of Nadia\u2019s keeps calling to find out where she and Anton have gone. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll show up at some point and I don\u2019t want her stayin\u2019 alone.\u201d</p><p>India looked at Domini. Tear tracks lined her face. She\u2019d wrapped her arms around her stomach, but it didn\u2019t keep her body from shaking, even in Cam\u2019s enormous jacket. The poor woman was seriously freaked out and India didn\u2019t blame her. Nadia\u2019s ex was a bad guy. \u201cSure you can stay at my place. I\u2019ll get you set up before I leave\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Leave? Where you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Colt\u2019s house. I\u2019m keeping an eye on him tonight. Dr.</p><p>Brewer\u2019s instructions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. If she is stayin\u2019 in your apartment, I want you there with her. I don\u2019t want her to be alone anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why doesn\u2019t she stay with you?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Domini dropped her chin to her chest and studied her feet.</p><p>Come on Cam, here\u2019s your chance, take it and run. Domini would rather be with you, not me. Why can\u2019t you see that?</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s gotta work at the crack of dawn and your apartment is right above the restaurant, so that makes the most sense.\u201d Cam sighed. \u201cLook. I\u2019m about to get off shift. I\u2019ll take Colt home with me and keep an eye on him if you watch out for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer? She?\u201d Domini said. \u201cI have a name, Deputy McKay and if you insist on treating me like a child\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cam whispered something directly in her ear that shut her up.</p><p>\u201cColt? You okay staying with Cam?\u201d</p><p>He looked at India and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll be lousy company. It\u2019s just as well Cam has to deal with me rather than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s settled.\u201d Cam shifted his stance. \u201cMiz Katzinski, would it be all right if I had a word with you? In private?\u201d</p><p>Domini stomped away and Cam followed.</p><p>India stepped in front of Colt and placed her head on his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be good as new if I get some rest.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his chin. And his jaw. \u201cProbably a good thing I won\u2019t be taking care of you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you always interrupt my sleep a billion times and then pick a fight with me so I\u2019ll kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019d\u2019ve tucked myself right in with you and there wouldn\u2019t have been a damn thing you could\u2019ve done about it because it would\u2019ve been on doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are ornery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a little mean. Okay, a lot mean.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cRemind me not to piss you off.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Stupid Colt McKay should\u2019ve taken his own advice about not pissing her off, India thought for the millionth time as she slammed a box of essential oil in the middle of the showroom floor.</p><p>She and Skylar spent Saturday afternoon at Sky Blue doing quarterly inventory and India was glad for the busy work. It kept her mind off Colt.</p><p>That dickhead.</p><p>They\u2019d had another fight. A doozy of a fight. A throwing-things-get-the-hell-out-I-don\u2019t-want-to-see-you-until-I-cool-down kind of fight.</p><p>Naturally, her sister brought up the elephant in the room when the last box of lotion had been tallied. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re acting unreasonable?\u201d</p><p>India slammed the cupboard door. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been two days.\u201d</p><p>Two very long days. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>Sky gestured to the enormous bouquet lined up on the counter.</p><p>\u201cObviously Colt is sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you being hard on him?\u201d</p><p>She whirled around. \u201cWhat would you have done, if Kade had stormed into the factory, chewed you out for...something someone else had supposedly seen you do? Ripped you a new one in front of a customer? And then literally dragged you off to\u2014\u201d Kiss you until you couldn\u2019t breathe, touch you so thoroughly you had to check your skin for branding iron marks. Turned you so dizzy with want and anger and fear you couldn\u2019t choose which feeling made you craziest so you acted out on all three? At the same time?</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d Sky prompted.</p><p>\u201cTo make your head explode. The man is infuriating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is infuriating? That he wanted to talk to you because he was worried about your risky behavior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt didn\u2019t talk; he yelled. And isn\u2019t there some legal confidentiality clause that Deputy Cam can\u2019t call him up and tattle that he thought I was driving my motorcycle too fast?\u201d</p><p>Skylar wagged her finger in India\u2019s face. \u201cTough. You drive that deathtrap like Wyoming is the autobahn. I\u2019ve been telling you that for years. And I wish Cam would\u2019ve chased you down and given you a ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re siding with him? With both of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Cam only told Colt because he knew it\u2019d be better coming from him than from someone else in this gossipy town. And Colt confronting you on your dangerous activity is not surprising because he cares about you, Indy. He really, really cares about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Then how do you justify Mr. Caring barging in here and going all caveman on me, practically dragging me away by my hair, in front of a client?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple.\u201d Skylar smirked. \u201cHe\u2019s a McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not even close to funny, Sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be. Chest thumping is part of Colt\u2019s genetic makeup and if you\u2019re going to be with him for the long haul, you\u2019d better get used to it. Besides, wasn\u2019t the client just Colt\u2019s cousin, Blake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I doubt Colt would\u2019ve acted so agitated if it\u2019d been a stranger in your tattoo station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not the point! He acted totally inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t exactly blameless, India. You reacted just as inappropriately.\u201d Skylar rolled her eyes. \u201cHonestly. Did you have to throw a wrench at him?\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s cheeks went hot with shame. \u201cHow\u2019d you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt told Kade. Kade is now blaming Eliza\u2019s tendency to throw things on my side of the family. A wrench for godsake.</p><p>Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the closest thing I could find.\u201d And the tool belonged to Blake, so it\u2019d seemed like karma at the time. Now it just seemed stupid, dangerous and childish. She sagged into a chair. \u201cGod. This is so screwed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really going on? You have a nasty temper, but this knee-jerk \u2018anger and retreat\u2019 reaction is so unlike you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, Sky. I don\u2019t want to fuck this up. And I\u2019m afraid I already have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChannel that anger into a more productive activity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Skylar slipped on her coat. \u201cDo I really have to spell it out for you? Go out to his place, accept his apology, apologize yourself, and fuck his brains out until Monday morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich would be a brilliant idea, except Colt and I aren\u2019t having sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Crap. \u201cWe\u2019re dating, not sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>Sky started laughing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>Her sister had to grip the counter she laughed so hard.</p> <p>\u201cI fail to see the humor in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve managed to hold Colt off for almost two weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. He\u2019s held me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s even better.\u201d Skylar wiped her eyes. \u201cI figured you guys would last about two days with the no sex rule.\u201d</p><p>India sniffed. \u201cWe aren\u2019t animals. We can control our baser instincts.\u201d Maybe. Kinda. Sorta. Not really. Okay, it was a fucking miracle they weren\u2019t balling each other\u2019s brains out at every opportunity. They definitely weren\u2019t lacking in the passion and chemistry department.</p><p>Skylar looked thoughtful. \u201cDo you want to make the leap from friends to lovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe. We\u2019re good at the friendship part.</p><p>Actually, we\u2019re great at it. Colt is my best friend. He\u2019s been my best friend since six months after I met him. I trust him like no one else, I really like him, I can tell him anything and we have fun together.</p> <p>He makes me laugh. He gets me. He doesn\u2019t judge me. We have so much history...if we fuck this up, we lose so much more than I can even fathom. It\u2019s sort of paralyzing me, to tell you the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t fuck it up. You\u2019ve got the friendship part down solid.</p><p>Now it\u2019s time to concentrate on the lover\u2019s part. And in my experience the sex part is way easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so.\u201d Skylar grabbed India\u2019s hands and pulled her to her feet. \u201cMake the jump by jumping him. Do it now before you chicken out.\u201d</p><p>India gave Skylar a quick hug. \u201cThanks, Sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owed you one for giving me a kick in the ass about Kade a few years ago.\u201d As India reached the back door, Skylar yelled, \u201cBut for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t forget condoms.\u201d</p><p>The universe fucking hated him.</p><p>At least it seemed as if the universe was conspiring to keep him from indulging in the most amazing sex in the history of the universe with the sexiest woman on the planet.</p><p>It was Saturday night. Two weeks had passed since he and India started dating. Technically, tonight could be the night.</p><p>So why wasn\u2019t his lover here in his arms, basking in the afterglow of smoking hot sex?</p><p>Because she was mad as a wet cat.</p><p>All due to a misunderstanding.</p><p>All due to you being a total dickhead.</p><p>Okay. Maybe he had acted like a dick, threatening to take her keys if he ever heard she\u2019d ridden her motorcycle like a bat out of hell again.</p><p>Granted, he probably shouldn\u2019t have brought it up while she\u2019d been at work. But that was the root of Colt\u2019s other problem: India had been working on Blake West. Namely, Blake\u2019s chest.</p><p>So maybe he\u2019d gone a little psycho when he\u2019d seen his shirtless cousin stretched out in the tattoo shop, with India bent over his naked torso, laughing. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have dragged her away and laid a tonsil-scratching kiss on her. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have demanded they end their two-week abstinence right then and there, with Blake in the other room.</p><p>Big mistake steering her in the backroom, where she had easy access to tools. Heavy tools. She\u2019d thrown a wrench at his head, for Christsake.</p><p>Then she\u2019d thrown him out of her tattoo studio.</p><p>He\u2019d done everything right. Romanced her. He\u2019d taken her out for dinner\u2014sure, Dewey\u2019s wasn\u2019t on par with The Four Seasons.</p><p>He whisked her to a show\u2014sure, the movie theater in Wheatland wasn\u2019t a Broadway play. He\u2019d taken her bowling. And to a rodeo.</p><p>He\u2019d toed the line of just kissing her.</p><p>Mostly. The hot incident in the truck notwithstanding.</p><p>His showing off at the basketball game hadn\u2019t turned out so well, yet...it\u2019d given him a glimpse of India\u2019s caring side. A side she showed to her sister, Kade, her nieces, and to Domini, but rarely to him.</p><p>Wrong. She showed it to you after she shot you in the ass with the nail gun.</p><p>Well, she should have.</p><p>What about all those times over the last few years when she arrived on your doorstep with chicken noodle soup, tissues and Vicks VapoRub? Or with movies? Or with \u201ca little something\u201d for your house? Or when she\u2019s dropped everything to help you, even when you didn\u2019t ask? Or how she just always knows when you need her around?</p><p>India showed him her thoughtfulness every time they were together. The fact she showed him her bitchy, violent side, made him feel...special, because she trusted him enough not to hide it.</p><p>Enough stewing. Enough supposing. Buck up and act like a man. In other words...grovel.</p><p>He dug out his cell phone and called her.</p><p>She answered on the first ring. \u201cI was just about to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me say my piece first and then you\u2019ll get your chance.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>And then Colt couldn\u2019t think of a damn thing to say. Dammit.</p><p>He used to be considered charming. What\u2019d happened to his silver tongue? Or had he been delusional and the booze was responsible for his sweet-talking ability?</p><p>\u201cColt? I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I acted like a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve better from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was an asshole, especially in front of Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your hands on him and I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I could think about was I wanted your hands on me like that. I wanted to make it crystal fuckin\u2019 clear to him that you\u2019d never ever put your hands on him like that in private. Never.</p><p>Because that privilege was all mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tattoo people for a living, Colt. I\u2019m going to have my hands on a lot of men. On some interesting places on men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve bothered me if it\u2019d been anyone besides him.\u201d</p><p>India sighed. \u201cWell, your message to your cousin couldn\u2019t have been clearer. I half expected you to whip out your dick and pee on me as you snarled at him and marked your territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Colt winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Really sorry, India. You have to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are. And as long as we\u2019re apologizing, I\u2019m sorry I threw the wrench at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Eliza didn\u2019t get her rock throwing abilities from you, as I would\u2019ve had another head injury to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently I\u2019m a lot more hard-headed than I realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, you sound so surprised by that statement, McKay.\u201d</p><p>A slight pause. \u201cHow\u2019s your ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expectin\u2019 me to say I\u2019m a dumbass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a smartass. Or you behaved like a jackass...take your pick.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you like crazy the last forty-nine hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve kept track of how long it\u2019s been since you\u2019ve seen me?\u201d</p><p>I always do. \u201cUh. Yeah. Does that make me a pathetic loser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s very sweet, in a stalkerish sort of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you really missed me?\u201d</p><p>Colt rested his hot forehead against the cool glass of the sliding glass door. \u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a funny way of showing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean fighting with you in public? Or groping you in public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hopin\u2019 you preferred one way over the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna tell me which one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She let loose a husky laugh. \u201cBut I might be convinced to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you were here.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>\u201cHang on, someone\u2019s at the door.\u201d By the time he reached the foyer, he prayed his suspicion was right.</p><p>India stood on his steps. \u201cI was on my way over to check on you before you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I might\u2019ve scared you away for good. I wanted to make sure you were all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right as in...you wanted to check if I\u2019d swung by the package liquor store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not here as your sponsor.\u201d She frowned. \u201cEspecially since I\u2019m no longer your sponsor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>India locked her eyes to his. \u201cBecause I missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d The moment of truth. Of intent. His heart raced. His body went on full alert.</p><p>\u201cAnd you do realize our two weeks of strictly dating are up, right?\u201d</p><p>Colt decided doing a victory lap would be a little over the top.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>He set his phone on the library table. \u201cAs long as you understand the instant you cross that threshold, India Ellison, I\u2019m gonna be all over you.\u201d</p><p>Giving him a cocky grin, she stepped into the foyer.</p><p>He had India in his arms before her other foot met the tile. His mouth was on hers as he carried her into the living room.</p><p>Between frantic kisses, he whispered, \u201cI need\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know, Colt, me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo foreplay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She kissed him. \u201cGood.\u201d She kissed him again.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. We\u2019ve had two weeks worth of foreplay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, woman, we\u2019ve had three fuckin\u2019 years of foreplay,\u201d he growled. \u201cIn my bed. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No more waiting.\u201d India trapped his face in her hands.</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere? Against the wall? On the couch? Over the chair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the white rug. Move the coffee table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d He set her down and dragged the iron and glass table out of the way as if it weighed nothing. Then he reached for her again.</p><p>The kiss was explosive. She tasted of mint and coffee. She fought him for control, her tongue dueling, then coy and teasing.</p><p>Colt could kiss her for days. And he would, right after he fucked her. At least twice. \u201cI wanna see you. All of you. Clothes off.\u201d</p><p>India whipped her shirt over her head. Unhooked her satin bra and tossed it aside.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cThose pierced nipples are about the sexiest things I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, you ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet.\u201d She peeled the black denim down her legs and kicked it by the couch. A funny smile twitched the corners of her lips. Wearing just a teeny pair of dark blue panties, she raised her arms above her head, performing a whole body shimmy.</p><p>When she spun around, his mouth watered. The fact India wore a thong didn\u2019t surprise him. The sun and moon tattoos, one inked on each of her perfectly round ass cheeks\u2014now those surprised him.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, I cannot wait to trace those designs with my tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome closer. I want you to take my thong off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d Colt dropped to his knees and hooked his fingers into the elastic running across her hips. He paused to kiss the jewel dangling from her belly button. Keeping his hungry gaze on hers, he slid the thong until it reached the tops of her feet. He allowed his eyes to gorge on her as they descend the length of her body, taking in the beautifully long sweep of her neck, her delicate collarbones, the gentle swell of her chest. Her compact ribcage, the muscles of her torso and the body jewelry winking at him from the sexy indent of her navel.</p><p>His gaze moved to the rise of her mound. Her completely hairless mound. He grinned. \u201cSugar, I should\u2019ve guessed you\u2019d be a Brazilian kind of gal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou approve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Colt placed his mouth on the top of her pubis and brushed his lips back and forth across the bare skin. So soft.</p> <p>Closing his eyes, he let his tongue follow the sweet cleft leading straight to paradise. At least, he\u2019d intended to, but his tongue ran into a barrier. A metal barrier. He opened his eyes.</p><p>Holy shit. A thin bar stretched above her clitoris, piercing the skin above it.</p><p>\u201cSurprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus. And I thought the nipple rings were sexy.\u201d He closed his mouth over the piercing and her clit and sucked. Once.</p><p>Twice. Three times. He groaned at the sweet, musky, slightly metallic taste and the way her hands tightened in his hair.</p><p>\u201cColt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna spend hours with my mouth between your legs.</p><p>Sucking. Licking. Biting. Makin\u2019 you come all over my face, drivin\u2019 you to the point you won\u2019t even know your own damn name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. Yes.\u201d</p><p>He gave her one last lingering suck before he pushed to his feet. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>India locked her eyes to his.</p><p>With one hand he pulled at the edge of his shirt until the snaps popped. \u201cTouch yourself as you\u2019re watchin\u2019 me get undressed. But don\u2019t come. There\u2019ll be hell to pay if you come before I\u2019m inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Umm. Are you always this...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemanding when it comes to sex?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cMore than this. Is that gonna be an issue for you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Her eyes roamed over his chest. His abs.</p><p>His arms. Back to his pecs.</p><p>\u201cIndy,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cAre you supposed to be doin\u2019 something for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze finally made it to his face. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019ve seen you with your shirt off, Colt. But it\u2019s like this is the first time I\u2019m really seeing you. You\u2019re amazing. All golden skin and delineated musculature. I want to run my hands all over your chest and belly. I want to trace every muscle and vein with my tongue until your skin is shiny wet with my saliva. I want to suck on your nipples. And while I\u2019m sucking on them, I\u2019ll imagine how it\u2019d be to tattoo such perfect skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Colt unbuckled his belt, wincing at how hard his cock was. \u201cGet to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI totally forgot what I was supposed to be doing.\u201d</p><p>He smiled wickedly. \u201cTouchin\u2019 yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed a little direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it when you say please. I\u2019d like it even better if I heard you beg. Put your finger in your mouth. That\u2019s it. Now get it nice and wet.\u201d While watching her, he unzipped his jeans. \u201cPut it on your clit. Show me how you get yourself off when you\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>India moaned softly as she rubbed the skin beneath the piercing.</p><p>\u201cDo you pinch your nipples?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. \u201cNot until I see your cock.\u201d</p><p>Colt raised his eyebrows at her demand.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He gave her his back as he removed his jeans. Before he could turn around, her hot, naked flesh pressed to his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll finger myself to orgasm and let you watch another time, but right now... I want you so bad.\u201d She brushed openmouthed kisses across the center of his spine. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>No way could he deny her or himself another second. \u201cI\u2019ll grab a condom and be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought a box on the way over. They\u2019re in my purse.\u201d</p><p>His cock twitched so hard it slapped his belly. \u201cGet one. Now.\u201d</p><p>The sound of cardboard ripping. Plastic crinkling. Then India stood in front of him holding a purple square. \u201cCan I put it on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Colt snatched it out of her hand, ripped the package open. While he sheathed himself, he lowered his head and kissed her. He hadn\u2019t meant for the kiss to be lazy and languorous, but it was. Sweet and perfect. \u201cIndy. I need to fuck you before I lose my ever lovin\u2019 mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They fell to the rug in a tangle of arms and legs. He rose above her, his cock poised at her entrance, his gaze holding steady, his breathing ragged, fear and anticipation warred inside him.</p><p>\u201cColt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Where I\u2019ve wanted to be for too damn long.\u201d</p><p>Pinning her wrists above her head, his gentleness vanished. He snapped his hips, slamming home with one deep thrust.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. If he came at the touch of her hand, what were the chances he\u2019s last beyond three or four more strokes as her pussy sucked at his cock like a hungry mouth?</p><p>None. Zero. Zilch. Nada.</p><p>Colt rubbed his mouth over her ear, letting the studs and piercings catch on the inside of his lower lip. \u201cThis is gonna be short and sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. Because I\u2019m already close. Been a long time for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as long as you.\u201d She slapped his butt. \u201cMove your fine ass, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>A snarl escaped as he pulled out and thrust in. seven, eight, nine times. \u201cTighter. Squeeze me tighter. Like that. Oh fuck yeah, exactly like that.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s nipple rings rasped over Colt\u2019s chest as their upper bodies thrust and retreat. Tingles broke out across his skin. When that zippy feeling burned down his spine, and electrified his balls, he knew he\u2019d reached the end.</p><p>Colt threw his head back, groaning, letting the sensations overtake him. Hot pulses. Pounding blood. That rush of endorphins.</p><p>Three years. Three excruciatingly long, lonely years he\u2019d gone without this feeling of euphoria. Of connectedness.</p><p>He didn\u2019t remember sex ever being this astoundingly good.</p><p>A sexy moan escaped from India and Colt raised his head to watch pleasure wash over her. After her soft, sated sigh, Colt kissed her. He rested his forehead to hers.</p><p>\u201cWas it worth the wait?\u201d</p><p>Yes, it was perfect. But he couldn\u2019t seem to find his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t one of those narcoleptic guys who immediately start snoring afterward, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would you\u2014\u201d He hid his face in her neck and pretended to snore. Loudly. Great big gulps of air that vibrated against her throat with each exhalation.</p><p>India giggled and squirmed. \u201cHey, stop. That tickles.\u201d</p><p>God. He loved the sound of her girlish giggles. \u201cI\u2019ll stop on one condition. Spend the night with me. All night. In my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tie you to the headboard and keep you here as my sex slave for as long as I want anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Is this where you remind me you\u2019re wicked good with ropes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t insult me by limiting it to ropes. I\u2019m wicked good with anything that can be hooked, tied or fastened together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess you leave me with no choice.\u201d</p><p>Colt raised his head to study her. \u201cI was kiddin\u2019. You don\u2019t have to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that the way it sounded. I\u2019m here because I want to be here. There\u2019s nowhere else I\u2019d rather be.\u201d She smoothed a section of hair from his forehead and he resisted purring like a contented cat. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t have any idea what we do now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither. I guess we\u2019ll have to wing it. I think we oughta move someplace more comfortable.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stretched. \u201cMmm. I\u2019ve always wondered what it\u2019d be like to lie on this rug naked. I thought it might be scratchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never would\u2019ve tried to stop you from testing that theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if next time you\u2019re on the bottom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeal.\u201d Colt smooched her forehead. \u201cLemme ditch this condom and I\u2019ll meet you in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>India picked up the box of condoms and headed down the hallway to Colt\u2019s room. She switched on the overhead light and cast a quick glance around. Earth tones prevailed. The walls were deep hunter green, the fabrics a mix of browns, tans and golds, the carpet a sandy beige.</p><p>The frame of the four-poster California king-sized bed was constructed from logs. Nightstands crafted out of the same honey-colored pine book-ended the enormous bed. A matching dresser spanned the far wall. A buffalo-skin leather chair and ottoman were set at a jaunty angle beside it. The door to the walk-in closet was closed, but the door to the master bathroom was ajar. She caught a glimpse of the oversized shower and the tile floor.</p><p>It was weird to think she\u2019d helped choose the furnishings for Colt\u2019s room, from the color palette to the bedding. And now she\u2019d be sliding around naked with him on those striped cotton sheets?</p> <p>Weird indeed.</p><p>His muffled footsteps stopped behind her. He was close enough his body heat burned her naked back, but he didn\u2019t touch her. \u201cWhat are you thinkin\u2019 about right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember when we went to Cheyenne and picked out the bedding. How you insisted on nothing too \u2018girlie\u2019. Heck, I Branded As Trouble</p><p>remember picking out the bed. Bouncing on the mattress and laughing, trying to freak out the salespeople by pretending we were having sex. I never imagined you and I would actually be...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you? Didn\u2019t you really? It never once crossed your mind that you\u2019d be in my bed?\u201d</p><p>India couldn\u2019t answer, mostly because she didn\u2019t know the right answer.</p> <p>Colt\u2019s lips landed on the nape of her neck. \u201cLemme show you all the things I thought about doin\u2019 to you in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Tingles raced down her spine.</p><p>He took her hand and tugged her behind him. He tossed the pillows to the floor and yanked back the coverlet. Facing her with a wicked grin, he patted the mattress. \u201cHop up. Get in the middle.\u201d</p><p>A bout of nerves hit her as she set the box of condoms up in the corner and lay flat.</p><p>Then Colt was hanging above her. Kissing her with fire and sweetness. \u201cIndy\u2014\u201d he said her name between kisses, \u201c\u2014put your arms straight out so I can see you. All of you.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>He nuzzled her neck, nipped at her jaw. \u201cTell me about your tattoos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll of them on the front.\u201d His callused finger traced the designs on her right arm, from the ball of her shoulder down to her wrist. \u201cWhy\u2019d you go with a sleeve on one arm and not the other?\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s mouth on her skin was beyond divine, but it was hell on her concentration. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t intentional. I wanted a cool snake curling up my arm, with the tail on my wrist and the head on my biceps. I had no idea my buddy GG planned to ink a flesh-colored snake until it was done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I knew the skin around it needed to be brightly colored with geometric shapes and abstract images so I designed those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sexy as hell.\u201d Colt bent his head and licked, from the tail of the snake up to the fangs.</p><p>\u201cOh. Wow. That\u2019s the first time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time what?\u201d</p><p>Any man has paid homage to my tats with his tongue. \u201cYou\u2019ve said anything about my tattoos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I love them. All of them. Especially the twisted barbed wire circling this biceps. It looks so real. The drops of blood on the tips of the barbs are a realistic touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you had me do one on you?\u201d She traced the thick black lines on Colt\u2019s biceps. His tat was a far better design than hers. She\u2019d killed herself drawing it, and spent extra time inking him, desperate for Colt to be proud to have it on his arm.</p><p>\u201cYep. If I had the guts, I\u2019d have you continue all the way down to my wrist so it looks like my arm is trapped in barbed wire.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s head started spinning. That would actually make a kick-ass tattoo.</p><p>\u201cAnd this one?\u201d He pressed his lips to the black scorpion tattoo on the upper swell of her left breast.</p><p>She refocused. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be funny to have a deadly insect crawling out of my bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this one?\u201d He traced the large blue starburst pattern surrounding her belly button.</p><p>\u201cI designed it when Skylar decided to leave the rat race in California and turn her hobby into a business.\u201d Her belly rippled when his thumb brushed over the design and the jewel dangling from her navel.</p><p>\u201cSeems odd that you\u2019d celebrate her success by inking yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was supposed to be for her, but she chickened out. I liked the design too much to let it go to waste. My friend Brett in Las Vegas did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother good decision.\u201d Colt lowered his head, allowing his hair to tease her skin before his mouth descended to lick the outline of the tattoo. Repeatedly. Thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cAny other questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now.\u201d He dragged his tongue down the center of her body. Slowly. \u201cGod, you\u2019re so soft.\u201d Colt nuzzled her mound. \u201cYou smell so good. I wanna bury my face here. Let your scent mark me.</p><p>Feel your sweet juices flowing down the back of my throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want, Colt, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her across the expanse of her body. Those blue eyes were dark with intent. \u201cOh, I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make me wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve been starvin\u2019 for a taste of you for too long. Spread your legs.\u201d He traced the metal bar with his tongue. \u201cDid it hurt to get pierced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost a bet.\u201d</p><p>Colt looked up. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Since I lose all the time I should probably give up betting, huh?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t mind when you lose to me, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I had it in for a while...I liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it too. A lot.\u201d Then he pulled the piercing and her clit into his mouth and sucked.</p><p>Her pelvis shot up.</p><p>He clamped his hands around her hips and held them down.</p><p>Again, no foreplay, no teasing, no fingers stroking the inside walls of her pussy, just a relentless rhythmic sucking.</p><p>\u201cYour mouth is so...God, do you know how to use your mouth.\u201d</p><p>A hum of approval vibrated up her core. He backed off and blew across her flesh, wet from his mouth and her own arousal.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me. I wanna feel you come.\u201d He refocused all that suctioning power on her clit.</p><p>That\u2019s all it took. The orgasm pulsed through her so fast she barely squeaked a sound as her sex throbbed beneath his dancing tongue.</p><p>Damn. Talk about quick.</p><p>After Colt released her tender flesh, he kissed the inside of her thigh. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d The crinkle of a condom wrapper forced her to open her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNow that we finished the speed round...\u201d</p><p>Heat stained her cheeks. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I am still the undisputed winner for the first time you put your hand on me at your apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry I touched you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either, to tell you the truth, since it finally brought us to this point.\u201d</p><p>Then Colt was on her, belly-to-belly, chest-to-chest, his shaft thick and hot on her sex, acting all predatory male. He shoved into her in one quick movement. \u201cSweet baby Jesus you feel so fine, Indy. So damn fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t so bad yourself, cowboy.\u201d Colt did some hip wiggle maneuver as he withdrew and plunged back in and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just surprised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I oughta slow down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d India let her hands flow over his arms, loving the flex of the hard, carved muscles. Loving the look of concern and awe on his handsome face. Damn, he was beautiful. She knew he wouldn\u2019t appreciate her saying so. It caused her to wonder what he saw when he looked at her. Like this. Naked, in body and soul. Face to face. As close as two people could possibly be.</p><p>\u201cSugar, you have the oddest look. Am I doin\u2019 something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s just...you\u2019re so...and being here with you like this...being turned on and happy and scared and not knowing if you feel the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same, do I ever.\u201d Colt kissed her. Soul-kissed her with such warmth, passion and precision her toes curled. He threaded his fingers through hers and stretched their joined hands above her by the headboard. In this position, it seemed as if their bodies were closer. His pelvis rocked, his cock tunneled in and out of her wet and welcoming sex, not in a fast movement. Languidly.</p><p>But no less potently. No less erotically.</p><p>His damp skin sliding across hers. Melting hot and lazy kisses.</p><p>Each grinding glide of his pelvis to hers built her higher. So close, if she could just... She hooked her feet on the outside of Colt\u2019s ankles, trying to free herself to grab his butt.</p><p>Colt squeezed her hands and pulled back to look at her.</p><p>\u201cSomething you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA handful of your ass would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Right now I\u2019m makin\u2019 love to you this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat way\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed the sensitive section of skin in front of her ear and she shivered. \u201cMy way. Maybe if you\u2019re a good girl, I\u2019ll let you pick the next way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cColt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery inch of you against every inch of me, India. Skin to skin. That\u2019s the way I\u2019ve always wanted to take you the first time in my bed. Come with me like this. I\u2019ll get you there if you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>His words, his intent, his smoldering kisses sent India spiraling into the unknown. She\u2019d always been in charge in the bedroom. Not a crop-wielding dominatrix, but she always felt her orgasms were her responsibility. How freeing would it be to pass that responsibility to him?</p><p>Like heaven.</p><p>When Colt stretched her arms higher and whispered, \u201cLet go,\u201d</p><p>She fell even as she soared. Her hips pumped and met his thrust for thrust. Her gasps cut through the sex-scented air, mixing with Colt\u2019s grunts of satisfaction as he let go right along with her.</p><p>This time when India tried to break his grip on her hands, he didn\u2019t protest. She touched him everywhere, running her palms down those fabulously sculpted muscular arms. Her fingertips danced across his broad chest, her thumbs strummed his nipples.</p><p>His answering hiss meant she\u2019d definitely spend more playtime there.</p><p>Colt lifted his face from where he\u2019d buried it in her neck.</p><p>India pecked him on the mouth. \u201cDing ding ding! I declare round three a tie.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Thank you. That was incredible. So now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already eyeballing round four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, since you said I get to pick the next way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe there\u2019s something else you oughta know about me.\u201d</p><p>Beyond you\u2019re spectacular in the sack?</p><p>If the man could wring three orgasms from her in less than three hours, when he hadn\u2019t practiced the fine art of lovemaking in the last three years, what would it be like when he did return to his former sexual glory?</p><p>Magnificent.</p><p>Her pussy clenched around his cock just thinking about the delicious ways he\u2019d prove his prowess.</p><p>\u201cDo that again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTighten around me.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, she did.</p><p>He hissed. \u201cThat feels good.\u201d</p><p>India kissed the sexy dent in his chin. \u201cMmm. You must\u2019ve forgotten how good sex is in your sexual sabbatical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s never felt like this. And I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s because I was wasted some of the other times.\u201d</p><p>Her heart leapt.</p><p>\u201cBut there is one thing I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Colt clasped both her wrists in one hand and pinned them above her head. \u201cI am in charge. I ain\u2019t the \u2018Would it be okay if I did this, honey?\u2019 kind of lover. I\u2019m demandin\u2019. Greedy. And I prefer a little kink.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d heard rumors of some of that kink, but Colt had never confirmed nor denied. \u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m gonna have your sweet little body every which way I\u2019ve fantasized about? Absolutely. That I\u2019m make you forget any other man who\u2019s ever touched you? Without apology. That I\u2019m gonna cause your body to sing and sigh and weep with pleasure?</p><p>Guaranteed. That I\u2019d ever hurt you? No. That I\u2019d ever share you?</p><p>Bring another lover into our bed? Hell no. Fuck no.\u201d His lips were a whisper away; his eyes flashed a dangerous glint. \u201cYou\u2019re only ever mine. My hands on you. My mouth on you. My cock in you.</p><p>Understood?\u201d</p><p>The annoyed feeling India expected never surfaced. This side of Colt wasn\u2019t as alarming as it was...arousing. The position of his body, the set of his mouth, the heat in his eyes all bespoke of his domination.</p><p>Since her relationship with Larry, she\u2019d avoided domineering men. Since she\u2019d been clean, she\u2019d avoided men from twelve-step programs. Since she\u2019d moved to Wyoming, she\u2019d avoided cowboys.</p><p>The irony that Colt was all three wasn\u2019t lost on her.</p><p>\u201cIndy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Just thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout how glad I am that you only wanna be with me. Just us, doing all the kinky things you\u2019ve been stockpiling in your years of sexual deprivation.\u201d</p><p>His slow, sure grin was a thing of beauty. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t know the half of it.\u201d Without releasing her hands, he destroyed her with a kiss so blistering hot she suspected her lips were smoking when he finally pulled back.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we do the normal date thing. Pop some popcorn. Put in a movie, neck on the couch and see where it takes us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly where it\u2019s gonna take us, Colt McKay.</p><p>Straight back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m hopin\u2019 for.\u201d</p><p>India settled on his couch, wearing his button-down shirt, looking unbelievably sexy, balancing the enormous popcorn bowl on her lap.</p><p>After Colt plopped beside her, he clicked start. He\u2019d cued up the movie, skipping the wawka wawka music and telling previews.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re we watching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA comedy.\u201d</p><p>India laid her head on his shoulder. Crunch crunch. \u201cThis is nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do this damn near every Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not like this. Snuggled close in the afterglow of amazingly perfect hot sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Quit hoggin\u2019 the popcorn. That\u2019s something else you always do. And crunch it as loud as humanly possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She laid a buttery, salty kiss on him and held the bowl closer.</p><p>The sex flick started as so many of them did. A hot woman, yakking on the phone to her friend about her lousy dating life. How she\u2019d love to get some action but her prospects were thin. The doorbell rings. She hangs up in such a hurry to answer the door that she forgets to put a robe on over her negligee. Standing on the other side of the door is a repairman.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recognize any of these actors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>India knew something was up when the repairman bent over to</p><p>\u201cfix\u201d the knob on the stove and the woman came up behind him, spinning him around to bump and grind on his tool.</p><p>\u201cColt, is this porn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Keep watchin\u2019. It gets better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe we\u2019re watching porn after we just had sex two times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree if you count oral.\u201d He tossed a couple kernels in the air and caught them in his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll bet we have sex again before the movie ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so literal, India. We don\u2019t have to bet on everything,\u201d he teased.</p><p>She faced him. \u201cNo, seriously. Put your money where your sexy mouth is, McKay. What\u2019s the bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne dollar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, not what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Miz Moneybags?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne kiss. One deep, slow, wet kiss.\u201d</p><p>Colt pretended to consider it. \u201cNo deal. When I win, I wanna nail you from behind while we\u2019re watching the scene where she\u2019s being fucked by three guys and one chick.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed interest. \u201cHow does that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Colt leaned over and licked the salt from her lips with a flirty kiss. \u201cI dare you not to get turned on by that scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna lose, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the beauty of bettin\u2019 against me, sugar. Neither of us really loses.\u201d</p><p>As the movie progressed, Colt knew India was getting turned on. She squirmed, even when her legs were primly pressed together.</p><p>She bit her lip. Her face was flushed. Her breathing choppy. But mostly he could tell because of the scent of the warm, sweet cream drifting up from between her thighs.</p><p>His dick tented his boxers but India was taking great pains not to notice.</p><p>Colt curled his hand around her knee. \u201cHere\u2019s the scene.\u201d</p><p>The main character returned home and found her best friend in bed with the repairman. She was livid. Her idea of punishment was having her friend lick her pussy while the repairman sucked her tits.</p><p>The camera shots consisted of the brunette going to town between the blonde\u2019s thighs, licking her slit over and over with long sweeps of her tongue. Or vigorously rubbing the blonde\u2019s clit with a sharp-tipped red nail as they both moaned in ecstasy.</p><p>Meanwhile the bad repairman was devoting all his attention to the woman\u2019s breasts. More sucking and tongue curls around the rigid tip as the woman writhed on the bed between them. She climaxed with gusto.</p><p>As she came down from her sexual high, the doorbell rang. Too tired to answer it, she dispatched her best friend to see who was at the door. The best friend came back to the bedroom with two new repairmen, who were sent to find out what happened to their male coworker. Their clothes flew, and they joined in the fun.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, Colt saw India was almost holding her breath.</p><p>Back on the screen, one of the new guys was spread out on the bed with at least twelve inches of thick cock sticking straight up.</p><p>The woman straddled him and impaled herself. Before she could arch back, the first repairman grabbed her hair, turning her head and shoving his dick into her mouth. She noisily sucked him off. The third man watched as her best friend licked a line up the woman\u2019s butt crack, from where her pussy was already stuffed with dick. She licked and tongue fucked that beige pucker until the man pushed her aside and rammed all ten inches of his cock into that tight asshole.</p><p>The woman went ballistic. Cock in her mouth, cock in her pussy, cock in her ass. She allowed the men to set the pace, but they all fucked her hard. When the moment of truth came, one at a time, they pulled out and sprayed her body with come. The blowjob guy came on her face. The ass fucker came on her butt crack. The pussy fucker blew all over her bouncing tits.</p><p>The best friend took that as her cue to jump back in the fray.</p><p>She rubbed in the come dotted across her friend\u2019s nipples. She licked the come off her friend\u2019s face. Then she shoved two fingers up her friend\u2019s pussy as she sucked her friend\u2019s tits and brought forth yet another orgasm from her horny friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colt hit pause. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>India shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate losing a bet.\u201d Then she attacked him. The popcorn bowl hit the floor. She bounced on his lap, kissing and biting and scratching like a wildcat.</p><p>He loved every fucking second of it.</p><p>\u201cHang on, lemme get this shirt off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry. Hurry, hurry, hurry.\u201d</p><p>Somehow between India\u2019s frantic kisses, he got rid of his boxers. Luckily he\u2019d remembered to bring a couple condoms and he was suited up in no time.</p> <p>\u201cFuck me, Colt, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m gonna fuck you. It ain\u2019t gonna be sweet and easy.\u201d</p><p>Colt turned her toward the TV. \u201cSpread your legs. Grab onto the coffee table. Yeah, Indy, that\u2019s sexy as hell.\u201d The second his cock touched the slippery core of her, he hissed.</p><p>He clicked back to the beginning of the scene and hit play.</p><p>Then he lifted her slightly and plunged in.</p><p>She pushed her hips back at him. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p> <p>Colt obliged her, keeping a relentless pounding rhythm. He looked up at the screen. The brunette was busy eating pussy. \u201cDoes girl-on-girl turn you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot usually. This scene is hot, but not as hot as the one where they\u2019re all fucking her. Three men at once. I wonder what that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re with me, you\u2019ll never know.\u201d Colt released her hip so he could grip her hair and pull her ear back to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou and me, India. No one else. If you wanna know what it\u2019s like to have every hole filled, I\u2019ll stick a dildo in your ass and one in your cunt while my cock is in your throat.\u201d</p><p>India whimpered.</p><p>\u201cWould you like that?\u201d</p><p>She whimpered again.</p><p>He pulled her hair a little harder. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, all right? I want to feel you in me everywhere, just you.\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cDo you want me touchin\u2019 your clit or your nipples?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy clit. Please. Rub on it like that woman is.\u201d</p><p>Colt stroked in the identical rhythm on the big screen as he snapped his hips. \u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to... Yes! That\u2019s it.\u201d She squealed and slammed back into Colt\u2019s tunneling cock with enough force the couch cushions shook.</p><p>The hot grip of her pussy muscles around his cock, milking him, sucking at him, and the throbbing cadence of her pulse beneath his stroking finger, all proved too much.</p><p>Colt threw his head back and came with a primal roar.</p><p>When he returned from that otherworldly place where he existed only as pure sensation, he realized he\u2019d clutched her hard enough to bruise her skin.</p><p>Not that she seemed to mind. India pushed up, dislodging his softening sex before she spun around and kissed him. A melding sweetness of raw emotion. She touched him, soothed him, and proved he hadn\u2019t been wrong to fall for her because there was so much more to her than what met the eye. She was everything.</p><p>Everything. And finally, she was his.</p><p>\u201cIndy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt,\u201d she whispered, tugging on his earlobe with her teeth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get serious on me. This night, heck, the last two weeks, have been too amazing to ruin by dissection. We\u2019re both guilty of doing it out of habit because of A.A. Just let it be, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. For now.\u201d</p><p>Bad porn music played in the background.</p><p>She eased back to look into his eyes, stifling a yawn. \u201cI\u2019m tired. Can we just crawl in your big comfy bed, snuggle up and go to sleep?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d be no more confessions or revelations tonight.</p><p>Truthfully, that was probably for the best.</p><p>\u201cCome on then, sleepyhead. Let\u2019s get you a pair of socks,</p><p>\u2019cause no way in hell are you puttin\u2019 them cold feet on me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The front door slammed. A feminine voice called out, \u201cI brought caramel rolls. They\u2019re still warm. They have extra, extra caramel, just like you like \u2019em. And I\u2019m hopin\u2019 because I\u2019m hand delivering your favorite breakfast sweet that you\u2019ll sneak me some of that high octane coffee I smell brewing.\u201d Chassie Glanzer screeched to a stop. \u201cHoly crap. India? What\u2019re you doin\u2019 half-naked in Colt\u2019s kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Chassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, wow, nice to see you. You caught me by surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sorta figured that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I oughta knock before I barge in next time. Not that it\u2019s never mattered before since you\u2019re the first woman I\u2019ve seen in my cousin\u2019s house for an overnight...ah hell, I\u2019m makin\u2019 a mess of this, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d Although, India was secretly glad to see she wasn\u2019t the only one who babbled from nerves.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Colt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn bed. I lost a bet so I had to get up and make coffee.\u201d She\u2019d sworn she couldn\u2019t come from just the vibration of the water jets on her clit, but Colt had proven her wrong. Twice. Early morning Lorelei James</p><p>shower sex, with the oscillating water spray aimed just so...oh, what a way to lose.</p><p>\u201cColt is always up at the crack of nothin\u2019, hard at work,\u201d</p><p>Chassie said.</p><p>Was he ever up. And hard. Dammit, talk about a continual loop of sex on the brain. \u201cHe\u2019s tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re glad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. He\u2019s been alone a long time.\u201d Chassie set the metal, foil-covered pan on the counter. She turned and gave India a once-over, taking in Colt\u2019s long-sleeved button-up shirt, her bare legs, and her mussed hair. \u201cHe needs someone like you.\u201d</p><p>India resisted jerking the lapels closed, even when chances were good whisker burns and love bites decorated her skin alongside her tattoos. \u201cSomeone like me...meaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman who really knows him. And really likes him. And believes in him. And makes him happy. You do all that for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, you had to have known how crazy he\u2019s always been about you, India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, you were the only one.\u201d</p><p>Had she really been so blind?</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m here at nine in the mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope our activities last night weren\u2019t loud enough to wake up the neighbors and you\u2019re coming to complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You\u2019ll never hear me complaining about loud sex.\u201d</p><p>Chassie grinned and pulled herself onto a barstool. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep so I\u2019ve turned into Betty Crocker. It\u2019s sort of embarrassing. I started baking. Bread, rolls, cookies, muffins, you name it. Trev and Ed can only eat so much, so poor Colt is stuck with the remnants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a bachelor, I imagine he hates getting fresh baked goodies.\u201d India smiled. \u201cIs the baby keeping you from sleeping?\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s hand caressed her rounded abdomen. \u201cThe fear of childbirth is keeping me awake most of the time. I hate doctors and hospitals.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t convince my boneheaded men that I\u2019d rather have a midwife deliver the baby at home, in our bed, where he was conceived, instead of in an impersonal hospital.\u201d</p><p>India admired Chassie for bucking conventions and living with and loving two men, despite the many tongues wagging in the community about the arrangement. \u201cSky was terrified of giving birth. But when the time came...she was fine. Afterward, she said the unknown was the worst part for her. It couldn\u2019t have been too bad because she went through it again fifteen months later with twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was really surprised Sky and Kade jumped on the McKay family \u2018let\u2019s have a kid every other year\u2019 bandwagon that our other McKay cousins are on.\u201d Chassie cocked her head. \u201cWas that beep a signal the coffee is done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh sure. Sorry, I\u2019m not much of a hostess.\u201d She smiled sheepishly. \u201cThen again, this isn\u2019t my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen again, isn\u2019t most of the d\u00e9cor in this place your doing?\u201d</p><p>Chassie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t want such a beautiful house to be a typical bachelor pad. Luckily, Colt has great taste.\u201d India grabbed two mugs and moved on the other side of the counter. As she poured, she said, \u201cAnyway, I think Sky and Kade decided if they were going to have more kids, they should do it sooner rather than later. They just didn\u2019t bank on twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd twin girls to boot. If I decide to go through this again, I hope we have a girl.\u201d</p><p>Chassie sighed. \u201cWe still have three months before we have to decide on a name, which is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>India spun her cup on the counter, biting her tongue because the question she wanted to ask was wildly inappropriate.</p><p>\u201cI know tattooing me and Trev and Ed doesn\u2019t mean we know each other very well, even if Colt talks about you all the damn time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? He talks about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConstantly, but just ask me whatever\u2019s on your mind, India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about what first name you\u2019re gonna give the baby, or the last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst name. The baby\u2019s last name will be Glanzer, like ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOurs?\u201d India frowned. \u201cBut don\u2019t you guys have two names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any more. Earlier this year, when Trev, Edgard and I celebrated our first...anniversary together, Ed legally changed his last name to Glanzer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMancuso was his stepfather\u2019s last name. Since he\u2019s broken all ties with his family in Brazil, and he has no living relatives here in the US...it just seemed right he have our name since he\u2019s a part of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlus, as a bonus, Trevor knew it\u2019d piss his dad off.\u201d She winked. \u201cSo enough about me, tell me about you and Colt. When did you and my cousin start...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStart dating? Two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Chassie sighed. \u201cI just bared my soul and that\u2019s all I get?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, \u2019cause Indy ain\u2019t the kiss-and-tell type like some people I know.\u201d Colt set his hands on India\u2019s shoulders and leaned in, mock whispering, \u201cAlthough, there is plenty to tell after last night, huh?\u201d</p><p>He kissed down the side of her neck. \u201cMmm. Mornin\u2019, sugar.\u201d</p><p>Goose bumps broke out in the wake of his warm kisses and sweet words. She closed her eyes and sank into him. \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for makin\u2019 coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I had a choice.\u201d</p> <p>She felt him grin against her cheek. \u201cIs that a complaint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hell no.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened, if anything. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am going to insist on no more betting today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who always starts it.\u201d</p><p>Chassie snorted. \u201cYou two are so whipped. It\u2019s as sweet as it is nauseating.\u201d</p> <p>Crap. India had forgotten about their guest. She opened her eyes. \u201cChassie brought caramel rolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky us.\u201d Colt gestured to Chassie\u2019s coffee cup. \u201cYou ain\u2019t supposed to be drinkin\u2019 coffee, Chass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t tell.\u201d At Colt\u2019s continued hard stare, she said, \u201cBut I know you will. Fine. Dump it out, meanie. I probably better get home anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are Trevor and Edgard doin\u2019 today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably screwing around.\u201d Chassie slid off the barstool.</p><p>\u201cNice seein\u2019 you, India. Nice boxers, Colt. Next time, I\u2019ll knock.\u201d</p><p>She shuffled out.</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d India said.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s ornery and sweet with a big heart. Kinda like you.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhich is probably why she and I have gotten on so well over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that part of the reason you built out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. By the time I got my life back in order, Chassie had married Trevor, Edgard had moved in, and havin\u2019 family close, but bein\u2019 in my own place, appealed to me. I get along great with all of them, sometimes better than with my brothers. Heck, the four of us have even partnered up breedin\u2019 stock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still work at the McKay Ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how that works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ranch is run like a corporation. We\u2019re all shareholders.</p><p>We take care of the ranch as a whole, but we\u2019ve divided it into four sections. Each one of my uncles and my dad is an original owner.</p><p>But when the main owners started havin\u2019 sons, they divided their individual sections up again. So, we\u2019ve all added separate parcels.</p><p>Like Cord and my dad bought the Foster place a few years back.</p><p>Colby and my dad bought an acreage north of Colby\u2019s place up in the mountains. That\u2019s where Kade was during Skylar\u2019s pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wondered about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was easier for Kade to take off since there\u2019s only Kade and Buck on my Uncle Cal\u2019s portion and they haven\u2019t expanded.\u201d</p><p>India frowned. If Cord and Carson bought land, and Colby and Carson bought land, wouldn\u2019t it make sense...Carson and Colt would\u2019ve bought land? \u201cDid you and your dad buy other acreages together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I bought land on my own that I kept separate from the McKay Ranch, which pissed them off. Because financially it ended up bein\u2019 a good investment, one that was solely mine.\u201d</p><p>One thing India and Colt never talked about was finances.</p><p>\u201cLike this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, we all own the land my house is on. My other McKay cousins take care of their two sections, and they\u2019ve added significantly to their holdings in the last ten years. We help each other out, but mostly we\u2019re responsible for what goes on in our area.</p><p>So Colby, Cord, Dad and I run ours. My cousins Kade and Buck theirs. Quinn and Bennett theirs while Chase is off rodeoin\u2019. My other cousins, Dalton, Luke, Brandt and Tell...I ain\u2019t gonna get into the clusterfuck that is right now.\u201d</p><p>India stared at him, too embarrassed to admit she didn\u2019t understand a word he\u2019d just said.</p><p>\u201cAm I borin\u2019 ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just a hard concept to grasp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. I\u2019m glad it ain\u2019t my job to figure out who\u2019s owed what when it comes time to get paid.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, bringing up ranch business always made Colt tense. His hands were wrapped around his coffee cup so tightly she feared he\u2019d break the ceramic.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry? The caramel rolls look delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I ate earlier.\u201d Colt smirked at her over his cup.</p><p>Cocky man. She smirked back when she remembered what he\u2019d had for breakfast.</p><p>It was time to return the favor. She set down her mug. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if I indulge. I love caramel. So thick, and sweet and sticky.\u201d She peeled back the foil and dipped her finger in the center of the gooey mass. She sucked her finger provocatively. \u201cWanna taste? Mmm-mmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt.\u201d India leaned forward and let her sticky lips track the line of his jaw. \u201cTake your boxers off.\u201d She breathed heavily in his ear. \u201cDon\u2019t ask why, just do it.\u201d</p><p>His mug hit the counter and a second later his boxers hit the floor.</p><p>\u201cGood boy. Grip the counter and spread your legs. Now watch me.\u201d</p><p>Colt managed to choke out, \u201cWatch you do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow you my favorite way to eat caramel.\u201d India recoated her fingers with the sugary goodness, scooping a dollop into her palm.</p><p>Keeping her eyes on his, her hand circled his cock. \u201cMight get a little messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live to get messy.\u201d</p><p>With the hand that wasn\u2019t stroking his brown-sugar coated shaft, she scraped the gooey topping off three caramel rolls and smeared it on Colt\u2019s chest. She took special care to paint both his nipples. Thoroughly.</p><p>Then she bent her head and tasted. Mmm. Sweet sugar and salty Colt. The perfect combination. She enclosed her mouth around his left nipple and sucked. And sucked. Worrying the pebbled tip with her teeth. Stopping to rub her cheek across his pecs. Each brush of her mouth and lips made those tight muscles dance.</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t utter a sound until she bestowed the same treatment to the other side.</p><p>India followed the sweet trail down the center of his spectacular body. She drew small circles around his belly button, dipping her tongue into his navel. Several times. She enjoyed the way his six-pack rippled with each wet swipe. Then she dropped to her knees.</p><p>He growled. \u201cSweet Mother of God.\u201d</p><p>As she received her first up-close-and-personal look at his cock, she couldn\u2019t believe how...big it was. Yeah, she\u2019d felt it inside her, but Colt had pretty much kept her hands off his junk. Mr.</p><p>Chivalrous hadn\u2019t allowed her to put a condom on him at all last night. Or in the shower this morning. He\u2019d slipped one on and hoisted her against the tiled wall as she\u2019d been trying to gather her wits after her second water-pik-induced orgasm.</p><p>India looked up at him. \u201cPackin\u2019 some serious heat there, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>He blushed. Colt McKay actually blushed. \u201cI-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not complaining.\u201d Keeping her eyes on his, she licked all the caramel from the head. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn that feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we quit talking so I can get to the really good part.</p><p>The licking\u2014\u201d she flattened her tongue and licked from the root to the crown, \u201c\u2014more licking\u2014\u201d she lapped at the purple head, flicking her tongue over the pre-come seeping out the tip, \u201c\u2014and my favorite, sucking.\u201d India bent her head and swallowed as much of his cock as she could.</p><p>A strangled groan emerged and he swayed.</p><p>She sucked off the brown sugar sweetness until all she could taste was the muskiness of Colt. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tease me the first time you used your mouth on me, so I\u2019m returning the favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI\u2019m so lasting about four more seconds.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers loosely wrapped around the base of his shaft and she stroked her hand up to meet her mouth going down all that delicious hard male heat. India curled her left hand around his right hip, stroking her thumb on the delicate skin by his hipbone as her head bobbed.</p><p>All at once, his balls tightened and she knew he was close.</p><p>Especially when Colt started bumping his hips into her face.</p><p>She jacked his cock faster and focused her attention on the sweet spot beneath the cockhead.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His cock twitched against the roof of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Ah hell, Indy.\u201d</p><p>India sucked him as deep as she could, suctioning as hot bursts of semen hit the back of her tongue. She swallowed the bitter/sweet taste, losing herself in the satisfaction of pleasing her lover.</p><p>After she let him slip from her mouth, she kissed the tops of his shaking thighs and rubbed her face against his semi-soft cock, nestled in the dark hair covering his groin. Marking him with her scent as clearly as he\u2019d marked her with his.</p><p>She rolled to her feet. Before India even met his gaze, Colt picked her up and set her on the kitchen table. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wantin\u2019 a little caramelly goodness of my own.\u201d He pushed her flat, keeping his hand in the center of her chest. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Then his other hand was smearing caramel between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cColt\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lapped at the caramel as delicately as a cat. The pointed tip of his tongue traced the outline of her weeping sex, from the piercing above her clit, down through her cleft to the slit of her pussy, to the rosette of her ass. He swirled and licked and probed with that nimble tongue until her whole body vibrated. Colt drove her to the brink of orgasm, dangled her at the edge and then yanked her back at the last second. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you going to let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He took great pains to erase all remnants of the caramel with his Hoover-like mouth. He inserted one finger in her pussy as he lightly tongued her clit. Then he inserted a second finger as he slurped at the sweet stickiness from the folds.</p><p>\u201cHow long\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I say.\u201d He began to fuck her with his clever fingers while his tongue flicked. \u201cI like sweet caramel.\u201d He blew a cool stream of breath over her hot tissues. \u201cBut I prefer your sweet juices.\u201d Colt latched onto her clit and sucked without pause. His fingers curled inside her, gently rubbing at a spot beneath her pubic bone. The tension coiled tighter and when she exploded with a gasp resembling a scream, he chuckled against her wet flesh.</p><p>Every throb, every pulse, every muscle twitch synchronized into a whole body orgasm. Just as India caught her balance, Colt knocked her off balance again. She was flipped over face-first on the table.</p><p>Colt yanked her hips back until the lower half of her body hung off the table. Then his hot breath teased the skin behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou have no fuckin\u2019 idea how many times I\u2019ve whacked off to this fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dick is hard again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Fuck, woman, you\u2019d tempt a eunuch.\u201d He positioned his cock and plunged in.</p><p>\u201cOh God you\u2019re good at that, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to know you think I\u2019m good at something.\u201d Again, he stretched his torso across her upper back so he could whisper in her ear. \u201cOne of these times I take you from behind? I\u2019m gonna be fuckin\u2019 your ass, not your pussy. You\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you?</p><p>Maybe if I put a vibrator up this pretty snatch? So I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 you in both places?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Damn you, yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shame in likin\u2019 it raunchy, sugar, now hold on.\u201d</p><p>He drove into her again and again. Slam. Retreat. Slam.</p><p>Retreat. Slam. Retreat.</p><p>The shirt stuck to her back. She wished it was just Colt\u2019s bare skin sticking against hers.</p><p>\u201cOnly been an hour but I forgot how good this feels.\u201d</p><p>Something niggled in the back of her head. Something else they\u2019d forgotten.</p> <p>\u201cClose. Here it comes.\u201d</p><p>It hit her. A condom.</p><p>\u201cColt, stop, we forgot a condom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop.\u201d He pulled out. A groan escaped and she felt the heat of his ejaculate spraying her butt cheeks.</p><p>India looked over her shoulder at him. His hand still pumped his cock, but his gaze was focused entirely on her ass.</p><p>\u201cI love these tattoos. But I gotta admit, I love seein\u2019 my come splattered all over them.\u201d He hugged her from behind. \u201cJesus that was hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. And sticky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShower. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have an idea of what you wanna do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to do with having something hot, and hard and fast between my legs.\u201d</p><p>Colt nipped her earlobe and soothed the sting with a swipe of his tongue. \u201cI\u2019m likin\u2019 this idea so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I brought extra protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you for a ride, cowboy. On my motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>Later that afternoon, India lifted her head from Colt\u2019s chest.</p><p>They were naked in his bed, after spending most of the day there.</p><p>She\u2019d convinced Colt to take a ride on her bike. When they\u2019d returned to his house, he\u2019d ridden her. She was still a bit sweaty and a lot tired.</p><p>Colt\u2019s fingertips idly traced her spine. \u201cYou have this cute little wrinkle by your nose that tips me off the wheels are spinning in your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I just wondered...what now? Are we still dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019ve moved beyond the dating stage to the \u2018seeing\u2019 each other stage.\u201d Colt tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cDo we really need to label this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because it scares me. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re supposed to do. Do we call each other and make plans? Is it a given we\u2019ll see each other every day? Do we take turns spending the night at each other\u2019s houses? Are we still going out and doing couple things? Or are we staying in and having sex nonstop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that last option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe serious. I\u2019ve had friendships. I\u2019ve had sexual relationships.</p><p>But I\u2019ve never had one that\u2019s been both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich leads me straight back to the original question: what now?\u201d</p><p>Colt absentmindedly stroked her cheek. \u201cIt took us time to become friends, Indy. It took us a lot longer to start dating. I imagine it\u2019ll take adjustments to bein\u2019 lovers. If I had my way, we\u2019d speed up that adjustment period together every minute we weren\u2019t workin\u2019, but that ain\u2019t realistic. Let\u2019s just take it week by week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we were together like that all the time, we might as well move in together or get married.\u201d</p><p>They both froze.</p><p>India backtracked. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore\u2019s the pity.\u201d</p><p>Her head screamed, retreat! \u201cUm. Wow. Look at the time. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>Colt sat up and reached for the box of condoms on the nightstand. \u201cThen let me have you once more, because I can\u2019t get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>She allowed him to kiss her but then she snatched the condom out of his fingers. \u201cI am so all over bouncing on your cowboy pole...just as soon as we have a plan of attack for the next stage of our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeadly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Monday night, we\u2019ll go to a movie.\u201d He grabbed the condom back and ripped the package open. \u201cTuesday night, we have a meeting, but afterward, let\u2019s go to your place. You can show me your sex toy collection and I\u2019ll prove why it\u2019s so much better to have a man fucking you than plastic.\u201d Colt rolled the condom on.</p><p>\u201cWednesday night, ladies\u2019 choice. On Thursday nights, I work out with Cam, so it\u2019ll be an off night for us. Friday night, we can hit the meeting and then come out here, where I will fuck you nine ways</p><p>\u2019til Sunday, which I\u2019m hopin\u2019 will spur you into staying with me until Sunday night.\u201d He stretched his legs out and brought her across his lap. \u201cIs that a good enough plan of attack for you?\u201d</p><p>India wreathed her arms around his neck. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just come up with that on the fly, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...how did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not as much of a free spirit as you pretend to be. You have an orderly, logical streak, planning ahead is important to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that the plan of attack is planned, can I get to the attacking you part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Lovers Week One</p><p>\u201cI never thought that meeting would get over,\u201d Colt said Tuesday night.</p><p>\u201cIt might\u2019ve gone faster if you would\u2019ve tried the trust game,\u201d</p><p>India pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat game don\u2019t prove nothin\u2019 about trust.\u201d Colt nuzzled the back of her head. \u201cJesus, I want you so fuckin\u2019 bad, Indy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you at least wait until we get into my apartment?\u201d The instant the lock clicked, he shoved them both through the door and slammed it shut.</p><p>Colt tried to cushion the blow when India\u2019s back hit the wall.</p><p>Luckily she didn\u2019t smack her head. Unluckily, their teeth clacked together, piercing her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He gently sucked at the raised bump while strumming the pads of his thumbs down the side of her neck. Seductively.</p><p>Delicately. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBed. Now.\u201d</p><p>India took his hand and led him into her bedroom, clicking on the lamp in the corner.</p><p>When they stopped by the side of the bed, Colt pinned her wrists behind her back. His mouth brushed her ear. \u201cTonight you\u2019re mine. You\u2019ll do as I say. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Good God it turned her on when his dominant side came out to play.</p><p>\u201cGet your favorite vibrator and half a dozen of those silk scarves you love so much. Then strip and get in the middle of the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to be doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>India rummaged in her drawer. How ironic that the vibrator was beneath the scarves. She draped the silken strips across the end of the bed, set the vibrator, a new tube of K-Y and a few condoms next to them and removed her clothes.</p><p>When she glanced at Colt as she spread out on the sheets, he was completely, gloriously nude.</p><p>Oh yeah.</p><p>Then he reached for a scarf and leveled her with the molten look that spelled pure trouble. \u201cHands above your head.\u201d He tied her left wrist to the metal headboard and repeated the process on the right. \u201cCan I trust you to keep your legs in place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019d better tie them.\u201d</p><p>Colt growled.</p><p>He chose the narrowest scarf and carefully threaded it though the nipple rings. He tugged lightly and the sensation zinged from her nipples straight to her core. \u201cOh. Wow. Do it again.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a little harder. \u201cInteresting that Miz India likes a bite of pain with her pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt, I don\u2019t know about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you. But I am gonna drive you more than a little crazy.\u201d He hung above her body, his knees bracketing her hips, his hands by her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you blindfold me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want you watchin\u2019 everything I\u2019m doin\u2019 to you.\u201d</p><p>Colt kissed her. Hot. Wet. Slow. He sat back on his haunches between her straddled thighs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>India stared at his erection and the slick spot the tip left above his navel. \u201cIs that bad boy for me?\u201d</p><p>He ripped open a condom and rolled it on. \u201cHow about if we get your first one outta the way?\u201d he said, reaching for the vibrator.</p><p>A loud bzzzz reverberated as he cranked the vibrator on high.</p><p>He placed the tip over the top of the piercing and left it there, keeping constant sensation on her clit.</p><p>\u201cOh God, I might set the new speed record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could almost come from just lookin\u2019 at you all tied up and listening to you make those sexy-ass noises. Let go, there\u2019s plenty more.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, the continuous contact sent her into a fast orgasm. A quick throbbing that both eased her and left her hanging on the edge, wanting more.</p><p>She\u2019d barely caught her breath when Colt placed his mouth on the curve of her throat and sucked. He pulled the scarf back and forth between the rings so the silk constantly slid across her hardened nipples.</p><p>Between his marauding mouth and the sensual slide of the material, chills broke out from her neck to her knees.</p><p>Colt kept up the suckling kisses and erotic silken glide of the scarf, changing the pace at odd intervals by tugging gently on the silk, sending a spark of pain that immediately morphed into pleasure.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>He chuckled and kept doing it. Again and again.</p><p>When India couldn\u2019t take any more, and felt the sticky warmth pooling between her thighs, she whispered, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease make me come again.\u201d</p><p>His cheek rubbed against hers; his breath tickled her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come my way. It won\u2019t be on my cock. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I just need\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colt took her mouth in a tongue-tangling kiss before that clever mouth moved down the center of her body. He scooted back on his belly until his face was on level with her mound.</p><p>She looked at his dark hair as he flicked his tongue across the piercing. Her arms jerked in her bonds and her legs twitched with every fleeting lick. She noticed he\u2019d twisted the ends of the scarf around the palm of his left hand. Her heart thumped when he turned the vibrator on.</p><p>\u201cColt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoosen up, sugar.\u201d He swirled the end of the vibrator around her opening in the same manner as his tongue circled her clit. Three things happened simultaneously: he slid the vibrator into her pussy, he sucked on her clit and he tugged on the scarf.</p> <p>India screamed.</p><p>Never had all her erogenous zones been targeted simultaneously. Her body was electrified, merely a conduit for sexual pleasure.</p><p>And Colt overwhelmed her with it. He fucked her with the vibrator, pressing the phallus against her pubic bone inside as he suckled her clit, then he\u2019d slowly drag it out again.</p><p>The intense stimulation had her grinding her sex into Colt\u2019s face. He emitted a growling noise and continued driving her to the brink with his lips and tongue. She thrashed as much as the bonds would allow, the fabric burned her wrists and ankles, the sheets abraded her spine, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Especially not when her orgasm broke free, reverberating in one long wave, as if every neuron in her brain sent a message to her body to tingle, explode and throb in unison.</p><p>She was so bowled over she couldn\u2019t scream. She couldn\u2019t breathe. Her eyes rolled back in her head. She finally knew what the French meant when they called an orgasm a little death\u2014she\u2019d briefly experienced heaven.</p><p>When the rhythmic pulses in her clit slowed, the vibrator disappeared.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>India opened her eyes to see Colt\u2019s cheeks were flushed, his lips glistened with her juices and his eyes were heavy-lidded with desire.</p><p>He ripped the scarves from her ankles, hiked her hips up, pressing the backs of her thighs to his chest. Aligning his cock to her pussy, he plunged in, his fingers tightened on her ass as he fucked her with abandon. \u201cJesus, you\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have that effect on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Your effect on me is I\u2019m ready to blow.\u201d</p><p>And he did, almost immediately. He was mesmerizing lost in his climax. She watched him, humbled by all this man freely gave to her\u2014in bed and out.</p><p>He untied her arms and legs and carefully unthreaded the scarf from the nipple rings. Rather than bringing her into his arms, Colt laid his head on her chest.</p><p>India ran her fingers through his damp hair. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever been better.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWill you stay over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to, but I can\u2019t because I have to be up early.\u201d</p><p>No bullshit excuses, just the truth.</p><p>\u201cToo bad. I was gonna bake caramel rolls for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYou don\u2019t cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not good at the sorts of things women around here are good at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRanch stuff.\u201d Wife stuff.</p><p>Stop that, India.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter. You\u2019re good at all sorts of other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wanna learn...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe normal stuff,\u201d she blurted. \u201cWill you teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my pleasure.\u201d Colt kissed the tip of her breast and then her mouth and hopped up.</p><p>India watched him get dressed.</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed beside her. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Ladies\u2019 choice, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already decided what we\u2019re gonna do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo-step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hopin\u2019 that\u2019s a sex position we haven\u2019t tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is the normal stuff I\u2019m talking about. I want you to teach me how to cowboy dance. In private, where no one can see my two left feet and my inability to keep time.\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s eyes searched hers. \u201cWhy do you wanna learn to dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you love to dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but that don\u2019t mean I expect you to take it up just to please me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I want to please you, Colt? What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. Stupid idea.\u201d She peered at her fingers gripping the edge of the sheet, feeling the sting of embarrassment. She never should have suggested\u2014</p><p>He tipped her chin up. \u201cIf you really wanna learn, I\u2019d be honored to teach you.\u201d His thumb swept over her bottom lip. \u201cYou constantly surprise me, India Ellison. Goddamn. You have no idea how much I\u2014\u201d He kissed her with such emotion she felt a lump rising in her throat.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he said gruffly and left her staring after him.</p><p>Three days later, Colt laid on his back staring at the wispy fabric draped above India\u2019s bed. While relaxed from a round of fast and fun sex, and content to just be around India, naked or not, he was tired of looking at the back of his eyelids. He sighed.</p><p>\u201cStop sighing like a teenage girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you done yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I move now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanna peek at what you\u2019re doin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Colt, sit still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re drawin\u2019 me with a really big dick.\u201d</p><p>India peeked over the edge of the sketchpad at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me to embellish that appendage, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Colt grinned. \u201cNow who\u2019s the sweet talker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, this isn\u2019t a nude. You just happen to be nude as I\u2019m sketching. Now, stop interrupting my artistic flow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d About thirty seconds later, he said, \u201cWho\u2019s gonna see this picture anyway? Because I don\u2019t want it hanging in your tattoo shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll keep it away from the slavering masses of women who trail after you like lovesick puppies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly woman I want slavering and trailing after me, all lovesick, is you, sugar.\u201d</p><p>No response. Scritch scratch. Scritch scratch. Scritch scratch.</p><p>\u201cThis secretiveness ain\u2019t givin\u2019 me warm fuzzies about what you\u2019re drawin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly the warm fuzzy type, Colt. Neither are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, which is another reason you need to show me because I wanna make sure you\u2019re not drawin\u2019 devil horns on me. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doin\u2019 this.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him again, a bit curiously. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you promise not to freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dice. I will freak out if the reason is embarrassing or lame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>India closed her eyes and sagged back into the pillows, clutching the sketchpad to her chest. A minute or so passed.</p><p>\u201cIndy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real reason is...you\u2019re beautiful. Men aren\u2019t supposed to be, but you are.\u201d Her eyes opened and she stared at him with an intensity that fired his blood. \u201cYour face, your body. God. Every single inch of you is...perfection. Sometimes the light hits you just so and it takes my breath away. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. With me.\u201d</p><p>Talk about taking his breath away. Colt rolled to his knees.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever wonder...if we\u2019ve wasted time not being together like this, before this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We can\u2019t go back. Any time I spent with you, as your friend wasn\u2019t wasted time. Our friendship is what got us to this point. And it\u2019s what\u2019ll get us to the next point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next point? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Marriage. Babies. Happily ever after. One week into dating and India wasn\u2019t ready to hear that yet, so he kept it light. \u201cWhere you show up naked at my house ready to do my bidding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll rethink that statement when you see what I\u2019ve drawn.\u201d India watched him as he crawled toward her.

Don\u2019t make me tickle you to get what I want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dare me. I rock at double-dog and triple-dog dares and don\u2019t get me started on truth or dare. Plus, I know all your ticklish spots. Hand it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome and get it, McKay.\u201d She attempted to roll off the bed.</p><p>His hand circled her ankle and he tugged her back on the mattress.</p><p>India shrieked and tried to wrench free, which only increased his determination.</p><p>Colt attacked her feet. She yelped and swatted at him with the sketchbook. He snatched it from her with one hand. \u201cHah!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey! Gimme that back, it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a sec. I just wanna look.\u201d He studied it before his eyes met hers. He flipped the page back to her, jabbing his finger at the twin images. \u201cYou really see me this way? With turquoise stars and orange and purple flames tattooed around my pierced nipples?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cGotcha. You really thought I was drawing nudie pics of you, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou little tease.\u201d He threw the notebook over the side of the bed and tickled her until she screamed.</p><p>The touches turned from playful to passionate. And then he was inside her, face-to-face, skin-to-skin, heart-to-heart. The more time he spent with her, the more amazed he was by her. By everything they were when they were together.</p><p>India curled her fingers around his neck. \u201cI wasn\u2019t kidding, earlier. You are so beautiful, Colt McKay. Beautiful inside and out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes, India. Same goes.\u201d He kissed her and the world fell away.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>Lovers Week Two</p><p>Colt hated cleaning the garage. So, when a sultry, \u201cHey, cowboy,\u201d drifted through the open garage door, he thought he might\u2019ve been hearing things.</p><p>\u201cIndia?\u201d Colt\u2019s gloved fingers tightened around the shovel handle.</p><p>\u201cIn the flesh, baby.\u201d Pause. \u201cLiterally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? It\u2019s the middle of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tattoo biz is dead and my sister is running the store. So I thought to myself, I wonder what my big, sexy cowboy is doing.\u201d</p><p>Her footsteps echoed as loud as the sudden thumping of his heart.</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m not busy, I thought I\u2019d come out and see if I can help you. I even have my cowgirl boots on.\u201d</p><p>Colt turned around so fast he almost got whiplash.</p><p>Holy hell. Cowgirl boots were the only thing India had on.</p><p>The shovel in his hand clanked to the concrete floor.</p><p>\u201cSadly, I don\u2019t own any other western wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not complaining.\u201d Colt\u2019s gaze slowly tracked her sexy body, from the pointed tips of her red nipples to the pointed toes of her red boots. His cock hardened. His mouth watered. \u201cBut I\u2019m hopin\u2019 you didn\u2019t ride your motorcycle out here in that get-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam\u2019ll have to arrest me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor killin\u2019 every man who laid eyes on you undressed like that.\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction glinted in her eyes. \u201cA little proprietary, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that means you\u2019re mine, only mine, then hell yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am yours, Colt.\u201d</p><p>His eyes ate her up with a hunger that bordered on obsessive.</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Without breaking eye contact, he grabbed a horse blanket from the pile on the workbench. He tossed it on the concrete in front of him. Then he began to unbuckle his belt. \u201cYou\u2019d better be over here, on your knees, ready to suck my cock by the time this zipper is down.\u201d</p><p>She hit the ground like she was sliding bases.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Colt peeled his jeans down his thighs and his blood-engorged cock slapped his belly. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d India licked her lips.</p><p>He circled the tip of his cock around her mouth. \u201cOpen. Take it all.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted and she swallowed in a drawn out tease.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of this ain\u2019t gonna be your pace, it\u2019s gonna be mine.</p><p>Fast and hard, Indy. That\u2019s how I\u2019m gonna fuck your sweet, perfect mouth.\u201d</p><p>Her moan vibrated up his shaft.</p><p>Colt threaded his fingers through her hair for a decent grip. He pulled out and eased back in. Three, four, five slow thrusts. Once his shaft was coated with her saliva, he increased the pace.</p><p>She\u2019d closed her eyes and kept her neck arched at an angle where she could take him deep.</p><p>It was a fucking turn on to watch her. How sexy it was as his cock disappeared between her red lips. How her fingertips dug into his thighs with enough force to leave half-moon shaped marks. How the wetness from her mouth freely ran down her chin and neck. He loved the raw power she had over him in her submission. The occasional scrape of her teeth. The teasing flicker of her tongue.</p><p>It was too much. Too good. Despite the cool temperature of the day and the garage, sweat beaded on his forehead and his whole body burned hot.</p><p>When his balls contracted, he shortened his strokes and increased the grasp on her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there. Right...now. Oh hell, suck. Suck hard. Suck it all.</p><p>Ah. Jesus. Your mouth is so wet and tight...fuck!\u201d</p><p>India held him upright as he came. And came. And when his cock was empty, she licked his softening shaft and nuzzled his balls, bringing him down from the sex high with tenderness.</p><p>He looked down at her and touched her cheek. \u201cThat was awesome. And I love your obedience. Love it so much, in fact, that I\u2019m gonna return the favor.\u201d</p><p>She lifted both pierced brows. \u201cMeaning I get to demand your obedience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Meanin\u2019 I\u2019m gonna grab some ropes and see how long you can keep it up.\u201d</p><p>Thursday night, the loud click of India\u2019s bedroom door opening echoed in her room. The mattress dipped. \u201cIndia? You awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably weren\u2019t even sleepin\u2019, Little Miz Troublemaker,\u201d Colt drawled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you left a message on my cell phone callin\u2019 me a dickhead.\u201d</p><p>She smiled in the darkness. \u201cI knew that\u2019d get you over here in a hurry after your workout with Cam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pissed off about something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that I didn\u2019t see you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was lonely.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cSo you insulted me to get me to come over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Might be masochistic, but I do love fighting with you. I love the making up part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Colt whipped the covers back. \u201cEspecially when you\u2019re already nekkid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be for me tonight, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I missed you. Are you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still debating.\u201d His teeth latched onto her right nipple, his left hand circled her wrists and pressed them above her head.</p><p>She arched, anxious to lose herself in the passion that always flared between them. His avid mouth was on her breast, sucking at the hoop piercing her nipple.</p><p>But he stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been touchin\u2019 yourself while you\u2019ve been waitin\u2019 for me to get here?\u201d</p><p>Crap. How had he known?</p><p>\u201cWill I find your sweet cream if I slide my hand between your thighs?\u201d</p><p>Distract him. She moaned and arched harder.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart your legs.\u201d</p><p>His rough palm was cold as it slid down her belly, over her mound. He slipped one long finger inside her pussy.</p><p>Eyes closed, she murmured, \u201cThat feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow good?\u201d Colt added another finger, pumping both deep, adding that delicious twist at the end she loved. \u201cAs good as when you got yourself off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. It\u2019s always better with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should\u2019ve waited.\u201d He removed his hand.</p><p>India froze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad girl, Indy. Makin\u2019 me worry for nothin\u2019. And while I was worryin\u2019 you were gonna rip me a new one for some reason like you\u2019re prone to do, you were here, diddling yourself, bold as you please.\u201d His breath was hot in her ear. \u201cBad girls get punished. Roll over and take your licks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me tell you twice.\u201d Colt released her wrists.</p><p>While she rolled onto her stomach, she heard him taking off his clothes. Heard him open a nightstand drawer. Heard the crackle of plastic as he ripped open a condom. Blood whooshed in her ears as her excitement rose.</p><p>\u201cGet on all fours.\u201d The bed dipped.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>His hard, hot upper body covered her back and his chin came over her shoulder. \u201cBad girls don\u2019t get to ask questions. Do I need to gag you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen be still.\u201d Colt trailed love bites from shoulder to shoulder. Then his tongue slowly followed the line of her spine from her nape to her tailbone. And back up. And back down.</p><p>Goose bumps spread across her skin. She moaned at the eroticism in his teasing touch, the wetness of his tongue, the coolness of his breath, the rasp of his beard, the silky swish of his hair, the tiny bite of anger guiding his movements.</p><p>And his scent drove her crazy. India knew he hadn\u2019t showered after leaving the gym. The dark, male musk of his sweat coated his skin and she breathed it in, hoping that scent would linger on her and the sheets after he left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colt lightly sank his teeth into the tattoo on her right butt cheek. He flicked his tongue around the design. Then he let his tongue lead the way to the left butt cheek, and he briefly lapped at the crack of her ass. Another bite. More licking.</p><p>Her whole body shook. \u201cOh God, Colt. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>His lips were on her ear. \u201cYou took your licks like a good girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought by \u2018licks\u2019 you were going to spank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like that?\u201d</p><p>Yes. But India bit her lip instead of confessing.</p><p>A beat passed, then whack whack on each of her butt cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, okay? I\u2019ve always wondered what it\u2019d be like, not that I\u2019ve ever let a man spank me because of some of that crap from my past, but I trust you not to take it too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer, sugar. Another time we\u2019ll explore that secret kink. With a paddle. Maybe a ridin\u2019 crop. Definitely my hand.\u201d</p><p>India shuddered.</p><p>\u201cIt is punishment not to lick you where you most want my tongue, bad girl.\u201d He nuzzled the back of her head. \u201cI should fuck you and not let you come, since you already got off tonight without me, but makin\u2019 you come gets me off. Lower your chest to the mattress and leave your ass in the air.\u201d</p><p>She set the side of her face on the bed and stretched her arms above her head.</p><p>\u201cBrace yourself.\u201d Colt kneed her stance wider, tilted her hips and plunged in. His withdrawal was fast. His returning stroke was fast. As fast and hard as he liked.</p> <p>His selfishness shouldn\u2019t be a turn-on, but it was. Normally he was an incredibly generous lover. India closed her eyes and let his need wash over her.</p><p>Slam. Slam. Slam. Slam. Slam. The slap of his skin against hers as she listened to his choppy breathing had her clenching around his cock. That familiar pulsing sensation rippled through her deepest tissues, sending her straight over the edge into a short orgasm.</p><p>Colt\u2019s hips pistoned faster. His fingers squeezed her ass and he began to come. \u201cFuck. Fuck.\u201d</p><p>India craved that burst of male heat inside her, not trapped in a condom. She wanted to stand up and see his seed trickling out of her sated and swollen sex.</p><p>\u201cGod, woman, the things you do to me.\u201d</p><p>After he pulled out, India collapsed on the bed. Vaguely she heard the toilet flush. The rustle of his clothes. Then his yummy scent surrounded her.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Can you stay and punish me some more since I tricked you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He kissed the tattoo between her shoulder blades and tucked the covers under her chin.</p> <p>\u201cNext time, if you\u2019re missin\u2019 me just ask me to come over, okay? Because if it happens again, I will spank your ass good and red for pickin\u2019 a fight. Sweet dreams.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Lovers Week Three</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, baby, right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt, will you shut up?\u201d India hissed.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. It feels too goddamn good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are staring at us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet \u2019em. Harder.\u201d He arched his neck. \u201cLike that. Goddamn you\u2019ve got magic fingers, Indy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Please. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>India wrapped her hands around the shopping cart handle and pushed to the frozen food section.</p><p>Within thirty seconds Colt came up behind her, curling his hands and his body over hers. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever ask me to rub your neck in the grocery store again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It wasn\u2019t like you had your hand on my dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might as well have with the \u2018oh baby\u2019 porn noises you were grunting.\u201d</p><p>He nipped her earlobe and licked the sting, brushing his lips to the center of her ear. \u201cAnd to think I didn\u2019t utter a sound last night when you gave me a handjob at the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was hot as hell, havin\u2019 your buttery fingers strokin\u2019 my cock. I had to clench my ass cheeks together when your thumb rubbed the sweet spot below the head. I was so fuckin\u2019 hard, India.</p><p>You did that to me. You do that to me.\u201d</p><p>And she thought he\u2019d lost his sweet-talkin\u2019 ability. The man could make her wet and weak-kneed with just words.</p><p>He blew in her ear. \u201cI think I behaved admirably by not shoutin\u2019 out your name when I came all over your hand. I think I oughta be rewarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were rewarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Maybe I oughta reward you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fulfilled one of my fantasies, so turnabout is fair play.</p><p>Tell me, sugar, what\u2019s one of your unfulfilled fantasies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first one that pops to mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with a man, who has a really big\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndy,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cKitchen. A man who knows the difference between simmer and burn, a man who can whip and stir, steam and cream. A man who keeps his promises of heating things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. I\u2019ll teach you to cook. But you so aren\u2019t getting any cock...tail shrimp tonight, if you waste all that dirty talk in the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t you worry. There\u2019s plenty more where that came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m countin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>Three days later, India was cleaning up the kitchen at Colt\u2019s house, when he shouted from the living room, \u201cIndy, you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost done. You need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take a soda if you\u2019re offerin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>India wrapped tinfoil around the leftover pieces of her first chicken dinner and shoved the plate on the shelf in the refrigerator.</p><p>As she reached for a Diet Pepsi, she accidentally knocked over the can of whipped cream from the back.</p><p>Heh heh.</p><p>The laugh track from the TV echoed. She vigorously shook the can and kept it behind her back, hiding it behind his recliner after she entered the living room.</p><p>Colt glanced up and bestowed the wicked grin that was hers alone. Cheeky man.</p><p>India leaned over and set the soda on the end table. As she straightened up, he snagged the ends of the dishtowel draped around her neck and hauled her on his lap.</p><p>He swallowed her tiny shriek with a kiss heavy on seduction.</p><p>She found herself plastered to him as he lowered the recliner completely horizontal.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured against her throat, \u201cmuch better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to mess around?\u201d He brushed warm kisses across her lips. \u201cBecause I could kiss you for hours. Here,\u201d he briefly let their lips connect, then nibbled a path to her ear, \u201cand other places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other places?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme think. Right here.\u201d He opened his mouth where her neck curved into her shoulder and sucked until she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cAnd here.\u201d That agile tongue circled the hollow of her throat and rained wet kisses down to the top button of her shirt.</p><p>\u201cAnywhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d His deft fingers began to unbutton her blouse. He didn\u2019t say a word until the material flapped open to reveal she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. He groaned and filled his hands with her breasts. Squeezing, rasping his thumbs over the nipples until they contracted into tight, aching points beneath the hoops.</p><p>Colt watched her face as he touched her. Gauging her reaction to better torture her next time. She let him think he was in charge, but she couldn\u2019t stop a smirk from forming.</p><p>\u201cWhy the devious smile, India Blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason. I thought you were gonna show me all the places you\u2019d like to kiss me and your mouth is nowhere near where I want it to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so impatient.\u201d</p><p>She slid his palms down her ribcage to her hips and shimmied closer, letting her bare breasts sway in front of his lips. She eased back when his tongue flicked out to swipe at a hardened nipple. \u201cOr maybe you need an incentive.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for his response, India leaned over and grabbed the can. She sat up and squirted a dollop of whipped cream on her left nipple.</p><p>Colt\u2019s eyes nearly popped out of his head.</p><p>\u201cPut your mouth on me, Colt. Lick me, suck me. Show me how you wanted to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d</p><p>The mechanism in the recliner went sproing as it snapped back into a chair.</p><p>Then he was upright with his lips pursed around her nipple, sucking off the sweet white stuff like a vacuum. Opening his mouth wider and wider until he seemed to suck her whole breast inside.</p><p>The cold spot from the whipped cream evaporated in his heated, hungry mouth. She arched into him, grinding into his cock, her blood pumping in cadence with him drawing her nipple in and out.</p><p>He snatched the can, tipped it upside down and sprayed a thick mound on her right nipple. This time he licked a tiny swath until just the pink tip poked out.</p><p>Slowly. Round and round. A measured lick here and there. His tongue started at the bottom swell of her breast, flattened around the sides, tapered to a fine point over her breastbone. As the circle grew smaller and smaller, he went slower and slower. He zeroed in on the rigid aching nipple, letting his tongue toy with the hoop, while his right thumb lightly feathered the skin above the waistband of her jeans, causing her belly to tremble.</p><p>When he\u2019d lapped up every drop, he sank his teeth into her sticky flesh, toeing that fine line between pleasure and pain, knowing just how much pressure she could stand.</p><p>White-hot desire lanced through her.</p><p>She\u2019d been rocking the seam of her jeans, which was directly in line with her clit, against the hardest part of him. The instant his teeth and tongue and hands and mouth came together, the throbbing between her legs synchronized and ignited an orgasm that left her gasping.</p><p>Once the ringing in her ears stopped, India realized the growling noise vibrating against her throat sounded suspiciously like a satisfied male chuckle.</p><p>Hey. How\u2019d she get off...track? She\u2019d meant to tease him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Make him lose control. So why did she have whipped cream smeared all over her chest and her sex was spasming?</p><p>Just lucky.</p><p>Time to spread the luck around.</p> <p>Colt scattered sticky kisses back to her lips and devoured her mouth. He tasted sweet and spicy and darkly male.</p><p>She used her teeth on his jawbone. Kissed his dimples. Blew in his ear until he shivered. \u201cTake off your sweats.\u201d</p><p>He went utterly still. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her tongue darted out and flicked his earlobe and he moaned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to squirt whipped cream all over your cock, Colt. I\u2019m going to lick and suck it off. Then I\u2019m going to suck you off. You\u2019re going to come in my mouth and I\u2019m going to swallow every creamy spurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny more questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>India grabbed the can, climbed off the chair and shut off the TV.</p><p>In record time, Colt\u2019s sweats and boxers sailed to the floor.</p><p>The little vixen trailed the fringed end of the dishtowel over his thighs and stomach. His flesh rolled beneath her touch and he recognized the power she had on him, body and soul.</p> <p>It was surprisingly sexy to give up control.</p><p>\u201cLast thing. Keep your hands on the armrest until I say otherwise. If I feel those mitts in my hair or on my face, I\u2019ll stop and tie them together with this towel. Understand?\u201d She snapped it once by his head for good measure.</p><p>Colt nodded. Damn. Was this domination stuff as much of a turn-on for her when he did it?</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d India dropped to her knees and scooted between his legs. She rubbed those soft breasts and pebbled nipples over the coarse hair on the inside of his thighs. \u201cThat feels good. Do you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes.\u201d</p><p>He went rigid as she studied him, as if deciding where to start.</p><p>The tip of his cock jerked. The thick vein running up the center pulsed; pearly liquid seeped out the purple head.</p><p>With an evil grin she put the nozzle at the base of his shaft and squirted a wide line straight up.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit! That\u2019s cold!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long.\u201d She bent her head and zigzagged her tongue up the length of his erection.</p><p>It took every ounce of control not to grab her head and force her mouth where he wanted it. Not to touch her while she was tormenting him.</p><p>She swirled more sweet stuff around the head of his cock. Then she sat back and admired her handiwork. \u201cMmm. Looks like a big mushroom, don\u2019t you think? And isn\u2019t it lucky I love mushrooms?\u201d</p><p>She daintily closed her lips over the rim where the cap met the shaft and sucked.</p><p>Colt\u2019s hips shot up, a reflex for her to take him all the way in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Not yet. I\u2019ve still got half a can of creamy goodness to mess with. You were the one who wanted to mess around, weren\u2019t you, Colt?\u201d</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>She tortured him. Fleeting licks from his balls to the twitching tip. Then she\u2019d suck him hard until the head hit the back of her throat. Bringing him to the edge again and again. Leaving him hanging there by a thread and then starting over. Hot mouth. Cool spray of whipped cream. The wet lap of her tongue.</p><p>His thighs clenched. His knuckles were white on the black armrest. He gritted his teeth. Sweat dripped from his temple. He didn\u2019t touch her. But he knew his eyes were absolutely wild and probably begging. Finally, he panted, \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>India smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a very good boy. You can touch me now.\u201d She curled her hand around the root and began to pump as her wet mouth moved up and down. Clasping her lips tightly as she released him from her mouth, opening her throat as his cock slid back in into that warm cavern. Creating a rhythm that made him pant and squirm.</p><p>Colt\u2019s hands cupped her face; his thumbs traced the center of her hollowed cheeks. Then his hips thrust higher.</p><p>\u201cFaster. Like that. Oh God, India. Don\u2019t stop. Oh Jesus. Oh fuck.\u201d He gripped her head as he erupted against the roof of her mouth. She sucked and he felt her jaw working as she swallowed and swallowed until he was fully spent.</p><p>After his cock quit throbbing and he could think again, he sank back into the recliner.</p><p>She stood.</p><p>Colt pulled her onto his lap. He aligned her back against the front of his body, hugging her tightly. \u201cWould it be lame if I said thank you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. That was...\u201d He sighed. \u201cWords fail me. I didn\u2019t invite you over, expecting that, India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I had such a fantastic time blowing your expectations all to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlowing me to heaven and back is more like it.\u201d</p><p>She released the catch on the recliner. When they were horizontal, she snuggled into him and whispered, \u201cAren\u2019t these cooking lessons going great? I think I\u2019m a natural.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Lovers Week Four</p><p>It was another crappy, boring day.</p><p>Damn rain meant India couldn\u2019t ride her bike. No tattoo customers had braved the lousy weather. No Sky Blue customers either. She\u2019d been stuck inside for four lousy days. She was sick of her own company.</p><p>You\u2019re sick of staying away from Colt.</p><p>True.</p><p>India kicked the door shut and bobbled the box of lavender soap when she saw him leaning against the doorjamb, looking pretty as you please. Dark hair tousled and damp from the wind and the rain. Stubble coating his jaw. Trouble in his eye.</p><p>Crap. She could never resist him when he looked all gorgeous and scowly.</p><p>Go on the offensive.</p><p>\u201cColt? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He patiently returned her cool stare. \u201cI\u2019m here to ask why I haven\u2019t seen you.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the soap on the counter and pointed to the boxes scattered around the showroom. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>Colt gave her that you\u2019re-full-of-shit eyebrow lift.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in Guernsey for two lousy days, India, two days in which I didn\u2019t hear from you once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, bucko, the phone lines run both ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Colt began to stalk her. \u201cI thought we were beyond this fightin\u2019 just so we can make up stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so fun.\u201d</p><p>He growled.</p><p>\u201cBesides, didn\u2019t we talk about not spending every waking minute together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked. I listened. And I disagreed.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s pulse doubled. He\u2019d used that matter-of-fact tone before he\u2019d stripped her, boosted her against the tile in his shower and screwed her until the water ran cold and her vocal cords shorted out from shouting his name in rapture.</p><p>Thinking about showering with him and experiencing his hot, naked male stamina is not helping you retain the upper hand, India.</p><p>Right. And she so had the upper hand when the man had her in full retreat until her spine hit the wall.</p><p>\u201cGot nothin\u2019 to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said tersely, slapping his hands on either side of her head. His mouth swooped down on hers in a kiss that wasn\u2019t gentle, wasn\u2019t meant to soothe, but to chastise. His mouth punished, forgave, and seduced\u2014all at the same time.</p><p>It was a kiss that smacked of ownership.</p><p>It was a kiss that knocked her for a loop.</p><p>It was a kiss that was four long days overdue.</p><p>After he\u2019d thoroughly scrambled her brain cells, Colt whispered, \u201cSweet Jesus, you piss me off sometimes, but I missed you, Indy. Come home with me tonight so I can show you how much.\u201d</p><p>She ducked under his arm. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Tell him the truth? Or lie?</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her time to decide. \u201cWhat? Are you sick of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d His gaze roamed over her. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>She huffed out a nervous stream of air. \u201cDammit, I got my period after that last time in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve been scarce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He looked utterly confused. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not usually a topic for discussion between men and women when they\u2019re first dating. Plus, I feel gross and I\u2019m not good company. I thought I\u2019d spare you.\u201d</p><p>Colt kissed her hard and quick. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I want to be with you no matter what your mood or what your hormones do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. We\u2019re way beyond the first dating stage, Indy, and don\u2019t pretend what\u2019s going on between us is only about sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, Mr. \u2018I Disagreed\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love getting nekkid with you.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cAll.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cThe.\u201d Another kiss.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d And another. \u201cTime.\u201d He grinned. \u201cBut I\u2019d be just as happy hangin\u2019 with you as bangin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow poetic, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am tryin\u2019 like the devil to get the shine back on my silver tongue.\u201d He fingered the gold hoop in her eyebrow. \u201cCome over anyway. You can sit on the couch with a heating pad and a bag of Hershey\u2019s Kisses. I\u2019ll even watch chick flicks with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you crave Hershey\u2019s Kisses that time of the month?</p><p>We\u2019ve been friends for almost three years. I\u2019ve noticed all your little quirks and your hormonal breakdowns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was too much of a gentleman to mention it. Now that I know you prefer my ungentlemanly ways...\u201d He brushed his mouth across the crown of her head. \u201cSometimes I think I know you better than you know yourself.\u201d</p><p>He was so damn sweet that she teared up. \u201cColt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now, none of that. I\u2019d rather you were throwing wrenches at me instead of crying.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She kissed his chin. \u201cI\u2019ll be over at seven. But I\u2019m warning you; in my hormonal state, I expect a lot of kisses. And chocolate for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar, I\u2019ll give you as many kisses as you can handle.\u201d</p><p>After an amazing week with India, didn\u2019t it figure his weekend started out crappy?</p> <p>Colt\u2019s morning had gone to shit after the engine on his four-wheeler blew up. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, he\u2019d gone to check cattle and found two dead cows and one dead calf that\u2019d been gnawed on by coyotes. Then he\u2019d sliced open his forearm on a piece of metal sheeting in the barn when his mother called demanding he show up for Sunday night supper. He spilled gas all over the floor in the garage and the fumes gave him an instant headache.</p><p>It was enough to drive a man to drink.</p><p>By the time he finished his daily chores and returned to the house well after dark, he needed a beer. Or a shot. Anything grain alcohol based.</p><p>Days like this, it flat-out amazed him he\u2019d passed the three-year mark without ingesting a single drop of booze.</p><p>India had left a message on his machine and on his cell phone and he ignored both. Pissy, testy, fighting the temptation of addiction; he wasn\u2019t fit for company.</p> <p>He needed a distraction. Driving into town and running on a treadmill at the gym didn\u2019t appeal to him. He was too wired to sit on his ass and watch TV or climb into bed and sleep it off. He wanted to hit something\u2014just not hit the bottle.</p><p>In the spare room he slipped on a pair of boxing shorts, his sparring gloves and circled the punching bag. Starting slow, he wanted to stretch out this beating and not tire himself out too quickly.</p><p>Right jab. Right jab. Left jab. Reverse the sequence.</p><p>He hit the bag over and over. Then he moved to the speed bag and pummeled it until he could scarcely hold his arms up. Only then did he take a breather. The workout mats were slick with sweat.</p><p>Colt\u2019s entire body was soaked, even his hair dripped. His eyes stung. The self-inflicted physical punishment usually helped him focus on one thing: not chugging beer until he passed out.</p><p>But tonight it didn\u2019t work.</p> <p>So, Colt began his workout again. By the time he\u2019d suffered through the third round, he\u2019d almost reached that level of an exercise high. He wanted to wallow in that feeling of invincibility.</p><p>Of strength. He spun around to rest his forearms on the weight bench bar and saw India leaning in the doorway, gawking at him.</p><p>No hello. No pleasantries. He tried to level his breathing and demanded, \u201cHow long have you been standin\u2019 there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough.\u201d</p><p>Goddamn, she looked good. She wore leggings the color of rich coffee and a floaty sheer pink tunic that hit her mid-thigh. No shoes. No makeup. No extra jewelry. No bra.</p><p>\u201cTell me, do you always beat on that thing so hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I\u2019ve had a lousy fuckin\u2019 day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen a bad one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have no idea how bad.\u201d</p><p>India crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Indy, I\u2019m in a piss-poor mood, I\u2019m shitty company, and I don\u2019t feel like makin\u2019 small talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I suggest we sit around and shoot the breeze?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But you oughta know I\u2019m feelin\u2019 a little mean, more than a little raw around the edges and I can\u2019t promise I wouldn\u2019t take it out on you, so it\u2019d be best if you went on home.\u201d Colt faced the heavy bag again. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see how this works. You can demand I buck up and spend time with you when I\u2019m a physical and emotional train wreck, but when you\u2019re having the same issues, I\u2019m just supposed to accept a pat on the head and go on my merry way like an obedient girlfriend? That sucks, Colt, and it\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>He ground his teeth together. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I needed a written invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, India. Will you just drop it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that.\u201d She stomped behind him. \u201cYou demanded complete honesty in this relationship and that includes both of us.</p><p>Which means you don\u2019t get to hide this side of yourself from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hidin\u2019 it from you for your own damn good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Do you turn into a werewolf or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fuckin\u2019 hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep cracking jokes until the crack of dawn because I\u2019m not going anywhere, McKay, so you might as well talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you; I don\u2019t wanna talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s fuck.\u201d</p><p>Colt wheeled around. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to fuck me either, because I ain\u2019t a nice guy right about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Even when I warn you haven\u2019t begun to see my aggressive side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo show me. I\u2019m a big girl. Maybe I like it rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re askin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re denying me. Or yourself.\u201d</p><p>He snarled. \u201cDon\u2019t push me.\u201d</p><p>India raised her chin. \u201cEven if I do, I know you won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll use you. Hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not using me if I\u2019m a willing participant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA willing participant? In rough sex? You\u2019re sure?\u201d Colt stalked her. \u201cI\u2019ll have you any way I want, as many times as I want, until I\u2019ve had my fill of your hot little body. You understand, once I start, I won\u2019t stop. Not even if you beg me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am begging you to let me be what you need. I don\u2019t know what that is unless you show me.\u201d</p><p>Just like that...Colt lost it. He didn\u2019t kiss her; he inhaled her.</p><p>The second he touched her, his cock inflated. His heart rate kicked up. He slid his hands over the curves of her hips, then hooked his thumbs in the waistband of her leggings and pulled them to her feet.</p><p>His finger traced the crack of her ass, past that tight pucker to the sticky slit of her pussy.</p><p>He ripped his mouth free. \u201cChrist. You\u2019re already wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what seeing you half-naked, sweaty, beating the shit out of a punching bag does to me.\u201d</p><p>His answer was a low growl as he yanked her shirt off. Colt dropped his boxing shorts and brought them both to the mat with India on the bottom and his hands beside her head.</p><p>Colt surged inside her. Pounding into that hot, pliant flesh.</p><p>Over and over. Harder and harder. Not kissing her. Not looking at her. Not touching her. Just fucking her.</p><p>India\u2019s legs circled his lower back as her hands spread across his upper back. Bringing him closer.</p><p>Thrust, thrust, then a grinding withdrawal.</p><p>So perfect. Her pussy was so smooth and wet and hot.</p><p>The mat was slippery with sweat. He was slippery with sweat.</p><p>Sandwiched between Colt and the mat, India became slippery with sweat and they scooted sideways.</p><p>Colt hardly noticed, he was so focused on getting to that point of no return, each stroke all the way in, then all the way back out.</p><p>Thrust, thrust, grind. Thrust, thrust, grind.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word, just raked her nails down his back and arched her hips hard. Colt knew her reactions well enough by now that he instinctively increased the side-to-side movement on every upstroke and downstroke.</p><p>That simple change set India off. She gasped, her cunt squeezed his cock like a vise and her nails gouged his ass with enough pressure she probably left bloody half-moon shapes on his skin.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care. He felt powerful. His balls lifted. He threw back his head, waiting for that pulsing rush to start so he could finish.</p><p>\u201cColt. Wait. No condom.\u201d</p><p>He finally looked at her. \u201cI know. Because I wanted to do this.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out, sat back on his knees and beat off. The roughness of the glove abrading his cock took him to that point between pleasure and pain. The muscles in his belly, his groin, his anus tightened. He shouted as spurts of his hot seed shot out, dotting her torso, marking her as his.</p><p>Spent, he sagged back to catch his breath. But only for a minute.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, India was still all stretched out before him. Waiting.</p><p>Colt ripped off the gloves with his teeth, scooted her down, tucking his knees in her armpits. He traced the outline of her full, beautiful lips with his thumb. \u201cNow you\u2019re gonna lick me clean.</p><p>Open wide.\u201d He leaned forward on his hands and fed his semi-hard cock into her mouth.</p><p>India moaned around the root of his shaft.</p><p>\u201cSee how good you taste on me?\u201d He pumped in and out of that wetness and suctioning heat until he was almost completely hard again. Then he pulled out. \u201cNow suck my balls. Get them wet.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were closed as she licked each one separately and blew across the dampness. Then she sucked both into her mouth and gently rolled them over her tongue.</p><p>Colt almost came when she released his nuts and her tongue ventured back to tickle the strip of skin in front of his anus.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He sat up and kissed her thoroughly before dragging her to her feet. \u201cBedroom. And there won\u2019t be any talkin\u2019 unless I say so, got it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>In his room, Colt stripped back the covers. \u201cGet in the middle of the bed on your hands and knees.\u201d He lit a candle on the dresser and grabbed the lube.</p><p>He moved into the space between her calves and ran his hands up the outside of her legs to her hips. He bent his head and tongued the tattoo on her right butt cheek.</p><p>India sucked in a quick breath.</p><p>Then he turned his head and tongued the tattoo on her left butt cheek.</p><p>Another hissing intake of air.</p><p>Colt flattened his tongue and dragged it up and down her spine, over the infinity symbol\u2014two long, twisted black lines\u2014a tattoo that started above her butt and ended at the gigantic butterfly spread between her shoulder blades. No traditional tramp stamp for his India. Her skin was a canvas; every marking on her was a work of art. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. So sexy. I could lap you up.\u201d Colt scooted beneath her. He curled his hands around her ass and pulled her pussy to his mouth, so she was sitting on his face. He licked her folds and suckled her pussy lips and fucked her entrance with his tongue. When she was whimpering and grinding her hips, he latched onto her clit and sucked until she screamed. And while India was still coming down from her orgasm, Colt slid out and licked her again. From her piercing to the pucker of her ass.</p><p>He painted that sweet rosette with his saliva. When she mewled cries and thrust her hips back, he spread her ass cheeks with his hands and thrust his tongue into that tight hole. Over and over.</p><p>Licking. Sucking. Making her loose and ready.</p><p>She softly whispered, \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>Colt kissed his way up the crack of her ass and her arched spine. His body covered hers and he pressed his forehead to her nape. \u201cYour ass is mine. No condom. I want you to feel every inch of me sliding into you. I want you to feel me coming inside you.\u201d</p><p>India made that mewling sound again.</p><p>He lubed up his fingers and scattered kisses across her shoulders as he prepared her. One finger. Then two scissoring inside her until she relaxed. Colt rolled her over on her back.</p><p>Her dark gaze stayed on his hand sliding up and down his hard cock as he applied lubrication.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go slow. At first. But we\u2019ll see how long it lasts once I\u2019m buried balls deep in your tight ass. Let me see that pretty pink pucker.\u201d</p><p>India brought her knees by her shoulders and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. I want you to watch me take you.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head the same time Colt put his hands under her ass and lifted her across his thighs.</p><p>Colt rubbed the wet head of his cock over that slippery rosette.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t clench.\u201d He pushed until the tip popped in through the ring of muscle.</p><p>Her breath hitched.</p><p>\u201cLet me in. Like that. Look at us, Indy. See how hot it is as I\u2019m pushin\u2019 inside you?\u201d Colt watched as his cock slid into her ass completely.</p><p>India clenched around him.</p><p>When he looked at her, she wore a smirk. Very carefully, he lowered his body over hers, not moving his cock, until they were nose to nose. Colt angled his head and kissed her. Sweetly, at first, then with heat. He began to thrust. \u201cEvery part of you belongs to me now.\u201d</p><p>She arched and canted her hips, pushing his shaft deeper as her pelvis sought contact with his.</p><p>Colt knew he wasn\u2019t going to last. Indy\u2019s ass would be sore no matter how hard or easy he fucked her, so his greedy male nature urged him to fuck her hard.</p><p>So he did.</p><p>She loved it.</p> <p>He pounded into her relentlessly, losing his mind when the friction of their groins sent her into a screaming orgasm. Her cunt and anal muscles contracted around his cock. Four deep, hard pumps and her body sucked his orgasm right out of him, as he shot inside that tight gripping channel.</p><p>Colt collapsed on her, kissing her neck, her mouth. Letting his cock soften before he withdrew. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d She twined her fingers in his hair. \u201cColt? I like that you showed me your rough side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because it\u2019s early and that was just round one.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Colt had been summoned to a Sunday night McKay family dinner and he\u2019d insisted on bringing India along. Which was why India\u2019s stomach was tied in knots as they pulled up to Carson and Carolyn\u2019s house.</p><p>The queasiness pissed her off. Why did she feel like a kid from the wrong side of the tracks being invited to the popular kid\u2019s birthday party?</p><p>She already knew Colt\u2019s family. Correction, she was friendly with the women who\u2019d married into the McKay family\u2014AJ and Macie. She\u2019d met Channing once or twice. Carolyn was a loyal Sky Blue customer. She\u2019d done tattoo work on Keely. But as far as really knowing them? Hell no.</p><p>Colt squeezed her hand. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d be fucking peachy keen if I was sucking down a fuzzy navel right about now. \u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno you seem...tense. Unlike yourself.\u201d His gaze moved from the high neckline of her long-sleeved blouse to the hem of her ankle-length suede skirt and red cowgirl boots.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just a little tired. You kept me up way too late last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that an objection?\u201d</p><p>She flashed back to how thoroughly he\u2019d claimed her, tamed her, proven to her his mastery over her body, proven he trusted her by showing her his dark, commanding, rough side without apology.</p><p>He\u2019d fucked her, one way or another, eight times last night. Her belly churned for an entirely different reason than nerves, but from pure lust. \u201cGod, no. Not at all. Were you worried I didn\u2019t enjoy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d The ragged edge of his thumb rubbed across her knuckles. \u201cI was rough. More than a little, and a lot out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ashamed?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI loved every second that you trusted me enough to let me lose control with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do trust you, Colt. Besides, if I hadn\u2019t liked it, I would\u2019ve told you. I\u2019m not exactly a shrinking violet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd thank God for that.\u201d He appeared to struggle with his next thoughts, so she jumped in and changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cDare I ask how many McKays are going to be in attendance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone in my immediate family. Ma decided to keep it simple.\u201d He scowled. \u201cI\u2019m sure Skylar told you how hard it is keepin\u2019 everyone straight with our extended family. And that ain\u2019t counting the West side.\u201d</p><p>India allowed a smirk. \u201cDoes that mean Blake isn\u2019t going to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity. I like him.\u201d</p><p>At Colt\u2019s half-snarl, India kissed the back of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when it comes to you, sugar. Lemme come around and help you out.\u201d</p><p>After he\u2019d opened the door, she said, \u201cI\u2019m capable of bailing out of this monster rig on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Maybe I wanna steal a kiss before we head into the lion\u2019s den.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good plan.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her close enough she felt his heartbeat against her chest. His kiss was surprisingly tender and soothing; she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d needed pacifying.</p><p>The sound of footsteps on gravel, then a loud, \u201cEww, gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, gross.\u201d</p><p>Colt eased back from the kiss. Once India\u2019s boots hit the ground, they faced the intruders.</p><p>Three boys. India recognized Kyler McKay and Thane McKay but not the last one with the same dark hair and blue eyes that ran in the McKay family.</p><p>\u201cUncle Colt, you were kissin\u2019 India?\u201d Kyler said in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Kyler, hi Thane,\u201d India said. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my nephew, Gib McKay, Colby and Channing\u2019s oldest boy. Gib, this is India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Gib.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia is your Aunt Skylar\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia also draws tattoos. Really cool ones. She has needles and ink and everything.\u201d Kyler frowned and touched her arm. \u201cHey, how come you covered up your tattoos? That snake is so awesome.\u201d</p><p>India resisted jerking her arm back.</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>She really resisted sticking her tongue out at him.</p><p>Kyler blurted, \u201cAre you gonna get married? Like Uncle Kade and Aunt Skylar done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You thinkin\u2019 of proposing to my girl if I don\u2019t get on the ball?\u201d Colt teased.</p><p>\u201cNo way! Girls are gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your mothers wouldn\u2019t appreciate that opinion. Or your Aunt Keely,\u201d Colt said dryly.</p><p>Kyler shot a nervous look over his shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019d kick our butts.\u201d</p><p>Colt rubbed his palm up her arm when she shivered. \u201cLet\u2019s all go inside. It\u2019s getting chilly out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go back in yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Kyler sighed. \u201cGrammy said we were bein\u2019 too wild and riling up the babies, so she sent us outside to run off some energy.\u201d He scrutinized Colt from his boots to his ballcap. \u201cYou wanna race to the end of the driveway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Gib said.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Thane added.</p><p>The knot in India\u2019s stomach tightened. Please don\u2019t make me walk in there by myself, Colt, please.</p><p>\u201cMaybe in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what all grownups say,\u201d Kyler grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHey, I never say no to you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you promised you\u2019d give us a chance to beat you.\u201d</p><p>Kyler\u2019s chest puffed up. \u201cI\u2019m faster than I was last time.\u201d</p><p>Colt turned to her and winked. \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He faced his nephews. \u201cBe prepared to get your butts whupped. On your mark. Get set\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gib jumped the gun.</p><p>Thane followed.</p><p>Kyler took the lead, whooping and hollering, with Colt running in fourth place behind the boys, taunting them.</p><p>India tried to imagine Colt at that age. Surrounded by brothers and cousins. All boyish charm and athletic grace. Did he have an uncle who\u2019d drop everything to race him?</p><p>Four shadows tore up the driveway. Colt lagged behind until the very end when he put on a last second burst of speed and beat them all.</p><p>His competitive streak evidently didn\u2019t allow his nephews to win. But they didn\u2019t mind. They were planning rematches, making big promises of defeat, and right then, India knew it wasn\u2019t about competition but about anticipation. For the boys and their uncle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wander off, guys. Stay right in front of the house, you hear?\u201d</p><p>Affirmative grunts.</p><p>Colt wasn\u2019t even breathing hard when he grabbed her hand and led her up the porch steps. \u201cYou\u2019re awful quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t talk all the time.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A blast of sound and heat hit her when the front door opened.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>\u201cCome on, it ain\u2019t that bad.\u201d He kissed the skin below her ear.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that was a total lie. But I promise not to desert you.\u201d</p> <p>The huge kitchen was filled with people. Big people, little people. Women. Men.</p><p>India half-expected everyone to turn and stare when she walked in, but no one noticed.</p><p>Finally Carolyn McKay looked up from an enormous steel pan on the cook stove. \u201cColton! Do you think you can steer your brothers and your father out of here so we can get supper done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Ma. Where do you want them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDining room. The table needs all the leaves.\u201d</p> <p>Colt squeezed India\u2019s hand and approached the group in the corner.</p><p>Macie descended on her. \u201cIndia Ellison, you little devil. So, you and Colt are a couple, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, for one, am not surprised,\u201d AJ said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d make one of us,\u201d India said under her breath.</p><p>\u201cOh pooh, you guys spend all your time together and have forever. It was only a matter of time before you realized...\u201d AJ</p><p>waggled her eyebrows. \u201cThe friends to lovers angle is so romantic.\u201d</p> <p>India\u2019s face heated. Colt\u2019s mother was right over by the sink.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure we\u2019re...?\u201d</p><p>AJ laughed. Macie laughed. Channing laughed. Hell, even Carolyn had a grin on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Keely came from behind her and wrapped an arm around her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re sure, because Colt is a McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll McKay men are...territorial,\u201d AJ said.</p><p>\u201cYou mean virile,\u201d Macie corrected.</p><p>\u201cVery virile,\u201d Carolyn agreed.</p> <p>\u201cEww. Mom! TMI!\u201d Keely said.</p><p>Carolyn flapped a towel at her. \u201cOh, your poor virgin ears, Miz McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgin?\u201d AJ sputtered.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget fertile,\u201d Macie said, rubbing her belly.</p><p>Channing added, \u201cYes, very fertile.\u201d</p><p>All eyes zoomed to AJ. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to add anything to the \u2018fertile\u2019 pile?\u201d Macie said sweetly.</p><p>AJ\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cHe told his brothers? Already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCord told everyone already,\u201d Keely said wryly.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m like, barely a month along!\u201d</p><p>A dark-haired blur rammed into Channing\u2019s legs. \u201cMama!\u201d</p><p>Channing bent to grab him but Keely intercepted. \u201cHuh-uh.</p><p>This ain\u2019t your first rodeo, Chan. You know you\u2019re not supposed to pick up Braxton or Gib when you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d The boy squirmed toward Channing.</p><p>Keely passed him over. \u201cBraxton, you are off the list as my favorite nephew. Where\u2019s Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kyler took Gib and Thane outside, thank goodness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you at least try and have a girl, AJ? Five nephews with two more on the way is a bit too much testosterone in this already testosterone-laden family.\u201d Keely shot India a sly look. \u201cIndia has three darling little nieces to spoil and play dolls with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEliza would much rather throw rocks than throw a tea party,\u201d</p><p>India said.</p><p>\u201cThat, I have to see.\u201d When Keely sighed and ran a hand through her hair, India noticed Keely looked really tired. Distracted.</p><p>Not her usual full of mischief self.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Kade and Sky would love it if you came over, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Because of my travel schedule I haven\u2019t been home enough in the last year and it looks to be worse next year. I\u2019ve only seen those sweet twins a couple times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are sweet. And not sweet. Thank God Colt came over and helped me take care of them when Kade and Sky went out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the girls adore him. He\u2019s so awesome with them even when I was pulling my hair out within six hours.\u201d</p><p>Everyone turned and stared at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Channing said carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s just, well, we\u2019re surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what? Colt is amazing with kids. All kids. He helped me out at the community center, and I know he\u2019s looking forward to being around Chassie\u2019s baby.\u201d</p><p>AJ, Channing and Macie glanced away. Carolyn gave her a curious look.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t surprise me Colt is great with kids,\u201d Keely said cheerfully. \u201cHe spoiled me rotten when I was growing up. He\u2019s always been my favorite brother.\u201d</p><p>Pause.</p><p>Keely ducked as her sisters-in-law threw things at her. \u201cI know when I\u2019m not wanted.\u201d She snuck out the side door.</p><p>\u201cShe just wants to go drink beer with the boys,\u201d AJ said.</p><p>\u201cSome things never change.\u201d</p><p>The women chatted amongst themselves. India listened, but didn\u2019t contribute much, either verbally or with dinner preparations.</p><p>She felt like a fifth wheel.</p><p>India wanted a drink something fierce. Stressful times like this made the crutch of alcohol more appealing.</p><p>Just one wouldn\u2019t hurt you.</p><p>She peeked around the corner of the living room, looking for Colt. He held a sleeping toddler on his lap and was in deep conversation with Carter. Cord, Colby, Keely and Carson were congregated by the bay windows drinking beer.</p><p>A half-empty beer bottle sat on the sofa table.</p><p>A sense of urgency, a need to flee swamped her. She wouldn\u2019t be missed if she snuck outside for a breath of fresh air.</p><p>No one would miss that bottle. No one would know if you had a little nip of liquid courage. No one would blame you.</p><p>India told the voice to shut up and practically ran outside.</p><p>Kyler, Thane and Gib were racing in front of the porch, playing hide and seek between the pickups. The night air had become chilly and she shivered, wishing she\u2019d worn a coat.</p><p>The McKay family dynamics weren\u2019t different from other families. Yet, she had a hard time figuring out where Colt fit in.</p><p>With two older brothers and two younger brothers, he could almost be considered the middle child.</p><p>The invisible child. The pleaser. The intermediary.</p><p>But according to the way Colt described himself, he was the rebel, the bad seed, the black sheep, even before he\u2019d become an alcoholic.</p><p>India didn\u2019t see him that way. And after spending just a short amount of time with his family, she wondered if any one of them saw Colt at all. The real Colt. The man she saw. Or did they still see him as Colt, the drunk? Colt, the charming womanizer? Colt, the screw up?</p><p>Didn\u2019t they see the man with the big heart? The quiet, contemplative man who\u2019d learned from his mistakes? The sweet man? The helpful man? The man who dropped everything to run a race with his nephews? A man who helped out at the community center with kids he didn\u2019t know, as eagerly as he\u2019d volunteered to help out with his own family\u2019s kids whenever he was asked?</p><p>Colt would be a wonderful father. Involved. Caring. Loving.</p><p>And not for the first time did she think he\u2019d make an even better husband.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha thinking about so hard?\u201d</p><p>She jumped at the sound of Cam\u2019s soft drawl drifting to her from the right side of the porch. \u201cCam. I didn\u2019t know you were out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou enjoy sneaking up on people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHabit. Although, I\u2019ll point out I didn\u2019t sneak. I was already here when you snuck out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when did you slink away, deputy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as humanly possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d It was weird having a conversation with someone she couldn\u2019t see. Almost like he was a ghost. Or she was in a confessional.</p><p>\u201cMy older brothers are pissed off at me for some things I said.</p><p>Dad ain\u2019t bein\u2019 real friendly either. I ain\u2019t about to apologize. If pesky Keely wouldn\u2019t have forced me to come by showing up on my doorstep, I wouldn\u2019t even be here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are still fighting? That happened a couple weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the same night I called Colt to help me with Sky and Kade\u2019s girls. I knew he was upset but he didn\u2019t get into specifics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as well.\u201d</p><p>Kyler, Thane and Gib ran inside.</p><p>The sound of sloshing liquid drifted to her. India recognized the sound of a half-empty bottle of booze and her mouth watered.</p><p>\u201cSo you never answered my question, India. What\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m contemplating my place in the universe. Or my navel.</p><p>Take your pick. They seem to be one in the same these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I needed a second to clear my head because it is overwhelming. What are you out here thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a trained soldier. It isn\u2019t my job to think. It\u2019s my job to do what I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you went into law enforcement? Just another set of orders to follow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. You have to admit...the uniforms are sexy as shit.\u201d</p><p>India laughed. \u201cAnd every woman loves a man in uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoves. Right.\u201d</p><p>Rather than quiz him on why he was so determined to keep Domini at arms length, she asked, \u201cDo you miss being a soldier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d More sloshing liquid. \u201cAnd no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that cleared things up a whole bunch for me, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s chuckle wasn\u2019t particularly pleasant. \u201cWelcome to my world.\u201d</p><p>She shivered as much from his tone as the temperature.</p><p>\u201cYou want my coat?\u201d</p><p>I want a drink of whatever you\u2019re having.</p><p>\u201cNo. Thanks, though. I should head back inside. Probably time to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll come looking for us. Or maybe I oughta say Colt will come looking for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound too happy about that prospect.\u201d India faced him, or where she thought he might be lurking. \u201cIn fact, several times, like at the basketball game, you\u2019ve questioned whether I should be with Colt because he ends up injured around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for snapping, I was on edge about Domini\u2019s situation that night.\u201d Pause. \u201cBesides, why would you give a shit what I say or what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But if you think Colt doesn\u2019t listen to you or care about what you say or what you think, you\u2019re an idiot, Deputy McKay.\u201d</p><p>She could tell that statement caught him off guard. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t torpedo the first decent relationship Colt\u2019s ever had, India. Far from it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough, you drive that motorcycle too damn fast.\u201d</p><p>India flashed him a cheeky smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to catch me first to prove that, copper.\u201d</p><p>Cam laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re keeping your torpedo launcher away from me...because you think I\u2019m gonna keep Colt on the straight and narrow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s Colt\u2019s responsibility to stay on the straight and narrow, not yours. Despite the fact you two wage war over the dumbest shit, and fight just so you can make up, you\u2019re good for him. You\u2019re a good person, Indy. A lot of the people in his past haven\u2019t been, including some people in his family. He deserves a woman who understands him. Who sees his past and doesn\u2019t judge him for it. Who sees him as the man he is now, not who he used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen. Maybe you oughta share that insight with your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve tried.\u201d</p><p>The porch door banged and Colt stepped out. \u201cHey. What\u2019re you doin\u2019 out here without a coat on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t out Cam. If he wanted to pipe up, that was his business. \u201cIt got a little stuffy in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that. You okay?\u201d</p> <p>No. I could use a big, stiff drink. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Come on, supper\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Of course.</p><p>She\u2019d never admit a fallacy. Instead, she\u2019d just slap on a happy face even if she was bleeding on the inside.</p><p>India was like that in A.A. too. Willing to deal with other people\u2019s issues, while skirting her own. Did she ever feel...overwhelmed? Did she ever have that urge to drink until she passed out?</p><p>Probably not. Of all the people Colt knew, India seemed to have the addiction thing whipped. She had total control of her demons and some days he wished he was as confident in his sobriety as she was.</p><p>No one noticed India\u2019s quiet demeanor at the supper table. She smiled. Laughed in all the right places but that restrained laughter never reached her eyes.</p><p>The only time a portion of the mask slipped was when she watched his nephews. A wistful look would soften her features. The same look she got watching her nieces. But if Colt let on he\u2019d noticed? He knew her back would snap straight. Directly followed by a determined lifting of that elfin chin.</p> <p>It drove him insane she had to act so freakin\u2019 tough all the time when he knew she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>When the kids began to get restless and whiny, Colt took it as a sign for them to leave.</p><p>After five minutes of silence cruising down the gravel road, he said, \u201cSorry you had a sucky time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a sucky time. Why\u2019d you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were awful quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of hard to get a word in edgewise with your family, so you can hardly blame me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlame you? For what?\u201d Colt slammed on the brakes and threw it into park in the middle of the gravel road. \u201cFor Christsake, India, will you at least be honest with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! Do you mind giving warning next time so I can brace myself for whiplash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, I was just thinkin\u2019 the neckline on that shirt makes it look like you\u2019re already wearing a neck brace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you critique my clothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did you start dressing like my mother?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cOmigod. You are such an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does that make me an ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s none of your goddamn business what I wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? So tell me. Why did you wear a long-sleeved shirt?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a stony stare. \u201cBecause it\u2019s October, Einstein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He let his gaze focus on her nose, then her eyebrow, her ears and finally her breasts. \u201cBut where are your hoops? And studs? Why\u2019d you take all of your piercings out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wear them all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about. Were you tryin\u2019 to look more acceptable to my family?\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s defiant posture said it all.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you give a damn what my family thinks about your tattoos, piercings and funky clothes, India? I don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t take you there so you could change who you are to please them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you take me there?\u201d</p><p>Because you\u2019re mine. Because I wanted everyone to see that I\u2019m worthy of love from an amazing woman like you. \u201cTo please myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo please yourself? Jesus. You are such an asshat, jerkwad...fuckface!\u201d India jumped out of the cab and slammed the door with enough force the whole truck vibrated.</p><p>She\u2019d gone beyond calling him a dickhead in a helluva hurry.</p><p>And now she was hurrying away from him.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, India! Get back in here.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear her response but he did see her flip him off in the glow of the headlights as she walked down the middle of the road.</p><p>Colt climbed out and chased after her. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not done talkin\u2019 to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit, I am done talking to you.\u201d</p><p>She kept walking.</p><p>He kept fuming. \u201cJust get back in the truck, India, this is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>India whirled around. \u201cYou know what\u2019s ridiculous? That I actually tried. I actually put forth an effort to be\u2014how\u2019d you put it?\u2014more acceptable to your family. And to what end? It isn\u2019t me that they aren\u2019t seeing clearly, Colt, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve shown up, painted fucking purple, with yellow feathers in my hair, wearing a slave choker and chain and it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference. I\u2019m not the one who needs to make the effort because I know who you are. They don\u2019t. It pisses me off.\u201d She flounced off again.</p><p>She was upset. For him? Because his family didn\u2019t understand him like she did?</p><p>\u201cIndy, wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m too mad to deal with you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t walk home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>Each twitch of her sexy little ass was like fuel on the fire. He wanted her. Now.</p><p>So Colt started after her. He caught her in about fifteen steps and picked her up, throwing her over his shoulder.</p><p>She kicked and screeched but he held onto the back of her legs as he spun around and headed back to the pickup.</p><p>\u201cLet me down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I-I\u2019ll bite you in the ass, McKay, I\u2019m not kidding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bite you back. And you already know how much I like your ass.\u201d</p><p>She screamed with frustration, pummeling her fists into his butt.</p><p>By the time they\u2019d reached the truck, she\u2019d quit flailing. She had a tight grip on his belt loops. \u201cAre you gonna run if I put you down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Colt slid his hands up to brace her back as he lowered her feet to the ground. \u201cSugar, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She was breathing raggedly, more out of anger than exertion.</p><p>Her head fell back.</p><p>Their eyes met. And Colt was lost.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus, India, when you look at me like that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Like you love me. Like I\u2019m a man worthy of you.</p><p>But he suspected she didn\u2019t know everything he\u2019d ever wanted was visible in her eyes. So he backtracked\u2014chickened out really\u2014and focused on the one thing she would admit to: overpowering lust.</p><p>\u201cLike you want to fight me and then fuck me.\u201d</p><p>India didn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cAre we done with the fightin\u2019 portion? Cause I\u2019d sure like to fuck you. Right here, right now. Against the dirty truck as you\u2019re shootin\u2019 me dirty looks.\u201d</p><p>Her response? She launched herself at him. Her mouth slammed into his in a kiss so raw it felt as if she\u2019d knocked the wind out of him.</p><p>Colt pushed her against the pickup. His hands raced everywhere as he tried to find a single section of her skin. Dammit, of all the times to be buttoned-up. He hooked his fingers at the hem of her shirt, between the lapels, and jerked until buttons flew and her warm flesh greeted his eager hands.</p><p>India didn\u2019t protest, in fact, ruining her shirt only made her kiss him harder. Her hands dove into his hair. Not for a leisurely, tender stroking, but she pulled his hair into tight fists as her lower body ground against his fly.</p><p>Goddamn he wanted to suck on her skin. Mark her. Bite her, but the ferocity of the kiss made it impossible for him to release her lips even momentarily. He growled in her mouth, bumping his cock into her belly. His hands scraped up her back, maneuvering around to cup her breasts. When his thumbs rasped over her nipples, he didn\u2019t feel the rings.</p><p>When he broke his mouth free and he ate a path down her throat, she arched, baring all to him. One tug and her bra cups opened. Rather than look, he let his mouth do the walking, straight to her left nipple.</p><p>Yes. A ring. A smaller one than what she\u2019d been wearing, but she hadn\u2019t taken it out in a fit of propriety. He sucked and lapped and bit and worshiped that tiny bit of metal until she moaned. He suckled her breast deep enough the ring tickled the back of his tongue. Another moan escaped as he switched to the other side and did it again and again and again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cColt. I need...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. I need you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>His cock, already straining behind his zipper, jerked when India\u2019s hands dropped to his waistband. She unhooked the belt buckle, popped the button and eased down the zipper. Her fingers snaked into his boxers and she circled her hand around him and squeezed.</p><p>Colt hissed at the intense pleasure. Feeling the velvety smoothness of her palm on his shaft. The tightness of her grip as she stroked from the base to the wet tip.</p><p>\u201cLift me against the door. You wanted to fuck me so bad, do it.</p><p>Like you mean it.\u201d</p> <p>With her hand commanding his cock he couldn\u2019t remember why this wasn\u2019t the best idea ever...wait. \u201cCondom,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo fucking what? You didn\u2019t use a condom last night when you came on my belly. Or in my ass.\u201d India teased his ear with her hot breath. \u201cI want to feel that heat in my cunt. I want to feel your cock sliding and pounding inside me without latex. Your wetness mixed with mine. Just hardness and heat. Just you, Colt.\u201d</p><p>Like he could deny her that.</p><p>Like you could deny yourself that.</p><p>He yanked his jeans below his knees. Then he boosted her up, fighting with the material of her skirt until it bunched at her waist.</p> <p>\u201cHelp me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She wrapped her legs around his hips and pulled her thong to the side. \u201cI\u2019m ready. Please. Colt. Now.\u201d</p><p>Colt bent his knees and drove deep in a single thrust.</p><p>India dug her fingernails into his shoulders. \u201cAgain. Hard like that again.\u201d</p><p>His slow withdrawal only made the hard, fast plunge more rewarding. Again. And again. Over and over.</p><p>No kissing. He\u2019d crack her teeth if he put his mouth on hers.</p><p>He lived in the moment, the feel of her hot pussy tightening with every stroke. The sharp bite of her nails through his shirt. Her irregular breathing fanning his cheek. The earthy scent of his lover filling his lungs as he filled her body with his.</p><p>She drummed her heels into his butt. \u201cDo that little grinding thing. Like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, India. Come on my cock. Lemme feel those sweet pussy muscles tightening around my dick as you\u2019re comin\u2019 hard.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a handful of hair and yanked, moving her head to where wanted so he could bury his lips in her neck. Nuzzled and licked the hot spot that\u2019d send her into orbit.</p><p>\u201cOh! Yes.\u201d India gasped. Her pelvis canted closer as she arched her lower back and her knees squeezed his hips. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.</p><p>Oh God, Colt, please don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t move his mouth. He kept his rhythm uniform, and clenched his ass cheeks as he fought off his own climax. The second her body relaxed, he hammered into her. Losing his mind in the slickness of her pussy, her whimpers burning his ear and how fucking fantastic, how perfect it felt to have his come filling her up.</p><p>After the last pulse, he reconnected with her mouth and kissed her with the gentleness his body had lacked.</p><p>He kept kissing her. She kept letting him. He tried to convey that being with her was everything. Everything. He loved her with his heart, his soul, his mind, his body. And being half-naked, against his dirt-coated pickup, in the middle of nowhere Wyoming, after he\u2019d fucked her mindless, was just icing on the cake.</p><p>India retreated to brush soft kisses over his cheeks, and his temple, his forehead, his eyebrows, his eyelids. All the while her hands stroked his shoulders and his chest and his neck. As if she was trying to convey the same thing to him.</p><p>The moment was perfect.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Lulled by the sound of the wheels clacking on the pavement and Colt\u2019s presence beside her, India fell asleep.</p><p>The next thing she knew, Colt gently shook her awake. \u201cHey.</p><p>Come on, sleepyhead.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and realized they weren\u2019t at Colt\u2019s place but hers.</p><p>\u201cI thought we were going to your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired and yours was closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t appear Colt was going to get out of the truck. Was he sick of her company and just dropping her off?</p><p>Or maybe he\u2019s waiting for an invitation.</p><p>India laid her head on his arm. \u201cYou coming in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I\u2019d like you to spend the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to get up early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t care. I just want you with me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head and parked.</p><p>They held hands as they climbed the stairs. Colt\u2019s quietness was unnerving. Not because he chatted nonstop, but something was wrong.</p><p>India led him into her bedroom. She stopped at the side of the bed and faced him. Sliding her arms round his waist, she rested her cheek against his chest.</p><p>He sighed and seemed to sag against her.</p><p>They embraced for long time.</p><p>\u201cYou tired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Maybe we should crawl in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d He disentangled himself and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cSit. I\u2019ll help you get your boots off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m capable of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feet probably smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Sit.\u201d She gave him a little push. She grabbed the heel end of his right boot and tugged. It slipped free so fast she lost her balance.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta let me do it.\u201d</p><p>She tossed the boot by the door. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Then she grabbed his left heel. The boot slid free easily. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve done the hard part, I\u2019ll let you get the rest.\u201d</p><p>Colt shucked his clothes while she did the same. She rolled down the covers and turned off the light. They crawled in their respective sides.</p><p>It was all very orderly.</p><p>India cuddled up against Colt\u2019s naked back. \u201cYou\u2019re warm.</p><p>Mmm. It\u2019s like having my own electric blanket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting cold at night. Probably need that electric blanket soon.\u201d</p><p>Now they were talking about the weather in bed. She waited a minute, but he didn\u2019t draw her into his arms like he did whenever she slept in his bed. She scooted up and placed her chin on his shoulder. \u201cColt, what\u2019s the matter? And don\u2019t tell me nothing.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cDid I embarrass you at your parents\u2019 house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to try and pretend you\u2019re acting normal right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd fuckin\u2019 you up against my truck in the middle of the goddamn road is normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Jesus, India, I ripped your damn shirt. I pulled your hair, for Christsake. How can you even want me next to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, McKay. I could\u2019ve said no at any point and you would\u2019ve stopped. Don\u2019t you doubt for a second that I didn\u2019t enjoy every second.\u201d She put her mouth next to his ear. \u201cAnd you told me you hated that shirt anyway, so no big loss.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly.</p><p>She moved so she could roll him on his back. She brushed the hair from his forehead. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have asked you to stay if I didn\u2019t want you here next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because I love you. Now was not the time for that confession.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been so rough with you. Last night. And now tonight.\u201d</p><p>Colt angled his head and kissed the inside of her wrist. \u201cYou deserve...\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t finish, India said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTenderness.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cI can give you passion, but I\u2019ve never given you...\u201d</p><p>He had given her softness and gentleness; he just hadn\u2019t realized that\u2019s what it was. But here was the opportunity she\u2019d wanted to show him her softer side. \u201cThen let me give you tenderness, Colt.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cLet me give you sweetness. Let me make love to you.\u201d Let me show you how much I love you, Colt McKay.</p><p>\u201cIndy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She traced the outline of his jaw. \u201cIf you hate it, I promise I\u2019ll let you fuck me as hard and raw as you want.\u201d</p><p>He managed a smile.</p><p>India threw a leg over his hip and straddled his belly. She reached up and knocked the pillows to the floor. \u201cThere. Now I have room to work.\u201d She set her hands by his head on the mattress.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He did.</p><p>She pressed a soft kiss on his lips. And another. And another, until there was no break and they were kissing nonstop. Not frantically, unhurriedly. She eased back, latching onto his wrists and moved his arms up above his head so she could run her fingers across the muscles of his biceps, triceps, and forearms. Touching him, feeling his cock jerk against her butt made her all the more determined to go slow.</p><p>India slid her lips down, flicking her tongue over the sexy dimple in his chin, trailing openmouthed kisses over his neck, past the hollow of his throat, between his pecs. She let her mouth follow the curve until the pebbled nipple brushed her lips.</p><p>Colt hissed.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said, lapping at the flat disk. She blew across the wetness and worried the pointed tip between her teeth. She switched back and forth between the two nipples until his upper body arched into her from the attention.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not spending so much time licking and kissing me there because you\u2019re secretly measuring me for a tattoo?\u201d</p><p>Her chuckle against that sensitive flesh brought another groan from him.</p><p>\u201cYou have nice nipples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What makes them nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig. Round.\u201d India\u2019s tongue drew a full circle. \u201cNot much hair. A pretty color. Brownish-red, but not too much red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m askin\u2019 this, but nipple color matters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Some guys\u2019 nipples are ugly. They\u2019re too small or centered weird on their chest. Or eww, they\u2019re buried beneath too much chest hair. Yours\u2014\u201d she watched his eyes as she tongued the tip, \u201c\u2014are perfect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGlad you think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sensitive too. I know you love it when I do this.\u201d India sucked the whole nipple into her mouth.</p><p>He groaned.</p> <p>India kissed and nuzzled every inch of his chest. Enjoying the chance to take pleasure in his body, not just his cock. She gave him credit; he left his arms above his head and didn\u2019t attempt to seize control.</p><p>Good behavior should be rewarded.</p><p>She wrapped her fingers around his shaft and slid her hips down his belly until they were groin to groin. She pressed her lips to his as all that male hardness slipped inside her on a slow, sweet glide.</p><p>A sighing moan filled her mouth, but Colt didn\u2019t attempt to break the kiss. India followed the contours of his arms and clasped their hands together, stretching her upper body completely across his.</p><p>She rocked on him, only allowing his shaft to withdraw halfway on each downstroke. Once he was buried balls deep, she\u2019d rub side to side, loving the combination of the rasp of his pubic hair over her clit and the piercing.</p> <p>It was a level of sexual comfort and closeness she\u2019d never experienced, the heat of Colt\u2019s body beneath hers, the fullness of his rigid sex filling her. The scents of sex and his cologne and her lotion mixed together. Hearing their stuttered breaths, at times in unison, at times staggered, and the whisper of rough skin on soft.</p><p>Colt finally broke his lips free. His neck arched and his fingers tightened around hers. \u201cSo close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Let me take you there.\u201d She trailed kisses down the arc of his neck and sucked on the spot between his collarbone and throat that brought his swift intake of breath. His hips pumped in a steady rhythm. He whispered her name as his cock jerked inside her, bursts of heat bathed her vaginal walls.</p><p>Her inner muscles started to spasm in time to the pulse pounding in her clit and she clenched those muscles around his cock, trying to prolong their pleasure.</p><p>He muttered, urging her to tip her head up so he could fasten his mouth to hers. God, she loved kissing him. Absolutely freakin\u2019 loved the give and take of their kisses, sometimes passionate, sometimes flirty, sometimes sweet, but always with an edge of heat.</p><p>She released their joined hands and pushed up. \u201cSo? Did you hate that sweet, sweet lovin\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou even have to ask?\u201d His hands roamed up and down her back, from her shoulders to her ass. \u201cYou and me nekkid is always spectacular, but that felt like we were...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnected on a different level.\u201d He paused, in speech and movement. \u201cDid you feel it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His hands landed on her hips and he rolled with her, laughing at her surprised squeak as she looked up at him. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve shown me sweet, sweet lovin\u2019, I might give the gentle approach a shot next time.\u201d</p><p>His tenderness would be her undoing.</p><p>Colt buried his lips in her neck, sending goose bumps dancing across her skin. \u201cIndy. I...\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t handle a confession from him. \u201cSnuggle me up, cowboy. I\u2019m cold and tired and it\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p> <p>Colt was gone by the time India woke up the next morning. No note, no anything. He hadn\u2019t even made coffee. She started the coffeepot and detoured to the bathroom.</p><p>When India grabbed a towel to shower, she dislodged the</p><p>\u201cmonthly\u201d calendar she\u2019d shoved between the stacks.</p><p>Since she\u2019d sobered up and since her mother\u2019s death from ovarian cancer, and her sister\u2019s accidental pregnancy, she\u2019d kept track of her period and other women\u2019s issues on a separate calendar in the bathroom.</p><p>Her gaze zeroed in on the big red X\u2019s. She counted forward.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>They\u2019d had unprotected sex at her most fertile time.</p><p>Twice last night alone. Once the night before when he\u2019d pulled out at the last minute.</p><p>Dammit. What if she\u2019d gotten pregnant? She unclipped the pen attached to the top and used it to mark off days. They\u2019d had sex a lot to make up for the five days she\u2019d had her period.</p><p>India freaked out. She counted again. No mistake. She jumped up and ran into the living room so she had more room to pace and freak out.</p><p>This was not happening. Not happening.</p><p>God. What\u2019d she been thinking? How could she\u2019ve been so stupid? So irresponsible?</p><p>It takes two to tango.</p><p>Colt had brought up the condom issue right before he fucked her against the truck. She\u2019d been so...intent on having him in his riled up state, all sexy and masculine and needy that she hadn\u2019t been thinking clearly. Just like he hadn\u2019t been thinking clearly the night before when he\u2019d used the withdrawal method.</p><p>Still, they both knew better. Especially since her sister and his cousin had an unplanned pregnancy due to a moment of recklessness.</p><p>But hadn\u2019t Skylar and Kade turned that oops into a happily-ever-after?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>So had she subconsciously wanted to get pregnant?</p><p>No. She wouldn\u2019t do that to Colt. She loved him. She couldn\u2019t wait to tell him how much she loved him. But she didn\u2019t want to start the conversation with, \u201cThese last six weeks have been the best of my life and I love you like crazy...and speaking of crazy, guess what? I\u2019m pregnant!\u201d</p><p>The poor guy had no choice but to marry her. Seems that\u2019s how the Ellison women find husbands; they trap them by getting knocked up.</p><p>Colt had suffered through enough gossip.</p><p>India sat on the floor and tried to come up with a workable plan. She had two days left of her most fertile time. If she could avoid Colt, she could avoid sex.</p><p>Isn\u2019t that a bit like closing the barn door after the cows get out?</p><p>Yes, but it was the only option that made sense\u2014even when it made no sense.</p><p>Late the next morning, Colt was standing outside shooting the breeze with Trevor and Edgard after they\u2019d sorted cattle for the upcoming sale. \u201cChass said Carolyn called a McKay family supper last night?\u201d</p><p>Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cI think you mean a summons,\u201d Colt said dryly.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d that go? You took India, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It went fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It ain\u2019t like Indy\u2019s a stranger to anyone in the family.\u201d</p><p>Although she had dressed and acted like one, Colt figured India wouldn\u2019t appreciate him sharing that tidbit.</p><p>Edgard and Trevor exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess Chass was worried how it played out, bein\u2019s half of ya\u2019ll ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 since Cam blew up at your brothers and Carson a few weeks back.\u201d</p><p>Colt sipped his coffee. \u201cSeems Cam\u2019s been avoiding everyone in the family, \u2019cept for me. So yeah, conversation at the dinner table was subdued. But there was enough babies cryin\u2019 that we all pretended we didn\u2019t notice the strain.\u201d</p><p>Trevor said, \u201cWhat the hell did Cam say that pissed everyone off anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChassie doesn\u2019t know,\u201d Edgard said. \u201cIt\u2019s driving her crazy, which means...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sent you two to get the dirt.\u201d</p><p>Edgard grinned. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are such suckers,\u201d Colt scoffed.</p><p>\u201cOh, she ain\u2019t gettin\u2019 the family dirt for free,\u201d Trevor added.</p><p>\u201cMe\u2019n Ed have her repayment choices all planned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet you do.\u201d Colt never would\u2019ve thought his sweet little cousin would be living openly with two men. At first, Colt had suspected Chassie\u2019s intimate relationship with Edgard came about only because of Trevor\u2019s need for a sexual relationship with his former rodeo partner. Colt\u2019d worried Chassie would do anything to keep her husband happy, including welcoming an old lover into their lives and their bed. Not that Chassie discussed Trevor and Edgard\u2019s past, but it was obvious to him how the two men felt about each other. Yet, the more time Colt spent with the trio, the more he realized they were all truly happy together, and in his mind, that was what mattered.</p><p>\u201cSpill the family beans, cuz,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>So Colt did.</p><p>When he finished, Edgard whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s harsh, man. Does that mean things aren\u2019t back to normal between you guys?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDefine normal. It\u2019s about the same as it was before. We\u2019re in the slow season so it ain\u2019t like I gotta see them everyday, which is probably a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s India\u2019s take on it?\u201d Trevor asked. \u201cEven though you just started datin\u2019, you two\u2019ve been friends for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia agrees with Cam. In fact, we had a huge fight about it last night after the family dinner.\u201d He told them an abbreviated version of what she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be wise to keep her. She\u2019s a smart one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo argument from me,\u201d Colt said. \u201cI know Cam will come around and clear things up with Cord and Colby when he\u2019s ready.</p><p>He\u2019s stubborn, but he ain\u2019t the type to hold a grudge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. My resentment and Cord and Colby\u2019s distrust of me has been going on for years. Workin\u2019 my ass off like I used to before I hit the bottle regularly ain\u2019t changed their opinion of me.</p><p>I\u2019m at a loss on how to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t your responsibility to fix it. Sure, Colby and me go way back, but that don\u2019t mean I agree with everything he\u2019s ever done. He and Cord\u2019ve been outta line toward you for a helluva long time, Colt, so in my opinion, they need to do a little groveling, not you,\u201d</p><p>Trevor said.</p><p>Edgard put his hand on Trevor\u2019s shoulder and shoved him sideways. \u201cWay to be compassionate, Trev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all families love to be shitty to each other like ours did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you suggest Colt does, Dr. Phil?\u201d</p><p>Colt saw the playfulness and how Trevor didn\u2019t attempt to shake off Edgard\u2019s touch. It meant the world to him these two gruff, private men were comfortable enough with him not to hide their feelings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which led him right back to the issue at hand with his brothers.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>A big red diesel Chevy turned and barreled up the driveway.</p> <p>Cord\u2019s truck.

What brings you guys by?\u201d</p><p>The truck door slammed in response.</p><p>\u201cDidja need something?\u201d Did I do something wrong again?</p><p>\u201cNo. Gotta say, it\u2019s sad the only time we show up at your place is when we need something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA damn shame,\u201d Cord added.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both welcome here any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>Both men leaned against the truck. Colby still favored the leg he\u2019d busted up rodeoing, and had taken up a cockeyed position.</p><p>Cord crossed his arms and his legs, keeping his face shadowed beneath his hat brim.</p><p>\u201cSo why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Colby tipped his head up and looked Colt square in the eye.</p><p>\u201cTo apologize for bein\u2019 a prick to you.\u201d</p> <p>Whoa. Not what Colt expected.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna make excuses about what I said a few weeks back, \u2019cause it\u2019s over and done. We both know it was wrong. We all know this situation has been buildin\u2019 for a while. You\u2019ve pissed me off so many times since I quit the circuit and started workin\u2019 on the ranch that I\u2019m surprised we ain\u2019t come to blows before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019ve been pissing you off since I was born,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>Colby shot him a smile. \u201cAin\u2019t that the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Colt, you and I did come to blows,\u201d Cord added.</p><p>Just another blackout drunk moment Colt didn\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cSo until Cam pointed it out a couple weeks back,\u201d Colby continued, \u201cI hadn\u2019t considered I\u2019d kept up that shitty attitude toward you even now that you\u2019re clean. Because I was used to actin\u2019 that way, I realized I didn\u2019t know how not to be mad at you, bro.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cThen when you built this house, away from us, and up the road from Trev, who\u2019d always been my best friend, I guess I was pissed and jealous. Makes me an immature fuck to spout off the shit I did to you. You didn\u2019t deserve none of it. Jesus. I don\u2019t know if I can ever apologize enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hafta\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme say my piece. I\u2019m sorry I\u2014 we\u2014didn\u2019t kick your ass when we saw you losin\u2019 the battle with booze. You shoulda been able to turn to us, Colt, instead we turned you against us. I don\u2019t blame you for wantin\u2019 to distance yourself. No wonder you prefer Kade and Buck to us, at least they had your back when you needed it.\u201d</p><p>Colt glanced away.</p><p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re spillin\u2019 our guts, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t try harder to include you in my life with Channing either. All Gib could talk about on the way home from dinner last night was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m really fuckin\u2019 sorry you\u2019ve borne the brunt of the work in your sobriety while I was workin\u2019 banker\u2019s hours because I\u2019ve got a wife and kids to go home to.</p><p>\u201cBottom line is Cam was dead on and it pisses me off I was too stubborn to see it. I didn\u2019t believe you could change, even when the proof was right in my face for the last three years. And it sucks that if Cam didn\u2019t have the balls to speak the truth, we all probably would\u2019ve gone on like this for years, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>Another moment of silence.</p><p>Cord shifted his stance. \u201cI ain\u2019t got much to add. Colby pretty much said it all. But I will say I\u2019m just as much a sorry sonuvabitch.</p><p>Maybe more. Christ, Colt, I\u2019m so fuckin\u2019 sorry. It never shoulda gotten to this point. We all know the strained relationship Dad has with Uncle Casper. As the oldest kid I swore it\u2019d never happen to any of us. I\u2019ll be damned if I didn\u2019t sit back and let it happen.</p><p>\u201cWhen you sobered up I wasn\u2019t sure it\u2019d stick. Hell, I watched you strugglin\u2019 that fall when you returned from treatment until you found an A.A. meeting. And what did I do the instant AJ and I got married? I quit hangin\u2019 out with you. I even went a step farther than Colby; I justified my actions by convincin\u2019 myself you were better off with A.A. support than with ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I ain\u2019t gonna lie. I needed A.A. I wouldn\u2019t have survived the first year if it hadn\u2019t been for A.A.\u201d If it hadn\u2019t been for India. \u201cI dealt with a lot of shit I didn\u2019t want any of my family to know about. So blame on the \u2018backing away\u2019 response is equal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to tell you from Carter that although he ain\u2019t around as much as he\u2019d like, he feels guilty,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>\u201cEspecially since all of us banded together and knocked some sense into him when he needed it. Must\u2019ve seemed like we couldn\u2019t be bothered to do that for you.\u201d</p><p>Colt looked back and forth between his brother\u2019s hangdog faces. \u201cLemme ask you something. Did your wives put you up to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. AJ\u2019s been worried,\u201d Cord said. \u201cBut she\u2019s been feelin\u2019 too crappy to do much but yell at me for knockin\u2019 her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame with Channing. Though, I gotta say, if either one of them were in top form, along with Macie, they woulda thrown their lot in with Keely and kicked all our asses. Keely knew what was up.</p><p>Might\u2019ve saved us all some grief if we woulda listened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ma? Any of this her doing?\u201d</p><p>Colby shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Ma\u2019s in worse denial than the rest of us. First thing she said after Cam blew up was she raised us to treat each other better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And Dad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t gotta explain nothin\u2019 to me about Dad,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>Both Colby and Cord smiled.</p><p>This time the silence wasn\u2019t filled with tension.</p><p>Colt said, \u201cI appreciate you guys comin\u2019 by and bein\u2019 up front with me. It\u2019d been easier to ignore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we okay?\u201d Colt asked.</p><p>\u201cI reckon. Except Colby and I would like you to help us draw up a more structured distribution of ranch duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Dad\u2019ll hate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit. That ain\u2019t his decision,\u201d Cord said. \u201cThis ain\u2019t a monarchy.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Bucking Carson McKay\u2019s iron rule about \u201cdoin\u2019 what needs done\u201d and receiving apologies from both his brothers? This was shaping up to be a damn fine day. The family changes would take some getting used to for all of them, still, Cord and Colby had taken the first step to making things better and Colt admired that. He could work with that.</p><p>But they could all use a little levity. \u201cSo, do we give each other a big group hug now, or what?\u201d</p><p>Cord said, \u201cI vote for the \u2018or what\u2019 option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dick with Cam. I\u2019m beginnin\u2019 to think our little brother feels left out of our family dramas.\u201d</p><p>Colby scratched his chin. \u201cYou know, we have been treatin\u2019 him with kid gloves since he settled back here. Maybe it\u2019s time we...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the gloves off,\u201d Cord and Colby finished together.</p><p>Colt grinned. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>Colt returned home hours later to find the light on his answering machine flashing. Probably a telemarketer. Most everyone he wanted to talk to called his cell. He hit play anyway.</p><p>Two messages.</p><p>\u201cColt. It\u2019s India. Look, I\u2019m going to be really busy the next couple of days. I hope you understand it\u2019d be best if we just did our own thing until the weekend. I\u2019ll call you then.\u201d</p><p>Beep.</p><p>He hit pause on the machine and dialed India\u2019s cell. She picked up on the second ring. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this? You\u2019re too busy to see me all week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI explained in the message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell you did. What\u2019s really going on, India?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom you, from us, from this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is this break gonna last? Or is it a permanent break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! God no. I swear to you, I just need some time alone to think.\u201d She paused. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever need that?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he did. Didn\u2019t mean he liked it. \u201cSo do you have an end date in mind for this moratorium on seein\u2019 each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Thursday?\u201d</p><p>He bit back a growl. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be at the meeting tomorrow night either.\u201d</p><p>There went that plan. \u201cCan I at least call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thursday is not that far away, Colt, I think you\u2019ll survive not talking to me for two days.\u201d Softly, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.</p><p>Take care,\u201d and hung up.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit.\u201d He hated this. Especially since he didn\u2019t know what\u2019d sent her into full retreat.</p><p>His family? Maybe.</p><p>Or maybe...he\u2019d spooked her by his intent to tell her he loved her last night, before she\u2019d stopped him. Why would that scare her?</p><p>She had to know how he felt.</p><p>Guess he\u2019d have to wait until Thursday to find out.</p><p>The message light still blinked. He hit play. \u201cHi, Colt, it\u2019s Ginger Paulson. I don\u2019t know if you remember me, but we met a couple weeks back at the community center? My son Hayden was in a class and we talked when I picked him up? Anyway, if you could call me back, I\u2019d appreciate it. There\u2019s something I\u2019d like to discuss with you.\u201d She rattled off the number and he scrawled it on the scratch pad by the phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, he remembered her all right. The redhead. He dialed her number. \u201cGinger? It\u2019s Colt McKay. What can I do for you?\u201d He waited while she explained. A big grin broke out when she finished.</p><p>\u201cSure I can meet you. Tomorrow night? At Dewey\u2019s? It\u2019s a date.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p> <p>The bell on the front door clanked.</p><p>India threw her sketchbook on the counter and stretched. Talk about a slow day. She slapped on a smile and entered the main part of the store, which showcased the Sky Blue product line.</p><p>\u201cGood morning. Something I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>The woman turned around. Carolyn McKay.</p><p>India tried not to let her smile slip. She\u2019d known Carolyn for a few years, in a professional capacity, as India the saleswoman who tempted Carolyn with new Sky Blue products. Was she supposed to act differently now that she was dating Colt?</p> <p>\u201cHi Carolyn. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. And you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m dragging ass because your son fucked me senseless and we didn\u2019t use protection, so I could very well be pregnant with your grandchild.</p><p>Not a good answer. TMI, as Keely would say. \u201cI\u2019m good. You looking for something in particular? I\u2019m afraid the lavender and sage hand lotion is backordered until next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting me know. But that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Brilliant response, India, maybe you oughta be totally stupid and her if she\u2019s here for a tattoo.</p> <p>\u201cDid you have a good time at our house Sunday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The food was wonderful. Colt has always told me what a great cook you are.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn beamed. \u201cReally? Sometimes I wonder if any of my family pays attention to what they\u2019re eating. It\u2019s good to hear my efforts are appreciated.\u201d She paused. \u201cDo you cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no. Seems pointless for one. I tend to go for fast and easy.\u201d That hadn\u2019t come out right.</p><p>A knowing look entered Carolyn\u2019s eyes. \u201cI see. My niece Chassie tells me Colt is a good cook, not that he\u2019s invited his father and me over for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s choice of dinner guests was not India\u2019s issue. \u201cHe is a great cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cooked for you?\u201d</p><p>Crap. She\u2019d fallen right into that one. \u201cYes. Since I can\u2019t crack an egg, I have to reciprocate in other creative ways.\u201d Ooh. And didn\u2019t that sound totally suggestive?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not important. Anyway, I was surprised to hear you were dating my son. Aren\u2019t there...rules against that sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>India frowned. \u201cRules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA.A. rules. About a sponsor not becoming intimately involved with a sponsoree.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn was fishing. The relationship between the sponsor and sponsoree wasn\u2019t spelled out on purpose, according to the A.A. guidelines. If she\u2019d done any sort of research\u2014and India would bet money Carolyn McKay had read up on A.A\u2014she\u2019d know that.</p><p>What Carolyn wanted was confirmation India was now\u2014or had been\u2014Colt\u2019s sponsor. India wouldn\u2019t betray that confidence, especially since early on Colt demanded everything about his A.A. life be kept from his family, as was his right.</p><p>India said, \u201cWith all due respect, Carolyn, I\u2019m sure you understand I\u2019m not at liberty to discuss A.A. business with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh sure. I just wondered. I worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worry about Colt? Or about me dating Colt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, I guess.\u201d</p><p>At least she hadn\u2019t lied. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be honest with you? You look like a straight shooter.\u201d</p><p>India took it to mean she looked low-class and acted crass. \u201cBy all means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy worry is that Colt has come to rely on you too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first it was understandable, he needed the support of others who\u2019d been through the same types of...things. But it\u2019s been a couple of years. Isn\u2019t time he weans himself from A.A.?\u201d</p><p>Weans himself? Jesus. Was this woman for real? Did she understand anything about what an addict goes through every damn day? \u201cRecovery is a lifelong process. It doesn\u2019t have a shelf life. Or a convenient timeframe. And the level of involvement in the A.A. program is just as individual as the journey it took to get there. We don\u2019t demand or command members. Participation is strictly voluntary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that. I\u2019m not talking only about A.A. I\u2019m talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you realize Colt\u2019s pulled away from his family almost completely in the time he\u2019s been with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to argue with you on the family issue, but that\u2019s not true. Colt spends lots of time with Cam. And with Kade, Skylar and the girls. He helps Buck out. I know for a fact he, Chassie, Trevor and Edgard have breakfast together most Sunday mornings.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t placate Carolyn. In fact, it seemed to distress her even more. \u201cWhich is all good and well, but Colt doesn\u2019t come over to our house for Sunday brunch or supper. He doesn\u2019t have much to do with Cord or Colby or their families unless I organize it. He and Carter used to be close, but not now. Can you explain that away as easily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter lives in Canyon River. Maybe because Colt works with his brothers almost every day, he needs a break in his off ranch hours?\u201d</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s owl-eyed expression said India was clueless. \u201cA break? There are no \u2018breaks\u2019 in ranching. For any of us. Especially in such a large-scale operation as the McKay Ranch. Especially in a family business. And him needing a break from his family is just plain ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019d be healthier if you did take an occasional break from one another. God knows Skylar and I get along better when she\u2019s not in my face all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be that way, India, but Colt isn\u2019t. He never has been until he met you. I know my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Carolyn, that\u2019s the crux of your problem. I don\u2019t think you know Colt at all,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you do? Since you\u2019ve come into his life he\u2019s built a house in the boondocks. He doesn\u2019t go to dances or to church. He never goes anyplace where he might meet a decent woman to settle down with now that he\u2019s cleaned up his act.\u201d</p><p>Decent woman. Evidently a woman who loved her son body and soul, who accepted him as he was, who believed Colt McKay was the most loving, most sincere, most thoughtful, most wonderful man she\u2019d ever known...didn\u2019t qualify as a decent woman.</p><p>Oh. That stung. Big time.</p><p>Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t you give this woman a reason to offer you false comfort.</p><p>Yet, even as she was bleeding inside, India knew Carolyn wasn\u2019t being malicious. Only acting on a mother\u2019s concern, as misguided, misinformed as that concern might be.</p><p>\u201cLook, India. That might\u2019ve come off sounding a little harsh. I like you. I always have. I just want you to understand not to take it personally when Colt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Moves on? Decides he\u2019d prefer a sturdy, native Wyoming ranch woman to a tattooed, pierced freakshow like me?\u201d</p><p>India leaned across the counter. \u201cThat way of thinking is exactly why he\u2019s distanced himself from your family. None of you know him anymore, nor have you taken the time to get to know him. And that is just plain sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are we supposed to get to know him if he\u2019s with you all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho Colt chooses to spend his time with is his business. Is that what this is about? He\u2019s choosing me over you?\u201d</p><p>A startled look darted across Carolyn\u2019s face. Her eyes teared up.</p><p>\u201cBut the thing is, he\u2019s not always choosing me. He has a life you don\u2019t even know about. A life that has nothing to do with the ranch.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s mouth opened to protest. India stopped it with a wave of her hand.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Colt plays in a charity basketball tournament a couple times a year? Did any of you bother going to cheer him on?</p><p>No. Did you know he takes boys in the Little Buddies program horseback riding on his land? So he can talk to them one on one about staying away from drugs and alcohol? No. And he did go to a dance, a community dance. For charity. Were any of the McKays, besides Colt and Buck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about the dance Colt brought a date to? A nice girl who he embarrassed when he was found in a janitor\u2019s closet with...you? Trust me, we heard all about that one. Just like we\u2019ve heard about all the rest of his sexual escapades for the last twenty years.\u201d</p><p>India felt all the blood drain from her face.</p><p>Carolyn\u2019s eyes went wide as if she were surprised she\u2019d spoken out loud. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that didn\u2019t come out right. I\u2019m just frustrated.</p><p>None of my boys are talking to each other or to me. And I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you warned me to stay away from Colt it might fix your family problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens no. I\u2019m warning you to expect that type of response and attitude from people around here, who always expect the worst from the wild McKays. I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s more than a little trouble that\u2019ll come your way if you are involved with my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI welcome it.\u201d She pushed back from the counter. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, Mrs. McKay, I have a tattoo customer scheduled that I need to get ready for.\u201d</p><p>India spun on her heel and managed to walk to the backroom with dignity she didn\u2019t feel.</p><p>A whispered voice pierced the silence and darkness.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for what? What\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. What\u2019s going on? Where am I? Indy? Is this some kind of sex game, sugar? Because I can\u2019t see it to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>A slice of awareness glimmered on the edges of his subconscious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colt couldn\u2019t move. It felt like a thick rope was wound around his body from his shoulders to his knees.</p><p>Where was he? At the ranch? He heard laughter. Smelled dust and coffee. He stomped his feet. It wasn\u2019t dirt beneath his boots but concrete.</p><p>Strong hands grabbed him by the arms and dragged him. His heart nearly beat out of his chest. \u201cOkay, enough of the rough stuff.</p><p>Or are you givin\u2019 me back some of what I gave to you? I said I was sorry.\u201d</p> <p>The blindfold was ripped from his eyes. He blinked until Bert\u2019s face came into view.</p><p>\u201cBert? What are you doing here? Where\u2019s India?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe time has come for you to face your fears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have faced them. I haven\u2019t had a drink in years!\u201d</p><p>Colt looked around. He was in the middle of a circle. The circle of trust, just like the A.A. meetings. Except this circle was composed of his family, Cord, Colby, Carter, Keely, his mother, his father, his uncle Harland, his cousins Dag West, Quinn and Bennett McKay, not his fellow A.A. members.</p> <p>He looked at Dag. Then Uncle Harland. \u201cBut you\u2019re both dead.\u201d</p><p>They just stared at him with vacant eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, Colton West McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo let go.\u201d</p><p>His gaze zoomed around the circle. Where was Kade? Cam?</p> <p>Chassie? Trevor? Edgard? Buck? The people he counted on?</p><p>Where the hell was India? The one person he trusted most in the whole world?</p><p>She\u2019s not here when you need her. She\u2019s just like the rest of them. She will let you down.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not ready yet.\u201d</p><p>Colt\u2019s head whipped around because every other part of his body was immobilized.</p><p>Blake West grinned at him. \u201cBut I\u2019ll give you a little push in the right direction, cuz, to get you started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust any of you!\u201d</p><p>Blake shoved him hard.</p><p>Without the use of his arms or legs, Colt braced for impact, knowing not one person in the circle would jump to catch him.</p><p>They\u2019d just let him fall. Like they always had.</p><p>He jackknifed up, throwing his hands in front of his face to protect himself and connected with nothing but air.</p><p>His eyes opened. He was in his bedroom. The alarm clock read four a.m.</p><p>It took a second for him to get his heart rate back to normal and realize it\u2019d just been a dream. A weird fucking dream, but a dream nevertheless.</p><p>Rather than dwell on all the hidden meanings any counselor would have a field day with, Colt focused on one thing: India. She was missing from the dream, missing from his life and he missed her something fierce. He needed to talk to her as soon as possible.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>The next day, India\u2019s Ink had a customer. Not India\u2019s favorite person by any stretch, but she was so bored and lonely she welcomed the diversion.</p><p>\u201cSo where\u2019ve you been, Cat? I haven\u2019t seen you around.\u201d India lined up the ink cups and wiped an alcohol pad across the faded pink rose tattoo on Cat\u2019s ankle.</p><p>\u201cOh, I had family stuff in Denver. Then I worked in Canyon River while Macie was flitting off to another one of Carter\u2019s art shows. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s pregnant again. Three kids in five years is crazy.\u201d</p><p>India didn\u2019t point out her sister had three kids in three years and she didn\u2019t find it crazy in the least.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wonder if Carter doesn\u2019t keep her pregnant because Macie will wake up and leave his poor artist\u2019s ass if she wasn\u2019t tied to him in some permanent way.\u201d</p><p>Not a flattering comment for Cat to voice about her friend and boss. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Domini fills in for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good thing? Right. I\u2019m lucky she doesn\u2019t lock the damn door and hide in the storage room when I\u2019m gone.\u201d She sighed dramatically. \u201cDommy is sweet and all, but she should not be Branded As Trouble</p><p>allowed out of the kitchen. I can\u2019t believe Macie made me train her for front work. What a waste.\u201d</p><p>India figured Cat\u2019s pronunciation of \u201cDommy\u201d as dummy wasn\u2019t accidental. \u201cI still think it\u2019s lucky for you or else you couldn\u2019t flit off to Denver every month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy great aunt was in the hospital. That hardly counts as flitting off,\u201d Cat huffed.</p><p>Cat\u2019s weeklong trips to Denver had been going on for over a year. Who picked up the slack? Domini.</p><p>Domini complained to India, well, as much as Domini complained about anything, which was almost not. Since Domini grew up in a different culture, making waves as a lowly employee had been frowned on. So India\u2019s suggestion that Domini take her concerns to Velma and Macie was met with a horrified and vehement no.</p><p>\u201cMy aunt had knee replacement surgery. There were orthopedic patients up the wazoo. She said some were diabetics there for amputation. Yuck. Which makes me glad Cam McKay keeps his fake leg covered up, because I\u2019d barf if I ever saw it. I mean, can you imagine? Eww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam McKay is a decorated war hero. Eww, doesn\u2019t exactly come to mind when I see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a total hottie, too bad he\u2019s a cripple.\u201d</p><p>A cripple. India\u2019s tongue would be bloody by the time she finished this job. Why had she taken it?</p><p>Right. Rent was due. Again. And she was short of funds.</p><p>Again.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I can\u2019t get past how icky it\u2019d be to get naked with him and see that...stump. And he\u2019s missing part of his hand.\u201d She shivered. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable since he has a thing for me because he\u2019s always in the diner.\u201d</p><p>Talk about cocky. Cam had a thing for Domini.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just re-inking this tat, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I debated on having you do it at all, since it is a Kat Von D design. The guy who originally did it worked with Kat before she became famous.\u201d</p><p>Please. If she had a buck for every time she\u2019d heard that line in the last few years, she\u2019d be flush with cash. After dipping the needle gun in black ink, she stepped on the pedal and her hand started to vibrate. She gently set the needle on Cat\u2019s skin.</p><p>India was grateful conversation stopped for a few minutes, even when she knew it wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>It didn\u2019t. Cat chattered on about her life. What she did, who she did. All gossip, all mind-numbingly boring to India, but Cat didn\u2019t notice. She must\u2019ve taken India\u2019s silence for rapt attention because she kept going.</p><p>She mostly tuned her out until she heard Cat say, \u201cSo rumor around town is you\u2019re dating Colt McKay.\u201d</p><p>India slid her hand a fraction of an inch to thicken the outline.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d you hear the rumor from?\u201d She concentrated on keeping the line the same diameter and not letting the black bleed into the pink.</p><p>\u201cMacie. Is it true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Colt and I are dating? Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends with bennies now, huh?\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s grip tightened on the tattoo gun.</p><p>\u201cMacie said you came to a McKay family dinner at the big house. I\u2019ve gotta say, I\u2019m impressed. Very few people get invited into the sacred McKay family realm if you\u2019re not married to one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you my sister, Skylar, is married to a McKay.\u201d</p><p>Cat gave her a droll stare. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll remind you about the number of McKay shindigs you\u2019ve been invited to because of that association. Zero. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you turn your leg a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shocked me to hear you and Colt were together.\u201d Cat laughed. Not a nice laugh, a mean laugh. \u201cA few of us around here wondered if you weren\u2019t gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. With the bull dyke swagger, the piercings and the excessive tats, not to mention the motorcycle, the addiction issues, the funky haircut and the tough girl attitude?\u201d She slurped her Diet Coke. \u201cGranted, single men are slim pickin\u2019s unless you\u2019re in the market for a dumb cowboy.\u201d</p><p>A loud click echoed in the room. India sat up and heard it again. She scrutinized her tattoo gun. Did it seem overly hot? She smacked it on her hand. It\u2019d be just her luck if the damn thing died on her. She stepped on the foot pedal, let go, and waited for the noise to sound again. Nothing. Weird.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Cat asked.</p><p>\u201cJust fine. I\u2019m switching ink colors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re not changing colors.\u201d</p><p>India wished she could change customers.</p><p>\u201cWhen I heard you and Colt were \u2018dating\u2019,\u201d Cat made quotes in the air, \u201cI thought as your friend, I should warn you. Don\u2019t get suckered in by his charms, because that cowboy talks sweet. And before you know it, you\u2019ll be watching him doing the same sweet-talking routine on another woman as soon as he gets bored with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou telling me you\u2019ve dated Colt?\u201d</p><p>Cat attempted an innocent look. \u201cWould you be upset if I said yes?\u201d</p><p>Yes. No. Lie. If you say no she\u2019ll get pissy and clam up. India settled for, \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2018date\u2019 him, but I did sleep with him a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after I moved here...maybe three and a half years ago.</p><p>We were dancing at the Golden Boot, one thing led to another...and we ended up back at his place.\u201d Cat paused. \u201cThen a week or so later we were at a party and ended up in somebody\u2019s bedroom again. Anyway, he fucked me and never called me. What kind of man does that?</p><p>\u201cMy friend Mimi went to a party at the Boars Nest, his old house, like a month later, and Colt was fucking some stripper, right in front of everyone! And when he finished with her, he passed her off to another guy.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and then Colt probably passed out. Those drinking escapades were a thing of the past, in Colt\u2019s past, and had no bearing on their future.</p><p>Still, India had to concentrate on keeping her hand from shaking. \u201cWhy are you telling me this about Colt if it happened years ago?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause a leopard doesn\u2019t change his spots, India. Knowing the truth about him will save you a lot of heartache. You wouldn\u2019t be the first woman in this area to fall for his lies and lines and you won\u2019t be the last.\u201d Cat pushed onto her elbows and looked at India over her shoulder. \u201cBesides, didn\u2019t Blake West ask you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>Colt happened. \u201cWe decided to stay friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that before or after you and Colt hooked up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee! That\u2019s what I mean. You and Colt had been friends forever, and when his cousin starts paying attention to you, a cousin he\u2019s always had a rivalry with, then Colt becomes interested in you?</p><p>Isn\u2019t that just a little...ironic?\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t as if India hadn\u2019t thought of that. And discounted it.</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest, but Cat wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>\u201cAlmost as ironic as Carolyn McKay waltzing in here yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a regular customer of Sky Blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m betting she didn\u2019t come in here to buy lotion. I\u2019m betting she came in here to talk to you. Did she warn you off Colt?\u201d</p><p>India looked up. \u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not the type of woman she wants her darling son dating, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, my Cat, what a tangled web you weave. I\u2019m finding it impossible to follow a single thread.\u201d</p><p>Cat gave her a superior sniff. \u201cWhat do you mean? It\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me. First you say Colt is going to dump me because he dumps every woman. Then you say his mother is worried we\u2019re going to have a permanent relationship, so she comes to warn me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich brings me back to my original point. You being at the McKay family dinner. I think that tipped Mama McKay off Colt\u2019s fling with the local tattooist might go on a little longer and she had to do something to stop it.\u201d</p><p>Fling. As if.</p><p>\u201cSo what did she say to you?\u201d</p><p>None of your goddamn business.</p> <p>\u201cBecause you looked upset.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s because I look like I could use a big bottle of scotch.</p><p>\u201cProbably not as upset as you were knowing Colt came into the diner with another woman last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Dammit. She shouldn\u2019t have asked. It\u2019d be just like Cat not to tell her. And then for India to find out it\u2019d been Colt\u2019s sister-in-law and to get pissed off for nothing.</p><p>\u201cThat gorgeous redheaded lawyer who moved to town earlier this year and took over her father\u2019s law office...Ginger Paulson?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019d explain Colt\u2019s evasiveness about the woman talking to him at the community center. \u201cMaybe it was business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh honey, it sure didn\u2019t look like they were talking business.\u201d</p><p>Cat gasped with mock distress. \u201cOh, India, I\u2019m really sorry I opened my big mouth and told you when you didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>No, you aren\u2019t sorry you miserable pot-stirring, gossiping, lazy-assed bitch.</p><p>Rather than allow catty Cat the satisfaction of seeing how badly she\u2019d upset her, India shrugged. \u201cI appreciate you telling me.</p><p>Like you said. I\u2019m just dating him. No big deal, nothing permanent, we\u2019re having some laughs. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m picking out wedding dresses and invitations.\u201d</p><p>Suspicion darkened Cat\u2019s eyes. \u201cReally? You\u2019re sure you\u2019re not upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive,\u201d she lied. \u201cBesides, I am getting what I want from Colt McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Cat asked.</p><p>India\u2019s lips twisted in a parody of a smile. \u201cNow where would be the fun in telling you, when I want it to be such a big surprise for him?\u201d</p><p>Colt was stuck in hell\u2014the foyer at the back of the building between the tattoo studio and the stairs leading to India\u2019s apartment.</p><p>He\u2019d been there for the last twenty minutes.</p><p>He racked his brain trying to remember whether he\u2019d slept with Cat, but it was pointless. There was a period of eighteen months that\u2019d been a total blur. But he did know in the years he\u2019d been sober, whenever she\u2019d come on to him at Dewey\u2019s, he\u2019d let her know he was not interested. In fact, he\u2019d been downright rude to her on a couple of occasions.</p><p>So...his rudeness, not calling her after a two-night stand...he could see why she had it in for him.</p><p>What sickened him, as much as Cat\u2019s tactics to turn India\u2019s niggling doubts into full-blown doubts, was that India hadn\u2019t defended him. Not once. She\u2019d demanded clarification on a couple of points. But never once had she said, you\u2019re wrong. I know Colt. I know his heart. I know his soul. I know the man he is now, not the man he was.</p><p>Not fucking once.</p><p>And what was up with her cryptic claim, I am getting what I want from Colt McKay?</p><p>A gut-level fear froze his breath in his lungs. Was India just another person who took what they wanted from him, expected his support, but when push came to shove, couldn\u2019t offer it in return?</p><p>Support or trust?</p><p>A leopard doesn\u2019t change his spots.</p><p>Colt shifted the bouquet of flowers and lumbered up the steps, not bothering to tiptoe. They\u2019d tiptoed around these issues plenty, it seemed, and the time had come to face them dead on.</p><p>India heard the stairs creak and knew Colt had come calling a day early. Her heart leapt for joy and she set the tattoo gun on the tray table. \u201cAlmost done, give me one sec.\u201d She hustled to the backroom.</p><p>The foyer was empty. Ever since she\u2019d tossed the wrench at his head, Colt kept his distance when she was working. But really, had he been in such a damn hurry he\u2019d left the back door open? Her hand curled around the doorknob and she pulled the door shut. A click echoed in the enclosed space.</p><p>A familiar click.</p><p>Heart pounding, India opened the door to determine her ears weren\u2019t playing tricks on her.</p><p>Click.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard him go upstairs until just now. Which meant...he\u2019d heard every word.</p><p>You mean he knows you didn\u2019t defend him.</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t understand how a woman like Cat operated. The only way to keep their relationship private, and not fodder for Cat\u2019s gossip mill, was to ignore her.</p><p>But Cat taunted you and you fell for it.</p><p>Heartsick, India dragged her feet returning to her tattoo station.</p><p>She picked up the tattoo gun and dipped the needle in the ink.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, as I was saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Cat? The truth is, I have a vicious headache.</p><p>Let me concentrate on this last petal and you\u2019ll be done.\u201d</p><p>Numb and weary, she shifted into autopilot as she finished adding in the last of the pink to the rose.</p><p>After she swabbed the area and Cat admired the tat re-furb, India taped a bandage on it. \u201cI\u2019ll ring you up out front.\u201d</p><p>Cat stopped. \u201cRing me up? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t expect me to re-ink you for free, did you?\u201d</p><p>The look on Cat\u2019s face said exactly that.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be a hundred bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a re-ink? A new tattoo doesn\u2019t cost that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but those aren\u2019t special Kat Von D tats, are they? I had to take extra care not to wreck her design, and that\u2019s much harder than starting from scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems a little pricey.\u201d</p><p>India just hoped it hadn\u2019t cost her everything.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>Rather than pace until India came upstairs, Colt found a vase and put the flowers in water. Then he paced.</p><p>Did he admit he\u2019d overheard the conversation? Did he play dumb and see if she brought it up first?</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d go with that option.</p><p>He wandered to her bedroom. The bed was unmade. The sheets were twisted into a knot. Pillows were strewn across the floor, as if she\u2019d thrown them. That made him smile. She was a restless sleeper.</p><p>The scents of cinnamon and lemon lingered in the air. His gaze landed on the silk scarves piled on the dresser. Between her scent and the memory of what he\u2019d done to her with the scarves, his cock started to stir. Not good to greet her with a hard-on. He backtracked to the bathroom.</p><p>Makeup, washcloths, empty coffee cups littered the bathroom counter. He washed his hands and was looking for a hand towel when he saw the calendar.</p><p>Whoa. Why did India need a calendar in the bathroom?</p><p>Curious, Colt picked it up. Several days were X\u2019d out. Some in blue. Some in red. He flipped the page. Days were marked for the following month. Not hard to figure out what the red days meant.</p><p>A weird feeling arose as he looked at the dates. A yes was scrawled on the blue X\u2019d square three days ago. The night they\u2019d had sex against the pickup. A yes was jotted in the blue X\u2019d box for four days ago. The night she\u2019d spent at his place and he\u2019d fucked her nine ways \u2018til Sunday. A no was written in the blue X\u2019d box for the last two days in which he hadn\u2019t seen India at all. A blue X</p><p>marked today and tomorrow. Then nothing until four weeks from the first blue X. Exactly four weeks.</p><p>Son of a bitch. Colt knew enough about biology to understand why India was marking the days. This was a fertility chart and blue indicated her most fertile time.</p><p>I am getting what I want from Colt McKay.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to tax his brain to figure out what India wanted from him: a baby. She wanted a baby so bad she\u2019d...steal it? She didn\u2019t care if it wasn\u2019t what he wanted?</p><p>Jesus. He wanted kids some day. He wanted kids with India, but he wanted a say in when and if that happened. Not for her to take away his choice by staging a \u201cdo me right here, right now\u201d</p><p>stunt that ensured he couldn\u2019t say no.</p><p>You could\u2019ve said no. By saying yes you reverted back to the behavior you used to be known by. So are you really mad at India?</p><p>Or yourself?</p><p>Colt couldn\u2019t breathe. He couldn\u2019t think. Had he put his trust in the wrong person? He stumbled out of the bathroom. When he reached the living room, India opened the apartment door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her gaze zoomed to the flowers on the table and then back to him. \u201cWhat are those for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not given out of guilt, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy would I think that?\u201d</p> <p>Was India really going to play dumb? \u201cI heard you and Cat talkin\u2019. Brought to mind Ma tellin\u2019 me when I was a kid that eavesdroppers never hear anything good about themselves. Guess she was right. But then again, I didn\u2019t exactly hear you leaping to my defense, Indy, when Cat started in on my character\u2014both past and present.\u201d He looked at her with a mix of misery and anger. \u201cI expected more from the woman I\u2019m dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was I supposed to respond? Anything I said would\u2019ve been the wrong thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the things she said were an outright lie. Any positive response about me or our relationship would\u2019ve been better than the flip crack that we\u2019re just havin\u2019 fun and you weren\u2019t pickin\u2019 out wedding announcements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we just having fun? Dating for kicks? Nothing serious, right? Especially since you were out with another woman last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that, you believe what Cat told you?\u201d He threw up his hands in total exasperation. \u201cYou believe what Cat thinks she saw?</p> <p>Without askin\u2019 me? Without trusting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fine one to talk about trust, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you go there. This ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to do with me not playin\u2019 some stupid trust game in A.A. meetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. It\u2019s not a game. But it is about trust. So I\u2019m asking you now, Colt. Who was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not asking me, you\u2019re accusing me. Expecting me to defend myself when I\u2019ve done nothin\u2019 wrong. When the reason I haven\u2019t explained anything to you is because I haven\u2019t talked to you in the last two goddamn days. You said you needed space, remember?\u201d</p><p>She moved to the wall separating the living and dining rooms, folding her arms across her chest. \u201cThat is not the issue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right that\u2019s not the issue. You immediately jumped to the conclusion I was seein\u2019 another woman behind your back.\u201d He resisted the urge to shake her. \u201cDo you honestly think if I was sneaking around that I\u2019d do it in the restaurant next to your business? In the same building as your apartment?\u201d</p><p>India bit her lip and looked at her feet.</p><p>Colt expelled a bark of laughter. \u201cDon\u2019t you go all wet-eyed and coy on me. You\u2019d be better off pickin\u2019 a fight because you know it\u2019s impossible for me to resist the hellcat in you. Then you\u2019d get what you want from me, just like you told Cat you would.\u201d</p><p>Two red spots appeared on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI wondered what that comment meant. I\u2019d foolishly hoped you were bein\u2019 cryptic with her because she\u2019s a mean, gossipy hag and it\u2019d drive her crazy.\u201d He paused. \u201cThen I found the calendar in the bathroom. I know exactly what you want from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You had no right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd neither did you. No right at all, to be another person in my life who takes away another one of my choices. To take something from me I would\u2019ve freely given to you, if you just would\u2019ve asked.\u201d</p><p>Tears shimmered in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who jumps to conclusions, Colt.\u201d</p> <p>He said, \u201cTell me I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p><p>She countered with, \u201cNo, you tell me I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p><p>A standstill.</p><p>Jesus. He had to get out of here. Now. He shuffled to the door, everything inside him heavy as lead. Like dead weight, which fit since he felt dead inside.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? You\u2019re just leaving?\u201d</p><p>For now. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. So what happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I need time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you time to get your head on straight, more than once in this relationship, I expect the same courtesy from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She pushed off from the wall. \u201cBut I sure hope you don\u2019t plan on finding a bottle to help you pass the time while you\u2019re off thinking.\u201d</p><p>And he thought he\u2019d felt sick before. \u201cSpoken like a true A.A. sponsor. Thank you for the support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Colt, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it the way it came out, I just can\u2019t think... Fuck. I can\u2019t believe this is happening and I know I\u2019m doing this all wrong.\u201d</p><p>Yes, you are.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just frustrated and you know how I get and say such stupid impulsive things\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. Because I thought I knew you, India. And I thought you were one of the few who knew me. But I guess I was wrong about that too.\u201d</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t look back as he left.</p><p>Go after him. You need him. You love him. Weren\u2019t you mustering up the guts to tell him how you felt? How can you let him walk away?</p><p>Let him go. You don\u2019t need him, especially after his hypocritical behavior. He jumped to his own set of conclusions without letting you explain.</p><p>India sank to the floor and wept, knowing it was pointless, knowing it\u2019d make her feel worse. She was so numb in body and mind and spirit, she couldn\u2019t even move. She couldn\u2019t even crawl to her bed. She just laid on the floor, curled in a ball, and cried. And cried. Big sobs. Hiccupping sobs. Silence as tears streamed down her face.</p><p>What had she done?</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>She\u2019d never wanted a drink so badly in her life. Or to smoke a big, fat joint. Or to down a bottle of sleeping pills so she could sleep the day away.</p><p>Her mind flitted between all the choices, in greedy glee, the old voices and vices taunting her. You\u2019ve been good for so long, don\u2019t you deserve to cut loose? Just once? No one will ever know. Surely one wouldn\u2019t hurt you.</p><p>One what?</p><p>One of anything. Pick. There are so many choices.</p><p>But what if I get caught?</p><p>By who? Could your life honestly get any worse?</p><p>No.</p><p>YES. Another voice piped in. Don\u2019t let eight years of sobriety go down the drain because of an eight-minute fight. Do something besides sit around and give your demons control. Take a walk. Talk to someone.</p><p>The only person India wanted to talk to was Colt.</p><p>Screw him. It\u2019s his fault you\u2019re in this state anyway. Get in your car and drive to the package store. No one will know. Don\u2019t you miss it? Don\u2019t you remember? The tart taste of white wine on your lips? The bubbly feeling of beer on your tongue? The fiery burn of tequila sliding down your throat?</p><p>India\u2019s mouth watered.</p><p>A mental snort sounded as voice number two reappeared. You might as well throw yourself down the stairs. Drinking again is suicide. You know that. Colt is not to blame. And if you use him as an excuse for a relapse, you\u2019ll never have the chance to repair this misstep in your relationship, because part of you will always fault him, even when it\u2019s not true nor his fault. You\u2019re stronger than this.</p><p>Goddammit, she was stronger than this. But she didn\u2019t have the strength to ride out the voices alone. She needed help.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that what she always reminded fledgling A.A. members? No one is ever cured of alcoholism. Some days are easy; some days are hard. No matter if you\u2019ve been sober a week or two decades, there\u2019s no shame in asking for help when you need it.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t. But there\u2019d be a whole lot of shame if she gave in to temptation.</p><p>India rolled to her back and stared at the ceiling. Squinted at it mostly, because her eyes were so swollen and bleary from crying.</p><p>She suffered from the mother of all headaches. Her mouth was as dry as the Wyoming prairie. She was exhausted. Heartsick. Her body hurt. Her mind was scrambled. But she knew if she laid there wallowing in self-pity another second she\u2019d never get up. Or she\u2019d give in.</p><p>One step at a time.</p><p>She slowly pushed to her feet. Shuffled into the kitchen.</p><p>Poured herself a glass of water. Once she\u2019d accomplished those simple tasks, she was ready for the hard one. She scrolled through the contact list on her cell phone. When his number flashed, she selected it and hit dial. He answered on the fourth ring.</p><p>\u201cHey Bert. It\u2019s India. No, I\u2019m not doing so good. Yeah, I realized I\u2019m not invincible. Do you have time to talk to me? Face-to-face?\u201d The tears came again. \u201cThank you. Come on up, the door is unlocked. I\u2019ll put on the coffee.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Colt\u2019s head spun every which way. When he parked in front of his empty house, he realized it was the last place he wanted to be.</p><p>Running wouldn\u2019t fix anything, but time away might give him a different perspective.</p><p>He called Cam and left a message. \u201cI\u2019m droppin\u2019 off the grid for a couple days, bro. Don\u2019t round up a search party for me, I\u2019ll be fine. And if anyone in our family asks, let \u2019em know I ain\u2019t on a three-day bender. Later.\u201d</p><p>Next he called Chassie\u2019s. \u201cHey Trev. How\u2019s Chass? Yeah, well you knew she was ornery when you married her. It\u2019s funny that it takes both you guys to handle her. Look, I\u2019m leavin\u2019 for a couple days and I wondered if you and Ed would keep an eye on my place?</p><p>Nothin\u2019s wrong.\u201d Colt sighed. \u201cThat ain\u2019t entirely true. Just some shit I need to sort out on my own. I appreciate the offer. You guys are great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Food packed, gear packed. Two rods, one tackle box, zero cell phone.</p><p>When things got tough...the tough went fishin\u2019.</p><p>Two days later...</p><p>India burst into Dewey\u2019s when she noticed the sheriff\u2019s department cruiser parked in front. She stalked over to Cam, who was sitting at his usual space in the back booth. \u201cTell me where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Colt? I haven\u2019t the foggiest idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, India. He left me a message saying he was leaving for a few days, and not to worry because he wasn\u2019t on a bender.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>India winced.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d After India talked to Bert, she\u2019d called Domini. Usually India relied on Skylar for personal problems, but she was dealing with two sick babies and an equipment breakdown at the factory. The last thing Skylar needed was more stress.</p> <p>So India had sobbed on Domini\u2019s shoulder for half the damn night. In addition to being a great listener, Domini gave practical advice. Which was why India had allowed a cooling off period before she set about making things right...only to realize Colt had all but disappeared.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t talked to Domini, besides when she swings by to refill my coffee. She\u2019s been a little busy around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did Cat take off again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Cat got fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! When?\u201d</p> <p>Cam beckoned her closer. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear this from me. But after Domini\u2019s, ah, talk with you the other night, she was furious.</p><p>She got Macie and Velma on a conference call and gave them what-for. Said she was sick of covering for Cat\u2019s incompetence and sick of not being able to keep employees because no one wanted to work for, or with, Cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap. What\u2019d Macie say? She and Cat are old friends, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere friends. Evidently Cat said some crappy things when she was in Canyon River and Macie was already upset. Coupled with the fact sweet Domini tossed out the ultimatum of keeping Cat and losing her, they fired Cat. Domini is the new manager.\u201d Cam grinned. \u201cI\u2019m so damn proud of her. I knew there was fire beneath that ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll congratulate her later.\u201d Her eyes searched Cam\u2019s face for clues. \u201cSo you really don\u2019t know where Colt went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about him. Really worried.\u201d She held up a hand.</p><p>\u201cNot that he\u2019s crawled inside a bottle, but I hate thinking he\u2019s hurting alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Cam considered her over his coffee cup. \u201cDid you cause that hurt?\u201d</p><p>India looked him straight in the eye. \u201cYep. I\u2019m not proud of it.</p><p>But since I caused the hurt, I intend to heal it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you already have.\u201d</p><p>That was a weird statement. \u201cSo what\u2019s your advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to my mother. She may have an idea of where he\u2019s gone off to. But don\u2019t call her,\u201d he warned. \u201cFace to face is always best with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Right. Talk to Carolyn McKay. Their last conversation had gone so well. But this wasn\u2019t about Carolyn. This was about Colt.</p><p>He was all that mattered.</p><p>She closed the shop and drove out to the McKay homestead.</p><p>Her bravado faded a bit when Carson McKay greeted her on the front steps. \u201cMornin\u2019, India. Something I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>How had she not noticed Colt was the spitting image of his father? In another thirty odd years, Colt would look exactly like this man. Handsome. Regal. She couldn\u2019t wait to watch the transformation take place as she and Colt grew old together.</p><p>The truth of that statement pumped up her courage to meet that suspicious blue gaze\u2014so much like Colt\u2019s\u2014dead on.</p><p>\u201cYes, Carson, there is something you can do for me. I need to talk to your wife.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 about getting a dog.\u201d</p><p>His horse, Laramie, snorted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. Maybe a blue heeler. He\u2019d keep you in line.\u201d</p><p>Laramie snorted again.</p><p>Colt laughed. \u201cThen again, I probably wouldn\u2019t have any better luck keepin\u2019 a dog in line, than I do keepin\u2019 anything else in my life in line. \u2019Cept maybe for this fishin\u2019 line.\u201d He chuckled again. \u201cA great joke lost on a horse.\u201d</p><p>If he didn\u2019t know better, Colt would swear Laramie rolled his eyes.</p><p>He shifted on the log. Time to move. His ass was sore. He tugged on the fishing line. Nothing. He walked over to where he\u2019d ground-tied Laramie. \u201cYou ready to hit the trail?\u201d</p><p>After hiding out at his favorite fishing hole for three days, Colt was ready to head home. The pine-covered hills on either side of the small pond, and the rock cliff on the backside, made this site inaccessible, except on foot or horseback.</p><p>Few people were aware of this slice of paradise. The terrain was too dangerous for livestock, which also meant nothing worth selling would grow on it. Wasn\u2019t like the sage, rocks, cactus, and Lorelei James</p><p>scrub pines were unique. Yet, for some reason, those elements served to hide this area well.</p><p>He and Dag had discovered this place one year when they\u2019d drifted off West land. They\u2019d likened themselves to Lewis and Clark\u2014explorers, discoverers, adventurers. Every year after that, they\u2019d load up the horses, basic supplies and spend a couple days roughing it. Fishing. Bullshitting. Planning. Later in their teen years, they drank like fish as they fished, bullshitted, and bragged about their future plans.</p><p>Dag had dreams of becoming a rodeo star. Living in California.</p><p>Colt was one of the few who hadn\u2019t laughed at Dag or his dreams because Dag might actually get to live his fantasy. Whereas Colt knew he\u2019d never have that choice. He\u2019d live on the McKay Ranch for the rest of his life.</p><p>Thinking back on those times, Colt realized he\u2019d been happy in that knowledge. That surety. He didn\u2019t have to choose a career; his heritage had chosen it for him.</p><p>So when had that security become a bad thing? When had he started resenting all he had? All he was? He wished he could pinpoint the exact moment. Attribute his sour attitude to an event, or a slight, or an epiphany. But he couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d just woken up one day, and his first thought wasn\u2019t, I\u2019d better get cracking, I have a lot to do, it was, Fuck this. When the hell did I sign on for manual labor, every goddamn day for the rest of my life? When did I decide I didn\u2019t want to travel and see the world, but I want to view it only from Sundance, Wyoming?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t. And it\u2019d been the first time Colt felt he hadn\u2019t been given a choice. So he\u2019d acted out. Not as a ten-year-old boy, but as a twenty-something man. Drinking, fighting. Resentful of his heritage. Resentful of his family. Feeling...inferior. To Cord, who\u2019d had a kid. To Colby, who\u2019d had a rodeo career. To Cam, who\u2019d been a soldier and a hero. To Carter, who\u2019d gone to college. To his sister, Keely, the precious, precocious, beloved baby girl. To his father, who\u2019d seemed to prefer all his brothers to him.</p><p>No one can make you feel inferior without your permission.</p><p>Easy to hear; hard to believe. All that counseling in rehab made a big deal about turning points. Colt experienced more than a few in his life. Some good, some bad, and he\u2019d reached another one last night. A major one.</p><p>As he\u2019d laid on his bedroll looking at the gorgeous display of stars, listening to the coyotes\u2019 mournful howl, the small animals rustling the underbrush, watching the antelope cautiously approaching the water\u2019s edge, he had that moment of clarity: he was exactly where he wanted to be. He always had been. He was living the life he\u2019d forgotten he\u2019d wanted. Now he needed India in that life on a permanent basis.</p><p>India. Man he loved that woman. Loved her like he never thought he\u2019d love another person. They were great together. Good for each other. They were more than friends, even more than lovers.</p><p>They were soul mates.</p><p>So first order of business after he got home and rid himself of the stench of fish and the great outdoors was to sit down with India for a rational discussion about their future. Pregnant or not, he wanted his ring on her finger and her in his house and bed forever. It was that simple.</p><p>Something startled Laramie and Colt reached for the lead rope.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d He ran his hand down Laramie\u2019s neck.</p><p>Sure enough. The distinctive sound of hoof beats echoed in the canyon walls. Before he could yell out, Laramie shivered. He turned his head and flared his nostrils.</p><p>Only one horse caused that reaction in Laramie: Sheridan, Carson McKay\u2019s mare. The equine pair had successfully bred several times, until Carson took Sheridan out of the breeding program. A fact Laramie hadn\u2019t forgiven Carson, as he tried to bite him or kick him at every opportunity.</p><p>\u201cIs that horse of yours gonna charge me, son? Or is he tied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tie him.\u201d Colt tied Laramie to a good-sized pine and ignored the stallion\u2019s angry snorts. \u201cI\u2019m hopin\u2019 you didn\u2019t come lookin\u2019 for me because there\u2019s some kind of emergency at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Everything is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me? I didn\u2019t tell anyone where I was goin\u2019.</p><p>Didn\u2019t think anyone knew about this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always come here when you need some thinkin\u2019 time.\u201d His dad didn\u2019t look at him as he tied Sheridan to a tree, away from Laramie. \u201cI\u2019m probably the only one who knows this is where you spent that week after Dag died.\u201d</p><p>Guilty. He\u2019d never told anyone where he\u2019d gone. It surprised him his dad had known.</p><p>\u201cSo am I in trouble?\u201d Jesus. Sounded stupid to say. He was a grown man, not a disobedient boy.</p><p>\u201cGuess that depends on your idea of trouble.\u201d His dad squinted at him. \u201cYour India came to the house today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was lookin\u2019 for you, but I suspect she came to give your ma what-for.\u201d Carson gestured to the log and they both sat facing the water. \u201cDid you know your mother stopped in and had a chat with India at her tattoo shop this week?\u201d</p><p>Colt managed a terse, \u201cNo,\u201d through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t either. I doubt I coulda stopped her if I woulda known. That woman gets her mind set on something...\u201d He huffed.</p><p>\u201cEvidently they had harsh words. India said she didn\u2019t need our approval to date you. She didn\u2019t see where Caro got off tryin\u2019 to tell her what kind of man you are, when she doesn\u2019t really know you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIndy said that? To Ma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Caro was a little stunned. She was even more stunned when India said she agreed with Cam, that we\u2019re all a bunch of idiots and hypocrites. Demanding you change and when you do, not believing that you have.\u201d His dad picked up a rock and threw it in the pond. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that accusation threw me for a loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Cause it\u2019s true. \u2019Cause we\u2019ve all been pretty selfish for years.</p><p>And yeah, I\u2019m includin\u2019 myself in that group. It pisses me off I was so busy judgin\u2019 you, that I didn\u2019t see what was happenin\u2019 right in my own damn family. Saw your brothers had followed my lead and were wrongly judgin\u2019 you too. It took Cam to bring it to a head.\u201d He scowled. \u201cAlthough, now that I think back, Keely mentioned something along those same lines, what\u2019s the point in changin\u2019 if no one believes you can.\u201d He shot Colt a sidelong glance. \u201cI\u2019ll admit she was right. To you. Be no livin\u2019 with that girl if I admit it to her.\u201d</p><p>Colt smiled.</p><p>\u201cSon, I\u2019m just gonna say this flat out. You know I ain\u2019t a spillin\u2019 my guts kinda man. I\u2019m better at showin\u2019 my feelings than my dad was, but I ain\u2019t nearly the father I oughta be. I know that, especially when I see how good Cord and Colby and Carter are with their boys. I\u2019m damn proud of them. They\u2019re good fathers and good men. I struggle with wantin\u2019 to be more like that even now that you kids are all grown.\u201d</p><p>Would his father gloss over and say something nice about him...just to have something positive to say?</p> <p>\u201cYet, of all my boys, I feel I failed you the most.\u201d</p><p>Thud. The other boot officially dropped.</p><p>\u201cNot because you hit bottom. Not because of the alcohol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d Colt demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re too goddamn much like me for your own goddamn good. You have been since the day you slid outta your mama, all wide-eyed, cooin\u2019 charm and smilin\u2019.\u201d He paused. \u201cKnow the first thing Caro said to me after she gave birth to Cam? You must\u2019ve been about two and a half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me love Colt more than the other boys. I thought it was some weird hormonal pregnancy talk, so I kinda patted her on the hand and told her it\u2019d be all right. But she was insistent I understand. Musta been mother\u2019s intuition because she knew from the get-go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew that you\u2019re a carbon copy of me. People say that of Cord, but it ain\u2019t true. You look like me, you act like me, hell, you probably even think like me. Caro knew every time she looked at you...she\u2019d see me. See my strengths and faults and want to fix the bad ones and bolster the good ones. Caro knew she\u2019d play favorites.</p><p>She knew she\u2019d let you get away with anything, so she left it up to me to even things up.\u201d</p><p>Colt was absolutely tongue-tied.</p><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, it chaps my ass, her passin\u2019 the buck to me. I ended up bein\u2019 harder on you than I shoulda been. Harder on you than I was on your brothers, that\u2019s for damn sure. Expected more outta you too. And if you did something wrong, goddamn if I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019d done something wrong. And when you did something right?\u201d His laugh was bitter. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t heap praise on you, now did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme finish. As things changed, we expanded the ranch, you showed us all up by buyin\u2019 land we all scoffed at and forged your own way. Then your brothers came home, and I shoulda taken you aside. Made sure you knew how important you were\u2014are\u2014to the ranch and to me. But I shoulda warned you too. I knew you were drinkin\u2019 too much. I knew you were whorin\u2019 around. Thing was, I didn\u2019t know them things because I\u2019d been listenin\u2019 to gossip. I knew them things because I\u2019d lived them.\u201d</p> <p>Not another back in my day lecture, Colt thought.</p><p>\u201cYour uncles and I were the original McKay hellraisers. I was the worst of the lot. I drank too much, smoked pot, drove my truck like a fuckin\u2019 idiot, charmed my way into the pants of every woman that\u2019d have me\u2014married, single, old, young, if they had a pussy they were fair game.\u201d</p><p>Colt reached behind the log and handed his dad a bottle of water. The man\u2019s mouth had to be parched with the way he was babbling on. It was as scary as it was fascinating.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Carson took a long pull off the bottle. \u201cOh, and you\u2019ll get a kick outta this. I told my old man to fuck off.</p><p>Repeatedly. Told him I didn\u2019t give a shit about his stupid piece of Wyoming dirt. I just wanted to get the hell away from him because he was a mean, old bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. What did Grandpop say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold me to get my ass back on the tractor and finish mowin\u2019 the south hay field because I had no choice. The McKay Ranch was my only choice. I imagine you must\u2019ve felt that way a time or two yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, about that time, I met your mother. I ain\u2019t gonna get graphic and gooey, but sweet baby Jesus, did I want that woman in the worst way. She was an innocent eighteen-year-old beauty. I was a hard-edged, twenty-four-year-old cowboy who got by on charm and looks and lived to raise hell. I convinced her to marry me, over her family\u2019s objections, over my family\u2019s objections, hell, over everyone\u2019s objections.</p><p>\u201cSad to say, I didn\u2019t change once we said them vows. I still drank. I still went to the bars and fought anyone who looked at me cross-eyed. And if they looked at your mother? I tried to kill them. I still did whatever the hell I wanted, whenever I wanted. Within three years we had one baby and one on the way, we were livin\u2019 in a trailer, hand to mouth. She shoulda left me. Many times. I thank the heavens she didn\u2019t because she\u2019s the only one who could ever get through to me when I hit rock bottom.\u201d</p><p>The idea of his staid, gruff, in control father, hitting rock bottom, startled Colt into blurting out, \u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. I\u2019ve been there, son. More than once, sad to say.</p><p>Didn\u2019t know that about your old dad, didja?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Caro\u2019s pulled me up by the bootstraps every time I fell and covered my ass. \u2019Bout the time you rolled around, I\u2019d gotten my ducks in a row, became the responsible man I needed to be. And ain\u2019t it ironic that you were around that same age when you saw the writin\u2019 on the wall?\u201d</p><p>He took another drink.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m sayin\u2019 is I\u2019m proud of you, Colton. You\u2019re a stronger man than I ever was. What you done, you done on your own. As much as I admire that, I wish it hadn\u2019t played out that way.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. I wish I coulda been a bigger man and a better father and not let you deal with so much shit on your own.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t you dare cry. Be a man.</p><p>Fuck all if he wouldn\u2019t shed a tear when he\u2019d just gotten everything he\u2019d ever wanted from the man he admired most in the world.</p><p>A gentle breeze wafted by, filled with the scents of sage and dirt, of horseflesh and water. Smells he\u2019d always associate with home.</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t look at his dad because he suspected the man wasn\u2019t completely dry-eyed. He allowed a couple minutes to compose themselves before he cleared his throat. \u201cThanks, Dad. I needed to hear it as much as you needed to say it. We\u2019re both livin\u2019 proof that people can change. And it can stick.\u201d</p><p>He kicked a clod of dirt. \u201cWill you give us all another chance?</p><p>I figure, maybe it\u2019s time we worked to earn your trust instead of the other way around.\u201d</p><p>Colt didn\u2019t mention his brothers had already come to that determination. \u201cIt\u2019d be good for all of us to start fresh. It\u2019s been a long time comin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And if you wanna take a month off and go to Hawaii, then so be it. You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d His dad turned and smiled.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course, part of me is hopin\u2019 you\u2019ll be there on your honeymoon with India. I like that little gal. She\u2019s a spitfire. Gotta say, it takes real guts to confront mama bear Carolyn McKay about one of her cubs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a deathwish,\u201d Colt muttered. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia said her piece. Caro said hers, something about India surpassing her expectations and being exactly the type of woman you needed. They both started cryin\u2019 and carryin\u2019 on and were best pals by the time I hightailed it outta there.\u201d Carson stood and scratched his head. \u201cNow I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m gonna come in from checkin\u2019 cattle someday and hear my wife\u2019s gone to town and gotten herself a tattoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTattoos aren\u2019t bad, but look out for the piercings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, there\u2019s just some stuff I don\u2019t wanna know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Colt unsaddled Laramie and brushed him down. He was dragging the packs to the back door when he saw her motorcycle parked in the driveway. He dropped everything and tore around the side of the house.</p><p>India sat on the steps, head in her hands, looking lost.</p><p>But she was here.</p><p>\u201cIndy?\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up. \u201cColt!\u201d She dropped the bundle in her hand, leapt to her feet and ran. Launched herself straight into his arms and peppered his face with kisses. \u201cI missed you, you dickhead. I missed you so goddamn much. Don\u2019t you ever ever ever take off and leave me like that again, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. He laughed and swung her around until she started laughing too.</p><p>\u201cOh God, stop. I\u2019m dizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I gotcha.\u201d He sat on the steps with India straddled on his lap. He picked up the bundle and it jingled. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA present. I realized I never did any romantic dating type crap for you. I didn\u2019t bake you cookies, or surprise you with a picnic\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the caramel incident counts as romantic. So does the whipped cream. And you showin\u2019 up buck-assed nekkid except for a pair of boots counts as the height of romantic behavior.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah? Anyway, I wanted to give you something tangible, so I brought you a bag of tokens from the pizza place in Moorcroft where we had our first date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a token of your affection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty pun-tastic, huh?\u201d She gave him a small head butt. \u201cSee?</p> <p>I knew you\u2019d get it. You know me so well, Colt. Better than anyone ever has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes. So you have to know my meeting with Ginger Paulson\u2014\u201d</p><p>India put her fingers over his lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain. I was a jerk. I trust you. Period.\u201d</p><p>He nipped her fingertips. \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you anyway. Her son Hayden is Buck\u2019s little buddy. Hayden wanted to do something special for Buck, and Ginger thought I could give them some ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. So now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you need to listen,\u201d India blurted. \u201cFirst, I\u2019m sorry. For not defending you, for acting like a lump of shit when Cat spewed all those horrible things about you. I lashed out at you when I should\u2019ve lashed out at her. It\u2019ll never happen again and I\u2019ll beat the living shit out of anyone who casts doubts on your character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding my mother?\u201d</p><p>India snorted. \u201cShe\u2019s not afraid to come out swinging, that\u2019s for damn sure. But then again, neither am I. It surprised her that I\u2019d fight for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little extreme, but apology accepted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond, it was a cheap shot, questioning your commitment to sobriety after our fight. I should be your safe harbor, not the crashing waves dragging you down.\u201d India fiddled with the button on his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m the one who had doubts about whether I could hold it together after you left. I, ah, had to call Bert.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh Indy.\u201d He rested his forehead to hers. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow? Yeah. Then? No. I was a mess. I needed help. I wasn\u2019t too proud to ask for it. That...feeling had been building for a while and I ignored it. So the near relapse reminded me I\u2019d gotten cocky. I thought I had addiction whupped, but I don\u2019t. I never will.\u201d</p><p>Colt knew no matter what his dad thought about Colt being strong enough to fight his addictions on his own, he never would\u2019ve made it this far if it hadn\u2019t been for India. And he was good with that.</p><p>\u201cLastly, the reason I asked for space was because it freaked me out when I realized we had unprotected sex more than once at my most fertile time. Making that chart gave me a plan of attack so I was fully prepared for if we dodged the baby bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the marks for the following month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Xs for the next month were so I\u2019d know when I went on the pill, which days we\u2019d have to use condoms until the pill was at full effect.\u201d</p><p>Now that Colt thought about it...the charts shouldn\u2019t have surprised him. That was exactly what India always did, planned for every contingency. \u201cYou want to go on the pill? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like sex without a condom. Which is the whole big \u2018oops\u2019 issue we have to deal with now, because we didn\u2019t use a condom, like three times, so I might already be pregnant.\u201d She searched his eyes. \u201cYou know I didn\u2019t do it on purpose, right? I\u2019d never take that choice away from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. And it wasn\u2019t just you, Indy, it was both of us throwing caution into the wind. If you\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re pregnant.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be a big oops in my mind anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister has little kids; my brothers have little kids. It\u2019d be a great opportunity for them to grow up around family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your reasoning? We should have a baby so our kid will have cousins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That ain\u2019t the reason.\u201d Colt cupped her face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cThe reason is...I love you, India. I\u2019ve loved you almost from the first moment I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t fall for you because you were my sponsor and my lifeline to sobriety. I fell for you because you\u2019re you. You\u2019re everything to me. You have been for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod. Colt. Why didn\u2019t you tell me? We wasted so much time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The last thing our time together was, was wasted. Don\u2019t you think there was a reason we didn\u2019t date other people after we met? Because we were already a couple. Platonic? Yes. But that don\u2019t make the years we spent together any less real or any less meaningful. In fact, I think it makes them more real because we know each other. Straight down to the bone.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t attempt to hide her tears.</p><p>\u201cIndy, you\u2019re my best friend. I love you. I\u2019m in love with you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. This is the real deal, sugar. I\u2019m asking you to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. God yes. A million times yes. Colton West McKay, I love you so much.\u201d India kissed him. So sweetly. So perfectly. With so much love and unbridled emotion he felt tears springing to his eyes for the second time in a day.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside.\u201d He set her on her feet and stood. Inside the house he spun her around.</p><p>She placed her hand on his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re so serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve shown you trust me in everything you do, and everything you are to me. It\u2019s time for me to do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me a little.\u201d India reached up and cupped his face in her hands. \u201cTalk to me. What\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d</p><p>Breathe. You can do this.</p><p>\u201cKnow that trust exercise you\u2019ve been after me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>She never looked away from him. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, India led him into an open area in the living room and she stood behind him.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross your arms over your chest. Close your eyes. When you\u2019re ready, fall back. Straight back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you have to trust me. I\u2019ll catch you. I promise. Even if you fall, I\u2019ll pick you up.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in his life, Colt didn\u2019t have a moment\u2019s hesitation about who to trust.</p><p>He closed his eyes and let go. </p> </body></html>"]
