M. Shea</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>When the hellhound howled, Stil climbed a tree. Branches scratched at his face, and the cold wind further chilled his wet clothes. He positioned himself on a branch, held his breath and clung to the tree trunk. The dull thud of horse hooves pounded in the forest like a war drum. When the animal snorted, its nostrils flared like an ember, placing the beast and its rider three trees over.</p> <p>Stil\u2019s lungs ached as he watched the horse paw at the ground. He was almost to the border. He couldn\u2019t be caught now!</p><p>The hound howled again, the noise traveling away from Stil. The mount and rider retreated, cantering after the hound in the darkness of night.</p><p>When Stil could no longer hear the horse, he gasped for air. His chest heaved as he climbed down. He wanted to sit and rest, but he couldn\u2019t take the chance. The rider would be back. Stil needed to get across the border and into Verglas before then.</p><p>Leaves crunched under Stil\u2019s feet as he blindly made his way through the forest, his soaked cloak sticking to him like slug slime.</p><p>As Stil slunk along, he snatched up a leaf and rubbed it between his hands. It turned into the finest silver before cracking and twisting, shaping into an intricate snowflake the size of Stil\u2019s thumbnail.</p> <p>\u201cHome,\u201d he whispered before blowing on the magic-made snowflake. It glowed and lifted out of Stil\u2019s hand, twirling and gliding through the air like real snow.</p><p>Stil almost lost sight of it several times. The snowflake was tossed through the dark forest by the rough wind and torrential rains like a toy boat bobbing on an angry ocean, but the tiny beacon of light led Stil closer to Verglas\u2014closer to safety.</p><p>The snowflake bobbed ahead, and Stil smiled when he saw the silvery blue light of the Verglas border, glowing in response to his magic.</p><p>A short distance behind him the hound howled.</p><p>Stil gave up all pretenses of stealth and ran, the heavy pants of the hound snapping at his heels. Lightning illuminated the forest, and Stil barely avoided a fallen tree.</p><p>The border was within reach when the hound caught up. It snapped down on Still\u2019s arm, yanking the mage off his feet.</p> <p>The dog wasn\u2019t a normal hunting animal. It was a hellhound\u2014huge, dangerous, and deadly. Red foam dripped from its mouth as it clenched Stil\u2019s arm, breaking his skin and drawing blood. The hound snarled. Its eyes glowed red in the darkness, and deeper in the forest the horse screamed an answer.</p><p>Stil kicked at the canine\u2019s chest and grabbed a handful of mud. \u201cBe rock,\u201d he said between clenched teeth as the pounding of horse hooves drew closer. The mud hardened into rock, and Stil bashed it against the hellhound\u2019s skull. The hound staggered, but it bit down harder on Stil\u2019s arm. Stil held in a shout and hammered on the animal\u2019s skull, using the rock like a mallet.</p><p>The hound let go, snarling and shaking its head. Stil stumbled backwards over a stump, which sent him crashing head over heels to the muddy forest floor.</p><p>Lightning flashed again, illuminating the nightmare when it arrived, carrying its rider. The nightmare was a horse\u2014if it could be called that\u2014which fed on nightmares and craved absolute darkness. It was skeletal, but its nostrils glowed, and its eyes were the same white as spoiled milk. It screamed (a sound more similar to glass breaking than the neigh of a horse) and gnashed its abnormally sharp teeth before its rider pulled it back.</p><p>\u201cCraftmage,\u201d the rider hissed.</p><p>Stil reached into his soaked clothes and slapped a red feather on the soaked stump. \u201cIgnite!\u201d he shouted before rolling away.</p><p>Even though it was old and saturated, the stump exploded into a roaring fire.</p><p>The horse spooked and shied away from the dazzling flames, shrieking in pain as the light burned its eyes.</p> <p>Stil leapt out of his roll and ran forward, his eyes hooked on the glimmering Verglas border. Behind him the rider growled, kicking the nightmare forward. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, the mount edged around the stump and chased after Stil, closing in for the kill. When Stil could almost feel the nightmare\u2019s sulfur-scented breath on the back of his neck, he threw himself forward, diving across the Verglas border as the nightmare lunged for him. Stil hit the ground just as ice crunched, and giant stalagmites popped out of the ground\u2014almost impaling the nightmare with sword-sharp tips and edges.</p><p>The rider reined in the nightmare as the ice wall formed, popping and cracking as more ice and snow gathered to create an impenetrable barrier that glowed unnaturally. The rider could travel up and down the Verglas border until his mount dropped with exhaustion, but he would never get inside. The Snow Queen\u2019s magic wouldn\u2019t let him set foot inside the country. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The nightmare screamed in rage on the other side of the ice wall. He turned his mount around and galloped back into Loire.</p><p>Stil chuckled between gulps of air. He forced himself to sit upright. He was soaked, and his arm was injured. The rain spattered his face as he dug through his cloak. When he found what he was looking for\u2014a ruby cut in the shape of a flame\u2014he breathed on it, sighing in relief when the charm activated and heat seeped into his body.</p><p>Stil stumbled to his feet and started in the direction of his temporary home. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Stil said, pushing his sopping hair out of his face. \u201cWhat merit is there in hunting me?\u201d</p><p>Gemma ran her hand over fabrics and cloth. Her fingers lingered on the bolts of violet-colored velvet and blush-red silk brocade. Her forehead furrowed she internally paged through patterns and dress styles like a child flipping through a picture book.</p> <p>Lady Linnea would look fetching in the violet velvet, which would offset her blonde hair. However, red brocade was the rage in Loire thanks to Princess Elle, who wore many gowns made of rose-red material.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s mind raced with the various styles she could design using the fabrics, but her mind was made up when she caught sight of the length of snow-white fur.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the fur, all of the violet velvet, and some more white linen,\u201d Gemma told the merchant as she tugged on the desired materials.</p><p>\u201cThis is to go on the Lovland\u2019s account?\u201d the merchant asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma said. She nodded in acknowledgment to the villager that entered the store\u2014she knew him well. As a child, she had played often with his flat-nosed daughter who had a penchant for pinching. \u201cI might be back for the silk brocade, too.\u201d</p> <p>The merchant recorded Gemma\u2019s purchase. \u201cIt\u2019s a good cloth. You\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want the grey silk?\u201d</p><p>Gemma glanced at the described material. The silk was well made, and the color was a subdued dove gray, but that shade would make Lady Linnea resemble a pale ghost. \u201cIt\u2019s not the right cloth for Lady Linnea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but it would look stunning with your eyes,\u201d the merchant said with a winning smile.</p><p>Caught off guard, Gemma blinked twice. \u201cPerhaps, but I don\u2019t need a dress made of silk. It wouldn\u2019t survive my week. This is all I want for now,\u201d she said, resting her hand on the new material before wrapping her purchases with worn linen.</p><p>\u201cOf course, of course. You be careful walking home, Miss Kielland. Mind the weather, you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Until next time,\u201d Gemma said before she left the tiny store, hauling her fabrics on her back.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Gemma,\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mrs. Hagen,\u201d Gemma said to the older woman as they scurried through the village square.</p><p>\u201cMaking another dress for Lady Linnea, are you?\u201d the older woman asked, her plump lips set in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cThat is what she employs me for,\u201d Gemma said as they hurried past an empty fountain.</p><p>\u201cFrivolous, I say,\u201d Mrs. Hagen grunted. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you took up clothes making. Your mother used to make the most beautiful quilts. Everyone needs quilts in this frigid place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should think everyone needs clothes, too, Mrs. Hagen,\u201d Gemma said, \u201cor the city would be a blinding and chilly place to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would WHAT?\u201d Mrs. Hagen exclaimed. \u201cChild, you sound just like Guri these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs. Hagen,\u201d Gemma said.</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a compliment. So, Miss Gemma, when will you pursue a real livelihood? You cannot live off Lady Linnea\u2019s charity forever. After all, who needs fashion and dresses in a country of snow and a mad\u2014,\u201d Mrs. Hagen cut herself off and looked furtively in the direction of the Verglas palace.</p><p>No one called King Torgen mad, even though he clearly was, if they wanted to survive.</p><p>Gemma and Mrs. Hagen reached the perimeter of the village square. In summers, the square used to house outdoor markets. But that was years ago. Now it was used to publically execute whatever poor sop King Torgen decided to kill on a whim.</p><p>\u201cI enjoy making dresses and clothes,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cSo, buy a doll,\u201d Mrs. Hagen said, her moist eyes sourly directed to Gemma\u2019s cloth purchases.</p><p>Gemma smiled insincerely. \u201cPerhaps one day. But for now, I must bid you good day, Mrs. Hagen,\u201d she said, bobbing a curtsey.</p><p>\u201cGood day to you, Gemma,\u201d Mrs. Hagen said before Gemma sped up her walking pace until she was all but trotting. It was a survival technique. Most of the Ostfold gossips did not have the lung capacity to speak and run at the same time.</p><p>Gemma hurried home, taking a twisting path to Lady Linnea\u2019s house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The grand manor was situated closer to the village square than it was to the palace. It was a short walk in the cool, fall air before Gemma arrived. Several flags flew from the flagpole, marking the three additional noble families staying with Lady Linnea\u2019s parents instead of risking the palace.</p><p>Gemma slipped in through the back entrance, avoiding the chaotic mess of the kitchen. She climbed a servants\u2019 staircase and slipped into her workroom\u2014which was a sea of lavish cloth and held the great luxury of a fireplace.</p><p>Gemma rang the bell to summon a scullery maid before she unwrapped her materials and splayed them out over a workbench.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something, Gemma?\u201d a scullery maid asked, poking her head in the room.</p> <p>\u201cSissel\u2014perfect. I was hoping it would be you. Could you get a fire started, please?\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d Sissel said, darting for the fireplace. In minutes she had the fireplace cleaned and lit, warming the room to a toasty temperature.</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>Gemma snapped a knotted rope. \u201cNo. Stand, please.\u201d</p><p>Wide-eyed, Sissel stood, brushing off her ash-smeared smock.</p> <p>Gemma walked around the scullery maid, brandishing her rope. She maneuvered Sissel\u2019s arms, measuring them and her shoulder width. \u201cThank you, Sissel,\u201d Gemma said after making a complete circuit around her.</p><p>\u201cSissel? Sissel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Gemma,\u201d Sissel said, bolting for the door.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Malfrid, the head maid, said. \u201cCook needs you in the kitchen. Get a move on!\u201d the red-faced woman said, folding her formidable arms across her chest. In this pose, she resembled a cream puff in her brown and white uniform.</p><p>\u201cShe was helping me, Malfrid,\u201d Gemma said, but Sissel was already gone, pounding down the servants\u2019 stairs.</p><p>\u201cHmph, no wonder,\u201d Malfrid said, strolling into Gemma\u2019s workroom. \u201cMust be nice to be paid to sit around a room and do little.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it? I wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Gemma said, writing Sissel\u2019s measurements on a small slate.</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m hired because I\u2019m good at what I do\u2014not because I\u2019m a personal friend of Lady Linnea,\u201d Malfrid said.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about that ever happening to you\u2014with Lady Linnea or anyone else,\u201d Gemma said, snagging a pin cushion.</p><p>Malfrid went stiff as she tried to figure out if Gemma was insulting her or not. \u201cTale-teller,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cIf I told tales, I wouldn\u2019t put up with your presence,\u201d Gemma said, picking up a scissors. \u201cNow if you don\u2019t mind, I have a dress to make,\u201d she said, pointedly staring at the door.</p><p>\u201cYou might be proud of yourself, Gemma Kielland. But you\u2019re nothing but a chicken borrowing turkey feathers,\u201d Malfrid said before storming out of the room.</p><p>\u201cPeacock feathers. You mean I\u2019m borrowing peacock feathers,\u201d Gemma called after the stocky maid, although her attention was focused on the fabrics spread across her workbench.</p><p>Most dressmakers would draw out a dress before they started making it. At the very least, they would measure out the material. Not Gemma. She could tell where to cut and exactly how to stitch fabrics together.</p> <p>Gemma worked in silence, her eyes\u2014an unnerving mash of gray and blue so pale, they looked like river ice\u2014narrowed in concentration. Her tea-brown hair spilled around her head in wavy, messy, shoulder-length ringlets\u2014the ends twisted up in curls that no amount of brushing could undo. Her heart-shaped face was highlighted by the blue hair-band peppered with snowflake embroidery that ran across her forehead and pushed her hair away from her face.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s button nose twitched as she cut the last piece of pricey fabric, and the door to her workroom opened.</p><p>\u201cGemma, I see you are hard at work,\u201d Lady Lovland, Lady Linnea\u2019s mother, said as she entered the room. Her daughter and a lady\u2019s maid trailed her like lap-dogs.</p><p>\u201cYes, My Lady,\u201d Gemma said, setting her scissors aside so she could curtsey to the gentlewoman.</p><p>\u201cThat is beautiful fabric. It will look stunning on you\u2014wouldn\u2019t you agree, Linnea?\u201d Lady Lovland said, picking up the violet fabric and holding it out to her daughter.</p><p>Lady Linnea resembled a statue of ice as her mother held the velvet against her blonde hair.</p><p>\u201cIt will accent the blue of Lady Linnea\u2019s eyes,\u201d the lady\u2019s maid, Jentine, said after several moments of awkward silence. Jentine was an older woman with silver hair and deep smile lines around her mouth. She usually treated Gemma well, probably because she knew Grandmother Guri. \u201cI think it will complement her greatly. An excellent choice, Gemma,\u201d Jentine said, giving Gemma a warm smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhich reminds me, I am most pleased with the newest dress you made for Linnea,\u201d Lady Lovland said. \u201cThe train is quite pretty, and the embroidery around the neckline is beautifully done. Didn\u2019t you think so, too, darling?\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea acknowledged the comment with a slight tip of her head.</p><p>\u201cThank you, My Lady,\u201d Gemma said, curtsying again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lady Linnea went on, imitating a statue and not looking at Gemma.</p><p>Gemma pushed her blue headband further up her forehead as Lady Linnea all but turned her back to Gemma. \u201cWhen it is convenient, I shall need to measure Lady Linnea again. I wish to try a new gathering at the waist, and I must be positive my measurements are precise,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lady Lovland said, elegantly flicking her fingers at her daughter. \u201cLinnea is free now, I believe. Will you stay, Linnea?\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea kept her face a perfect mask of porcelain as she curtseyed.</p> <p>\u201cWonderful. We will leave you girls to it. Come, Jentine. I can hear little Karl screaming in the nursery. I should collect him, lest he aggravate our guests,\u201d Lady Loveland said.</p><p>\u201cYes, My Lady,\u201d Jentine said, following the elegant lady out of the room.</p><p>Gemma listened to their steps fade down the hallway as Lady Linnea stood in the middle of the small room like a carving. When Gemma nudged the door shut, Linnea\u2019s shoulders heaved.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d Lady Linnea said, flopping into a chair like a tired child. \u201cI thought I would never be free of Mama this morning. She spent all of breakfast hounding me to improve my embroidery,\u201d Lady Linnea said, her face scrunching up.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to dancing?\u201d Gemma asked, returning to her workbench to start pinning the fabric pieces together.</p> <p>\u201cShe says I\u2019ve mastered it\u2014which is hardly fair, because you are right: some of the more elaborate steps and turns can be used in swordplay. Speaking of which...\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea scrambled out of her chair and ran to the fireplace. A short sword was carefully hidden, tucked into the side of the fireplace. Lady Linnea unsheathed the sword. \u201cI only feel alive when I\u2019m holding a weapon,\u201d she said, reverently holding the sword in front of her.</p><p>\u201cBe more careful while practicing, My Lady. That last rip in your dress was in an awkward spot. It was difficult to patch,\u201d Gemma said, threading a needle with ease.</p><p>Lady Linnea swept the sword through the air in several different practice moves before she sheathed the sword and thumped across the room to look over Gemma\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNo petticoats?\u201d she asked, her voice hopeful.</p><p>\u201cNo petticoats,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cThe gown parts in the front and back. Publically it is to show the lacework on the kirtle, but the kirtle splits in areas where the gown sits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I will be able to move easier? Gemma, you are a genius,\u201d Lady Linnea said, turning away from the workbench, satisfied with Gemma\u2019s explanation. \u201cMama thinks you might be one of the best seamstresses in Verglas, but she doesn\u2019t even know the brilliant changes you make to your dresses for me,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p> <p>The young lady drew a dagger from deep inside the wide sleeves of her dress\u2014Gemma\u2019s design, including the dagger sheath stitched into the upper arm\u2014and stuck it in a wood chair to serve as a target before she began thrusting her sword at it in various military maneuvers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored to hear that,\u201d Gemma said, the words spilled from her lips automatically as she worked with the velvet material.</p><p>\u201cAre the servants and villagers getting after you again?\u201d Lady Linnea said, casting Gemma a sympathetic look over her shoulder before landing a sweeping blow on the abused chair.</p><p>\u201cA little. They remain uncreative and repetitive as ever, accusing me of doing little work or nothing at all,\u201d Gemma said, cocking her head as she studied the velvet before pawing through a basket of thread spools.</p><p>\u201cIgnore them. They\u2019re silly nitwits who haven\u2019t got a clue how talented you are. Why, Papa was furious when Lady Selberg tried to hire you out from under us for her daughter. Thank you for staying, by the way. I don\u2019t know who else would sew pockets in my winter muff for my daggers! I only hope Mama offered to pay you enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than enough, My Lady.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea attacked the chair for a few more minutes before she sighed and straightened up. \u201cI have some bad news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKing Torgen denied Papa\u2019s request to return to Loire to continue with his ambassador duties,\u201d Lady Linnea said, knitting her hands together as her shoulders fell in an unseemly slump.</p><p>Gemma shrugged. \u201cI expected he would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take the news better than I did,\u201d Lady Linnea sighed. \u201cI\u2019m dying to leave this place. Loire wouldn\u2019t be so bad\u2014Prince Severin runs a marvelous military, even if he doesn\u2019t allow females to join the army\u2014but Mother would never let me escape from her grasp. She frets too much over my reputation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you ever return to Loire, I imagine she will let up some,\u201d Gemma said, comparing threads to the violet fabric. \u201cWasn\u2019t she more relaxed when you lived there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that was four years ago\u2014before I grew to a marriageable age. Mama locks me up when we are in Verglas from fear that King Torgen will force me to marry a Verglas noble. She has her heart set on a obtaining a Loire son-in-law,\u201d Lady Linnea said, sighing in disgust. \u201cI would much rather be in Farset. Have I ever told you they have female captains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral dozen times, My Lady,\u201d Gemma acknowledged as she tossed thread spools aside and returned to digging through the basket of spools.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky, Gemma. You don\u2019t have to worry about marriage,\u201d Lady Linnea said. \u201cI want to leave this frozen place so badly it makes my heart ache.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so terrible,\u201d Gemma said, pausing to look outside. The northern mountains were visible in the bright sunshine. \u201cOur government might be less than desirable, but the country is pretty. I like the Snow Queen\u2019s residual magic and the way it makes everything clean and white with snow.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea shivered. \u201cYou are part caribou,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you wanted to come to Loire with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Gemma said. Her sharp, ageless eyes softened to match the childish-ness of her heart-shaped face. \u201cPrince Lucien is said to wear the most daring ensembles, and with Princess Elle established as a fashion idol, it is a wonderful place for a seamstress to visit,\u201d she said. She smiled for a moment and added, \u201cThat being said, any country would do. I want to see how the Erlauf dressmakers counter Princess Cinderella\u2019s red hair, and I\u2019ve heard incredible stories about the shoemakers of Trieux.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known you would come with me only because of fashion, not because of our friendship,\u201d Lady Linnea said, sliding her sword back in its scabbard. \u201cUnfortunately, it seems we aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can wait,\u201d Gemma said, returning to her work.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any other choice but to wait. And in the meantime, we\u2019re held captive by the desires of a...\u201d Lady Linnea trailed off. She flattened her lips together as she stared at the royal palace. The tower and walls stretched above all the structures in Ostfold. Once it was to hearten the villagers; now it served more as an intimidation technique.</p><p>\u201cI have some good news that might brighten your mood,\u201d Gemma said, offering the older girl a smile. (It was hard to believe, but Gemma\u2014jaded and sarcastic\u2014was only seventeen. Lady Linnea, bright and full of dreams, was halfway through her eighteenth year.) \u201cI think I\u2019ve finally found a way to waterproof your cloak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good. Last time I returned with a wet cloak, I had to tell Mama I stepped under an emptying chamber pot so she wouldn\u2019t study me to see that I had fallen in the river like a drown rat. That was embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine so, My Lady.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea chatted companionably, discussing foreign armies and the men and women that ruled them, as Gemma started sewing. The pair never dreamed their lives would soon be altered forever.</p><p>Chapter 2</p> <p>Peder the miller was known to be a generally useless man. Although he ground wheat cheaply, the flour he produced was subpar\u2014coarse and prone to mold. His wife was well liked by everyone, and his daughter, Gemma, was nice enough\u2014if not a little stoic and mouthy. Peder, however, was mostly just tolerated and had a reputation as the town drunkard.</p><p>It was customary on any given night to find him in the Sno Hauk\u2014that is, the Snow Hawk tavern\u2014in his usual seat at the corner of the dilapidated bar. For the first half hour of his visit, he customarily chugged pints and complained about picky customers. After consuming enough beer to bring a blush to his cheeks, he often tried flirting with the serving girls and (badly) sang duets with the innkeeper\u2019s youngest son who had a great way with the fiddle.</p><p>If he had enough coin\u2014which was once in a blue moon\u2014he would then partake in a bottle of honey wine. The honey wine always got him roaring and staggering drunk, so everyone, included the barkeep, was glad Peder rarely had the coin to pay for the luxury.</p><p>As such, the other Sno Hauk patrons were less than pleased when, one fall evening, Peder plopped his flabby backside on a stool after slaughtering a Verglas folk song and slapped a gold coin on the bar.</p><p>\u201cBarkeeper!\u201d Peder shouted, his vowels already drawled by the addling effects of beer. \u201cYour best honey wine!\u201d</p><p>The barkeeper, a large, swarthy fellow named Otto, wiped his hands on a ragged cloth. \u201cYou\u2019ve had quite a bit to drink tonight. Ought you not hold on to that coin? You might need it during the winter,\u201d Otto said.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Peder said, a crooked smile planted on his face. \u201cThere will be plenty more where this one came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? How?\u201d Small Tim\u2014who was roughly the size of a bear and was another Sno Hauk regular\u2014asked as Otto held the gold coin up to inspect it in the firelight.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d Otto said after biting it.</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d Peder said. \u201cGave it to her mother\u2014woman can\u2019t hide a thing from me. I\u2019m too smart,\u201d Peder said. He tried to point to his forehead but instead almost jabbed himself in the eye.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did Gemma come by this great fortune?\u201d Big Tim\u2014a stooped older man who used to be the size of a baby giant but had shrunk in his old age\u2014asked.</p><p>\u201cShe finished a dress for her great mistress,\u201d Peder said, rolling his eyes. \u201c\u2018Parrently the lady liked it so much she gave it to her on top of room and board.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA gold coin for a dress?\u201d Small Tim thundered.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Peder said. \u201cWhere\u2019s my honey wine?\u201d</p><p>Otto cast the drunkard a look of pity. \u201cAre you sure you do not want to keep it? I doubt Lady Linnea would often repeat such kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope! Gemma\u2019s getting paid every time now. Some other noble tried hiring her, but the Lovlands like Gemma so much they said they would pay if she stayed,\u201d Peder said, propping his elbows up on the bar. \u201cNow, my honey wine!\u201d</p><p>The floor creaked and groaned as Otto disappeared in a back room.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think Gemma really does for the nobles?\u201d asked Alf\u2014a squinty-eyed man who had an unfortunate resemblance to a weasel.</p><p>\u201cI already said she makes dresses,\u201d Peder said, his forehead creasing.</p><p>\u201cIt is well known that Gemma is the personal seamstress for Lady Linnea,\u201d Big Tom attested.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know for certain,\u201d Alf said, eagerly leaning forward. \u201cThe young lady rarely leaves her house, so nobody\u2019s ever seen these great dresses Gemma is said to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop trying to cause trouble, Alf,\u201d another bar patron warned in a rumbling voice, giving a meaningful glance to the four royal guards who were seated around a table at the back of the room.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t causing no trouble!\u201d Alf said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying sweet Gemma might not be the dressmaker she\u2019s lauded to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you be doubting my daughter,\u201d Peder declared as Otto set his bottle of honey wine in front of him. He ignored the cup Otto presented him with and took a swig directly from the bottle. \u201cShe\u2019s a good girl. I think,\u201d Peder said, blinking as he tried to make his rusty mind work.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s filling Lady Linnea\u2019s ears with gossip about us common folk,\u201d Alf said.</p><p>Peder started to complain, but he was already taking another swig of his wine, which sufficiently distracted him.</p><p>Small Tim, taking pity on the girl who wasn\u2019t present to defend herself, shook his shaggy head. \u201cI\u2019ve known Gemma since she was a wee girl. Gemma wouldn\u2019t carry tales. If she\u2019s not making dresses, it\u2019s likely she\u2019s being paid to keep the poor Lady Linnea company. The lady has been cooped up for the past few years. She must feel like a stall-bound horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma makes dresses,\u201d Big Tim said, firmly. \u201cMy granddaughter Sissel works at the Lovland house, and she\u2019s seen what Gemma makes. She\u2019s a talented girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t believe her talent until I see it with my own eyes,\u201d Alf said.</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s talented!\u201d Peder said, smacking his honey wine on the bar with more force than necessary. \u201cShe\u2019s my daughter! She\u2019s so talented, the Lovlands paid her gold coin to stay,\u201d Peder said, waving a finger at Alf.</p><p>\u201cLike I would believe the words of a drunkard,\u201d Alf said with a contemptuous sneer.</p> <p>\u201cMy Gemma has more talent in one hand than you have in your whole self, Alf Skeie!\u201d Peder said. \u201cWhy, she\u2019s so talented she could work for the King himself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeder, settle down, and enjoy your drink,\u201d Small Tim said, glancing at the soldiers\u2019 table.</p><p>Alf rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re farting with your mouth, Peder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Peder roared.</p><p>\u201cPeder, be quiet, you fool,\u201d Big Tim hissed \u201cNo! Not when someone doubts my fortunes!\u201d Peder said.</p><p>\u201cI was insulting your daughter,\u201d Alf said.</p><p>\u201cThat, too!\u201d Peder said. \u201cGemma could turn rags into the finest linen. She\u2019ll make me rich!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just an old, drunk fool with a beggar daughter,\u201d Alf said.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d Peder shouted, staggering into a standing position and knocking a stool over.</p><p>The rest of the bar patrons quieted down and looked to see what trouble was brewing.</p><p>\u201cYou are just jealous. My daughter is so talented she could, she could...she could spin straw into gold!\u201d Peder declared.</p><p>Alf snorted and opened his mouth to reply, when a stranger clamped a strong hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Alf started, turning around.</p><p>A tall man stood behind him. He wore a plain, black cloak with the hood pulled up. Alf couldn\u2019t see much of the man\u2019s face, but he was harpooned by the man\u2019s odd-colored eyes and strong grip. The stranger held himself like a competent man\u2014or worse, someone important.</p><p>\u201cA drunkard may utter foolishness in his inebriation, but it is a spiteful fool who goads him on. Shut your mouth, or I will shut it for you in retribution for ruining my evening,\u201d the stranger said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d Alf sulked.</p><p>The stranger pushed Alf back in his stool and returned to his spot by the fireplace.</p><p>Alf shivered, and Small Tim shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what you get,\u201d the bear-man said to Alf.</p><p>Peder blinked as he stared at the stranger. \u201cWas that a mage?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Otto rolled his eyes. \u201cNo, Peder. Go back to your drink,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy honey wine!\u201d Peder said, gleefully reaching for his bottle.</p><p>\u201cYes, your honey wine. Next time I see Gemma, I will congratulate her,\u201d Otto said.</p><p>\u201cHear, hear,\u201d Big Tim said, raising his pint.</p><p>No one thought any further of Peder\u2019s loose mouth. No one except for Alf, who sniveled and sulked over his mug.</p> <p>\u201cGemma!\u201d</p><p>Gemma glanced behind her before she darted up an alleyway, carefully holding her basket above her head. She had just enough time to crouch behind a stack of wooden crates before two women\u2014Mrs. Hagen and her neighbor, Mrs. Nystrom\u2014peered down the alleyway, looking like vultures with their hooked noses and bobbing heads.</p><p>\u201cGemma! Where did that girl go?\u201d Mrs. Hagen said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you didn\u2019t see her after all?</p><p>\u201cI did so! She so resembles a broomstick, you can pick her out of a village gathering with ease.\u201d</p><p>Behind the crates, Gemma heaved her eyes to the sky.</p> <p>\u201cThat pert girl puts on airs far above her. She thinks she\u2019s a seamstress!\u201d Mrs. Hagen sniffed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s making good money. My husband is friends with Lars Skeilen, and he said Big Tim said Peder the Miller used a gold coin at the Sno Hauk. He claimed Lady Linnea gave it to Gemma for her services,\u201d Mrs. Nystrom said.</p><p>\u201cMaking money has nothing to do with skill,\u201d Mrs. Hagen snapped. \u201cLord and Lady Lovland likely see her more as a companion for sweet Lady Linnea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. You cannot tell me our Gemma made that beautiful hunter green riding habit Lady Linnea was out in not two weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>She had, actually. Gemma considered standing up and telling the old harpies so, but it would be a waste of breath; she had endured criticism from all of Ostfold since she first got her seamstress position. So instead, Gemma held in an aggravated sigh and rested her head against the crate.</p><p>Go away! Go away! Go away! She thought.</p><p>\u201cThe scoundrel girl, claiming credit for something that isn\u2019t her work,\u201d Mrs. Hagen said, as if she could hear Gemma\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect with a father like Peder?\u201d Mrs. Nystrom asked.</p> <p>Mrs. Hagen grunted. \u201cI suppose you are right. Hm, is that Malfrid over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. She must be out shopping. I wonder what for...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find out,\u201d Mrs. Hagen suggested.</p><p>The older women wandered away from the alley.</p><p>Gemma waited for a few extra seconds before she popped upright. \u201cOld goats,\u201d she said, brushing off her skirts with one hand. She kept her basket secure and pressed against her stomach. The basket was covered with worn linen\u2014an old tablecloth ripped up for rags. Gemma pulled the linen snug before she wound her way farther into Ostfold, taking back alleyways to avoid the more quarrelsome residents.</p><p>Gemma kept walking, leaving the shopping districts for a residential area that housed most of the farmers, animal herders, and many of the servants employed by the King. In the center of the quiet street was a rustic little house. It was short and squat and had four small fir trees growing on the grass roof\u2014which was normally a bright shade of green but was currently brown with fall.</p><p>A sleepy-eyed goat sat on the top of the roof and chewed its cud. Gemma shielded her eyes and called up to the fawn-colored goat, \u201cAre you enjoying the view?\u201d</p><p>The goat baaed.</p><p>Smoke puffed from the chimney like little clouds, and the shutters were painted a delightful shade of pink.</p><p>This was Grandmother Guri\u2019s house.</p><p>Gemma knocked on the door. \u201cIt\u2019s Gemma,\u201d she called, brushing the nose of the intricately carved reindeer that was posed to prance across the door. The reindeer\u2019s nose was smooth and shiny from hundreds of fingers touching it.</p><p>\u201cGemma, my girl! I thought I was about due for a visit. Come in!\u201d a voice inside the house croaked.</p><p>Gemma pushed the door open and stepped into the Grandmother Guri\u2019s home. The familiar scent of singed wood, goat milk soap, bacon, and kanelgifler\u2014cinnamon rolls\u2014wafted through the air.</p><p>Grandmother Guri was stirring a pot. She, like her house, was short and squat. Her long white hair was braided in a halo around her head, and her skin was tan and leathery. She had sharp eyes the color of grey pebbles right after they\u2019re pulled from a riverbed, and the softest hands and the gentlest touch.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Grandmother?\u201d Gemma asked as she set her basket on a table and removed her shawl from her shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood, very good! I would be doing better if Jo-Jo would stop eating my linen napkins in her sleep. Do you hear that, you wretched goat?\u201d Grandmother Guri said, using a broom to hit one of the support beams holding up the roof.</p><p>Jo-Jo baaed, a sound that was audible even through the greenery growing on the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat cheese are you making?\u201d Gemma asked, eyeing the bubbling pot.</p><p>\u201cPrim. I would offer you tea, but I can\u2019t heat a thing until the prim sets into a spread. Would you like milk? Jo-Jo dropped some before she hauled her fat udders onto my roof.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Gemma said, sitting down on a rickety but comfortable wooden chair that was smooth with use. Everything in Grandmother Guri\u2019s house was well-made and old, but majestically beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something,\u201d Gemma said, reaching into her basket.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Grandmother Guri said, squinting in Gemma\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cA jar of Bard\u2019s applesauce,\u201d Gemma said, placing the jar on the table. \u201cI know it\u2019s your favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. As I always say, \u2018It takes a worm to know an apple.\u2019 Thank you, my girl!\u201d Grandmother Guri said, setting Gemma\u2019s mug of milk on the table.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you need help with something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d Gemma asked, sipping the rich goat milk.</p><p>\u201cI may be old, but I\u2019m not stupid. That applesauce is a bribe if I ever saw one. What has you troubled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just come to visit you?\u201d Gemma said, tilting her head as she studied the older woman who had taught her so much.</p><p>\u201cNot unless you\u2019re planning to have a picnic on that mighty fine velvet you have in there,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, sticking her head into Gemma\u2019s basket. \u201cThat color will set off Linnea\u2019s hair just right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think so, too?\u201d Gemma said, her joy breaking through her bland mask, making her smile in delight.</p><p>\u201cMmm, of course. You have my eye for color. Now, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the gown\u2014the velvet\u2014to fluff out without the extra volume of the kirtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy girl, even that noble miss of yours has got to have a kirtle. She can\u2019t go running around like a naked jay bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said she wouldn\u2019t have a kirtle,\u201d Gemma said, not at all scandalized by the phrase that would make most fair maidens blush appealingly. (As previously mentioned, Grandmother Guri had taught her so much. The older woman\u2019s blunt way of speaking stopped shocking Gemma before she was old enough to reach the reindeer carving on the door.) \u201cBut I want to make the dress more mobile, so I planned to make slits in the side. However, I\u2019m not certain the skirts will fill out then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. So she\u2019s still a bloodthirsty miss, then?\u201d Grandmother Guri asked, lifting the violet velvet out of the basket.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to join the army, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever floats your apples. Even nobles are entitled to happiness,\u201d Grandmother Guri said. \u201cGet my sewing basket, would you?\u201d</p> <p>Gemma ran around the table to pick up the massive basket that was weighed down with threads, scissors, needles, pin cushions, and kinds of sewing materials. After she set down the basket, she retrieved an oil lamp to shed more light on the material.</p><p>Grandmother Guri was not related to her\u2014Gemma\u2019s family was one of the few that was not distantly tied to the clever woman\u2014but ever since Grandmother Guri found Gemma crying in a corner of the mill when Guri was coming to pick up her flour order, Grandmother Guri was a part of Gemma\u2019s family. The older woman gave Gemma little gifts for her birthday and the holidays, wiped Gemma\u2019s tears, and mended her hurts. Grandmother Guri even gave Gemma the skill and passion that drove her. She taught Gemma how to sew and continued to help her with the beautiful but complex dress patterns Gemma designed.</p><p>Even if the majority of those in Ostfold didn\u2019t believe in Gemma\u2019s skills at sewing, Grandmother Guri did. And Grandmother Guri was more than enough for Gemma.</p><p>Gemma drank her milk and watched her teacher fold the cloth.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m picturing it right, I think you\u2019ll be fine. The slits shouldn\u2019t compromise the volume too much, unless you\u2019re planning to cut actual chunks out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of it, but that seemed like it would be too obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would. No, your idea should work well. You\u2019ll do drooping cuffs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLined with white fur, yes.\u201d</p><p>Grandmother Guri nodded in approval. \u201cIt should be a pretty sight when you finish it,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, frowning up at the ceiling when Jo-Jo baaed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gemma said. The faint uptick of her lip betrayed how pleased she was.</p><p>\u201cNow. How\u2019s your love life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it loud enough? HOW IS YOUR LOVE LIFE?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandmother,\u201d Gemma frowned.</p><p>\u201cHm? You\u2019re a young and pretty thing; you\u2019re allowed to be in love. Mind you, I\u2019m not sure I know any strapping young men who could match you well,\u201d Grandmother Guri said as she lowered herself into a cushioned chair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMatch me...\u201d Gemma stopped herself from rolling her eyes. Grandmother Guri had explained the saying to her a hundred times.</p><p>\u201cLove is like a pair of horses. They need the same gaits and to be going in the same direction. Our Ostfold boys are handsome, but I don\u2019t think none of \u2018em are heading in the same direction as you,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, tilting her head so she looked like a curious owl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want marriage right now. I don\u2019t feel particularly inclined to have children, either,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ve had the experience already, taking care of your parents as you have,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, squinting up at her roof as the muffled footfalls of her goat moved across the house. \u201cOh\u2014snow beans! If you want an easier but equally as thankless task, get a goat,\u201d she advised. \u201cJo-Jo! You get away from that chimney this instant!\u201d Grandmother Guri shouted.</p> <p>Gemma finished her milk, her eyes crinkling with untold humor.</p><p>\u201cStill, I am surprised no young men have taken to flexing their muscles at you,\u201d Grandmother Guri said.</p><p>Gemma snorted. \u201cWith the town as critical of my job as it is? Any son that looked twice at me would be paddled by his mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too critical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always say a critical person is a sign of weak bones.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is. I wish you wouldn\u2019t be so hard on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also say if wishes were horses, beggars would ride.\u201d</p><p>Grandmother Guri swatted a hand in Gemma\u2019s direction. \u201cYou need to start listening to the important things I say, my girl!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything you say is important, Grandmother.\u201d</p><p>Grandmother Guri gave a great cackle of laughter. \u201cI wish you realized that as a child,\u201d she hooted, but her smile was pleased. \u201cI\u2019m glad you have dreams, my girl. You are a talented seamstress\u2014better than I am, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandmother, no\u2014,\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, now, I can recognize a gift when I see it. It\u2019s true. You have a mind for patterns and clothes I have never seen. I would hate to see you waste it, but I would also hate to see you throw love away if you happen to find your matching partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to find anyone in Ostfold, Grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did I say you had to? Hm? I didn\u2019t! No, what I mean is...you are driven, Gemma. You might not realize you\u2019re looking at your love until it\u2019s too late. So while I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t act like a silly girl and swoon over every boy your age...just be open to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe open to being silly?\u201d Gemma pertly said, her eyebrow jutted up in a look of disbelief that Grandmother Guri often wore.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, smacking Gemma upside the head. \u201cBe open to love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I will. But Grandmother, I am telling you it will take a man of magic to love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make such oaths, my girl,\u201d Grandmother Guri chortled. \u201cLife has a funny way of twisting things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you say. So, about the dress...\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 3</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Gemma said when there was a knock on her workshop door.</p><p>The door swung open. \u201cOh! My apologies, Gemma, My Lady,\u201d Sissel said when she got a look inside the room. Lady Linnea was as still as a portrait painting, looking out the window. Gemma stepped around the dummy Lady Linnea\u2019s dress hung from. The violet gown was almost finished\u2014Gemma was merely fussing with the fur cuffs on the wide, drooping sleeves\u2014but the elaborately embroidered kirtle was barely started.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. I will return,\u201d Sissel said, almost stumbling over her feet in her effort to flee.</p><p>\u201cYour timing is perfect, Sissel. I have something for you,\u201d Gemma said, retreating to a chest of drawers.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sissel asked, lingering in the doorway out of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Gemma said, pulling out what appeared to be a shawl. It was made of small squares of blue and purple fabric\u2014Lady Linnea\u2019s favorite colors\u2014and was warm and thick.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Sissel blinked when Gemma held the shawl out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cI had it mostly finished before I measured you, but I needed to make sure it was long enough.\u201d</p><p>Sissel stared at the shawl\u2014a patchwork of expensive, beautifully patterned fabric. \u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s too grand for the likes of me. Besides, what would My Lady say?\u201d Sissel whispered, her eyes darting in Lady Linnea\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cI made it with fabric scraps that are too small to use any other way. I was being thrifty. You wear it like this,\u201d Gemma said, looping the shawl around Sissel\u2019s shoulders and neck. \u201cThere are three buttons, here, here, and here, so it will stay on your shoulders and leave your hands free,\u201d Gemma said, buttoning the shawl.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gemma. It\u2019s beautiful\u2014I\u2019ve never owned anything so soft,\u201d Sissel said, reaching up to stroke a square patch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to check on the fire,\u201d Sissel said, sticking her neck out like a turtle so she could see Gemma\u2019s fireplace without entering the room. \u201cI thought I might clean it out, but it wouldn\u2019t be right to do that with Lady Linnea present,\u201d Sissel added, her voice lower than a whisper.</p><p>\u201cCome back in half an hour. She has embroidery lessons then,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cAnd thank you for your thoughtfulness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Sissel repeated, pressing her shawl to her cheek. She glanced at Lady Linnea and gave a wobbly curtsey before she hurried away.</p> <p>Gemma shut the door when the scullery maid disappeared down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cYou are a fool,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d Gemma asked, returning to the violet gown.</p><p>\u201cIf you sold clothing items like that to the people who questioned your talent, the nasty rumors about your abilities would be silenced,\u201d Lady Linnea said, turning so she could lean against the wall in a most unlady-like manner. \u201cInstead you give such things\u2014which should be costly and pricy\u2014away to scullery maids and stable boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat stable boy is keeping it a secret from your mother that you occasionally slip out and ride. He deserved the coat, My Lady,\u201d Gemma said, inspecting her stitches.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe, but what about the goose girl? Or that baby blanket you made for one of your father\u2019s customers?\u201d Lady Linnea said before she shook her head. \u201cThese people should act as your champions. Instead they closet your workmanship away like they were made of gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But I am well fed and well paid. I have a job I love. I may find the doubts and rumors irksome, but I would rather sew for those who need it and deserve it than raise my esteem in the eyes of people I don\u2019t like and frankly don\u2019t care about,\u201d Gemma said, snipping a loose thread with a scissors.</p><p>Lady Linnea tilted her head as she thought. \u201cI redact my comment from before. You are not a fool. Instead, you are filled with an unspeakably horrid amount of good will.\u201d</p><p>Gemma scoffed. \u201cDo you know me at all?\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea flopped her upper body on a workbench. \u201cI think your cynical expressions and unrelenting pessimism\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m practical and realistic, My Lady, not pessimistic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2014hide your gooey, warm feelings. You, Gemma, are exactly like a hedgehog. Or a porcupine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I would ever apply the word \u2018gooey\u2019 to an animal covered in quills,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Lady Linnea smiled, but she wiped the sign of mirth off her face when someone knocked on the workroom door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>A footman opened the door. He offered a bow in Lady Linnea\u2019s direction. \u201cLady Linnea,\u201d he murmured before addressing Gemma. \u201cIf you would come downstairs with me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Gemma asked. Had her father gotten drunk and lost somewhere in the city, again?</p><p>The footman flatted his lips. He glanced at Lady Linnea and leaned forward to whisper, \u201cA squad of royal guards is here to escort you to the palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Gemma said, standing up straighter.</p> <p>\u201cThey would not say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma is being summoned?\u201d Lady Linnea said, her adopted persona briefly failing her at the footman\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cYes, My Lady,\u201d the footman said, bowing at Lady Linnea.</p><p>\u201cDo Mama and Papa know?\u201d Lady Linnea asked. Although her face was smooth like cream, worry accented the noble edge to her voice.</p><p>\u201cThey are aware, My Lady. I believe Lord Lovland means to go to the palace, as well,\u201d the footman said.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Lady Linnea said, blowing out of the room without further notice, a vision in her ivy green dress.</p><p>Gemma shut her eyes. When she opened them, she had a solid grip on her composure. \u201cI will get my cloak,\u201d she said, retreating into her workroom to snatch up a plain, brown cloak. She settled it on her shoulders before she nodded to the footman.</p><p>The footman led her through the manor, all the way to the front entrance.</p><p>\u201cHave strength,\u201d the footman whispered to Gemma before he bowed to Lord Lovland. \u201cMiss Kielland, My Lord,\u201d he said, backing away.</p><p>Lord Lovland was on the slender side. Lady Linnea inherited her tallness from the lord, but the man was more scholar than warrior. He had a kind face, which was covered with a strawberry-blonde beard and was creased with worry.</p><p>\u201cGemma, the King has requested your presence in the palace,\u201d Lord Lovland said. \u201cAs your employer, I will follow you,\u201d he hesitated and turned to the guards. \u201cMiss Kielland will join you in a moment,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sensing the dismissal behind the words, the squadron bowed to Lord Lovland and trooped through the doors. The footman closed the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cHave you done anything to bring the King\u2019s attention to you? Anything at all?\u201d Lord Lovland asked, his voice low pitched and urgent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma said, her words firm and certain.</p><p>Lord Lovland inhaled. \u201cThen this may involve Linnea. I worried when he denied our request to return to Loire...Gemma, I beg you to protect Linnea. You must step carefully in what you say to him. The King is a madman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Lord,\u201d Gemma said, taken aback by Lord Lovland\u2019s frankness.</p><p>\u201cHe is, and the smallest thing might set him off with a desire to see you killed. He is worse than a wild, rabid bear. Do you remember early last fall?\u201d</p> <p>Gemma grimly nodded.</p><p>\u201cPrincess Elise\u2019s near death may be your fate if you displease him. Do not be clever; do not be memorable. If the King means to keep an eye on you, I cannot protect you,\u201d Lord Lovland said. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, My Lord,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cGood girl. Off you go,\u201d Lord Lovland said, stepping aside. The footman opened the door and escorted Gemma out.</p><p>The guards had brought a cart, into which they helped Gemma climb before they set off to the palace, the cart horses moving at a steady trot. Naturally, the guards took the most direct route, which wound through Ostfold. Civilians stopped and stared as the cart rolled through the streets. Some people looked at Gemma and her armed escort with sympathy. Others crossed themselves or whispered to their neighbors. A few sneered.</p> <p>Gemma ignored the reactions and grimly steeled herself. No matter what awaited her, it was never good to be called to King Torgen\u2019s attention. After what seemed like both an eternity and a second, the urban area of Ostfold peeled back, revealing the Verglas Royal Palace.</p><p>The palace, built during the Snow Queen\u2019s time, was made to resemble ice and winter. Every part of the castle jutted up into triangular cut-outs that were intricately decorated with snowflakes and the royal family crest\u2014a reindeer. The only tower in the castle was tall and skinny, and it was angled to get a perfect view of the mountains that unfolded behind the palace.</p><p>Gemma was stone still as the cart rolled through the palace gates. When it stopped, a guard helped Gemma down. The rest of the guards fell into ranks around her, herding her into the castle.</p><p>The interior was gloomy and dark, matching Gemma\u2019s mood. The King must be summoning Gemma about Lady Linnea. Perhaps Lord Lovland was right, and he wanted insider information about her\u2014or maybe he meant to hire her to watch Lady Linnea? Gemma bit down on her tongue to clear her mind as the guards escorted her into the throne room.</p><p>The throne room was a beautiful masterpiece that overlooked Lake Sno\u2014the snowfed lake located at the back of the palace. There were two thrones: a central one for the current monarch, which was made of wood and blue velvet and placed on top of a marble dais, and a second one made of glass and crafted to resemble ice. The ice throne was positioned in the far back of the room, facing the lake view instead of the throne room. Tradition said it was occupied by the Snow Queen when she lived, and it hadn\u2019t been moved out of reverence.</p><p>The floor was marble covered with blue rugs accented with snowflakes and reindeer, and the sunlight sparkled when it hit the silver-glass- and gold-work at the opposite side of the room, which was crafted to resemble a winter scene.</p> <p>But Gemma didn\u2019t see any of the beauty of the gorgeous room because when she stepped inside it and took note of those who were present, her worry increased tenfold.</p><p>Kneeling before the throne was her sloppy father. Her mother was on the sidelines, squished between an army of clerks, record keepers, and scholars.</p><p>This isn\u2019t about Lady Linnea, Gemma realized as she stared at her father, who couldn\u2019t even meet her gaze. It\u2019s about me.</p><p>\u201cGemma Kielland, My Lord,\u201d a guard said, bowing to the king.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d King Torgen said, folding his hands over the expanse of his belly.</p><p>King Torgen was considered comely in his younger days, but years of hatred, spite, and madness had hardened his features and gave every part of his face the shadow of cruelty. His eyes were the worst. The whites were a sickly yellow, and the dark irises glowed with fires of hatred and insanity. Gemma had seen him before for public spectacles and events, but she had never before born the weight of King Torgen\u2019s sickly, feverish eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about you, Gemma Kielland...and your unusual ability to spin straw into gold.\u201d</p><p>WHAT? Gemma felt her muscles go slack. She must have misheard him. \u201cI beg your pardon, My Lord, my ability to what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo spin straw into gold. I have received a report that your father has run his mouth off singing of your fortunes,\u201d King Torgen said, a mean smile spreading on his lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma looked to her father. His head was hanging, and he didn\u2019t look up. Judging by his pasty complexion, he was still half drunk. Gemma snapped her eyes to her mother, the parent whom she had given her extra wages.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s mother stared at her feet with puffy eyes and shaking shoulders\u2014declaring her guilt as plainly as Gemma\u2019s father. Gemma\u2019s mother\u2014whom everyone near and far declared a sweet, kind woman\u2014apparently didn\u2019t have the strength to hold onto the bit of help Gemma could offer her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a misunderstanding, My Lord,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cA misunderstanding? You mean to say you cannot do it?\u201d King Torgen asked.</p> <p>If I could, do you think my parents would be living in squalor? Gemma thought. She took a moment to prepare herself, but before she could respond King Torgen continued.</p><p>\u201cIf that is the case, and your father has lied, I will be forced to order both of you be put to death,\u201d King Torgen said.</p><p>Gemma paused, her breath leaving her.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s mother made a mewling noise and started crying. The few villagers that were present exchanged looks and whispers.</p><p>\u201cHe has wasted my time\u2014which I find to be priceless\u2014and, therefore, must be forced to face the consequences of his lies...should that be the case. You are merely collateral damage, I suppose. One must set an example for the kingdom,\u201d King Torgen said.</p> <p>Gemma turned around, searching the villagers for a friendly face. Everyone avoided looking at her, and Gemma saw a dark green cloak she knew belonged to Lord Lovland retreat to the back of the room.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to help her.</p><p>As the situation didn\u2019t directly involve Lady Linnea, the Lovlands weren\u2019t going to stick their necks out and bring possible destruction on themselves by drawing King Torgen\u2019s attention.</p><p>Gemma would be sacrificed, killed by her father\u2019s stupidity and the inaction of others.</p><p>\u201cGemma, Gemma no!\u201d Gemma\u2019s mother said as she staggered through the crowd. \u201cI can\u2019t lose both of you. W-what will I d-do?\u201d she said, hooking her fingers on Gemma\u2019s cloak and collapsing to her knees in a mess of mindless sobs. \u201cGemma!\u201d</p><p>As Gemma dispassionately looked down at her panicked mother, she knew without a doubt that if she told King Torgen her father had lied, claiming the death sentence for herself and her father, her mother would not long survive them.</p> <p>\u201cN-not both of them, p-p-please!\u201d Gemma\u2019s mother said, raising her eyes to the ceiling.</p><p>Gemma ignored her mother\u2019s cries as she weighed her options. Either way Gemma was going to die, but was it worth it to see her father killed for getting her into this mess as well? Should she say yes to spare him\u2014to spare her mother?</p><p>\u201cWell? Did he lie?\u201d King Torgen asked.</p><p>Gemma sucked in a gasp of air as she considered her response. She loved her mother. Things looked grim, but just maybe...</p><p>Gemma glared at her father with her ice-eyes, hating him more than ever as she said, \u201cNo, My Lord, but he was mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d King Torgen said, leaning back in his throne.</p><p>\u201cYes. I cannot spin straw into gold because straw cannot be spun into anything; it hasn\u2019t the right fibers,\u201d Gemma said. Everyone in the room held their breath for a deathly moment of silence before Gemma continued, \u201cBut I can spin flax into gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gemma! T-thank you!\u201d Gemma\u2019s mother said, pulling on her cloak.</p> <p>Gemma ignored her mother and stared King Torgen in the eye. Having just sacrificed herself for her father\u2014whom she didn\u2019t much like\u2014and her mother\u2014whose weak will chafed Gemma\u2014she was not feeling charitable. Even though she was going to try and survive this, luck was not on her side. Only one person had ever evaded death when King Torgen ordered it, and such an order was a fairly frequent event.</p><p>\u201cI see. And how do you do it?\u201d King Torgen asked.</p><p>Gemma pressed her lips together before she responded. \u201cThe flax must be freshly cut from the fields, dried, and the seeds removed. After which\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plant must be harvested, I understand. Then, you spin it into gold?\u201d King Torgen said, waving a hand to dismiss Gemma\u2019s unspoken words.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Gemma was quick to say. \u201cThe fibers must be harvested from the flax. The plant must go through the breaking, scutching, and heckling process to remove chaff and properly groom the fiber.\u201d</p><p>Seizing the only glimmer of hope she had, Gemma continued, \u201cAdditionally, my magic must be performed away from any eyes and only at night. Moonlight must be allowed to shine on me as I work, or the results will not be permanent.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Gemma could escape. King Torgen would surely demand a demonstration. With the limits she just set, he would be forced to leave her alone, at night, in a room with a window.</p><p>\u201cI presume you would prefer to do the harvesting, breaking, scutching, and heckling yourself?\u201d King Torgen asked, his voice oily.</p><p>\u201cThe gold would be of higher caliber,\u201d Gemma said, kicking herself for not thinking of that requirement earlier. The longer she dragged the process out, the more time she had to think of a way to escape! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps in the future. For now, I will be satisfied with low-quality gold,\u201d King Torgen said, his smile gleeful.</p><p>He knew Gemma was lying through her teeth. Everyone knew it! It wasn\u2019t possible for a normal girl to spin flax into gold, or the magicians and enchanters would have plucked her up as a child!</p><p>\u201cForgive me, My Lord, but I, your lowly subject, must remind you that I cannot work my magic in public,\u201d Gemma said, her voice strong.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. My guards will prepare a room with the specifications you have marked out. Until then, I will hold you in my dungeons, lest there be a misunderstanding,\u201d King Torgen said. \u201cGuards!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGemma!\u201d Gemma\u2019s mother cried.</p><p>The six guards that escorted Gemma into the throne room moved into formation around her, stepping between Gemma and her mother before herding her out. Gemma could hear her mother\u2019s sobs and the whispers of all present as they left the throne room behind. Eventually the guards led her down a winding staircase into the depths of the wooden castle.</p><p>The deeper they went, the more Gemma\u2019s dread built.</p><p>King Torgen\u2019s dungeons were known for the terrors that happened in them. It was an awful place built out of black stone. All light sources seemed to sputter in the terrible darkness, snuffed out by the horror of the place.</p><p>The guards escorted Gemma into a cell. There was nothing in it, but along the way\u2014without Gemma noticing\u2014the guards had plucked up various items they set down inside the cell. One dropped a small wooden stool, another a worn but thick blanket. A third soldier set down a bucket of water, and the fourth placed a cloak down on the ground.</p> <p>\u201cYou acted with honor, Miss,\u201d one of the soldiers said as the others filed out of the cell. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we can\u2019t give you more.\u201d</p><p>Gemma folded her lips into a smile with great difficulty. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said before the soldier shut the door.</p><p>With the soldiers gone, Gemma was left alone in the oppressive silence. She stood on the stool to try to look outside\u2014there was a window set in the ceiling covered with a metal grate that let her see bits of the cloudy sky, and two palace walls. She tried half-heartedly pulling on the grate of the ceiling-window, but it didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be easy to get out of here,\u201d Gemma said, walking the small perimeter of the underground cell. \u201cMy real chance will come when the King imprisons me to do the spinning.\u201d</p><p>To conserve energy, Gemma sat on the folded cloak and closed her eyes, leaning against the wall of the cell. The air was chilly outside, and the dungeon was perversely cool, so Gemma wrapped herself in the warm blanket and buried her nose in the cloth to try and block out the sewage smell of the prison.</p><p>Hours passed, and the morning sunlight disappeared. Gemma guessed it was late afternoon when there was a heavy thump of something hitting the ground above Gemma\u2019s cell.</p> <p>\u201cGemma Kielland! If you aren\u2019t in this cell I\u2019m going to strangle you myself when I find you. I just ripped my second-best gown climbing that wretched wall!\u201d</p><p>Gemma rocketed from her blanket cocoon. \u201cLady Linnea?\u201d she asked, her voice incredulous.</p><p>A shadow was cast on the floor of her cell as the blonde-haired noblewoman leaned over the ceiling-window. \u201cSo you are here, good! I nearly dislocated my arm checking the ten empty cells surrounding you before this. Each cell is individually walled in; can you imagine the stupidity of that? Our taxes at work, I suppose. Why didn\u2019t you rip off a piece of your dress and hang it from the window like a good captive? I would have been able to figure out where you were when I tried spying you out from an upper window this morning,\u201d Lady Linnea peevishly said.</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t think anyone would help me,\u201d Gemma said, climbing the stool so she could properly address the lady.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lady Linnea said, the anger gone from her voice. \u201cI-I tried talking to Papa. He wouldn\u2019t listen,\u201d she said, gripping an iron bar with a hand that trembled in anger. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a loyal servant, and he\u2019s willing to abandon you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t blame him. It\u2019s safer for your family. Not to mention it is my father\u2019s fault I am in this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not allow you to be left behind,\u201d Lady Linnea said, stubbornly tucking her head.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gemma said, touched by the fiery lady\u2019s words. \u201cEven if you cannot free me, I thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCannot free you? Just who do you think I am?\u201d Lady Linnea scoffed. \u201cFarset wouldn\u2019t let me into their army if I couldn\u2019t break you out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have a plan?\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea\u2019s plans were frequent. Their success, however, was rare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lady Linnea drooped. \u201cI did.

I need to catch him before he is called to dinner with his father. Wish me luck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will wish you no such thing. Lady Linnea!\u201d Gemma said when Lady Linnea momentarily disappeared from view. The lady reappeared when she climbed high enough up the wall that Gemma could see her again.</p><p>\u201cWhen this is over, I insist you make me a new second-best dress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLady Linnea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTa, ta!\u201d Lady Linnea said, kicking her legs over the wall and jumping to the other side.</p><p>Gemma rubbed her forehead. \u201cGrandmother Guri was right. Instead of having children or friends, I should have gotten a goat. If she gets herself killed, I won\u2019t forgive her!\u201d</p><p>After a tip off from a gossipy lady\u2019s maid, Lady Linnea found Prince Toril moping on a bench placed near the shore of Lake Sno.</p><p>Lady Linnea smoothed her usual polite mask over her face and approached the prince with all the elegance she could muster. She could do this. She had to do this. Gemma was counting on her.</p><p>\u201cPrince Toril,\u201d Lady Linnea said in a soft, whispering voice that she used because it was an audible representation of the caress of silk on skin. \u201cI must beg your pardon for intruding, but I am in a terrible plight. I need your help.\u201d</p> <p>Prince Toril looked away from the lake long enough to glance at her. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he sighed.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, Lady Linnea tried curtsying. \u201cMy name is Lady Linnea Lovland. Your father has imprisoned my servant. He means to kill her if she cannot spin flax into gold\u2014a feat most impossible for all\u2014even a mage.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril crossed his legs at the ankles. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I ask that you would save my servant. Please, intervene! If you do, I will forever be in your debt,\u201d Lady Linnea said, tilting her head so Toril was treated to the most fetching angle of her face.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>Lady Linnea placed a hand over her heart. \u201cBut why not? If you spoke to your father, I know he would release her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care about you; I don\u2019t care about your servant; I just don\u2019t care. Now leave me be,\u201d Prince Toril said, looking out at the lake.</p><p>Lady Linnea blinked. She had always been told Toril was a dimwit, but that he was at least kinder than his father. The general population lived for the day his father died, and he would take over. What had him huffy?</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot mean that, Prince. We are your subjects,\u201d Lady Linnea persisted.</p><p>\u201cYes? Well, I hurt too,\u201d Prince Toril said, standing up and running a frustrated hand through his hair. \u201cI have loved and lost the pinnacle of females: Princess Elise of Arcainia. She will never have me, and so nothing matters! If you will excuse me,\u201d Prince Toril said, striding down to the lake waters.</p><p>The water was icy cold, so the prince didn\u2019t dare walk in. Instead, he settled for moodily trekking down the shoreline.</p><p>Lady Linnea watched him go with a scowl. Everyone in Verglas had heard about Prince Toril\u2019s fancy for the Arcainian princess, but Lady Linnea had thought he would be over the worst of his heartache by now!</p><p>Lady Linnea chased after the Prince, picking up a fallen tree branch that had quite a bit of heft to it. \u201cPrince Toril,\u201d she called.</p><p>The prince didn\u2019t stop. He continued his moping walk.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder when they rounded a bend in the shoreline that took them out of sight of the palace, screening them behind trees. As soon as it was safe, Lady Linnea ran the remaining distance to the prince and smacked the branch on top of his head.</p><p>The branch broke, and Prince Toril fell like a sack of potatoes.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Toril groaned as he tried to pick himself up.</p><p>\u201cListen, you imbecile,\u201d Lady Linnea said as she plopped down and grabbed the prince by the collar of his shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t care about your failed romantic dalliances. In fact, after seeing you mope like a spineless swineherd, it\u2019s no wonder she rejected you! What I care about is my seamstress, and she\u2019s going to be killed by your bloodthirsty father. I will not let that happen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d Prince Toril stammered.</p><p>\u201cAre you addled? Do you not understand the words I am speaking most plainly? Fine. Then I will put it in terms you can understand: SAVE. MY. SERVANT. OR. ELSE!\u201d Lady Linnea said, shaking the prince. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Prince Toril stared at her with bug eyes and didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Lady Linnea released his shirt collar and pushed him back to the ground in disgust. \u201cGutless twit,\u201d she muttered. \u201cShouldn\u2019t have placed any kind of hope in such a rotten royal family\u2014the Snow Queen must be rolling in her grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Prince Toril muttered.</p><p>\u201cThis is what happens when one doesn\u2019t make it obligatory for the royal sons to serve in the military,\u201d Lady Linnea said, standing and brushing the skirt of her dress off. She took a moment to bite her lip. She was failing Gemma. She needed to pull herself together! This was the kind of adventure she longed for...but she never thought it would be her close friend at stake.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps I am not so sorry,\u201d Prince Toril stiffly said as he stood.</p><p>Lady Linnea turned her back to the prince. What could she do? Perhaps she could find a saw and hack at the bars over the dungeon window? But that might be too loud.</p><p>\u201cLady, you will hear me out,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>Maybe she could poison the guards or give them a sleeping tonic? \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous; poison would be impossible to track down at such an hour. It\u2019s best to make those kinds of purchases in the morning,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cLady!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want,\u201d Lady Linnea said, her voice withering when she realized the Prince was attempting to speak to her.</p><p>\u201cYou, ma\u2019am, have been very rude. You act as if my broken heart is a mere flesh wound,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cWell it is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Lady Linnea snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Prince Toril said, sounding incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYou could have FOLLOWED this precious princess of yours to Arcainia. But did you? No! You prefer to mope and sulk about the country for a year like a boy denied sweets! She still isn\u2019t married is she?\u201d Lady Linnea said, putting her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cNo, but she loves\u2014,\u201d</p> <p>Lady Linnea cut him off, chopping her hand as if slicing through his words. \u201cExcuses,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you really loved this girl, you would desperately try to woo her right now\u2014even if she loved another. Hope isn\u2019t lost until she says her vows! Or if you really wish to be despondent, you can dwell upon your terrible shortcomings\u2014a long list, if you ask me\u2014which is probably why she told you to bugger off. I recommend you begin with your inability to think of others. Now leave. I am trying to plan a prison break, and your nattering is not aiding me.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril was either struck dumb by Lady Linnea\u2019s insight, or he was too stupid to respond\u2014Lady Linnea suspected it was the latter\u2014so he only gaped at her.</p><p>Lady Linnea gave an aggravated sigh and rolled her eyes before she started walking up the shoreline, meandering in the direction of the palace. \u201cPerhaps I could find a key to her cell?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I believe it has to be open from outside the cell. I will never be able to smuggle myself down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Linnea, please wait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lady Linea said, placing her hands on her hips.</p><p>Prince Toril jogged the few paces between them.</p> <p>\u201cWell? Time is of the essence, and I would prefer to waste none of it on you,\u201d Lady Linnea said, tapping her foot.</p><p>\u201cYou said your servant has been imprisoned by my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Linnea said, some of the bite fading from her manners.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you. He wants her to spin flax into gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but why would he demand such a thing of her in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhilst in an inebriated state, her foolish father said she could do it. When it is proven that she cannot, King Torgen will kill her,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>Prince Toril nodded and rubbed his eyes with his hand. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201c...Yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will help you,\u201d he said, glancing at the sky, which was painted dusty pink by the setting sun.</p><p>Lady Linnea eyed Prince Toril. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the sudden change? Not five minutes ago, you were as limp as a dead fish washed ashore. Now you are willing to help?\u201d Lady Linnea asked, trying to unobtrusively study his head for blood. Perhaps she hit him with the branch too hard?</p><p>Prince Toril took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d Lady Linnea scoffed.</p><p>\u201cIf Princess Elise knew that I turned away someone looking for my help, she would be horrified. In my heartbreak, I have become the kind of man she despises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid?\u201d Lady Linnea offered.</p><p>Prince Toril frowned. \u201cComplacent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, where is this servant of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the dungeons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we should start there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quite agree,\u201d Lady Linnea said, starting for the palace. \u201cAnd...thank you,\u201d she added more than a little awkwardly.</p><p>Prince Toril blinked. \u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor helping.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril cleared his voice. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They hurried to the dungeons as the sun started to sink behind the horizon. When they cleared the last step into the oppressive place, a guard standing duty shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThe servant girl?\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cYou are a moment too late, My Lord. King Torgen had her taken to her to a room full of flax,\u201d the guard said.</p><p>\u201cThen we will find her and claim her there. Do you know where they went?\u201d Prince Toril asked.</p> <p>The guard shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not, My Lord. But you will need to speak to your Father to free her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Lady Linnea asked, her mask of temperance and serenity back as she clasped her hands together.</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s locked up, and King Torgen is the only one with the key,\u201d the guard said.</p><p>Lady Linnea went as white as a snow. She reached out and placed a hand on the dungeon wall to stabilize herself.</p><p>\u201cI see. Thank you,\u201d Prince Toril said to the guard.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, My Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Prince Toril said, taking Lady Linnea\u2019s elbow and guiding her along.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave her,\u201d Lady Linnea whispered. Desperation permeated her words.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Prince Toril agreed. \u201cBut you can\u2019t hang about the palace the entire night either. Return home. I will speak to my father. Your servant will not die, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea wasn\u2019t exactly reassured, as Prince Toril was as terrifying as butterflies. But he was right: her reputation would not recover if she gadded about the palace unaccompanied after dark. She would go home to gather additional resources and return in the morning.</p><p>\u201cVery well. I must thank you further, My Lord, Prince Toril,\u201d Lady Linnea said when they left the terrible dungeon staircase and emerged in the palace.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Lady Linnea. You have helped me more than you know,\u201d Prince Toril said, bowing over her hand.</p><p>Lady Linnea wanted to roll her eyes at the prince\u2019s dramatics, but she didn\u2019t. Idiot or not, if Prince Toril saved Gemma, Lady Linnea would be his most loyal subject ever.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Gemma stared at the wads of flax dusting the room. There wasn\u2019t as much as she expected. Bundled up, it was roughly the size of a rectangular hay-bale. The small amount was most likely because King Torgen knew she would fail at the task.</p><p>The flax fibers were a shade of dirty cream and smelled like the outdoors.</p><p>\u201cSet to work, Gemma Kielland,\u201d King Torgen said, pushing the wheel of the spinning wheel so it clacked and rotated. \u201cAnd if, by tomorrow morning, you have not spun this flax into gold, I will have you beheaded,\u201d he said, giving Gemma a dark smile that made her skin crawl. \u201cWork well,\u201d he said. He started laughing as he headed for the door.</p><p>The three guards accompanying King Torgen gave Gemma pitying looks before they followed their master out of the room.</p><p>King Torgen was still laughing when she heard the ominous thud of a bar falling into place over the door and a loud clank as the room was locked from the outside.</p> <p>Gemma shook her head when King Torgen\u2019s laughter faded as the monarch walked away.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Gemma said, lifting her chin up and setting her shoulders. \u201cTime to try escaping.\u201d</p><p>Gemma walked the perimeter of the room, ignoring the panic coiled in her stomach like a snake as she knocked on the walls and peered out of the window.</p><p>The room was plain. It was the size of Gemma\u2019s workroom back in Loveland manor, but empty and barren. Besides the flax, a chair, the spinning wheel, several oil lamps, a little pot of water to use for wetting the fibers, and a cup of water to drink\u2014probably provided by one of the guards\u2014there was nothing else in the room.</p><p>The window was stomach height\u2014which boded well\u2014but the view from it revealed that the room was three floors above the ground.</p><p>This narrowed down Gemma\u2019s escape plans, but if she had to choose between the possibility of a broken limb and certain death, Gemma would jump.</p><p>Reaching in her dress, Gemma unearthed the fork and knife she was given with her supper\u2014a tasty stew. King Torgen likely didn\u2019t know about the utensils, or that she had been fed, but Gemma internally thanked whatever kind soul ordered it as she tried prying at the two boards expertly nailed over the open window.</p><p>When the board bent Gemma\u2019s fork instead of being wedged from the window, Gemma changed tactics and tried sawing through the material with the blunt knife.</p><p>Gemma had to press hard to make the knife even scratch the surface, but after a few minutes of sawing, there were a few specks of wood shavings. Encouraged, Gemma pushed down harder and kept sawing. The motion made her arm ache, and eventually scream in pain, so after a few minutes more, she switched hands. Gemma was at it for an hour when both her arms were numb and heavy. She stopped sawing and let her arms drop while she inspected her work.</p><p>There was barely a gouge in the wood.</p><p>Gemma was no carpenter, but she knew it would take her days, not hours, to hack her way through the boards and to freedom.</p><p>The panic and desolation Gemma was keeping under tight control threatened to overwhelm her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was over. She was going to die.</p><p>When King Torgen returned in the morning, he was going to have her beheaded.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Gemma said, pounding a fist on the wall. \u201cNo,\u201d she repeated. Tears stung her eyes, but she glared at the board. \u201cI can\u2019t give up,\u201d she said, stiffening her resolution before she started sawing at the board again.</p><p>Some of her tears escaped her eyes and rolled down her face. Gemma refused to acknowledge them and tried tugging on the board.</p> <p>When a teardrop fell from her face and splashed on the windowsill, the door clanked and was thrown open with a mighty crash. Footfalls walked into the room, and the door slammed shut.</p><p>Gemma whirled around, hiding her knife behind her back.</p><p>A strange man stood at the door. He was tall, but his shoulder width put him more on the slender side. He wore black cape with the hood pulled up, blocking most of his face except for his fine mouth.</p><p>His cloak was unlike any style Gemma had seen before. It latched on the right side of his neck with a large sapphire pin. Part of the cape was pushed behind his right shoulder, keeping his right arm free and mobile. The rest of the cape covered his front. If his mouth wasn\u2019t so pleasant looking, Gemma would have wondered if he was death coming prematurely for her.</p><p>As it was, he was likely a less-than-savory servant of King Torgen. \u201cI told My Lord if I was seen while working, the flax would not turn to gold,\u201d Gemma said, wary of the man but hopeful the encounter could be used to her advantage.</p> <p>The stranger tilted his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said in a voice that was musical and fresh like a newly melted snow stream.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t King Torgen send you here to check on my progress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. You are Gemma Kielland, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cThen I am here to help you.\u201d</p><p>Gemma stared at the stranger with her icy eyes. \u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>The stranger\u2019s fine lips parted in a smile to reveal perfect, white teeth. \u201cI am here to spin the flax into gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Gemma said with no conviction.</p><p>\u201cYes. I overheard your plight and decided a rescue was in order.\u201d</p><p>Gemma exhaled and rubbed her eyes. \u201cPlease go away. I haven\u2019t the time to deal with a madman,\u201d she said, her forehead furrowed.</p><p>The stranger chuckled and pushed the front flap of his cloak over his left shoulder, revealing strange clothes underneath. He wore a black shirt that contained none of the fanciful puffs that were all the rage in Loire. It was tailored, almost like the Erlauf military uniforms Lady Linnea day-dreamed of. Over the black shirt, he wore a vest that was the same shade as his sapphire cloak pin and bulky with pockets. The look was finished with black breeches and black boots that were so well polished, Gemma suspected she could see her reflection in them if she drew close enough.</p><p>\u201cYou are an amusing one,\u201d the stranger said as he sat in the chair and arranged the flax fibers, pulling some away from the bundle tied to the distaff. He wet his hand in the water pot to moisten the fibers, and set about rolling the fibers and mashing them with the end of the flax thread already wound around the spindle. He pressed a foot pedal to crank the wheel\u2014which made the spindle rotate and the thread wind. As he worked, he spoke under his breath, almost like he was conversing with the flax fibers and spinning wheel.</p><p>Gemma raised her eyebrows at the man, but he was absorbed with his work. Nonchalantly, Gemma strolled around the room and tried tugging on the door. It was locked. Those outside must have locked the door when the stranger entered.</p><p>Gemma returned to her window and reluctantly turned her back to the spinning stranger\u2014listening intently lest he lose his mind all together\u2014and returned to sawing at one of the boards barring the window, hoping the clanks and whirls of the spinning wheel would cover up the noise of Gemma sawing.</p> <p>Eventually, Gemma forgot about the intruder and furrowed her forehead as she pressed against the board with all her might.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to escape? Smart girl, smarter than your father,\u201d the man said in his fresh, musical voice.</p><p>Gemma jumped and almost tossed her knife into the air. When she had a good grip on the knife again, she folded her arms across her chest and stared at the stranger.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to surprise you,\u201d the stranger said as he looked at the scratched up board with a critical eye.</p><p>Gemma could still hear the spinning wheel whirling. She risked a glance at the spinning wheel, and then she did drop her knife.</p><p>The spinning wheel was spinning, and flax fibers pulling away from distaff unaided, rolling and curling itself around the spindle. The spindle was not wound with coarse flax thread...but something shiny.</p><p>Gemma leaned back on her heels when she realized the material curling around the spindle was not thread, but finely spun metal. Gold.</p><p>Gemma studied the gold thread and considered the possibilities. Was she dreaming? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, my arm aches too much for that.</p><p>Perhaps she had cracked with grief, and the man was a figment of her imagination.</p><p>Gemma slid her eyes sideways and poked at the stranger\u2019s cloak with a finger. The cloak, to her surprise, was made of soft, slippery cloth the likes of which Gemma had never seen.</p><p>No, he has too much presence to be a hallucination.</p> <p>Then the last option\u2014the option which Gemma privately thought made the least sense\u2014was that the stranger was some sort of do-good-er magician or enchanter.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for my thoughtless words, sir,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cIn my defense, I did not know your station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an enchanter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkies and clouds, NO.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you are a mage.\u201d</p><p>The man tilted his head to the left and then to the right, his lips similarly slanted as he thought. \u201cYes,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gemma bowed her head in reverence. An enchanter was the highest rank a human gifted with magic could achieve. They were to be treated with as much reverence as a foreign dignitary. Mages were ranked well below enchanters, but they were still to be treated with respect and honor. \u201cWhy are you doing this, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I have an obligation to help those in need,\u201d the mage said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cThere is something I need in return, though,\u201d the mage said.</p> <p>Gemma took a step backwards. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>The mage\u2019s fine lips twisted in a scowl. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. This part is always so awkward...\u201d he sighed and tried again. \u201cMy magic is about trade. I need something as a payment. It does not have to be equal in worth; I just need something even remotely valuable. Like your gold necklace,\u201d the mage said.</p><p>Gemma touched the necklace. It was a string of gold so thin, fishing wire had more width to it. But the necklace was a gift from Grandmother Guri on Gemma\u2019s fifteenth birthday, and it was the only thing of worth Gemma owned.</p><p>Gemma glanced at the mage. The innocent set of his mouth said he didn\u2019t know what he was asking for, and, Gemma supposed, a gold necklace was a small price to pay for her life\u2014should King Torgen actually set her free, as unlikely as Gemma thought that to be.</p><p>\u201cYou are a mage who can spin flax into gold, and you want a gold necklace?\u201d Gemma asked, unclasping the necklace from her neck.</p><p>The mage\u2019s smile was sheepish. \u201cI apologize. I know it must seem odd to you, but it\u2019s the price of my magic,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gemma raised her eyebrows but said nothing. It wouldn\u2019t be wise to pose impertinent questions to a mage who was in the process of saving her. So, she handed the necklace over, placing it in the mage\u2019s warm palm.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the mage said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, sir. It is I who should be thanking you,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t quite what I pictured,\u201d the mage said, pushing his hand into the depths of his cloak to stow Gemma\u2019s necklace.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought, based on your parents, that perhaps you would be less confident. To be perfectly honest, I expected you would be a sobbing mess by the time I arrived.\u201d</p><p>Gemma gave the mage a look of displeasure. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, and now you are offended. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I compared you to a street-corner charlatan magician, how would you feel?\u201d</p><p>The mage laughed, and Gemma doubted her earlier judgment. Perhaps she really was hallucinating after all. Gemma had never before met a mage, but she was under the impression that they were stuffy and didn\u2019t laugh often.</p><p>\u201cYou are such fun. I\u2019m glad I heard about you,\u201d the mage said.</p><p>\u201cDo you often run around, saving damsels in distress?\u201d Gemma asked, turning to face the scratched up board.</p><p>\u201cYou find that unlikely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was a knight\u2019s job to rescue fair maidens,\u201d Gemma said, sawing at the board again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but we mages can\u2019t let them hog all the glory,\u201d the mage said with a handsome smile.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s fingers and arms twisted with pain as she stubbornly sawed away.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep at it. The King will let you go after he sees this,\u201d the mage said, walking across the room to add flax fibers to the distaff.</p><p>Gemma glanced over her shoulder. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOnly perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing Torgen is not the type to let someone off so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpinning flax into gold is easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not from Verglas,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d the mage asked, joining Gemma at the window. He watched, leaning against the wall as Gemma sawed.</p><p>\u201cYou underestimate King Torgen\u2019s cruelty,\u201d Gemma said, bracing against the board so she could press down harder.</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast fall, he nearly killed Princess Elise of Arcainia. She did nothing wrong\u2014she was hiding in Verglas while performing a difficult task to rescue her cursed foster-brothers. He would have burned her at the stake if the curse hadn\u2019t broken while he had her set on fire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do you put up with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon? I don\u2019t understand what you mean,\u201d Gemma said, glancing at the mage. She stopped sawing long enough to adjust her grip on her dinner knife before she went back to it.</p><p>\u201cWhy do the citizens of Verglas put up with it? Why don\u2019t you overthrow him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as we fear him, he does have the blood of the Snow Queen\u2019s family in his veins,\u201d Gemma grunted. \u201cAnd as much as we hate him, we have absolute loyalty to the Snow Queen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven though she\u2019s been deceased for centuries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven then.\u201d</p><p>The mage folded his arms across his chest. \u201cCenturies later, and Verglas is still unwavering. I wonder if she spelled the people in addition to the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt helps that it\u2019s mostly the nobles and those of us foolish enough to live in Ostfold who bear the brunt of King Torgen\u2019s temper,\u201d Gemma continued. \u201cAnd the country already has enough trouble. It hasn\u2019t been officially stated, but everyone knows Arcainia all but owns Verglas. We have a mountain of debt to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so,\u201d the mage said.</p> <p>Gemma was still sawing at the board when she saw white dance on the horizon. A geyser of snow shot up from the ground into the air. Ice formed behind it, stretching as tall as a small mountain. The display was far away, but it was impossible to miss as the moonlight danced on the snow and ice, making it shine like lightning.</p><p>The tension faded from Gemma as she watched the display.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the mage said, leaning so he could see outside. He looked for barely a moment before he slid back against the wall.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Snow Queen\u2019s magic,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery citizen of Verglas knows her magic like we know the faces of our mothers,\u201d Gemma said, tilting her head as she watched the light reflect off the ice.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking something,\u201d the mage said.</p><p>Gemma hesitated. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would the Snow Queen\u2019s magic activate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would assume it means an evil magic wielder is trying to force his way past the Verglas borders,\u201d the mage said. \u201cThat is what activates her residual magic, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014but why?\u201d Gemma repeated. \u201cThe world knows about the Snow Queen. What dark magician could possibly be desperate enough to try regardless?\u201d</p><p>The mage was silent.</p><p>Gemma was quiet as well as she watched the snow fall. The sprouted ice disintegrated, falling from view.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing you need to worry about,\u201d the mage said, pushing away from the wall. He retreated to the spinning wheel to check on the gold thread and the flax fibers. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a joke,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gemma asked as she adjusted the fold of blue cloth tied around her forehead.</p><p>\u201cThe Snow Queen\u2019s magic is still strong enough to keep magic users with evil intensions out of her country, but it is the offspring of her family that rules with horror,\u201d the mage said.</p><p>Gemma knew of no safe reply to the mage\u2019s dangerous statement, so she tucked her chin and kept sawing.</p><p>After the midnight hour, Gemma gave up sawing and sank to the ground.</p><p>\u201cTired?\u201d the mage asked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExhaustion does not necessarily equate with sleepiness, Sir Mage,\u201d Gemma said, running a hand through her wavy hair.</p><p>The mage tipped his head like a dog. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I don\u2019t think I could sleep if I wanted to. Death threats and King Torgen have that sort of effect on us normal citizens,\u201d Gemma dryly said.</p><p>The mage smiled widely. \u201cI see. I hadn\u2019t thought about it like that. You mentioned before that you haven\u2019t much hope King Torgen will release you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he does, he knows my name. He will remember the result forever. I will have to leave Ostfold immediately,\u201d Gemma said pulling her legs to her chest to conserve heat.</p><p>\u201cIs that so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would leave behind the only friendships I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Gemma said, thinking of Grandmother Guri and Lady Linnea as she traced a hem of her brown and white uniform with her finger. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think my survivability rate is favorable. I could perhaps find employment somewhere in Verglas, but King Torgen would surely hire the assassin\u2019s guild to track me down. Outside of Verglas, I am more likely to survive, but who would want a seamstress from Verglas? We are the backwoods of the fashion world,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have ever strung so many words together before,\u201d the mage said.</p><p>Gemma cracked a wry smile.</p><p>The mage sat down, resembling a tent with his swirling cloak. \u201cI recall hearing you made dresses. You work for a lady, I believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Linnea, daughter of Lord and Lady Lovland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they are nice?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma shifted so her head was able to rest against the back wall as she remembered watching Lord Lovland slink to the back of the throne room while King Torgen sentenced her. \u201cLady Linnea is a good person.\u201d</p><p>The mage whistled. \u201cHigh praise coming from a girl as reluctant as you.\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s lips curled into the faintest hint of a smile. \u201cLady Linnea deserves it. She is unusual, but lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, to win over your loyalty. It\u2019s probably easier to move a castle than you,\u201d the mage said.</p> <p>\u201cI am practical, not stone-hearted,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re guarded,\u201d the mage corrected.</p><p>Gemma shrugged.</p><p>\u201cRight. Well if you\u2019re going to stay awake, we may as well play a word game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA word game?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I choose an object that is visible in this room. You ask me \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 questions. Based on my response, you make guesses about what the object is. I will pick an item first, and once you correctly guess it, it will be your turn to pick an item. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Gemma glanced at the spinning wheel. \u201cIs it gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t start by directly guessing the item; you ask questions about it! And no, it\u2019s not gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. Is it the spinning wheel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I suspect you are being deliberately obtuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, Sir Mage. Is it brown?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril pounded on his father\u2019s door the moment the sun peeked over the horizon. The mountains that stood guard at the castle\u2019s back cast purple shadows across the land as Prince Toril hollered, \u201cFather, I know you are awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want? I thought you were off sighing over your lost princess?\u201d King Torgen said, throwing open the door to his room.</p><p>Prince Toril was disappointed to see his father already wore a mad smile in spite of the early hour. Occasionally, if he caught him while he was still half asleep, King Torgen was more amiable.</p><p>Or perhaps he\u2019s just less bitter, Prince Toril thought. As little as he liked to admit it, his father was growing crueler as the seasons passed. While he never had to fear for his own life, he knew the people were uneasy\u2014even before Elsa\u2014no\u2014Elise was almost burned at the stake.</p><p>\u201cYou have a peasant girl imprisoned,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>King Torgen rolled his eyes and sighed in disgust. \u201cFell for another pretty face, did you? I should have beaten your gullibility from you as a child,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t fallen for anyone,\u201d Prince Toril said. \u201cBut you have to let this girl go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d King Torgen demanded. He started walking down the hallway. Prince Toril followed him, keeping pace.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasted my time\u2014which is more valuable than the blood that pumps in her veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father wasted your time,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>King Torgen stopped to stare at Prince Toril. \u201cYou are well informed of the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>King Torgen looked down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t because I\u2019m in love with the girl,\u201d Prince Toril was quick to say.</p><p>\u201cSo you still love the mute swan girl, then? It\u2019s a pity you\u2019re so stupidly loyal.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril winced. \u201cYou must let the girl go, Father.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril ducked just in time to avoid King Torgen backhanding him.</p><p>\u201cListen closely, son,\u201d King Torgen spat. \u201cI must do nothing. I am King, and it isn\u2019t until I die that you will rule. As long as I breathe, I reign. You would do well to remember that.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril was frozen by the mad, frenzied look in his father\u2019s eyes. It wasn\u2019t until King Torgen had walked twenty paces before Prince Toril was able to break out of his paralysis and follow.</p><p>\u201cYou are right. You are the King, Father,\u201d Prince Toril said. \u201cBut it is your position only because you were granted it. You have an oath to uphold; we are to protect the weak, not behead them,\u201d Prince Toril said, passing a line of guards.</p><p>King Torgen narrowed his eyes at Prince Toril. \u201cYou seem set on this girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am set on freeing her, yes.\u201d</p><p>King Torgen stopped outside a barred door. \u201cFine,\u201d he said, sticking the key in the lock and twisting it.</p><p>\u201cShe will be free to go\u2014even without spinning the flax into gold?\u201d Prince Toril eagerly asked as guards removed the bar from the door.</p><p>\u201cThe peasant girl can\u2014,\u201d King Torgen went silent when the door opened.</p><p>\u201cShe can?\u201d Prince Toril prompted. When his father did not respond, Prince Toril peered over his shoulder.</p><p>A rather normal-looking girl with brown hair and large eyes was standing in the middle of a barren room. Next to her was a spinning wheel, upon which there was a spindle of thread that glittered and twinkled like gold.</p><p>In that moment, Prince Toril knew the girl was doomed. He would never be able to save her from his Father\u2019s clutches now.</p><p>Chapter 5 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma had dosed off for a few minutes when the horizon was pink with the promise of the sun. While she was sleeping, the mage must have slipped out. When she opened her eyes he was gone, although the gold thread was still there, wound around a spindle.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s body creaked and ached as she pushed herself off the ground\u2014a most uncomfortable sleeping position\u2014and approached the spinning wheel.</p><p>She held her breath, releasing it only when she reached out to touch the metallic thread. It was real, and it was most assuredly gold\u2014or at least close enough that no one would know the difference.</p><p>\u201cNot a hallucination then,\u201d Gemma said, turning to the window to greet the sun with a tame smile. Her future was still dark, but she would survive the day, which was more than she hoped for. With extra time, she could gather better escape tools.</p> <p>Gemma was crouched in front of the spinning wheel, eyeing it with escape plans in mind, when she heard voices in the hallway. The door thudded and clanked as it was unlocked and unbarred. Gemma had just enough time to hide her bent fork and dull knife in her skirts before the door opened.</p><p>King Torgen stood in the doorway. His bloodshot eyes were immediately drawn to the gold thread.</p><p>\u201cShe can?\u201d someone said out in the hallway. A handsome young man Gemma recognized as Prince Toril peered over his father\u2019s shoulder. The prince was...horrified. He looked from the gold to his father, dismay twisting his face.</p><p>\u201cGemma Kielland. Well done,\u201d King Torgen said, a delighted smile crawling across his face as he stormed into the room.</p><p>Gemma nervously backed up until she hit the wall before she stooped in a curtsey.</p> <p>\u201cYou have indeed managed to spin flax into gold,\u201d King Torgen said, caressing the costly thread. \u201cJust as I asked.\u201d</p><p>Gemma curtsied again rather than risk speaking.</p><p>\u201cYou will do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, My Lord?\u201d Gemma said. She wasn\u2019t surprised but fear and disappointment still shot through her like an arrow.</p><p>\u201cGuards, take her back to the dungeons. We will begin preparations for her next task,\u201d King Torgen said, smiling cruelly at Gemma.</p><p>\u201cYes, My Lord,\u201d the guards standing outside the room murmured. They organized themselves around Gemma and escorted her out of the room and down the hallway.</p> <p>She was surprised when the guard captain fell in step with her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ask how you did it,\u201d he said, staring straight ahead. \u201cBut I pray, miss, that you can do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall see,\u201d Gemma grimly said. \u201cPrince Toril looked...displeased,\u201d she said as they turned a corner and headed down the wretched spiral staircase that would take them to the dungeons.</p><p>\u201cYah. He managed to nearly talk King Torgen into releasing you.\u201d</p><p>Gemma stopped walking. \u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Toril was pushing for your release. He almost had it, too, until King Torgen saw the gold.\u201d</p><p>Gemma pinched her eyes shut. She would have been free? If the mage hadn\u2019t done this impossible task, she would be free to go.</p><p>\u201c...Miss?\u201d the captain said.</p> <p>Or would she? The King was stubborn. It was likely he would come after her again as soon as Prince Toril\u2019s back was turned.</p><p>I can still survive this. The mage really did save me, Gemma decided.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do it a second time, can you?\u201d the captain said.</p><p>Gemma squared her shoulders and lifted her chin. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see who\u2019s crowned the victor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is nothing, sir,\u201d Gemma said, walking again. She was quiet until they reached the dungeons.</p><p>\u201cWe can move you to a more comfortable cell. The first one has a straw pallet. Take her there,\u201d the captain told his men.</p><p>Realizing Lady Linnea would have a harder time finding her if she moved cells, Gemma was quick to say, \u201cPlease, I would prefer to return to my original cell. If you don\u2019t mind, sir,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain? You would be more comfortable,\u201d the captain said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>The captain shrugged and nodded to his men, who escorted Gemma farther down the cell block.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you let the...stranger into my room last night?\u201d Gemma asked when they stopped outside her cell.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you allow a visitor inside?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cMiss, if you go missing, my life and the lives of my men are forfeit. I pity you, but neither I nor my men would allow someone in your room while you were spinning. Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I apologize. It must have been a dream,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the captain said. He opened the dungeon door and bowed his head when Gemma slipped inside. \u201cSomeone will bring you breakfast shortly,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The captain nodded and closed the dungeon door with a clank.</p><p>Gemma shivered at the scratch marks and blood splattering the back of the dungeon door. She picked up her stool and put it under the window before climbing it. She stood on her tip-toes to peer outside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lady Linnea was not waiting\u2014which didn\u2019t surprise Gemma. It was still early; Lady Linnea had most likely just finished her secret morning sword practice.</p><p>Gemma sat down on the stool and picked up the outer layer of her gown\u2014which was a plain brown color\u2014and ripped off a small piece of her linen kirtle. She tied the little strip in a bow around one of the bars in case Lady Linnea could not remember which cell she was in.</p><p>Gemma strained to get closer to the window to breath in the fresh air, her stomach rolling from the prevalent, coppery smell of blood that coated the dungeons. She glanced at the blanket and the soldier\u2019s cloak left on the ground from the previous day before she hopped off the stool.</p><p>I should rest. Even if I don\u2019t want to.</p> <p>She tucked the blanket around herself after she sat down in a corner. She closed her eyes, trying to come up with an escape plan.</p><p>Lady Linnea paced back and forth. She had heard\u2014thanks to a fist full of copper coins presented to a servant\u2014that Gemma survived the night with no threat of beheading. The servant insisted it was because Gemma successfully spun flax into gold, but that was impossible.</p><p>\u201cGemma is not the goose that laid a gold egg. She\u2019s an excellent seamstress, but she hasn\u2019t any magic!\u201d Lady Linnea said, addressing Lake Sno. \u201cPrince Toril must have gotten through to his father. That is the only reasonable explanation.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea rounded the bend so she could peek past the trees and peer at the Verglas palace. No one was in sight.</p><p>\u201cWill he take all day to arrive?\u201d Lady Linnea groaned. Her message to Prince Toril asked him to meet her at the shores of Lake Sno immediately. Evidently the dim-wit did not share Lady Linnea\u2019s sense of urgency.</p> <p>\u201cThe lovesick fool is probably off sighing over flowers and a reflecting pool,\u201d Lady Linnea sourly said, her expression pinched. \u201cPerhaps I should see if I can speak to Gemma in the dungeons...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Linnea!\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril, riding a beautiful stallion, broke through the line of trees at the border of the forest.</p><p>\u201cPrince Toril,\u201d Lady Linnea said, treating the prince to a delicate and elegant curtsy before she smiled at him. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great news? I must give you a million thanks,\u201d she asked. The smile fell from her lips when Prince Toril rode closer and Lady Linnea was able to read his stormy expression. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour maid\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my seamstress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. Your seamstress has not been released, nor was she spared because of my efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how?\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril sighed, his bangs falling over his eyes like a horse\u2019s unruly forelock. \u201cShe spun flax into gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cImpossible or not, she did it. I saw it with my own eyes. All the flax fibers were gone, and instead, there was a spindle of gold thread,\u201d Prince Toril said, dismounting.</p><p>\u201cThen it was a trick of some sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not. Father had the goldsmiths inspect the thread immediately. It\u2019s real gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how? Gemma doesn\u2019t have any magic. I know she doesn\u2019t! If she had an ability like that, she would have used it before now to make her dresses even more exquisite! She has too much pride as a seamstress not to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes she have a patron? Someone who could hire a man to climb the castle walls and deliver gold thread to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a clever idea, but no. She is employed solely by my family. She has parents, but they are penniless. Perhaps Papa and Mama did it. How much thread was there?\u201d Lady Linnea asked, offering her hand\u2014palm up\u2014to Toril\u2019s stallion.</p><p>\u201cA good amount on a spool this big,\u201d Toril said, gesturing with his hands.</p><p>Lady Linnea bit her lip. \u201cThen it was not my parents. They like Gemma well enough, but Papa wouldn\u2019t give up that much gold for a seamstress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t do it?\u201d Prince Toril pointedly asked.</p><p>Lady Linnea frowned at Prince Toril. \u201cIf I thought up that smart of a plan, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered to ask you for help in the first place. It\u2019s a shame I didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril also frowned at the casual, verbal backhand. \u201cIt was not a smart plan. I nearly talked my father into letting her go. And then he saw the gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t release her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now. Even though it is obvious someone besides Gemma made the gold, he\u2019s not going to give her up. He is too greedy.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea wilted. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that possibility. So she\u2019s still captive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And Father intends to make her spin again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. The materials need to be gathered I suppose, but after\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can delay the spinning if we buy up all the flax in Ostfold!\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril was almost pulled off his feet when his stallion tossed his head. \u201cDo you have any idea how much that will cost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares? Gemma just spun your father gold thread. You can afford it. Now are you going to help me save my seamstress or not?\u201d Lady Linnea asked, planting her fists on her hips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBuying the flax won\u2019t save her.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea closed her eyes and knitted her hands together to keep from reaching out and pulling on Prince Toril\u2019s long bangs in impatience. \u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d she agreed, her voice tight as she tried to practice patience. \u201cBut it will buy Gemma some extra time until I can think of a proper escape strategy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>Lady Linnea waited several moments for a more eloquent response. None were forthcoming. \u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you buy the flax?\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril patted his stallion\u2019s glossy neck. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope this servant of yours is worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma is priceless,\u201d Lady Linnea said. \u201cNow get to the markets. You have to buy the flax before your father gives the orders!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, yes,\u201d Toril said. He gripped the stallion\u2019s reins before vaulting back into the saddle. \u201cI will send word to you about the flax.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you. I will speak with Gemma and see if she will tell me how she received the gold,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cYou what? You cannot. She is in the dungeons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know that,\u201d Lady Linnea said, rolling her eyes. \u201cShe was wretched hard to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went to the dungeons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens no! Even I am not that daring. No, I found her by the prison windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Now get buying!\u201d Lady Linnea said, making a shooing motion at the prince. \u201cPrince Toril,\u201d she called after the prince turned his stallion in the direction of the forest. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril bowed at the waist. \u201cI am happy to help,\u201d he said before he rode off.</p><p>\u201cEven if he isn\u2019t the brightest, I like him more when he is invested, not moping,\u201d Lady Linnea decided as she bustled off in the direction of the palace.</p><p>\u201c...and that is our plan,\u201d Lady Linnea said, smiling brightly.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Lady Linnea asked.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds expensive,\u201d Gemma honestly responded.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe. We\u2019ll see. That reminds me, how on earth did you get gold thread?\u201d Lady Linnea asked, peering down into the depths of Gemma\u2019s cell.</p> <p>\u201cA mage broke into the room and spun it for me,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to tell me, you don\u2019t have to make up a story about it,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a story.\u201d</p><p>Linnea rolled her eyes. \u201cRegardless, do you think you can pull it off again?\u201d</p><p>Gemma tilted her head and studied the far wall. What was the likelihood that the mage would magic his way through the castle to come to her rescue a second time? \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. We\u2019ll just have to get you out before the King imprisons you in another room with flax. Ah, that reminds me! Here,\u201d Lady Linnea said. She disappeared for a moment. When she swerved back into view, she carried an axe, which she struggled to lower through the grille of the window.</p><p>The fat, wedge-shaped head caught on the bars and would not push through.</p><p>Lady Linnea grunted, her eyes shut tightly as she strained to hold the tool. \u201cDo you have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is stuck on the bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Please tell me you are jesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t often jest, My Lady.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea sat on the grate and tried maneuvering the axe through the slender gap between the bars with no luck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to fit,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cIt has to,\u201d Lady Linnea grunted as she heaved all of her weight onto the axe\u2019s wooden handle. \u201cI\u2019ve failed you too many times. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone is going to hear you,\u201d Gemma said, staring at the stuck axe head that clanked against the window grille.</p><p>Lady Linnea gave up and tossed the axe aside, her shoulders drooping. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gemma. I\u2019m useless, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not,\u201d Gemma said, giving Lady Linnea a rare smile of affection.</p><p>\u201cI am, too. I keep trying, but I fail! Trying alone isn\u2019t going to save you,\u201d Lady Linnea said, brushing dirt off her dress. \u201cI\u2019ll bring something later today\u2014a slender dagger without a hilt, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cYou think you will be able to slip away from your home again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Mama and Papa think I\u2019m despondent and locked up in my room since you were taken away. Although I better go. They\u2019ll be knocking on my door soon for lunch,\u201d Lady Linnea said before she ducked from view. Gemma heard a clank as the noble lady tried hefting the axe over the wall that separated Gemma\u2019s cell from the palace grounds.</p><p>\u201cMy Lady,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Lady Linnea reappeared. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the help,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Lady Linnea smiled. \u201cOf course. You are important to me, Gemma,\u201d she said before she threw herself at the wall and started climbing. \u201cI\u2019ll see you this afternoon!\u201d she said, hefting herself over the wall and disappearing all together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma was sitting on her thick blanket when the cell door clanked open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your early dinner here,\u201d a guard carrying a tray said. He pushed up the visor of his helm several times before he gave up and tossed the protective head-covering outside the dungeon. Gemma recognized the man as the kind guard who had delivered dinner the night before, as well as her breakfast that morning.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gemma said, sitting up straight.</p><p>\u201cNo need for thanks,\u201d the guard said, briskly setting the tray on Gemma\u2019s stool. He glanced at Gemma and made a sweep of the surroundings before he shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know when I am to be taken tonight?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>The guard scratched his thinning hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not. The spinning won\u2019t be ready for another day. There seems to be a shortage of flax fibers.\u201d</p><p>Gemma stared at the man. Lady Linnea\u2019s plan was actually working?!</p><p>\u201cI see. Thank you,\u201d Gemma repeated.</p><p>The man shook his head. \u201cI will return for your dishes,\u201d he said, stooping to pick up his helm before he left Gemma\u2019s cell, locking it behind him.</p> <p>Gemma looked over the plates and cutlery piled on the tray. She nibbled on the food\u2014a delicious roasted duck\u2014but mostly pushed it around. Her stomach gurgled with nerves as she tested the knife for sharpness and compared it to the dull, warped one she had smuggled into her spinning room.</p><p>As she ate, Gemma swapped out the knives and thought about the fixed patterns of her prison life\u2014mainly the movement of her guards.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Gemma didn\u2019t move the following morning when the kind guard opened the door to her cell to deliver her breakfast tray.</p><p>The soldier pushed up his visor before, as customary, he removed his helm altogether. He entered the cell and looked around for the stool before realizing Gemma, huddled in the corner, was sitting on it, her eyes closed and, to all appearances, sleeping.</p><p>\u201cPoor thing,\u201d the guard said before he turned his back to Gemma and set the tray down. He crouched down to fix some of the items on the tray, and Gemma smashed him in the back of the head with the stool.</p> <p>He toppled over with a groan, stunned long enough for Gemma to unbuckle his belt and slide the keys off.</p><p>She ran out of the cell and shut the door as the guard started to recover.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Stop! Help!\u201d he yelled, but his shouts were muffled behind the thick dungeon walls.</p><p>Gemma fumbled with the three keys on the ring before she found the right one and locked it just as the soldier slammed into the door on the other side.</p><p>Gemma dropped the keys and ran through the surprisingly empty dungeon. She sprinted up the stairs just as voices emerged from the far end of the chamber.</p><p>When she reached the top stair\u2014sweaty and out of breath\u2014Gemma paused long enough to look up and down the hallway. She spied a laundress pushing a cart of laundry. When the woman paused to enter a side room to gather more laundry, Gemma grabbed a huge pile of dirtied linens. She held the laundry at chest height so it mounded over her like a cloth mountain, hiding her face.</p><p>Still carrying the laundry, Gemma prowled down the hallway, looking for a way out of the palace. Her hands trembled when a group of three chattering maids glided down the hallway. Gemma\u2019s heart throbbed in her chest, but none of the servants called out to her, or even seemed to notice her as she walked.</p><p>Gemma slipped around a corner and leaned against a wall. Enough, she thought. I have to be calm. Gemma tilted her head and listened. The palace was mostly silent. Servants talked in hushed tones and did their work quickly and efficiently. No one had raised a cry yet. Perhaps no one even knew she had escaped.</p> <p>Still listening, Gemma started walking again. This time, she followed her ears, moving in the direction of servants\u2019 chatter.</p><p>She made it to the kitchens with no trouble. Rather than plunge through the warm room in a bundle of laundry, Gemma followed an outer wall that led away from the kitchens. Eventually, it opened up into a courtyard.</p><p>Gemma heaved the laundry higher up and walked across the courtyard. She couldn\u2019t believe it when she passed the palace walls and entered the gardens. She made it to the shores of Lake Sno without being detected. Gemma skirted up to the line of trees that crowded the lakeshore. Then, she dropped the laundry and ran, following the edge of the forest.</p><p>Eventually, she came upon a little shack. Gemma took a risk and peeped inside. The shack was empty and buried under dust. It obviously hadn\u2019t been used in some time. There were white swan feathers that dotted the furniture, and a small bundle of what looked like dried nettles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma ransacked the place, looking for blankets, provisions, anything she could take. It wasn\u2019t safe to return to Ostfold. She was better off hiding in the forest and at the base of the mountains. In a few weeks, maybe she could venture into the outskirts of Ostfold to ask Lady Linnea for help.</p><p>Gemma would have to abandon her relationship with Grandmother Guri. It was far too dangerous to risk seeing the older woman. And as sad as it made Gemma to lose her, she wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to be killed because of her. Gemma, in the middle of swinging open a cupboard door, paused. The captain said his life and the life of his men would be forfeit if I escaped...No. I cannot afford to think of them. I must hide, she decided, glancing inside the cupboard and moving on.</p><p>She climbed a ladder to find a loft filled with straw and peppered with swan feathers. Her conscience railed at her as she climbed down, and she sagged against the ladder when she stepped off the bottom rung. They were kind to me, and surely they have families and loved ones who will miss them.</p><p>Gemma leaned her cheek against the dirty ladder. \u201cWhat does it matter? I must think of myself. No one would think of saving my life\u2014not my drunkard father, nor my mother who hasn\u2019t the strength for it. No one would...except for Lady Linnea.\u201d</p> <p>Gemma closed her icy eyes and balled her hands into a fist. \u201cBy the Snow Queen,\u201d she cursed before releasing a great sigh. \u201cLady Linnea is right. I am foolish,\u201d she said before exiting the shack. She retreated back up the shoreline, picking up the abandoned laundry when she found it. She dawdled on the lakeshore for a few moments (enjoying the sunlight on her skin in spite of the blustery wind) before walking back through the royal gardens and into the palace.</p><p>She set the stolen laundry down in an empty hallway and wandered deeper into the palace. It took her a while to find the dungeon stairs, and when she happened upon them, she stared for a few minutes before she took in gulps of fresh air and set her shoulders.</p><p>Gemma fixed her face into an expression of strength, then plunged down the stairway. Her heart beat heavier with each step she took, and every instinct screamed at her to run. But she followed the stairs all the way to the dungeon. When she reached the bottom stair, she leaned forward to look down the aisle formed the boundaries of the cell blocks. The door to her cell was open, but there were no guards to be seen. Obviously, someone had freed the man who delivered Gemma\u2019s breakfast.</p><p>Gemma tried to walk the remaining distance to her cell, but her legs stiffened and froze. So she plopped down on the lowest stair, hunched over her knees in a miserable ball, and waited to be discovered. Her shoulders shook in a moment of despair. Panic clawed at her, and her emotions threatened to overtake her. It isn\u2019t fair. I never asked for this, I\u2014Gemma impatiently crushed the thought and threw her arms over her legs, resting her head on her arms. She didn\u2019t look up when several sets of heavy footfalls raced up the aisle.</p><p>\u201cAny news from the palace guards?\u201d a male from one end of the dungeon called.</p> <p>\u201cNone. She did not go out the front gates\u2014or if she did it was before we notified them,\u201d a different man at the opposite end shouted.</p><p>\u201cContact the dog master,\u201d the first man said.</p><p>\u201cI already have; he asked for her blanket,\u201d the second soldier said as he ran past Gemma and the staircase. \u201cIf we\u2019re lucky it will have her scent\u2014,\u201d the soldier cut himself off and backed up to stand in front of Gemma and stare down at her.</p><p>Gemma lifted her head up. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she said, impatiently wiping at her eyes that were, irritatingly enough, burning with tears.</p><p>The soldier pinched his eyes shut and rubbed them before staring at her.</p><p>\u201cFoss,\u201d the guard from the opposite end called. \u201cFoss! What is wrong with you, man?\u201d he said, his voice growing louder as he drew closer. \u201cAre you\u2014,\u201d the guard\u2014or the captain, as Gemma recognized him once she could see his face\u2014cut himself off when he joined \u201cFoss\u201d at the dungeon staircase to gawk at Gemma.</p> <p>Gemma finished wiping her eyes and stared back at the pair. \u201cI would walk myself back my cell, but my legs have given out at the moment,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her words kicked Foss into moving. \u201cWe should tell the others\u2014no! First we need to put her in her cell! Where are the keys\u2014,\u201d he quieted when the captain placed a meaty hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the captain asked.</p><p>Gemma met the captain\u2019s gaze with her sharp, intense eyes. \u201cWhy what?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come back? There is a very good chance we wouldn\u2019t have found you. You were free.\u201d</p><p>Gemma rolled her shoulders back. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the captain said.</p><p>Gemma stared at Foss and the captain. Foss shifted and squirmed, but the captain was an unmovable mountain. \u201cBecause you and your men don\u2019t deserve to die. Is that an acceptable answer?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The captain didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he let go of Foss and reached out to help Gemma stand. He held her arm while walking her back to her cell\u2014Gemma wasn\u2019t sure if it was because he was supporting her or keeping her from running away.</p><p>When they reached Gemma\u2019s cell, Gemma slipped inside. She picked up her stool and set it in a corner. \u201cIs he alright?\u201d Gemma asked, gesturing to her untouched breakfast tray.</p><p>\u201cHe is uninjured,\u201d the captain said, reaching for the cell door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI would let you go if...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Gemma sat on her stool. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to apologize for. You are not the one who has imprisoned me,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The captain was silent as he studied Gemma for a few moments longer before he shut the cell door with an ominous clank. Gemma flinched, but held herself together.</p><p>The brief escape made the dungeon feel even colder and darker. The stench made her stomach roll, and the silence was suffocating.</p><p>\u201cIf I got out once, I can do it again. I will just have to make certain I do it so no one can be blamed,\u201d she vowed.</p><p>\u201cGemma. Gemma, I am a genius, and you must tell me that,\u201d Lady Linnea called, almost falling over the wall above Gemma\u2019s cell. \u201cBuying up the flax has worked marvelously\u2014even if that idiot Prince Toril almost ruined it all by having the flax sent to the palace. A chicken has more sense than him. He is\u2014what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lady Linnea said when she realized Gemma wasn\u2019t responding.</p><p>\u201cHm? Nothing. Sorry, I was sleeping,\u201d Gemma lied, unfolding from the corner into which she was pressed. She moved the stool so it was beneath the window and stood on it, looking straight up at her friend.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lady Linnea said doubtfully. \u201cYou look pretty dreadful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you hide the purchased flax from King Torgen?\u201d Gemma asked. (It was easier to distract Lady Linnea than to lie outright to her. The beautiful lady was observant, and it was likely that she would haul off and hit Gemma if she knew Gemma had the chance to escape and chose to returned to her cell.)</p><p>\u201cOh! It was brilliant. I ordered straw to be bought, and we spread it on top of the cart of flax fibers!\u201d Lady Linnea beamed. \u201cPrince Toril got the stable servants to agree not to tell King Torgen,\u201d she grudgingly added.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something,\u201d Lady Linnea said, reaching for something out of sight. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, passing a small hand hatchet through the window grate. \u201cIt\u2019s not very sharp, but it was the only one I found that I thought could fit through the bars,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gemma said. She smiled as she ran a finger along the axe-head. \u201cThis will be useful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlso, I thought you might have to bribe someone at some point, so take this,\u201d Lady Linnea said, shoving her fingers through the grille to offer Gemma a plain, gold ring.</p><p>\u201cI cannot take your jewelry, My Lady,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cPft, this old thing? I received it at party in Loire. Means nothing to me\u2014it\u2019s too small for my fingers anyway. Take it, I\u2019ll never wear it,\u201d Lady Linnea said, wriggling her fingers to wave the ring in Gemma\u2019s face.</p><p>Gemma stared at Lady Linnea for a few moments before reluctantly taking the ring. \u201cThank you, My Lady,\u201d she said before Lady Linnea pulled her hand back through the bars.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Oh! One more thing. An old lady told me to give you this,\u201d Lady Linnea said, stuffing a small pouch through the bars.</p><p>\u201cAn old woman?\u201d Gemma asked after the pouch nearly fell on her face. She caught the pouch and opened it. Inside was a number of sewing needles carefully jabbed into a piece of fleece.</p><p>\u201cShe approached me when I was walking in our garden with Mama and called me a blood thirsty barbarian! Thankfully, Mama was talking with Jentine and didn\u2019t hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, it was Grandmother Guri,\u201d Gemma said, brushing the needles with her forefinger.</p> <p>\u201cGrandmother Guri? The woman who taught you to sew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea made a tisking noise. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame she didn\u2019t tell me as much. I would love to converse with such an interesting woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is unusual in that way,\u201d Gemma said, studying the needles.</p><p>\u201cSo why did she give you...sewing needles?\u201d Lady Linnea asked, pressing her face against the ceiling-window grate so she could have a better look.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Did she say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Perhaps she meant for you to use them as lock picks?\u201d</p><p>Gemma slid the needles back in the pouch. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re they right shape, My Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can always try. Anyway, I\u2019ve got to go. Mama is getting suspicious. She tried forcing me to take lessons again today, but Papa said I didn\u2019t have to. He feels bad about leaving you\u2014as he should,\u201d Lady Linnea snorted like an antsy horse.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the hatchet and ring, and for delivering the needles,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I will see you soon. Be well!\u201d Lady Linnea said before she darted from Gemma\u2019s sight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma sat in the bit of late afternoon sunlight that peeked into her cell and studied her newly acquired items.</p><p>She ran a finger over the dulled hatchet edge and walked the perimeter of her cell. \u201cIt\u2019s all stone, so unless I could chop through the iron bars\u2014which I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t burrow out. And even if I did, the soldiers would be blamed for my escape. I will have to escape when I\u2019m supposed to be spinning. Perhaps I can convince King Torgen I must be unguarded,\u201d Gemma murmured.</p><p>She sighed and lifted the hatchet up again to study it. \u201cWhere on earth am I going to hide this?\u201d</p><p>Minutes stretched into hours as Gemma experimented with various locations of securing the hatchet in her clothes so it would neither fall out nor cut her.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until the sky was purple-blue with the beginning of night that Gemma realized no one had stopped by. Not that she was expecting anyone besides Lady Linnea, but the guards hadn\u2019t dropped off lunch or appeared to take her breakfast tray.</p><p>I don\u2019t blame them. They must be leery of me, Gemma thought as she rested her back against a grungy wall and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou lie and say you can spin flax into gold, and you return to the dungeons after a successful escape attempt. I am beginning to think you might have a death wish.\u201d</p><p>Gemma lurched forward in surprise at the familiar, melodious male voice.</p><p>It was the mage.</p> <p>Gemma stood, careful not to disrupt the various escape items she had strapped to her body, and hopped on the stool to look out the ceiling-window.</p><p>The mage sat on the edge of the grille with enough ease to make Lady Linnea jealous. He still wore his unusual, black cloak, but today he had on tan, cotton pants that puffed a little at the knee but were tucked into his boots, a blue sash with incredible beadwork as a belt, and black cotton shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. A blue dragon was embroidered on his shirt, and if Gemma looked at it out of the corner of her eye it seemed almost like the dragon moved.</p><p>Why does he dress so oddly? He must be ancient and is dressing in styles from the distant past, Gemma decided, taking in the mage\u2019s clothes.</p><p>He lounged on the cold ground as if he were seated on pillows with his elbows propped on the grate and his legs carelessly crossed. His face was covered by his cloak, but his fine chin and lips were pointed down at Gemma.</p><p>\u201cI very much wish to live,\u201d Gemma firmly said.</p><p>\u201cTruly? You need to be more convincing, in that case,\u201d the mage said.</p> <p>\u201cIf I did not lie about my abilities, King Torgen would have killed my father in addition to me. Although I cannot abide the man, my mother feels something for him, and it would be cruel to leave her alone in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your escape this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guards in charge of me would have been slaughtered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would sacrifice yourself for the men holding you captive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would sacrifice myself to spare the men who have shown me kindness in spite of the danger they face. They have families, children, and wives who would miss them. I am but one person,\u201d Gemma said, getting a crick in her neck from looking straight up. \u201cIt is not that I wish for death or think I am worth less as much as it is that I choose to not see them die for my sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are noble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d Gemma said, hopping off the stool.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you understand me, Gemma Kielland. You are noble,\u201d the mage said.</p> <p>Gemma leaned against a gritty, damp wall. \u201cI fear you have been deceived. I am not noble. I have often been told I am a jaded, cynical being who speaks with the intent to maim.\u201d</p><p>The mage chuckled. \u201cYou mistake aristocracy for nobility. By noble, I mean you have an excellent moral character.\u201d</p><p>Gemma felt like she had no response to such a compliment.</p><p>\u201cIt is a rare quality,\u201d the mage added, his voice wistful.</p><p>Gemma pushed off the wall and raised her icy gray-blue eyes to look at the mage. \u201cRare? I should think you often rub elbows with people of excellent moral character,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d the mage asked, his fine lips curling with the question.</p><p>\u201cYou are a magic user\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cCraftmage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Magic users\u2014and mages\u2014are some of the most outstanding figures in the world,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we once were,\u201d the mage said, sighing with elegance. \u201cBut now we have so many rules and regulations we must follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they noble rules? You said you had an obligation to help those in need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, and I do,\u201d the mage agreed. He tilted his head to look up at the sky, treating Gemma to a quick few of his rather fine nose. \u201cBut it\u2019s not because of any regulation. When I made the rank of craftmage, a very dear friend spoke to me about the responsibility of using magic. She insisted that whenever possible, it was my duty to help the weak. I swore I would do so.\u201d</p><p>Gemma pinched her lips together.</p><p>The mage exhaled. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve upset you. What is it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI take exception to being labeled weak.\u201d</p><p>The mage laughed outright. \u201cAs you should,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I have learned anything about your character, it is that you are a strong woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhich brings us back to you. Why did you so nobly return? Why did you lie in the first place?\u201d the mage asked, tucking one knee to his chest.</p> <p>Gemma shrugged. \u201cWhat could I gain by thinking only of myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour life?\u201d the mage said.</p><p>Gemma pinched her lips together.</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019ve offended you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I merely no longer wish to dwell on my actions. Good evening, Sir Mage,\u201d Gemma said, walking towards a corner of her cell.</p> <p>\u201cAh, wait, you hasty thing,\u201d the mage called.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, you will be summoned by King Torgen to another room to spin flax into gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>The mage nodded. \u201cI will help you complete the task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Gemma asked.</p> <p>\u201cMy obligation to aid those in need...but also because you deserve a little magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better\u2014easier even\u2014to free me from my cell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but I am hopeful we can find a way for you to return to your normal life. Breaking you out would shatter that chance,\u201d the mage said. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>Gemma shrugged. \u201cIt seems I am a bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind. I will be stranded in Verglas for a time anyway,\u201d the mage said, looking away again.</p><p>Gemma and the mage were silent for a few minutes before the mage spoke. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk a lot, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I speak if I have nothing of worth to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoble, strong, and practical. If we keep this up, in several nights, I will be able to fully report on your character,\u201d the mage said.</p> <p>\u201cHm,\u201d Gemma said, conveying disinterest as she returned to leaning against the cell wall.</p><p>The mage rustled around on the grate for a moment before sliding his hand through an opening. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, holding out a chunk of cheese and an apple.</p><p>Gemma looked from the offered snack up to the mage. \u201cI have plenty to eat myself,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gemma said. She was careful not to touch his hand when she took the food\u2014not out of fear as much as respect.</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019ve been fed and reassured, are you in the mood for a game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Gemma held back a sigh. \u201cIs it a mouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not how the game works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir Mage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you are so against guessing, I will take a turn. Do you have something in your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Gemma reluctantly said.</p><p>\u201cExcellent, is it a material?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a food item, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The stupid game went on for at least an hour. As little as Gemma liked the game, she had to admit it kept her mind off her pitiful circumstances, and by the time the mage crowned her as the champion of the night, Gemma\u2019s heart was lighter, and the dungeon was not so terribly bleak.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>At sunset the following day, Gemma stood in front of her cell door, her arms folded across her chest, her feet firmly planted. Her stomach growled so loudly it was painful. She hadn\u2019t had anything to eat besides the apple and cheese from the mage almost a full day before.</p><p>Gemma stood as still as a statue and was not disappointed. Within minutes, the door to her cell clanked and swung open.</p><p>The captain from the previous day, the guard called Foss, and four other guards stood on the other side, braced as if Gemma were a wild animal about to attack.</p><p>Gemma raised an eyebrow at their stance and wordlessly joined them in the aisle. The soldiers crowded around her, making it difficult to move. Gemma was surprised they didn\u2019t put shackles on her or tie her arms behind her back.</p><p>The escort to the room she was to spin in was silent, awkward, and uncomfortable. The guards startled whenever she moved\u2014Foss almost yelled when she raised a hand to adjust her hair-band.</p><p>After climbing two different sets of stairs and winding down several hallways, Gemma and her escort popped out in a narrow corridor where King Torgen, Prince Toril, and a band of guards were waiting for them.</p><p>\u201cGemma Kielland, your time has come,\u201d King Torgen said, indicating to the doorway in front of him. \u201cThe conditions are the same as before. Spin all the flax into gold by dawn, or I will have you beheaded.\u201d</p><p>Gemma glanced through the open doorway and, with disappointment, noted that it was not the same room as the previous time. Even worse, there was a great deal more flax. There was so much, in fact, that it covered the room like a fibrous carpet.</p><p>\u201cVery well, but I have a new condition as well, My Lord,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d King Torgen said, his face going from feverishly happy to angry.</p><p>Behind him, Prince Toril made a gesture to stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will spin this flax, but it will make more noise than my previous time. I cannot have any guards on duty\u2014for if they hear my work, the flax will fail to turn into gold,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>The guards surrounding Gemma did not turn to gape at her\u2014as Gemma was sure they longed to\u2014but one of them shifted, and two of the guards who were holding spears tightened their grips so the wooden poles of their weapons creaked.</p><p>They knew what she was doing\u2014or trying to do.</p><p>\u201cI think not, Gemma Kielland,\u201d King Torgen said, his bloodshot eyes narrowed.</p> <p>\u201cThen you won\u2019t see a speck of gold,\u201d Gemma said, her voice flat as she stared the King down.</p><p>Nobody spoke.</p><p>King Torgen and Gemma stared at each other. Gemma held his feverish glare. She knew if she looked away, he would tear into her.</p><p>\u201cFather, you should give her a fair chance,\u201d Prince Toril said. \u201cIf she, er, cannot complete the task it will hardly be her fault.\u201d</p><p>King Torgen sneered. \u201cFine. The guards will stay on duty, but they will be stationed two hallways away.\u201d</p> <p>With this pronouncement, King Torgen walked away, four guards trailing behind him.</p><p>Prince Toril shuddered. When his father drew out of sight, he whispered, \u201cThat was dangerous. I can see why Lady Linnea thinks so highly of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, My Lord,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I know what you were trying to do. It was an honorable idea, but he\u2019s not desperate enough to give you whatever you demand. Yet,\u201d the prince said as he looked at Gemma with a pinched expression.</p><p>\u201cThank you, My Lord,\u201d Gemma said when she realized he expected some sort of reply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help you more. I\u2019m working to keep flax fibers out of Ostfold for now. I hope that is useful. Will you be alright tonight?\u201d</p> <p>Thinking back to her time spent with the mage, Gemma cocked her head. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril\u2019s shoulders slumped with relief. \u201cGreat\u2014I\u2019ll tell Lady Linnea. Until tomorrow morning, then. I wish you all the luck in the world,\u201d Prince Toril said before stepping away.</p><p>Gemma was herded into her new spinning room\u2014which was considerably larger than the previous room.</p><p>\u201cSorry, miss,\u201d a guard said before he swung the door shut. It clanked when it was locked, and thudded when the bar was slid into place.</p><p>\u201cThere goes that idea,\u201d Gemma sighed. She glanced at a small, round table that was loaded with food. There was pickled fish, boiled potatoes, baked apples, cheese, fat slices of sour dough bread that was so fresh it was still warm, and a small block of butter.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s stomach growled at the wonderful smells, but she forced herself to walk the perimeter of the room. The walls were wooden, but when she knocked, it seemed that there was some kind of stone behind the panels.</p><p>The window, Gemma eagerly saw, was again barred with wooden boards, but this room was located on the top floor. Unless she could fashion a very long ladder, Gemma would die climbing out.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help anyway. I can\u2019t leave, or the soldiers will be killed,\u201d Gemma said. Not knowing what else to do, she wandered over to the table and started to eat.</p> <p>After she finished her third potato, she turned to the mound of frayed blankets piled next to the table. As Gemma chewed on a chunk of baked apple, she unfolded a blanket, inspecting it with a critical eye.</p><p>\u201cMight help,\u201d she said.</p><p>An hour later, when the mage opened and shut the door with a deafening clank\u2014that Gemma didn\u2019t understand how the soldiers could miss\u2014Gemma greeted him.</p><p>\u201cHello, Sir Mage,\u201d she said before stuffing a piece of buttered sourdough bread in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWorking on your next escape plan?\u201d the mage asked in his throaty voice.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Gemma said around the bread as she continued braiding the strips of old blankets she had shredded.</p><p>\u201cRethinking your sacrifice?\u201d the mage asked, walking over to the spinning wheel.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Gemma said. She tossed the sturdy rope/braid and blanket pieces aside and began gathering up flax fibers. \u201cI\u2019m just preparing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d the mage said, wetting his fingers and pulling flax fibers away from the already prepared distaff, maneuvering them so they circled the spindle.</p><p>\u201cWill you have enough time tonight to spin all of this?\u201d Gemma asked, dropping an armload of the fibers by the spinning machine.</p><p>\u201cYes. The machine will merely have to spin faster. If it appears that I am running out of time, I can always set up my spinning wheel,\u201d the mage said.</p><p>\u201cYou have a spinning wheel?\u201d Gemma asked, looking at his cloak with new appreciation.</p><p>\u201cYes. I carry a number of tool kits, spinning wheels, saws, everything,\u201d the mage said. \u201cI need them to work my craft-magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you make magical items?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>The mage shrugged. \u201cYes. But it takes quite a bit of time to make things from scratch. My more valuable skills lie in the ability to bestow magic upon regular items after they have already been made. It\u2019s not often I get to make something truly magical, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn order to work my magic, the item must be high quality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think that would mean it would be quite easy if you visited a King or Queen,\u201d Gemma said, dropping another bundle of fibers by the spinning wheel.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean expensive. The high quality has nothing to do with the base materials,\u201d the mage said as he added fibers to the distaff when the spinning wheel starting whirling on its own as his magic activated. \u201cThe item needs to be well made by a true craftsmen. These days, people are more concerned with getting the newest styles as quickly as possible\u2014which means the items appear to be beautiful but often the crafters have taken shortcuts to churn them out,\u201d the mage said.</p><p>\u201cSo you can only make something magic if it\u2019s well made?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I can still enchant cheap knock-offs,\u201d the mage admitted. \u201cBut they don\u2019t hold on to the spells very long, and they won\u2019t stand up for repeated use\u2014the spells can only be used once.\u201d</p><p>Gemma lingered at the table to eat a pickled fish. \u201cI find it surprising that all goods are growing less...perfect. Some countries are known for their craft exports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you are right,\u201d the mage said. \u201cIt\u2019s still reasonably easy to find high quality furniture and food items. Jewelry can be iffy; it depends on the jeweler who made it. The same goes for weapons. The true problem is clothing. Clothing\u2014anything made of cloth really\u2014is terrible. Even robes made for a king will rarely hold more than two or three spells or charms. Unfortunately, cloth is usually what most people want enchanted,\u201d the mage said. In spite of his glorious voice, he sounded like a teacher scolding a miscreant pupil.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to carry around than furniture; it can hold a larger variety of spells than weapons; it will take stronger spells than the ones that can be spelled on food, and it is less expensive than jewelry,\u201d the mage said. His face was pointed in the direction of the spinning wheel. After watching it spin out gold thread for a few moments, he nodded.</p> <p>\u201cBut enough of my tribulations,\u201d the mage said, his lips forming a handsome smile. \u201cI want to hear about you.\u201d</p><p>Gemma picked up the last flax fibers and dumped them by the spinning wheel. \u201cWhy?\u201d she said with a complete lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cBecause you interest me,\u201d the mage said, sitting down by the table of food. \u201cSo, from whom did you inherit your nobility? Certainly not your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met him then?\u201d Gemma asked. She hesitated and stood in front of the table, wondering if it would be terribly disrespectful if she sat and ate with the mage. Probably.</p><p>\u201cOne could say that,\u201d the mage, said, pointing to the cushion next to him.</p><p>\u201cAh, my sympathies,\u201d Gemma said, ignoring the gesture and folding her legs to sit across from him.</p> <p>\u201cYour mother, then?\u201d the mage asked, mashing a potato with the only knife that came with the food.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Gemma said. She reached under her dress and slid her pilfered dinner knife out\u2014the mage choked on his potato at this particular reveal\u2014and used it to butter another piece of bread. \u201cDo you want some bread?\u201d Gemma asked when the mage finished coughing.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you storing that?\u201d the mage asked. He tilted his chin up and leaned forward, as if he were peering over the table at Gemma\u2019s skirt.</p><p>\u201cNot telling. This nobility you keep harping about is probably something I learned from Grandmother Guri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaternal or maternal grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither. I\u2019m not related to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent a lot of time with her when I was a child. She taught me how to sew, which is how I became a seamstress,\u201d Gemma said.</p> <p>\u201cYou think she might have passed her character on to you?\u201d the mage asked with a teasing smile.</p><p>Gemma shrugged. \u201cPeople say we say similar things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are borderline offensive.\u201d</p><p>The mage turned to hide his struggle to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be truthful, Sir Mage,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cI can tell,\u201d the mage said. \u201cPerhaps it is something nobody can take credit for, and it is something that uniquely belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t understand what I mean, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Gemma said, finishing her bread. She dusted off her hands and picked up her blanket rope, fidgeting her way back into it.</p><p>\u201cI supposed if you reveled in your superiority, that would cancel the nobility of your character,\u201d the mage said. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking a rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future. You never know when you will need rope,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cI can make you rope if you want some that badly, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what you just explained about cheap fabrics? I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean I make things with shotty craftsmanship; I meant the general population. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t either, of course,\u201d the mage was swift to add.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The mage laughed. \u201cYou are quite a bit of fun.\u201d</p><p>Gemma raised her eyebrows. \u201cI believe this is the first time anyone has thought so.\u201d</p><p>The mage grabbed the last slice of sourdough bread and, in one elegant motion, rocked to his feet. \u201cThen everyone you know is blind,\u201d he said, checking the tension of the spinning thread.</p><p>Gemma smiled for the merest moment. She glanced up at the mage to make sure he hadn\u2019t noticed\u2014he was still busy tending to the spinning machine\u2014before she bent over her work with determination.</p> <p>It was just after midnight when Gemma hacked the last wooden bar covering the window apart. Her back and arms ached, and she was sweaty and growing chilled in the cool, fall air, but the window was wide open. and the crisp air smelled like freedom.</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d the mage said. \u201cBut I fail to see what the open window will accomplish as you seem most determined to save your guards.\u201d</p><p>Gemma looked down at her hatchet and shrugged. \u201cI felt like hacking at something,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a useful way to channel your aggression,\u201d the mage said, crossing the room. He leaned out of the open window and inspected the outside walls. He momentarily turned back in the direction of the spinning wheel before climbing onto the window sill with great ease.</p><p>With elegance that was unnatural\u2014considering how high up they were\u2014the mage started to stand, molding his body against the castle wall when he passed the boundaries of the window frame. He jumped, and the buckles on his black boots glittered before he disappeared from sight, climbing upwards.</p> <p>Gemma leaned out of the window and watched the mage pull himself up over the edge of the roof, resting on the base ledge. The patch of roof spiked above him like an icicle, and snowflakes the size of Gemma\u2019s head formed the lattice work around the triangle.</p><p>\u201cCare to join me?\u201d the mage asked.</p><p>Gemma pointedly looked down, where large torches posted in the courtyard were barely pinpricks of light.</p><p>The mage laughed. \u201cI won\u2019t let you fall,\u201d he said, scooting on the ledge so he could offer his hand.</p><p>Gemma grumbled under her breath about nutty mages, but the lure of the cool, fresh air and the light of brilliant moon soon had her heaving her body onto the window sill.</p><p>\u201cThere are so many carvings, it\u2019s actually quite easy,\u201d the mage said, gesturing to the caribou carving next to the window.</p> <p>\u201cRight. Easy,\u201d Gemma grunted as she planted a foot on the hooves of the caribou\u2019s back legs and strained to grab his rearing front legs. Gemma grumbled more about crazy mages when her grip slid and her stomach rolled\u2014making her regret the last few pieces of bread she had eaten\u2014before she climbed higher.</p><p>When Gemma clambered onto the caribou\u2019s head, the mage grabbed her by the back of her dress and helped haul her onto the ledge.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s less windy here,\u201d the mage said, motioning for Gemma to scoot further into the triangular shape. \u201cWhich is lucky, because I\u2019m no weather mage,\u201d he said, offering Gemma a grin.</p><p>Gemma had nothing to say\u2014the intimidating climb up to the ledge and her knowledge of everything she owed the mage kept her from speaking the insults.</p><p>Instead, Gemma admired the beauty that lay outside the castle. The night sky was a deep purple with a screen of stars twinkling like diamonds sewn into lace. Fresler\u2019s Helm\u2014one of the tallest and surely the most famous mountains in the range that loomed around the royal palace like the train of a dress\u2014glowed in the moonlight. Occasionally, long strands of emerald green and shadowed snow blue light swirled from the mountain and added extra color to the sky.</p><p>The air chilled Gemma, freezing her cheeks and nose, but it smelled fresh, with hints of leaves and smoky fires and\u2014just the barest trace of what would soon come\u2014snow.</p><p>It felt amazing to be outside again. Her escape attempt had awakened Gemma\u2019s longing to be out. Out of the castle, out of the black walls of the dungeon. Sitting on the ledge in the fresh air soothed her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Gemma said after several minutes.</p> <p>\u201cIt is,\u201d the mage agreed, rustling around in his cloak. \u201cVerglas is savage and wild, but also unbelievably beautiful. Here, take this. It will keep you warm,\u201d he said, removing something from his cloak. He breathed on it before holding it out to Gemma.</p><p>In his hands was a ruby. It was the deep red of blood, cut as thinly as a knife blade, and fashioned in the shape of a flame.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, reaching out to take it. Gemma jumped in surprise when she touched the ruby and felt heat flow into her finger tips and up her arm. She withdrew her hand and eyed the elaborately cut gem.</p><p>\u201cA heat charm. One of the more rare variety as it\u2019s attached to jewelry,\u201d the mage said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma slowly reached out and took the charm, her shoulders relaxing from the hunch she had pulled into when the heat spread through her body. \u201cIs this an example of a charm that could be put in cloth\u2014or clothes?\u201d</p><p>The mage nodded. \u201cMy cloak has the same effect as the ruby. Most gems and precious metals can hold a large amount of magic. They are merely much harder to procure. That heat charm would go for the same price as, say, hmm, a matched team of four horses with good bloodlines and excellent confirmation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gemma said, her eyes bulging.</p><p>The mage shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s why royals can afford such charms for themselves and but cannot afford to outfit their armies. Which is just as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it really that hard to find good quality cloth goods?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>The mage gave Gemma a quirk of a smile. \u201cYou have no idea. I\u2019ve wanted a carpet for ages\u2014there\u2019s an old spell I found that will make it fly\u2014but I haven\u2019t found a good enough carpet yet for a price I can pay,\u201d the mage sighed.</p><p>As Gemma watched him, she slowly changed her mind about the mage. Originally, she thought he had to a century old\u2014even if his lips and chin were fine and young-looking. Magic preserved its wielders longer than the human lifespan, anyway. But the more the mage talked, Gemma saw the impatience, the language, and the gestures of a younger man. Was he, perhaps, possibly half a century old?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d the mage asked when he caught Gemma staring.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Gemma said, looking back at the sky. She cupped her hands around the heat charm, relaxing as its warmth worked its way all the way down to her toes.</p> <p>\u201cI was going to ask you this earlier, but I hope you have something stuffed in your dress as payment?\u201d the mage asked.</p><p>I will need to thank Lady Linnea. I had forgotten about the payment, Gemma thought. \u201cYes, but I\u2019m afraid it will hardly be any better than the previous payment,\u201d she said. She clenched the ruby in one hand and slipped the gold ring out from under her hair-band\u2014which had held it strapped to her head.</p><p>Gemma held out the plain gold ring, and the mage took it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI still cannot see the logic in giving a mage who can spin flax into gold a gold ring,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cMagic is often hard to understand,\u201d the mage said.</p> <p>Gemma shrugged and held the heat charm closer to her chest, almost hitting her head on a decorative snowflake carving.</p><p>\u201cIn a few minutes, I will have to go indoors again. I trust my spinning wheel to go for hours, but I don\u2019t know about this one the palace is lending us,\u201d the mage said.</p><p>Gemma nodded. \u201cThank you for the heat charm, and for helping me up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure,\u201d the mage said, his voice soft with sincerity.</p><p>The sky was pink with the promise of the sun as Gemma sat at the table and ate the last baked apple. It was cold, but still tasty with the zing of cinnamon.</p><p>\u201cFinished\u2014and just in time,\u201d the mage said, winding up the last length of gold thread.</p><p>\u201cI imagine you must be very popular with royalty thanks to this trick?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014not many know I can do it. Those that do know belong to the magic community, and they hardly care. Gold is used like a cheap spice by those in positions of power,\u201d the mage snorted. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing Gemma a wad of fibers.</p> <p>When the pink light of dawn hit the fibers and they glowed, Gemma saw that although they hadn\u2019t been spun into thread, the fibers were gold. \u201cNo,\u201d Gemma said, passing the fibers back.</p><p>The mage smiled\u2014amused by Gemma\u2019s refusal. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he said dropping the wad of fibers on her lap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a seamstress. I can\u2019t do anything with gold,\u201d Gemma said, picking the fibers up and holding them out.</p><p>The mage shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to add them to the thread now. Take them. I would rather you have them than that murderous king of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has to be at least equal the cost of the gold ring I gave you,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cSo? How is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just is,\u201d Gemma said, sliding away from the small table. \u201cHere, take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the mage laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou are insufferable,\u201d Gemma glowered.</p><p>The mage grinned and leaned closer. \u201cAnd you are quite fetching,\u201d he said before playfully tapping Gemma\u2019s nose.</p><p>If Gemma had been any less prone to emotional outbursts, her jaw would have dropped at the harmless flirtation. Instead she stared straight ahead, slightly dumbfounded and as enthusiastic as a block of ice while the mage withdrew.</p><p>\u201cI had best be off. It would be most embarrassing if the King opened the door and found me here with you. I will drop by your cell later today to hear whatever good news has been bestowed upon you,\u201d the mage said, striding for the door.</p><p>Gemma uncomfortably cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d the mage said, turning to face her.</p><p>Gemma ran a hand through her wavy, brown hair. \u201cI, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve properly thanked you yet...for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gold thread, the bad bargains, the food...\u201d Gemma said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the mage said, blessing Gemma with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid I have done you a great discourtesy, but I am afraid I might also offend you, so if you would prefer not to answer, please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p> <p>The mage\u2019s soft smile cracked into a grin so pleased and handsome Gemma had to briefly shield her eyes from the sight. \u201cYou can call me Stil,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen, craftmage Stil,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cThank you, for saving my life,\u201d she said, curtseying.</p><p>Stil returned the gesture with a deep bow. \u201cIt has been my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Gemma could only nod and self-consciously fix her hair band.</p><p>Stil left, and Gemma had just enough time to secure the wad of gold flax fibers in the sleeve of her dress before the door clanked open.</p> <p>King Torgen brutishly pushed his way in, almost knocking over one of his guards to do so. He claimed the spindle of gold thread and held it above his head so it glowed in the morning light.</p><p>\u201cGemma Kielland,\u201d he said when he was finished gazing at it. \u201cYou are a treasure.\u201d</p><p>Although the words sounded nice, the look on the king\u2019s face made Gemma shift uncomfortably. His eyes were no longer lit by mild greed, but by a ravenous appetite. His smile was more of a snarl. He looked as if he wanted to eat Gemma\u2014or at least roast her alive.</p><p>\u201cTake her back to her cell!\u201d King Torgen snapped at the guards before he returned his attention to the gold thread.</p><p>\u201cCome, Miss,\u201d the captain of Gemma\u2019s guards said, grabbing her by the wrist and pulling her out of the room as quickly as possible. She barely had time to bow to Prince Toril, who was kicking up his heels in the hallway, before her guards hurried her away at a trot. They slowed only when they reached the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d Gemma asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not wise to place you near the King when he is in such a mood,\u201d a guard said.</p><p>Gemma glanced at her escort. \u201cWhat mood would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadness,\u201d another guard grimly said.</p><p>They were silent until they reached the dungeons. Gemma thought they would lock her in her cell without anything further to say, so she was surprised when the guards stopped some feet away from her cell.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she said when she realized they were all staring at her.</p><p>\u201cWe never thanked you, Miss Kielland, for coming back,\u201d the captain said, snapping a salute at Gemma\u2014his men mimicked him.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Gemma said, awkwardly clasping her hands together. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything at all we can do to repay you for your kindness?\u201d the captain\u2014and apparently the spokesperson said.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma said, somewhat bemusedly. All the strange and uneven deals she had been involved in the past few days were increasing. She couldn\u2019t give Stil anything of worth; the guards couldn\u2019t do anything to help her, and Gemma\u2019s only useful skill was sewing. \u201cUnless,\u201d Gemma said, brushing her skirt to feel the pack of sewing needles from Grandmother Guri bump her skin. \u201cThere is something,\u201d she said, pulling the puff of gold fibers out of her sleeve. \u201cIf I give you this, could you have someone purchase fabric for me?\u201d</p><p>The captain took the golden flax with wide eyes. \u201cThis is from\u2014,\u201d he started before breaking off and shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWe could melt it down,\u201d the guard Gemma recognized as Foss said. \u201cI have a brother-in-law who is a goldsmith. He\u2019ll keep his mouth shut so the King doesn\u2019t hear about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could trade for the fabric if it wasn\u2019t so recognizable,\u201d another soldier said.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d the captain asked.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s forehead furrowed as fabrics and patterns flipped through her mind. \u201cI will need silver thread\u2014black thread too. A lot of it. And I think...black wool and dark blue silk.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Lady Linnea snored and rolled over in her sleep. It was dawn. Usually she was up by now, practicing sword techniques with the fireplace poker. But last night she stayed awake much longer than she meant to, fretting about Gemma.</p><p>How was Gemma getting the gold thread? Could she really get it a second time? How could she be smuggled out? These thoughts tormented Lady Linnea into the wee hours of the morning.</p><p>So it was to Lady Linnea\u2019s great chagrin that she didn\u2019t wake up until something tapped the glass pane of her window.</p><p>Lady Linnea, about as picturesque as a ruined souffl\u00e9, picked her head off her goose-feather pillow. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said, smacking her lips several times. When she noticed the dark shape crouched by her window, she had a dagger in her hands in an instant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The figure tapped on the window before pressing his face against the frosted pane. \u201cLady Linnea, it\u2019s me,\u201d Prince Toril said. \u201cCould you let me in\u2014YIKES,\u201d he yelped when he nearly fell off the roof on which he was crouched.</p><p>Lady Linnea threw on a robe and stalked across the cold room. \u201cI never think you can get more idiotic, but somehow every time I see you, you manage it,\u201d she said, opening the window and grabbing the struggling prince by his cloak, dragging him into her room.</p><p>\u201cYou are absolutely mad,\u201d Lady Linnea declared, shutting the window behind him. \u201cFirst of all, you could break your skinny neck by climbing two stories in the frost and cold. Secondly, do you have any idea what will happen if our parents hear about this? Please try to use your head, however small it may be, and think for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Prince Toril said, picking himself up off the ground with an injured look. \u201cI thought you would want to know what happened to that servant girl of yours. I can see now that I was wrong,\u201d he stiffly said.</p> <p>Lady Linnea sighed, exhaling the fight and stiffness out of her body. \u201cNo, you are right. I apologize; I am very eager to hear about Gemma, and I am sorry for abusing you so. What happened?\u201d Lady Linnea asked, clasping her hands together as she feared the worst.</p><p>\u201cShe did it again,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cShe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe spun all the flax into gold thread. I wouldn\u2019t believe it if I hadn\u2019t seen it myself, but she did it,\u201d Prince Toril said with a puppy smile.</p><p>Lady Linnea sat down hard in an armchair. \u201cShe did it,\u201d she repeated.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know how she\u2019s managing it?\u201d Prince Toril asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lady Linnea said, relief making her lightheaded. \u201cI asked her about it\u2014she said a mage broke into her room and did it for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be,\u201d Prince Toril frowned. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any mages in the area. At least, none have presented themselves at the palace\u2014and they always do.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t care how she does it as long as she is alive. This is marvelous!\u201d Lady Linnea said, sagging in her chair.</p><p>\u201cNot quite,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>The prince shrugged uncomfortably. \u201cMy father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of him?\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever going to release her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t keep her in the dungeons forever,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cNo, but he will try to think of a reason to keep her chained to him so she will spin gold whenever he wants it,\u201d Prince Toril said. \u201cI believe we could potentially help her escape, but now\u2014especially after the large amount of gold she spun last night\u2014my father would create a bloodbath among his guards and hold them responsible for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lady Linnea said, drooping further.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore, this maid\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my seamstress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis seamstress of yours will never be safe in Verglas\u2014not as long as Father is alive. If we manage to free her without getting all the guards killed, she will have to flee across the border.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea bit her lip and looked west. \u201cThe Kozlovka border is closest to Ostfold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be better if we sent her to Loire or, ideally, Arcainia. My father would never dare to reach for her there after last year\u2019s episode with Princess Elise,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>Lady Linnea stared at Prince Toril, shocked by his moment of brilliance. \u201cYes,\u201d she said before brightening again. \u201cYou could take her and then go to romance that princess of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Prince Toril slowly agreed. \u201cBut I think it would be best if I stayed behind to clean up the mess my father will make. Will you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My parents hardly let me out of the house. I could never talk them into allowing me to leave the country,\u201d Lady Linnea sighed. \u201cBut it makes no difference. I could send a servant with her, or Gemma will survive on her own for a time. She\u2019s a smart girl, and much more clever than I am,\u201d Lady Linnea said. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked when she noticed the odd look Prince Toril gave her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever heard a person say their servant is more clever than they are,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>Lady Linnea shrugged. \u201cGemma is fiendishly smart. Although I wouldn\u2019t want you to get the wrong impression! In a situation that requires weapons, I would perform far better than her,\u201d she said with a proud smile as she stood.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>Lady Linnea pulled her robe tighter around her waist when she heard someone rustling in the room next door. \u201cYou have to leave\u2014someone will be by shortly to tend the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, right! Of course,\u201d Prince Toril said, retreating to the windows. \u201cDo we continue with your plan to purchase flax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Linnea said, glancing over her shoulder. \u201cI mean to visit Gemma this afternoon. Will you be available after lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll wait for you on the shores of Lake Sno?\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea nodded and flipped her tangled blonde hair over her shoulders. \u201cUntil then.

He climbed across the roof and down the side of the manor with surprising agility.</p><p>When he dropped to the frost-covered grass and raised a hand to wave to Lady Linnea, the young lady called, glancing around guiltily to watch for servants. \u201cPrince Toril?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor buying the flax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, for coming,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>Prince Toril bowed. When he straightened, Lady Linnea heard a tap on the door. She waved to the prince before hastily shutting the window and pulling the drapes to cover it.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said, before preparing herself for the day.</p><p>\u201cWhen Mama heard about the rumors, she called the steward, head maid, housekeeper, and chief footman and told them if she ever heard such silliness about you being spread through the house again, they should plan on seeking employment elsewhere. Of course everyone knows Malfrid is the one who started the rumors. I don\u2019t know why Mama has retained her thus far. She is as sour as a skunk,\u201d Lady Linnea said, her voice dripping with disgust.</p> <p>Gemma finished sewing the seam that attached a piece of black wool to a liner of midnight-blue silk. \u201cI\u2019m happy to hear Lady Lovland defends me, even though I am no longer a Lovland employee,\u201d Gemma said, rolling the fabrics so the new piece was no longer inside-out but outside-out.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lady Linnea yelped, banging her elbow on the grate of the ceiling-window. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018no longer a Lovland employee\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what it sounds. I am not a Lovland employee. How can I be, locked up as I am?\u201d Gemma said, her eyebrows furrowed as she shaped the fabric piece into a hood. \u201cI hope it is deep enough. He does enjoy covering his face,\u201d she said, placing the hood on her head to be certain the rim fell low over her face\u2014it did.</p><p>Lady Linnea didn\u2019t hear Gemma\u2019s mutters as she was too busy squawking. \u201cBut! You just\u2014who cares if you are locked up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hardly make dresses for you in this situation, My Lady.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea eyed Gemma like a curious songbird. \u201cBut you are making some sort of...thing right now. You could do the same for me!\u201d the young lady said, puffing out her chest. She thought for a moment before adding, \u201cNot that I expect you to. I imagine sewing for someone else is the last thing you wish to do right now. But, you can\u2019t just...What will I do without you?\u201d Lady Linnea protested, peeking down through the window grille</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it just yet, My Lady,\u201d Gemma said, setting the hood aside to eye the pieces she had already cut for the body of the cape.</p><p>The soldiers were quicker to retrieve the material than Gemma had hoped. She had placed her \u201corder\u201d the previous day, and they brought it to her when they delivered her dinner tray that same evening.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lady Linnea asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows what is going to happen to me,\u201d Gemma grunted as she matched up pieces. \u201cKing Torgen might imprison me for life, or he might have me killed on a whim. My future is extremely unstable,\u201d Gemma said, sounding unbothered by her tumultuous life as she selected a piece of wool and silk. \u201cThis lining is going to take ages to sew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will live,\u201d Lady Linnea sternly said, shaking a finger at Gemma. \u201cAnd for now, Toril and I have bought every scrap of flax in the city. King Torgen is being forced to look outside Ostfold, so we have bought you at least a week, possibly longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? So it\u2019s just Toril now, is it?\u201d Gemma asked, lifting an eyebrow as she threaded a needle.</p><p>\u201cYou are reading too deeply,\u201d Lady Linnea said, blushing a faint pink. \u201cI could call him the Idiot, but that hardly seems respectful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound convinced,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cThat would be because I am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma!\u201d Lady Linnea scoffed and made snorting noises like an angry horse.</p><p>Gemma unwound black thread from the spool and started the first few stitches of the piece before she straightened it out and jabbed some of the extra sewing needles in strategic locations to keep the piece straight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you seem to be doing well,\u201d Lady Linnea said when she was through being flustered. \u201cI worried when you were first imprisoned. You had lost much of your spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImminent death often does that to a person,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Lady Linnea rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat I meant is...you are you again. The fight is back in your words. I\u2019m glad,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>Gemma stopped sewing long enough to peer up at Lady Linnea through the barred window and give the lady a reassuring smile. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Thank you for caring.</p><p>Understanding what was unsaid, Lady Linnea ruffled her cloak and shifted her seat on the chilly grate. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might also note I\u2019m valiantly not asking who the cloak is for,\u201d Lady Linnea added.</p><p>\u201cThe mage,\u201d Gemma said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told you already that you don\u2019t need to make up stories.

Especially if he is slipping the gold to you,\u201d Lady Linnea said. \u201cIs it one of the guards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody is courting me, My Lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d Lady Linnea said. She looked to Gemma\u2019s project with undisguised curiosity before she sighed. \u201cI need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a meeting scheduled with Prince Toril, again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lady Linnea said, wrinkling her nose at Gemma. \u201cWorse: I have embroidery practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I shall need it,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p> <p>\u201cTake care, My Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too! Do not hesitate to tell me if you need anything,\u201d Lady Linnea said before scrambling out of sight. \u201cGoodbye!\u201d she said, popping back into view as she climbed the wall like a deft squirrel.</p><p>Gemma shook her head and kept sewing.</p><p>Gemma was tying off her thread a day later when the door clanked open. \u201cYes?\u201d Gemma said when she looked up and realized the guard\u2014Foss\u2014didn\u2019t have any food with him.</p><p>Foss adjusted his helm. \u201cThe Captain said\u2014if you like\u2014Rudd and I are to take you outside for a walk.\u201d</p><p>Gemma stared at the guard.</p> <p>\u201cHe said you might appreciate the fresh air,\u201d Foss added. \u201cWould you like to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d Gemma said, hastily standing. She folded the long pieces of the cape, stacked them in the corner of her cell, and grabbed her cloak before joining Foss at the door.</p><p>Foss backed up into the dungeon aisle, where another guard\u2014Rudd assumedly\u2014waited. \u201cThis way, Miss,\u201d Rudd said, his voice a deep, rumbling noise. He led the way to the dungeon stairs, and Foss brought up the rear behind Gemma.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like to go, Miss?\u201d Foss asked. \u201cThe kitchens? The library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gardens,\u201d Gemma said, throwing the cloak over her shoulders in preparation for the cool air.</p><p>Foss hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s quite cold out,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cAnd I promise I will not run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know, Miss,\u201d Rudd rumbled.</p> <p>Neither of the soldiers said anything more as they led Gemma through the twisting palace, popping out a small door that Gemma supposed\u2014based on its close proximity to a weapon storage room\u2014was a guard entrance and exit.</p><p>The fall air had cooled considerably. Gemma\u2019s dungeon window was sheltered, so the bitter wind that yanked at Gemma\u2019s cloak and clothes was a shock.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to be out here?\u201d Foss shouted over the howling wind.</p><p>\u201cYes. Is there a more protected area?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Foss said, beckoning.</p><p>Gemma followed Foss and Rudd into a tiny, narrow courtyard nestled into the castle that still afforded a view of Lake Sno and, if one stuck their head out of the protected area, Ostfold.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gemma said, pulling her borrowed cape closer, able to speak at a regular volume in chilly but sheltered courtyard.</p><p>Foss nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p>Gemma itched her nose as she looked out over the beautiful lake. Her expression thoughtful, she extended her finger and pointed past the lake, to the area where the mountains flattened into the Kozlovka border. \u201cThe first night I was ordered to spin, I saw some of the Snow Queen\u2019s magic activate there. Do you have any idea what it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah, that,\u201d Foss said. \u201cThe night watch saw it too. Some guards were dispatched in the morning to investigate it. They found\u2014what was it, Rudd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHellhound,\u201d the second guard supplied.</p><p>\u201cYeah, hellhound tracks and horse hoof-prints,\u201d Foss said.</p><p>\u201cA hellhound?\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cYep. I haven\u2019t heard of one coming so far north in ages,\u201d Foss said. \u201cOf course it will never get into Verglas,\u201d he was quick to add.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d Rudd wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cIt just seemed...unusual,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Foss squinted up at the cloudy sky. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, the captain said we were to tell you that you can expect at least two weeks before the King will be ready for you to spin again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks?\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cAll the flax in the area has been bought up and shipped south. The King has to buy it in small loads\u2014some of it isn\u2019t even correctly prepared, yet,\u201d Foss said.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cThe King was purple with rage when the news was given to him,\u201d Rudd said.</p><p>\u201cEspecially when he received a written offer from Princess Elise of Arcainia. Prince Falk has come up with a new type of flax, which she offered to sell a load of,\u201d Foss said.</p><p>\u201cHe ripped that letter up and threw it in the fire,\u201d Foss added.</p><p>Gemma grinned. \u201cThank you for the news,\u201d she said, pushing her hair out of her face.</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Foss said. He hesitated, and rested his hand on the pommel of the sword strapped to his waist.</p><p>Gemma slid her hands under the cape and waited for the soldier to build up his courage.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking...what are you making with that fabric?\u201d Foss finally asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA cape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d This time it was Rudd who asked.</p><p>Gemma inhaled the frigid air, her shoulders bunching up before she exhaled and relaxed. \u201cSomeone to whom I owe a great debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear the guards are allowing you out for walks,\u201d Stil said the following day. He sat on top of the ceiling-window grille, blocking some of the cold air.</p> <p>\u201cThey call it \u2018airing me out,\u2019\u201d Gemma said, holding the mage\u2019s ruby heat charm in her hands.</p><p>\u201cIt is kind of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma agreed. \u201cDo you recall the first night you helped me, and we saw some of the Snow Queen\u2019s magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked them about it. They found hellhound tracks right on the border.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWere there horse hoof-prints too?\u201d</p><p>\u201c...Yes,\u201d Gemma was slow to respond. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky guess,\u201d Stil sighed, thumping his fist on his knee. \u201cDid the guards bring you more blankets?\u201d Stil asked, gesturing to the pile of wool and silk.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma said. She refrained from offering a more detailed explanation.</p><p>Stil half smiled at the blatant cold-shoulder and pursued a different conversation topic. \u201cHow soon do you think the King will parade you out for more gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks or so,\u201d Gemma said.</p> <p>\u201cMore intelligence from the guards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. I am glad they have become closer allies since your return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma said, glancing at the empty tray on which Rudd had served her dinner. She thought for a moment, \u201cI apologize, did you want something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. I already ate, and the hour is late,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma rustled in her nest of blankets. \u201cThank you for coming,\u201d she said, resting her clamped hands on her feet as the ruby charm pumped heat through her body.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I enjoy our conversations. You are quite amusing, and no one else will play the guessing game with me,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma arched an eyebrow at him.</p> <p>Stil grinned unrepentantly.</p><p>Gemma shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSo, Miss Kielland, tell me: if you could have anything in the world, what would you want?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>Gemma leaned back against the dingy wall as she thought.</p><p>\u201cHaving trouble prioritizing?\u201d Stil teased.</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s not much I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJewels to wear, a home of your own, gold\u2014none of that appeals to you?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>Gemma shrugged. \u201cWhat good are jewels when the person I visit most often is Grandmother Guri? Her goat\u2014Jo-Jo\u2014would try to eat them. Gold is pretty but useless to a person of my station. You can\u2019t eat it, nor can you sew with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA home, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey reek of work. I would rather spend my time sewing,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cA sum of money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney brings out the worst in people,\u201d Gemma said, thinking of the irresponsibility of her father.</p><p>\u201cYou might be the least greedy person on earth due to sheer practicality,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma shrugged. \u201cI know what I like. The rest is unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what would you like?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>Gemma scooted lower in her blanket pile. \u201cTo make clothes and travel. I want to see the fashions of Loire, Sole, Erlauf, and Ringsted. I would like to see the differences in clothing between the counties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, you have been bitten with the bug of wanderlust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d Gemma said, muffling a yawn. \u201cBut I would want to return to Verglas. I would miss its cold, white winters, and the way the frost dyes everything white and ice cuts intricate patterns like lace. Many believe Verglas is frozen tundra for most of the year, but I think it\u2019s the most beautiful place in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma looked up at the mage. \u201cYou think I\u2019m crazed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stil said, his voice warm with understanding. \u201cVerglas calls to all of us magic folk. There\u2019s powerful magic here that can\u2019t be found anywhere else. You are right. Verglas is the most beautiful place in the world.\u201d</p><p>Gemma nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so, too,\u201d she admitted, the ice in her eyes melting.</p><p>Gemma and Stil talked less as Gemma yawned more. Eventually, the young seamstress nodded off in a short stretch of silence.</p><p>Stil smiled down at her through the window grate. She was sleeping upright, slumped against the wall with the blankets mounded only waist high. \u201cYou are going to get a crick in your neck, if you don\u2019t catch a cold first,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gemma exhaled, her breath deep with sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stil glanced over his shoulder before he flipped a small, wooden container off his belt. He opened it up and smeared his thumb in the greasy balm contained inside. He smeared the balm over the perimeter bars of the grille before screwing the container shut and sliding it back into place.</p><p>He whispered over the bars, making the spots smeared with the balm glow. Careful to not make too much noise, Stil pulled up on the window grille. The charmed bars separated like soft butter. He set the grill aside and dropped through the opening, landing inside the cell with a quiet tap. He crept to Gemma\u2019s side and maneuvered her so she was lying down with blankets piled on her. He drew a worn quilt up to her chin and couldn\u2019t help the affectionate smile that twitched on his lips. When sleeping, Gemma seemed less guarded and more relaxed. Without the sharpness of her eyes to counteract her plump, heart-shaped face, she looked younger and sweeter. Remembering the incident at the Sno Hauk tavern, Stil wondered if Gemma\u2019s eyes would lack some of the sharpness if she had a better father.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I like your eyes. They are like gems\u2014exquisite,\u201d Stil said, smoothing the blankets before he stood.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Gemma said, mostly asleep even though she struggled to lift her hand out of the blankets.</p> <p>\u201cShh, go back to sleep,\u201d Stil soothed.</p><p>\u201cNo, your heat charm,\u201d Gemma murmured.</p><p>\u201cKeep it,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma briefly opened her eyes, flashing Stil with eyes that said she was unimpressed. \u201cToo expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d Stil repeated, stepping back up to her to place a finger on her forehead.</p> <p>Gemma had already fallen asleep again, several locks of her wavy hair plastered over her face.</p><p>Stil carefully tucked her hair behind her ear. He watched Gemma for a few moments as she slept before he shook himself. \u201cIf she wakes up, she\u2019s going to accuse me of being a lecher,\u201d he said, standing and striding across the room. He jumped off her stool and grabbed at the ceiling, pulling himself through the gaping hole of her ceiling-window. He set the grille back in place and whispered the magic words of release, canceling his spell and returning the bars to their normal consistency.</p><p>Stil turned to go, but something made him pause and to look down at her one more time. \u201cGoodnight, Gemma Kielland,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gemma grunted.</p><p>Stil smiled before gliding away.</p><p>Chapter 9</p> <p>\u201cLunch time, Miss Kielland,\u201d a guard cheerfully called through the door two days later as he unlocked it.</p><p>Gemma carefully put away her sewing supplies. \u201cHello, B?rres,\u201d she said, greeting the guard she had previously hit with the stool with a twinge of guilt.</p><p>\u201cHello, Miss Kielland. Today I\u2019ve got soup, fresh bread, and goat cheese for you,\u201d the guard said, giving Gemma a bright smile in spite of their previous violence spattered exchange.</p><p>\u201cThank you, I will enjoy it,\u201d Gemma said, making an effort to speak.</p><p>B?rres bobbed a bow. \u201cShout when you\u2019re done\u2014it can be hard to hear through the walls,\u201d he said, seeing himself out the door.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Gemma said, watching him go. When he shut the door behind himself, Gemma rubbed her forehead. \u201cPoor man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were doing what you had to.\u201d</p><p>Gemma jumped and whirled around to find Stil inside her cell. \u201cSir Mage,\u201d Gemma said after blinking twice.</p> <p>\u201cGood afternoon, Gemma,\u201d the mage said with an unreadable smile.</p><p>Gemma looked from her food to the mage. \u201cWould you like something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine, thank you,\u201d Stil said. \u201cI\u2019ve come here to let you know I will be gone for a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said. She didn\u2019t understand why the mage felt the need to alert her to her schedule, until she realized that if King Torgen happened to get the prepared flax early, she would be sunk if Stil wasn\u2019t around. \u201cOh,\u201d Gemma said with new understanding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve skulked about the castle a bit, and it is for certain that the flax won\u2019t arrive in at least four more days; however, I would rather not take the chance. So, I have brought you this,\u201d Stil said, holding his finger out.</p><p>\u201c...It\u2019s a thimble,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s magic.\u201d</p><p>Gemma raised both her eyebrows at him. \u201cA magic thimble?\u201d</p><p>Stil grinned. \u201cIt may be unorthodox, but the metal takes to summoning spells quite readily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Gemma said, taking the thimble before she sat on the ground next to her little table of food. She sliced open a roll and spread soft goat cheese across it. \u201cHow is it magic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s the important bit. If something happens and you need me, you can use the thimble to call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Gemma said, eyeing the thimble on her finger before she stood up and marched across the room.</p><p>\u201cYes. It doesn\u2019t work like a true summoning spell because it won\u2019t transport me to your side\u2014that\u2019s high level that only a few genius Enchanters every century can manage\u2014but I will hear your voice and know that you need me, and my matching thimble will guide me to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said, offering the mage the roll. \u201cYou really had to use thimbles for this magic?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a craftmage, not a weather mage.

It\u2019s Rumpelstiltskin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumpelstiltskin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Gemma said, keeping her expression bland.</p><p>Stil\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cI can tell you are laughing on the inside, Gemma.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not better than laughing openly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is,\u201d Stil said. \u201cYour eyes glitter extra, which is enchanting.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Gemma opened and closed her mouth before furrowing her forehead as she tried to decipher what that meant. Stil finished his roll and watched her. The set of his lips said he was highly amused as Gemma tried to puzzle through it.</p><p>\u201cI will need something to trade for the thimble,\u201d he said after some moments when Gemma still hadn\u2019t worked out an acceptable reply.</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Gemma blinked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a less valuable charm, so I don\u2019t need much. You could give me a bit of whatever you\u2019re making,\u201d Stil said, nodding to the cape\u2014which was coming along quite nicely\u2014Gemma had folded and placed on the blankets.</p><p>Gemma pressed her lips together and wondered how she could refuse.</p><p>\u201cOr a lock of your hair will do just as well,\u201d Stil said.</p> <p>Gemma frowned. \u201cA lock of hair? That\u2019s incredibly useless\u2014although I suppose it isn\u2019t as terrible as trading gold for more gold.\u201d</p><p>Stil said nothing but wore a small smile.</p><p>\u201cVery well. I will have to trade with a lock of hair\u2014for I haven\u2019t anything else. Unless you want another roll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair will be fine. It won\u2019t take much,\u201d Stil said, beckoning her closer with a finger.</p><p>Gemma approached the mage and stood very still when he flicked a hunting knife out of his cloak. He spun Gemma around and gently pulled a lock of her wild hair. \u201cThere,\u201d he said when Gemma felt him release her hair.</p><p>The craftmage held up the lock\u2014it was little more than the crazy, upward curl her hair ended with\u2014for Gemma\u2019s inspection. \u201cAlso, I will lend you this while I\u2019m gone,\u201d he said, passing over the ruby heat charm.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. You just took that back yesterday,\u201d Gemma argued.</p><p>\u201cAnd you will need it even more while I am gone. It\u2019s only going to get colder, and you sleep with an open grate in your ceiling,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything I could trade for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I will lend it to you,\u201d Stil said, taking Gemma\u2019s hand and placing the charm on her palm.</p><p>Instantly warmth started to flood Gemma, who looked doubtfully down at the charm. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Stil said, once again leaning back against the wall.</p><p>Gemma shrugged and changed the subject. \u201cWhere will you be going?\u201d she asked, moving to place the charm on top of the cape.</p><p>\u201cI have a bit of investigating to do.\u201d</p><p>Gemma tilted her head. \u201cIs the Veneno Conclave planning something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s the problem,\u201d Stil sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Stil brushed his hands off before moving to stand in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing for you to worry about. You will be safe while I\u2019m gone,\u201d he said, placing his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>Gemma frowned. She did not like the brush off, but Stil was a mage. A mage who had saved her life twice, now. She allowed him to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cAnd you will not hesitate to call for me,\u201d Stil said, tapping a finger on her shoulder to get her attention.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma agreed.</p><p>Still smiled. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, brushing a finger beneath her chin. \u201cI will head out immediately, then. Enjoy your lunch,\u201d the mage said.</p><p>Gemma turned to glance at the tray of food. \u201cYes, did you want\u2014,\u201d she cut herself off when she realized the mage was no longer in the cell with her.</p><p>Gemma shrugged. \u201cMages. They\u2019re worse than cats.\u201d</p><p>The following day, early in the morning, Gemma walked outside on the shores of Lake Sno with Foss and Rudd. There was no wind, but the temperatures were cold, and the previous night brought a hard frost, so everything from fence posts to tree leaves were white with the lacework of frost.</p><p>They had wandered close enough to Ostfold to hear the morning bustle as villagers went about their lives.</p><p>\u201cWinter is nearly here,\u201d Foss announced. \u201cHave you got enough hay for your animals, Rudd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hope to sell one of the goats. If we don\u2019t, it will be tight,\u201d Rudd said.</p><p>Gemma turned her gaze from Ostfold to her guards. \u201cYou have animals?\u201d She asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFour goats, a flock of chickens, and a pig,\u201d Rudd said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a few,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cMy wife and children keep \u2018em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow enterprising of them,\u201d Gemma said, only half listening. She could hear a bell ringing. But it wasn\u2019t just any bell, it was a chime that she knew. It belonged to\u2014</p> <p>\u201cJo-Jo, stop this deer-prancing nonsense and walk like a respectable creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandmother Guri!\u201d Gemma shouted, her jaw dropping with shock.</p><p>\u201cHello, my girl,\u201d Grandmother Guri called as she picked her way among the rocks with a knobby cane. She dragged her white goat along behind her with a rope tied to the animal\u2019s pretty, sky-blue collar and brass bell.</p><p>Gemma ran to greet her, throwing her arms around the short, old woman. Gemma was attacked by the desire to cry\u2014and a tear or two might have gotten away from her\u2014as she was enveloped by Grandmother Guri\u2019s warm arms and scent of hay and cinnamon.</p><p>\u201cNow, now. Everything is just fine,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, patting Gemma on the back as she held her. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well.\u201d</p> <p>Foss and Rudd stood a few feet away, looking like they wished they were a million miles away. They swapped expressions before each guard strolled in the opposite direction, giving Gemma and Grandmother Guri enough space to speak softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d Gemma asked, impatiently flicking a tear from her eye when they finished hugging.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m collecting herbs. I need some chives, and the only bunch in the area still alive is here by the lake. Jo-Jo is along to carry my things for me,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, affectionately smacking the goat\u2014who had saddle bags slung over her sides\u2014on the rump.</p><p>Jo-Jo baaed and nibbled on Grandmother Guri\u2019s bright red mittens before the old lady pulled her hands out of the goat\u2019s range.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re still alive, eh?\u201d Grandmother Guri asked as she squinted up at Gemma.</p><p>\u201cHow much have you heard?\u201d Gemma asked.</p> <p>\u201cBits and pieces. Gossip does run from the palace like gravy. People bring me the news they hear since they know you\u2019re my girl. They said the King\u2019s got it in his silly, cracked knob that you can spin straw into gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlax fibers,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Grandmother Guri swiped a hand through the air, brushing off the correction, and continued. \u201cThey also say you\u2019ve been doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been...misled,\u201d Gemma said, glancing at Foss and Rudd, who were doing their best imitations of lakeside boulders.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit down?\u201d Gemma asked. \u201cThe story is...long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well, then. Won\u2019t do my old bones a bit of good to stand that long. Get the packs from Jo-Jo; I\u2019ve got a cushion in there,\u201d Grandmother Guri said as she adjusted the red headscarf wrapped around her white hair.</p><p>After some maneuvering, Gemma and Grandmother Guri sat side by side on the saddlebags, a small blanket thrown over their laps. Jo-Jo grazed a few feet away but occasionally drew closer to nibble on Grandmother Guri\u2019s thick, black skirt.</p> <p>\u201cNow. Start from the top\u2014when King Torgen called you to the palace,\u201d Grandmother Guri said.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s tale spilled from her lips like snow in a snowstorm. It was a relief to tell someone about the threats, Gemma\u2019s fright, and the long, dark hours. Grandmother Guri didn\u2019t react when Gemma talked about Stil and everything he did for her. She snorted when Gemma described her escape and less than triumphant return, but for the most part the old woman was silent and thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a story,\u201d she said when Gemma finished.</p><p>\u201cYou believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse I do. You\u2019re not a fanciful girl. If you said there was a mage, there was a mage. There must have been, or King Torgen woulda killed you at the first sunrise,\u201d Grandmother Guri said.</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell Lady Linnea. She thinks I\u2019m covering for a lover,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cShe may be half right,\u201d Grandmother Guri said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Gemma frowned.</p><p>Grandmother Guri patted Gemma\u2019s cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s best to not worry about it yet, my girl. Though it is a shame you don\u2019t know what this mage looks like. You should ask him to remove his hood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can inspect the goods!\u201d</p><p>Gemma almost choked on shock. \u201cHe\u2019s a magic user. The man must be fifty if he\u2019s a day!\u201d she declared.</p><p>\u201cAh, but he is a mage, not an enchanter. Mages are done with their schooling sooner and don\u2019t live as long. There\u2019s a chance he\u2019s young and handsome!\u201d Grandmother Guri cackled.</p><p>\u201cGrandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best to keep your options open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMages fancy mages.

He follows the most strange and complicated rules of magic that I have ever heard of,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cHe will spin enough gold to purchase a manor, and do it in exchange for one gold ring. He lends me an expensive charmed ruby but asks for a trade for a thimble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a bit unstable,\u201d Grandmother Guri said. \u201cSo what will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout the King and this spinning. I assume this mage cannot be at your beck and call forever. Eventually you will have to leave, or King Torgen will discover the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have hopes that eventually I will talk the King into allowing me to spin without guards posted, and I can escape then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot talk the King into anything, my girl,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, looking in the direction of the palace.</p><p>\u201cYes, but if he wants the gold badly enough, he will do what I ask,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cBartering with the crazed is like baiting a rabid bear,\u201d Grandmother Guri warned.</p> <p>\u201cWhat else can I do?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many alternatives,\u201d Grandmother Guri admitted. \u201cBut if you flee, you cannot stay in Ostfold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma agreed.</p><p>\u201cNor can you stay in Verglas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma repeated.</p><p>\u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d Grandmother Guri asked.</p> <p>\u201cA little. I love Verglas. While I would enjoy seeing other countries, I cannot fathom a time when I would not think of Verglas as my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a wild, magical country. But you can carry it in your heart, and Verglas will always you welcome back\u2014whether you stay here forever or you are gone for fifty years. Leave if you must, my girl,\u201d Grandmother Guri said.</p><p>\u201cIf I flee, I will leave everyone I love.\u201d</p><p>Grandmother Guri was silent for a long time. Gemma knew better than to disturb the woman while she thought, and she waited patiently for the reply.</p><p>\u201cEscape,\u201d Grandmother Guri finally said. \u201cIt\u2019s your best chance. You\u2019re a smart girl; I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make friends wherever you go. And you might not be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Lady Linnea would go with me?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>Before Grandmother Guri could reply, Jo-Jo wandered up to the pair. She sneezed on them both before shaking her hand, smacking Gemma with her ears.</p><p>\u201cYou darned goat!\u201d Grandmother Guri shouted.</p> <p>Jo-Jo pranced away, evading Grandmother Guri\u2019s cane.</p><p>Gemma almost fell over in an effort to also avoid Grandmother Guri\u2019s flailing.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kielland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Gemma said, as she looked up at Foss.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably return to the palace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you, Foss,\u201d Gemma said before she stood up and dusted herself off.</p><p>\u201cHelp an old lady up,\u201d Grandmother Guri said as she started to haul herself to her feet.</p><p>Gemma rushed to help her. When Grandmother Guri was safe and adjusting her clothes, Gemma folded the blanket, stowed it in the saddle bags, and retrieved the mischievous Jo-Jo.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, taking the goat\u2019s lead when Gemma brought her back.</p><p>Gemma nodded and stooped over to hug the older woman. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have missed you. Take care, my girl. Send word when you can,\u201d she said, kissing Gemma\u2019s cheek before releasing her.</p><p>Gemma nodded. \u201cOf course. Goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, child.\u201d</p><p>Gemma thought she was getting used to a life of imprisonment and a murky lifespan. But her heart clenched tight in her chest as she forced herself to walk away, leaving Grandmother Guri behind as a bright spot on the lakeshore.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Stil adjusted the fall of his worn cape on his shoulders as he cautiously poked through the forest. The border Verglas shared with Kozlovka was just ahead, but there was no sign of the hellhound, nightmare, or the rider.</p><p>Stil looked back at the setting sun. \u201cI should further investigate tomorrow in daylight,\u201d he said, taking another step forward. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think a quick look will hurt.\u201d</p><p>It was risky to spy out the enemy\u2019s movement at sunset when the rider moved only at night. Some might even say it was stupid, but the threat couldn\u2019t be too imminent. It was unlikely the rider was still around.</p><p>Stil chuckled as he pictured what Gemma would do if she knew the risk he was taking.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t say anything, just give him that look that said she questioned his intelligence and arch her expressive eyebrows at him.</p><p>\u201cAhh, yes. Gemma,\u201d Stil said. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do about her.</p><p>Stil had decided to help her when he first heard that someone had brought news to the king about her father\u2019s drunken utterances. Stil had a feeling it was the weasel-like thug he silenced at the tavern fight. Feeling partially responsible, and with Angelique\u2019s lecture about responsibility beating in his head, Stil knew he had to help her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He just hadn\u2019t expected her to be so...self-sacrificing and vibrant.</p><p>Most would say Gemma wasn\u2019t an expressive girl. She generally kept her mouth shut and usually spoke words that were as prickly as a thistle.</p><p>Stil disagreed.</p><p>She\u2019s expressive alright. But it\u2019s in her eyes\u2014the way they shift from ice when she\u2019s upset to sapphires when she\u2019s happy, he thought.</p> <p>And that didn\u2019t even touch on her noble character. Who would escape certain death only to turn around and go back because they realized they would cause the death of those who served as their wardens?</p><p>No one.</p><p>No one, except Gemma.</p><p>Feeling the need to speak it out loud, as though making it final, Stil said, \u201cLeaving her is no longer an option.\u201d</p><p>It was then Stil realized he had left Verglas while musing over the seamstress. He whirled around, taking in the bare trees and the lack of the Verglas pines and firs.</p> <p>Uttering an oath under his breath, he ran back in the direction from which he had come, cursing his stupidity.</p><p>There was a snarl, and the hellhound leapt in front of Stil, cutting him off.</p><p>\u201cFire,\u201d Stil said, throwing a red feather in the beast\u2019s face. The feather exploded into an inferno of fire, forcing the hellhound backwards.</p><p>The beast whipped its head and howled as Stil ran north.</p><p>The nightmare answered the hellhound with a snort, bursting out of murky darkness with its flaming eyes.</p><p>Stil slipped his hunting knife out from under his cloak as he ran parallel to the nightmare and its rider. \u201cSorry,\u201d Stil said to a tree, his hand scraping the rough bark. \u201cCleave,\u201d he said before slicing the knife straight through trunks of several trees.</p> <p>The nightmare shrieked angrily and lunged to get out of the way.</p><p>Stil took the opportunity to start running east, back into Verglas.</p><p>The hellhound was back, snarling and panting on Stil\u2019s heels. \u201cOf course you always find me in the wild. Not in the city where I could use the very ground against you,\u201d he said, flicking a ribbon from under his cloak. \u201cBind,\u201d he said, throwing the ribbon at the animal. The ribbon wrapped around the beast\u2019s snout, muzzling it as though it were made of iron. The hellhound scratched at it and tried to flex its mouth, but the ribbon held. Stil reached under his cloak and popped out the only real weapon he had\u2014a metal bar roughly the length and thickness of his forearm. \u201cCudere!\u201d he shouted, throwing it into the air. Stil jumped aside to dodge the nightmare and was almost shot by the rider, who loaded another bolt into his crossbow.</p><p>Still muzzled, the hellhound leapt for Stil\u2014claws extended\u2014just as Stil\u2019s weapon came slicing downwards, glowing as metal grew and extended, forming a double tipped spear taller than Stil. One tip had metal wings at the base of the spearhead. The other end had a curved blade that was sharp on only one edge; the other edge was covered by decorative metal work and gems.</p><p>Stil caught it, bringing it up just in time to guard against the black claws, although he was driven back by the force.</p><p>\u201cBlaze!\u201d Stil said. The spear erupted in light, temporarily blinding the mongrel. Stil whirled the spear over his head and shoved the curved end out behind him. He countered another arrow\u2014which made the weapon flash like lightning when it was struck.</p><p>The hellhound and the nightmare shrieked, and Stil ran.</p><p>Where is it? I couldn\u2019t have walked too far into Kozlovka! Stil thought as he ran, ducking just in time to avoid an arrow.</p> <p>Stil almost drooped in relief when he spotted a pine tree. He had to be getting close! He planted his feet and, using his momentum, spun. He slid his spear across his left arm and braced it with his right. He landed a direct blow to the hellhound\u2019s head, knocking the creature to the ground but failing to draw any blood.</p><p>Stil cursed and ran again. Being a craftmage, he hadn\u2019t trained much for fights. That failing was painfully obvious to him as the cold air stung his lungs while he sprinted.</p><p>Stil grabbed a leaf while on the run and used his magic to shape it into a snowflake. \u201cHome,\u201d he said. The snowflake glowed, and forty feet away, an opalescent line shot through the ground. He was almost there.</p><p>The nightmare screamed somewhere behind him. He swung, releasing his spear, which sliced through the air with glittering edges.</p><p>The nightmare swung so the rider could block it with his short sword, but the loss of the weapon lightened Stil and let him sprint unhindered.</p><p>He closed the distance between himself and the Verglas border as the rider spurred his mount on, catching up.</p><p>Still almost took an arrow to the shoulder, but he darted to the side just in time.</p><p>He was so close!</p><p>The nightmare jumped, closing the gap.</p><p>\u201cGo bother a war mage!\u201d Stil shouted as he threw himself across the border.</p><p>The nightmare skid to a stop, shrieking as the Snow Queen\u2019s power exploded into an icy wall of sharp, glittering ice shards. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stil panted and peeled himself off the ground, rubbing the sore shoulder he landed on.</p><p>On the other side of the frosted wall, the nightmare screamed and the hellhound howled.</p><p>Stil groaned and shook his head to clear his sight and mind. \u201cThat was fair stupid of me,\u201d he admitted, taking inventory of his body as he stood.</p><p>He was going to be stiff the following day, but there were no injuries.</p> <p>The nightmare snorted, having traveled a few feet down the border to peer around the ice shield.</p><p>The rider shot his loaded crossbow, but the arrow was blocked by ice that shot out of the ground and snapped around the weapon with frigid jaws.</p><p>\u201cCudere,\u201d Stil called, forcing his arm up. His double-ended spear trembled for a moment before it whirled through the air, as if thrown. It easily broke through the ice wall, sending a cascade of ice shards everywhere. Stil caught the weapon and twirled it once to rid it of ice flecks before he brandished it at the rider.</p><p>He toed the border line and took a swipe at the nightmare with the curved tip.

The rider turned the animal and road off into the inky darkness, the hellhound following them.</p><p>Stil backed farther into Verglas and shook his head. \u201cI have no idea what any of this is about,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>Lady Linnea grunted as she swung her leg over the palace wall, dropping into the small area above Gemma\u2019s cell. \u201cGemma, I have got news for you. Sissel just about took down Malfrid when Malfrid...Gemma?\u201d Lady Linnea said, kneeling down to press her face against the window grate and peer inside.</p><p>Gemma was not in her cell.</p><p>\u201cIs she out walking?\u201d Lady Linnea wondered, fixing the shawl she had tied over her blonde hair. \u201cNo, her cape is here, and the mittens I brought her. They can\u2019t have moved her, or she would have taken her things...\u201d Lady Linnea trailed off, her heart crawling into her throat.</p><p>Where was Gemma?</p> <p>Had King Torgen called for her? Had he figured out how she got the gold thread and beheaded her?</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d Lady Linnea hissed into the empty cell.</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>Her heart pounding, Lady Linnea scrambled to stand up.</p><p>What happened to Gemma? Where was she? How could she find out?</p><p>Lady Linnea franticly climbed the wall and flew into palace, looking for the one person who could help her. She needed to find Toril.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Prince Toril said, skidding into the palace gardens. He was half undressed, wearing only black knee-length trousers, a linen shirt, knee-high socks, and buckled shoes in the cold, biting air. Clearly he was in the middle of something when he received Lady Linnea\u2019s panicked message via a servant.</p><p>\u201cGemma is gone!\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father must have done something. She isn\u2019t in her cell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guards occasionally take her for walks; she\u2019s probably out on one right now,\u201d Prince Toril said, the wind ruffling his hair.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d Lady Linnea said. \u201cHer cape and that black, wool thing she\u2019s been working on are still in her cell. If she were outside or set free, she wouldn\u2019t have left them behind. She\u2019s gone!\u201d</p><p>Toril exhaled and set his shoulders before looked decisively to Lady Linnea. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, offering his hand.</p><p>Lady Linnea took it and the pair ran indoors, a pleasant change from the raging winds. Prince Toril led Lady Linnea through the hallways at a quick, ground-covering walk.</p><p>Several times, the pair ran into servants who watched with wide eyes but said nothing as their future monarch and the beautiful Lady Linnea\u2014almost all the palace servants recognized her on sight now as the girl Prince Toril occasionally snuck out to see\u2014marched through the palace.</p><p>They reached the dungeon stairs and clattered down them, leaving the light, airy architecture of the palace and swapping it for the oppressive dungeons.</p><p>When they were almost to the base of the stairs, Lady Linnea cut in front of Prince Toril to take the lead. She jumped down the last two steps, her heart beating frantically, when she recognized the sound of...Gemma\u2019s laughter.</p><p>Lady Linnea and Prince Toril poked their heads around the corner.</p><p>In the middle of the dungeon aisle, lounging on cushions and crowded around a table that was barely a foot off the ground, were Gemma and three guards.</p><p>\u201cConsidering you were the one who wanted to teach her how to play, Captain, you\u2019re doing terrible,\u201d one of the guards said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s four cards for each person, right?\u201d Gemma asked, dealing cards.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the guard captain, recognizable by his uniform, sighed. \u201cIf you and Skoglund win another trick, that will put you in the majority, and you\u2019ve won the game. I hope it\u2019s not boring you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. It\u2019s quite entertaining,\u201d Gemma said. Although her words were bland, her eyes glowed with mischief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI claim Miss Kielland for the next round.

I didn\u2019t think I would have to carry Captain through the whole game,\u201d the guard said.</p><p>\u201cMight I remind you, Foss, that I\u2019m the one who will be writing your recommendation\u2014or demotion\u2014to the Guard Lieutenant?\u201d the captain said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Foss said with a salute, drawing an amused, arched eyebrow from Gemma.</p><p>\u201cShe looks fine,\u201d Prince Toril whispered in Lady Linnea\u2019s ear. \u201cShe\u2019s just playing Karn?ffel\u2014and doing well, I think. Lady Linnea!\u201d he hissed when Lady Linnea sank to the ground, relief making her light-headed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I just,\u201d Lady Linnea couldn\u2019t continue and instead shut her eyes and rested her head against the grimy dungeon wall.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Linnea smiled. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p> <p>After a moment Prince Toril asked, \u201cAre you strong enough to stand? I would prefer to not let them know we are here,\u201d he said, tipping his head in the direction of the chattering card game.</p><p>\u201cI can manage,\u201d Lady Linnea said, standing. Her legs shook like a newborn foal, but she brushed off her dress\u2014which was dirtied beyond repair\u2014and heaved her chin up, regaining some of her confidence.</p><p>\u201cMay I escort you out?\u201d Prince Toril asked, offering his arm.</p><p>Lady Linnea took it with the composure of a queen and allowed Prince Toril to lead her up the dungeon stairs.</p><p>\u201cI find it refreshing that you care so much about your servant,\u201d Prince Toril said, breaking the silence when they returned to the palace hallways. \u201cShe is lucky to have such a caring mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is my close companion,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, because you allow her to be so,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cWait, you think that this is just a case of me being kind to a servant because I am a loyal person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cHuh. I\u2019m beginning to see why you didn\u2019t go after Princess Elise,\u201d Lady Linnea said, dropping Prince Toril\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Prince Toril asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you understand the balance of relationships. They are give-and-take. I\u2019m not Gemma\u2019s superior in our friendship because I\u2019m trying to get her through this alive\u2014which is rather what I suspect you think. I\u2019m frantic to protect her, yes, not because I\u2019m some bleeding-heart noble, but because Gemma is my best friend,\u201d Lady Linnea firmly said. \u201cGemma has my loyalty because she\u2019s earned it, and I have Gemma\u2019s trust because I\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely you have more to give,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cYou would think that, and perhaps that is the circumstance right now, but before I felt like I could never repay Gemma for everything she\u2019s done for me,\u201d Lady Linnea said. She tilted her head and studied Prince Toril with pursed lips. \u201cIt takes work to build a lasting relationship, My Lord. You cannot expect someone to give you their everything just because.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I understand,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised, looking at your sparkling parentage,\u201d Lady Linnea said, stopping their stroll down the hallway. \u201cAllow me to rephrase it. A friendship is filled only with as much love as you give. Gemma has my heart because I chose to give it to her. And my choice paid off, because there is no one in this horrible, tattered world that I trust more than Gemma Kielland. And so we are two best friends, walking together to achieve what neither of us could do alone. Do you understand it now?\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril wore a very sad smile, one that pained Lady Linnea to see on the normally sunny\u2014if not slightly dopey\u2014prince\u2019s face. \u201cPrincess Elise said something similar to me, once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she wasn\u2019t the only woman capable of deep love, and that before I found such a woman who would love me like that, I had to learn how to give that kind of love, too,\u201d Prince Toril said. \u201cShe meant the give-and-take loyalty you\u2019re talking about, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cI see it, now,\u201d Prince Toril said, looking up at the ceiling. \u201cYou have given me much to think about, Lady Linnea,\u201d he said when he finally lowered his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI am glad. I would rather have you learn about it now, Toril, than to continue in ignorance,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cYes. I think so, too...\u201d Prince Toril trailed off before he shook himself, putting a smile back on his face. \u201cIn any case, I will show you a way out. I have an appointment with a Farset ambassador that I will be late for if I do not hurry. This way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, My Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought your lunch, Miss Kielland,\u201d B?rres said, setting her tray down. \u201cMeatcakes, carrots, and potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, B?rres,\u201d Gemma said, smiling at the guard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.

Enjoy your lunch,\u201d B?rres said, slipping out of the dungeon.</p><p>Gemma sighed and felt for the braid of black and silver thread she had tied around her neck, cradling Stil\u2019s heat charm and magic thimble.</p> <p>It had been several nights, and he hadn\u2019t yet returned. Should she call him?</p><p>\u201cIt seems my timing is perfect, then.\u201d</p><p>Gemma looked up to find Stil relaxing next to the ceiling grate, looking as if he had been there for the past few minutes.</p><p>\u201cSir Mage, how was your journey?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t go quite as I planned,\u201d he said, adjusting his hood so it fell lower, although he gave Gemma a lopsided smile. \u201cBut I am alive and in once piece, and I returned at the perfect hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately I must go. I came only to tell you that I am back,\u201d the mage said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Oh\u2014here,\u201d Gemma said, trying to untangle the ruby heat charm.</p><p>\u201cKeep it for now. You can give it to me when I see you tonight,\u201d Stil said. \u201cAnd you might want to ask the guards for some shutters if the King is going to keep you cooped up here,\u201d he added before slipping from the ledge, disappearing from sight.</p><p>With the mage gone, Gemma turned her attention to the black wool cape folded and stowed in the corner. \u201cI wonder if I have enough time to finish it before tonight...\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p> <p>Gemma carried the nearly finished wool cape\u2014she had a little embroidery left on one shoulder\u2014as well as her own cloak, the last of the silver thread she would need, her needles, and the mittens and various weaponry Lady Linnea had smuggled in.</p><p>A guard\u2014Foss\u2014had warned her before they left the cell that she would want her cloak.</p><p>Gemma had wondered why, but now\u2014as the guards escorted her through the chilly wind and a few snowflakes fell\u2014she understood.</p><p>The guards led her outside the castle, to a tall, crumbling tower that was separated from the palace and pushed into the forest border. The men wrestled the door open and nudged Gemma inside.</p><p>The interior of the tower was just as shabby as the exterior. The floor was smooth stone\u2014worn from age and use, not from excellent craftsmanship\u2014and the tower stretched so high the ceiling disappeared into darkness. Torches were posted on the walls, casting a cheerful glow that the tower couldn\u2019t absorb. There were windows\u2014barred of course. A few retained the original glass panes, but most had been broken over the ages and were badly boarded up so the whistling wind still managed to pry in through cracks and holes.</p><p>The tower felt similar to the palace dungeons in that it oozed with dark feelings. However, while the dungeons felt oppressive, the tower was soaked with desperation and sadness.</p><p>Part of that might have been its contents.</p><p>Piled everywhere, in stacks taller than Gemma, were bundles of flax fibers.</p> <p>A crew of spinners wouldn\u2019t be able to spin the immense amount of flax King Torgen had stock-piled. It was possible that Stil wouldn\u2019t be able to save Gemma this time.</p><p>Standing in front of the sea of flax were King Torgen and Prince Toril.</p><p>\u201cGemma Kielland,\u201d King Torgen said, the sags under his eyes and the too-sharp plains of his face were dark, giving him a fiendish look.</p><p>Gemma clutched the wool cape closer and bobbed a curtsey.</p><p>\u201cTonight, you will spin all this flax into gold,\u201d King Torgen said, gesturing to the piles and piles of flax. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t, I will have you beheaded. If you do succeed, you will marry me and become Queen of Verglas.\u201d</p><p>Gemma paused. \u201cI beg your pardon, My Lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you manage to finish all the spinning, you will be my queen,\u201d King Torgen said. His sick smile said he knew Gemma would not enjoy this.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I do not wish to, My Lord?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>The guards tensed, worried the king would retaliate, but he only laughed. \u201cTonight\u2019s outcome has very little to do with what you wish, Gemma Kielland. If you can spin flax into gold I will see you chained to me, even if it means I must put the shackles on you myself. You could marry Toril, the coward, if you wished.\u201d</p><p>Gemma took a step back, repulsed. To marry the mad king\u2014a man who would plot to have her killed? Or to marry his son and become the daughter-in-law to such a twisted creature? Who knew what atrocities he would carry out? He left Toril alone, but Gemma doubted King Torgen would leave her be, no matter whom she married.</p><p>King Torgen laughed at Gemma\u2019s look of revulsion.</p><p>\u201cChoose wisely, Gemma Kielland, lest you regret it,\u201d King Torgen said, strolling to the door. His path took him close to Gemma. He leaned into her, his breath reeking of decay. \u201cGuards will be posted outside. They will bring you to me tomorrow, as my bride, or one on death-row.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma said, her voice strong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>King Torgen narrowed his eyes. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there will be no guards posted outside the tower.

I am aware of your little ruse, Gemma Kielland. The guards stay,\u201d King Torgen said, grabbing a chunk of Gemma\u2019s wild hair and pulling.</p><p>\u201cThen you will not get so much as a strand of gold from me,\u201d Gemma said, her voice strong and her posture confident in spite of her prickling scalp.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t play games you cannot win, girl,\u201d King Torgen growled, pulling harder.</p><p>Gemma ignored her pain and met King Torgen\u2019s glare with the presence of a commanding general. \u201cAfter tonight, I will have spun enough gold to pay off half the country\u2019s debts, and you are ripping me from my family and friends to bring me into yours. No guards. That is my price for the deeds you have forced from me.\u201d</p><p>King Torgen\u2019s upper lip curled back in a sneer. He released Gemma\u2019s hair and pushed her backwards.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d King Torgen said with a pseudo-pleasant smile. \u201cNo guards will stand on duty tonight.\u201d</p><p>King Torgen swept outdoors, the wind yanking on his clothes and hair.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Prince Toril said before he followed his father outside.</p><p>\u201cAre you alright, Miss Kielland?\u201d the guard captain asked when the door ominously slammed shut.</p><p>Gemma took in a shaky breath but set her shoulders and chin. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice strong. \u201cWill he keep his bargain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean will he refrain from posting guards? I think so. His anger indicates he will,\u201d the captain said.</p><p>Gemma nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to escape?\u201d Foss asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gemma honestly replied.</p><p>The guards exchanged glances and nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure to be in your service,\u201d the captain said as his men saluted Gemma. \u201cI wish it could have been under different circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for your kindness,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>The captain also saluted Gemma before he motioned for his men to follow him and exit the tower.</p><p>The howling wind rampaged indoors while the guards filed out, making the torches flicker. When the door slammed shut, Gemma heard the familiar groan of a bar being dropped into place, and a lock turning.</p><p>Gemma ran a hand through her wavy hair. \u201cNow what?\u201d she wondered.</p><p>When Stil banged into the tower an hour or so later, Gemma was pacing back and forth in front of the flax.</p> <p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d Stil said, brushing snowflakes from his cloak.</p><p>\u201cI am in a great deal of trouble, Sir Mage,\u201d Gemma said, still pacing.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>\u201cYou must let me out of the tower so I can run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, have you seen the weather? I can\u2019t let you flee in this,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma stopped in front of Stil and whirled to face him, every muscle in her body tight with agitation. \u201cThen you may as well kill me now. I would rather be dead than be married into that demon\u2019s family!\u201d</p><p>Surprised by the outburst, Stil reached out and placed his warm hands on Gemma\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNo matter what happens tonight, you will be safe. Now, please explain\u2014everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe base bargain is still the same. If I don\u2019t spin all of this into gold, King Torgen will have me killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expected that,\u201d Stil said, squeezing Gemma\u2019s shoulders before he released her and approached the spinning wheel. He wet his fingers and started pulling flax from the distaff to get the machine running.</p><p>\u201cYes, well he\u2019s gone and added a benefit. If all the flax is spun, he will marry me and make me his queen!\u201d Gemma said, spitting the words out like they were bile.</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d Stil said, turning around incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Gemma said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cThat does change things a great deal,\u201d Stil said, seating himself on a rickety chair. He folded his arms across his chest as he thought, occasionally nudging the spinning wheel to make it run.</p><p>\u201cIt seems running is your only viable option,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma emphatically nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t leave right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe weather is terrible, and these days I prefer not to travel at night,\u201d Stil said, turning so his fine lips and chin were pointed in the direction of a glass window.</p><p>\u201cForgive my bluntness, Sir Mage, but I fail to see what your travel preferences have to do with me.\u201d</p><p>The mage tilted his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t really think I would allow you to set off into the wilds alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you open the tower door for me, that will be more than sufficient help,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stil said, rejecting the idea.</p><p>\u201cSir Mage, Stil,\u201d Gemma said, trying again. \u201cYou have done so much to aid me. I cannot count on you any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Stil said, and Gemma sagged with relief until the mage spoke again. \u201cThen I choose to tag along as your extra baggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>Gemma opened and closed her mouth twice before saying, \u201cWhy?\u201d in a voice that indicated the mage had lost his wits.</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to see you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCraftmage Stil,\u201d Gemma said, drawing her shoulders up and facing Stil with the same bravado with which she had faced King Torgen. \u201cYou need not be concerned with your obligation to help the weak. Once I am free, I will be my own responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour flight has nothing to do with my obligation,\u201d Stil countered. \u201cAlso, I find it interesting that it takes a marriage proposal to make you animated and talkative.\u201d</p><p>Gemma clenched both of her hands in fists before shouting, \u201cYou cannot lead me around like a goat for the rest of my life!\u201d</p><p>Stil laughed at the comparison.</p><p>\u201cSTIL!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d the mage laughed, holding his sides.</p> <p>Gemma rolled her eyes in disgust and waited for his laughter to subside.</p><p>\u201cGemma, I am concerned for you not because of any mage code or responsibility, but because I genuinely like you,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma pushed an eyebrow up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cForgive my disbelief, but magic users rarely make friends with civilians. Royalty? Perhaps. Scholars, occasionally. But seamstresses from Ostfold? Never,\u201d Gemma flatly said.</p><p>\u201cI see your point, but the attachment is already made. Now, if we are traveling together, I owe you an explanation for my reluctance to travel at night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir Mage,\u201d Gemma groaned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Verglas not for any great reason, except that I am being tracked by a creature of darkness, and he cannot force his way past the Snow Queen\u2019s residual magic.\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s protests died on her lips.</p><p>Stil gave Gemma a wry grin. \u201cYou see, you are not the only one who is a harbinger of trouble. I have no idea why I am being chased or to what ends. I only know he rides a nightmare and controls a hellhound.\u201d</p><p>Gemma wordlessly plopped down on a stool near Stil\u2019s chair. So that was why he reacted so oddly to news of the hellhound tracks, she realized.</p><p>\u201cHe has been chasing me for the better part of a year and following me for much longer. At first, I was able to keep well ahead of him with ease. But he grew stronger, somehow. By the time I finally thought to head to Mullberg to get to the Veneno Conclave, it was too late. The rider and his animals gained so much strength through darkness that they almost caught me. Thankfully I managed to escape to Verglas, and I have been trapped here ever since, for well over a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...you\u2019re a mage,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cCraftmage, Gemma. My fighting capabilities are limited.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Gemma said, waving her hand as if she could wash his words away. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re a mage. Wouldn\u2019t other magical folk from the Veneno Conclave help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t flee there. The mountains between Mullberg and Verglas would be the perfect place for the rider to trap me. I\u2019ve tried sending out word, but magic users are spread thin already.\u201d</p><p>Gemma tilted her head. \u201cWhat? Whatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are disconnected from it all as the Snow Queen\u2019s magic has held your borders, but the rest of the world is under direct assault by darkness,\u201d Stil grimly said. \u201cThe Sole crown princess\u2014the only heir to the Sole throne\u2014has fallen into a cursed sleep. There\u2019s a powerful, black sorcerer who has been plaguing Kozlovka for years, but they stupidly didn\u2019t think to tell the Conclave about it until recently. Trolls are troubling Farset, and goblins are raiding in Erlauf. No one knows what\u2019s happening in Ringsted. The Chronos Mountains are impassable, and the coast is riddled with giant storms. It takes multiple weather mages to force clear seas for sailing.\u201d</p><p>Gemma was quiet for a time. \u201cYou are serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeathly so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew\u2014I don\u2019t think anyone in Verglas knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s excusable. All of Verglas has been occupied dancing to the tune of your mad, crazed king.\u201d</p><p>Gemma shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not all bad,\u201d Stil continued. \u201cA prince of Loire was cursed for three or so years. He broke it not quite two years ago, which is fortuitous because Loire has been instrumental in cracking down on any sort of darkness. Erlauf is about to crown a new queen, and she\u2019s brilliant. With her at the head of the country and her husband in the army, they will squash the goblin uprisings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you aren\u2019t saying is that the world is in great upheaval, and you are forced to go at this alone as a result,\u201d Gemma said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stil shrugged. \u201cThe rider is strongest at night. It wouldn\u2019t be untrue to say light is his weakness\u2014he won\u2019t move in it, anyway, and he and his animals fear it. He can\u2019t get into Verglas, but somehow he\u2019s still tracking me. I have tried moving from one end of Verglas to the other, and he waits for me on the border. I know it may sound like traveling with me will be more dangerous than if you were to move alone, but as long as we are in Verglas, it will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Mage,\u201d Gemma said, her voice tight with pain. \u201cThe point is I will have to leave Verglas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get you to a border and hide you better and in more comfort. One of my companions should arrive soon to aid us. I\u2019ve received word that she has recently resurfaced in the southern kingdoms.\u201d</p><p>She? Gemma raised her eyebrows at the pronoun and the soft smile Stil wore. The last thing I need is to get involved in a mage\u2019s love affair.</p> <p>\u201cSo, we will flee together,\u201d Stil concluded.</p><p>\u201cWho is this rider who chases you?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think \u2018who\u2019 is the right word. He\u2019s not human. The rider is...\u201d the mage was quiet for a moment, his expression tight. \u201cThe rider is darkness wrapped around death. He hasn\u2019t a soul\u2014he\u2019s too evil for that. There is nothing human-like about him except for the shape of his body. He\u2019s the worst nightmare you can imagine, and his darkness is the kind that tempts people to do evil things. He is hatred, and he hungers for bloodshed and the agony of others.\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s throat closed at the description.</p><p>Stil wasn\u2019t being chased by a lightweight, evil sorcerer. He had a creature of darkness on his trail.</p> <p>A few minutes passed before Gemma was able to summon a safer subject to discuss.</p><p>\u201cDo you intend to go hooded the whole time? We\u2019ll be in trouble if you take it off\u2014I\u2019ll never be able to find you again,\u201d she dryly said.</p><p>Stil tilted his head.</p><p>\u201cBeing that I have no idea what you look like,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Stil said. \u201cI apologize; I had forgotten. I\u2019ve been going hooded to avoid King Torgen\u2019s attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you famous?\u201d Gemma asked.</p> <p>Stil hesitated. \u201cYes, I suppose,\u201d he said, before flipping off his hood.</p><p>Gemma worked hard to keep her mask of indifference in place. Stil was a handsome as stories told round the campfire made royal princes out to be. His nose\u2014matching his fine lips and chin\u2014was long and slender, setting off his high cheekbones and flawless skin. His eyes were a dynamic spattering of blue\u2014the same color as the sky with circles of royal blue slicing through to the center.</p><p>His hair was blue-black\u2014like a night sky. The front was feathered but the back was long and silky, pulled into a low ponytail that disappeared into his cloak.</p><p>To be frank, Stil was the most handsome man Gemma had seen\u2014and she had caught a glimpse of the famed Arcainian princes! She knew magic users were supposed to better looking than the general population, but this was ridiculous!</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cHm? That is all you have to say,\u201d Stil frowned.</p><p>\u201cWere you expecting a scream of horror?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stil said. \u201cIt\u2019s only\u2014well, I know I\u2019m nothing compared to an enchanter, but most find me attractive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTsk,\u201d Gemma said, turning her back to the craftmage. \u201cWhen do we leave?\u201d</p><p>Stil sighed and muttered under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou do not want to travel in the dead of night, but the closer we get to dawn, the easier it will be for King Torgen to find us,\u201d Gemma said, peering out of a glass window.</p><p>\u201cWe need to wait until after midnight. Even if King Torgen does not have guards posted, I imagine he will personally watch the tower for some time,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cYou think he will have missed your arrival?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>Stil smiled, and Gemma could see that his eyes gleamed and crinkled with the gesture. \u201cAfter the way I arrived the first time you had to complete this impossible task, do you really think I can\u2019t move without being seen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Gemma shrugged. She looked past Stil to eye the spinning machine. \u201cBut if we are going to run, why do you spin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDistraction. When King Torgen sees how much gold is present, he will forget about you for a while\u2014I imagine,\u201d Stil said, adding more fibers to the distaff.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot possibly spin it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I won\u2019t. But I can get enough done to be a proper distraction,\u201d Stil said. \u201cAlthough I will still need a payment.\u201d</p><p>Gemma glanced at the wool cape she had worked on since the second night Stil saved her. It wasn\u2019t finished yet. She couldn\u2019t give it to him. \u201cI don\u2019t have any gold. I have a few dull weapons\u2014hand axes and the like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Stil said, rubbing his chin as he thought.</p><p>His scrutiny was a little more uncomfortable to bear now that Gemma could see his uncommonly handsome face fixed on her.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps...\u201d Stil said, strolling to her side.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Gemma said, turning away from the window.</p><p>Stil smiled widely. \u201cHow about your firstborn child?\u201d he said, speaking slowly, like a cat rubbing against furniture.</p><p>Gemma stopped thinking altogether. \u2018What?\u201d she asked, slumping against the tower wall.</p><p>Stil planted a hand on either side of her head, boxing her in. \u201cYour firstborn child will be mine,\u201d Stil said, the words coming more confidently this time.</p><p>Gemma raised an eyebrow. \u201cThat is quite a hefty raise in price.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSupply and demand,\u201d Stil winked.</p><p>Gemma shrugged. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Stil dropped his hands and blinked in surprise. \u201cYou agree so easily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to have children.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that cancel out the negotiation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It will be my own fault if I never collect my payment,\u201d Stil said, flipping his ponytail over his shoulder. \u201cJust see that you remember it as well,\u201d he warned, his cloak swirling around him as he returned to the spinning wheel.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to remove the...items you carry under your clothes,\u201d Still called over his shoulder. \u201cWe will be moving swiftly, and I\u2019m not certain how well you can sprint with a hand axe secured somewhere in your skirt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cIf you need something to stow your goods in, I have a bag I can lend you. That cloak won\u2019t do either, but we\u2019ll have to wait until we reach my camp to give you a different one. I haven\u2019t any on me at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Stil snorted. \u201cYou are as fine as a winter pony heading to the desert. You need to be better equipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour prices are too high for me to accept anything,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cI will not give you a second-and third-born child for a cape and a bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Stil said. \u201cThe first one is the only one I should need to make you promise for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Anyway, giving you things\u2014like bags and capes\u2014doesn\u2019t involve my magic, so there is no need to trade,\u201d Stil said, tossing Gemma a silk, drawstring bag roughly the size of her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need a bigger bag,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat one should fit all of your things. It\u2019s charmed\u2014like my tent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are speaking in riddles tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry putting things inside it, and you\u2019ll see what I mean,\u201d Stil said, grabbing a length of flax and adding it to the spinning wheel\u2019s distaff.</p><p>Gemma rolled up the sleeve of her brown Lovland uniform\u2014which had seen better days after weeks of living in a dungeon\u2014and slid out the dull butter-knife that was hooked on her cuff.</p><p>She dropped the knife into the silk bag, and was surprised when the knife\u2014which was taller than the bag was long\u2014disappeared inside.</p> <p>\u201cSee? Charmed. So where are you hiding the axe?\u201d Stil asked with a sly smirk. He tilted his head and swept his eyes up and down Gemma\u2019s body with interest.</p><p>Gemma ignored the question and circled behind a flax pile to finish disarming herself without being gawked at.</p><p>In addition to the useful items Lady Linnea had passed off to Gemma, Gemma was able to fit her thread, needles, and the wool cape inside the silk bag, which remained the size of a handbag.</p><p>\u201cOur plan is this,\u201d Stil said when Gemma finished exploring the depths of her borrowed bag. \u201cTonight, we will try to make for my camp. I\u2019ve been hanging around Ostfold, but my camp is a four-or five-hour journey south. Ideally, we should reach it shortly after dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do when the soldiers come for us?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, they won\u2019t be able to break inside,\u201d Stil grinned. \u201cEvery scrap of my camp is charmed. They won\u2019t see our quarters. They\u2019ll just see a cloth tent and move on. It works a little like the silk bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what you meant when you said you could hide me in comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. The trip there will be difficult in the darkness and falling snow, but once we reach camp, we consider can ourselves fortified and slowly make our way south. Any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObjections?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this with me?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain,\u201d Stil said, giving Gemma a soft smile. \u201cWe have a few hours before we should leave. I suggest you get some rest. I\u2019ll see to the spinning.\u201d</p><p>Gemma shifted, uncomfortable with leaving the mage to do just about everything.</p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t feeling sleepy, we could always play the question game,\u201d Stil teasingly added.</p><p>\u201cI will sleep,\u201d Gemma said, walking off. She paused midstride to turn around and add, \u201cThank you, Stil.\u201d</p><p>Stil inclined his head in acknowledgment.</p><p>Gemma took the silk bag and her cape and chose a flax pile far away from the spinning wheel to nestle into. She didn\u2019t think she could sleep even if she wanted to, but as she watched Stil wet more flax, her eyes slowly shut, and she drifted off to sleep.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d Stil said, gently nudging her.</p><p>\u201cHm,\u201d Gemma said, rubbing her crusty eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Gemma woke up quickly, her eyes wide as she tried to place where she was. \u201cWe can leave?\u201d</p><p>Stil nodded. \u201cYes. Do you still have the heat charm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma said, struggling out of the flax pile in which she was nestled.</p><p>Stil had done a heroic job of spinning the flax. Gemma\u2019s flax pile was one of only two full stacks left\u2014although there had been packets of fibers spread throughout the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKeep it\u2014slip it in your mittens,\u201d Stil said, tossing Gemma the mittens Lady Linnea had given her.</p><p>Gemma untangled the threaded charm from her neck and slipped it in her mitten\u2014along with the thimble she had yet to use. She finished fastening her cloak, picked up her silk bag, and met Stil by the door.</p><p>She took one last glance of the sorrowful tower, taking in the impressive spindle of gold thread.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Stil asked. In his hand, he held some sort of glowing prism.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma said. She was sorry she couldn\u2019t send word to Lady Linnea and Grandmother Guri, but they would understand.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Stil said, flipping his shabby hood up.</p><p>Gemma didn\u2019t see what Stil did to open the door\u2014he blocked her view with his body\u2014but the door clanked, and the wind sucked it open, nearly tearing it off its hinges.</p><p>The snow had stopped playing around and was pelting the ground, covering it in a layer of white as tall as the length of Gemma\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cSo you really love this beautiful country, huh?\u201d Stil shouted over the howling gusts. He struggled against the wind to close the door when Gemma followed him out.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see in the morning,\u201d Gemma shouted, snowflakes stinging her cheeks. She had to pull her cape against her to keep it from streaming straight behind her.</p><p>The wind howled like a ravenous wolf as Stil led Gemma east\u2014away from Lake Sno and behind the royal palace. They moved at a staggering walk, which was an uncomfortably slow pace for a person fleeing for her life. Gemma tried to walk quickly, but the wind pulled on her clothes and tossed her like she was a corn husk.</p><p>\u201cAt least we need not worry about our tracks,\u201d Stil said, turning to look behind them. By the light of the prism, Gemma could see that any footprints they made were almost instantly erased by the whirling wind and snow.</p><p>Gemma squinted up at Stil and didn\u2019t reply, fighting to keep her balance.</p><p>\u201cIt will get better when we leave Ostfold behind,\u201d Stil said, gesturing to the sleeping city. \u201cThe woods are more sheltered.\u201d</p><p>They passed the palace and walked south, through empty farm fields, moving parallel to the capital.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until they staggered through the farmland surrounding Ostfold that they were able to slip into a dark forest.</p><p>Stil was right: the wind was partially blocked by the great trees, but the same trees cast sinister shadows and groaned ominously as Stil and Gemma walked past\u2014moving briskly.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d Gemma asked, looking behind. Her heart beat faster ever since they left the tower, but at the sound of a howl, it stopped all together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the trees. No one at the palace has discovered your disappearance. They won\u2019t be up for a few hours. Come on,\u201d Stil said, tugging Gemma forward by the hand and holding his prism light out.</p><p>They walked through the dark forest and the occasional blustery meadow for what felt like hours.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s face was numb, and her feet were blocks of ice\u2014in spite of the heat charm\u2014when they stumbled out of the dark forest and into a field.</p><p>The sun was up. Dawn hadn\u2019t reached them in the forest, but in the field, the pink horizon made the snow smoothed across the ground glow and sparkle like fine fabric.</p><p>The howling wind was gone, replaced by a playful breeze that kicked up bits of snow and made the flakes glitter. Fir trees, pines, and bare oaks shielded the meadow, bringing in spots of green and brown. Birds sang and perched on a sorry-looking tent and a sleepy donkey.</p> <p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d Stil said. \u201cMy camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said, her voice monotone.</p><p>The tent\u2014which was tattered and looked like it was on the verge of collapsing\u2014was tucked behind a bare campfire that had no wood to stock it.</p><p>Gemma hoped the tent was, as Stil had promised, like her silk bag and had hidden depths, or she would march off alone\u2014danger or not.</p><p>The donkey was picketed to the ground. His fuzzy coat was puffed, making him resemble a yak more than an equine. He was big for a donkey\u2014the size of a small horse\u2014and when he caught sight of Gemma and Stil, he brayed and stamped his hooves.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Pricker Patch,\u201d Stil said. \u201cBe careful with him. He nearly bit my arm off once when I told him he looked ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Gemma tilted her head to study the donkey as they drew closer. \u201cHe looks sensible.\u201d</p><p>Stil snorted, sweeping snow away from the tent with his cloak. \u201cSensibly ferocious. I keep him to guard the camp and carry things, not for company. This way. Let\u2019s get out of the cold,\u201d Stil said, lifting the tent flap. The inside was the same as the outside\u2014ratty and worn. Stil frowned and let the tent flap fall back into place.</p><p>\u201cIs the inside of the tent magically heated?\u201d Gemma asked as Stil opened the tent again\u2014revealing the same thread-bare innards. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat? No. A normal fire does the job,\u201d Stil said, closing the tent flap. He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m home, you finicky thing. Stop playing games and open up,\u201d he said before smacking a side of the tent.</p><p>Gemma winced, fearing it would collapse under the abuse, but when Stil lifted the tent flap, it opened up into a large parlor. It contained a marble fireplace with a cheerfully crackling fire, two padded settees, two arm chairs, piles of cushions, and a short table not more than two feet high that held a silver tea set.</p><p>\u201cSorry, someone must have been creeping around here\u2014it was guarding itself. We can check Pricker Patch\u2019s teeth later to find out if he ate the intruder,\u201d Stil said, stepping aside so Gemma could enter first.</p><p>Gemma hesitantly crawled through the narrow opening, into the elegant room. She winced when she set her snow covered feet on the immense, red, patterned rug that covered the ground.</p> <p>Stil\u2019s tastes were perfectly expressed by the room.</p><p>The wood on the settees and the armchairs, as well as the legs of the table, were ornately carved and stained such a deep, rich brown-red color they glowed. The walls were some sort of plaster, but there were moldings where it met the plaster ceiling and the wooden floor.</p><p>Gold candlesticks, welded to resemble unfurling vines and flowers, were bolted to wall. They held bee\u2019s wax candles that scented the air with sweet honey.</p><p>Gold-leafed instruments, a tapestry, and paintings hung from the wall. Even the frames were of the highest quality.</p><p>As Gemma looked around the room with big eyes, she realized Stil hadn\u2019t been thoughtlessly bemoaning the loss of great craftsmanship. And he was obviously an extremely talented, well-paid craftmage.</p> <p>\u201cHome at last,\u201d Stil said, thoughtlessly trekking snow across his costly carpet and dumping his cloak and belongings on one of the fine settees. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked Gemma as he kicked off his boots.</p><p>Gemma gripped her borrowed silk bag that held the wool cape she was making for the craftmage. \u201cNothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Stil smiled as he combed his silky black hair with his fingers. \u201cThank you. With my vocation, you think I would be sick of looking at crafted goods and merchandise, but I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s important to stock my place with the best. It feeds my soul,\u201d he said, groaning when he stretched his arms above his head. \u201cYou must be an ice block. Come. You\u2019ll want to use the bath, I assume,\u201d Stil said, leading the way through a great door.</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d Gemma asked, carefully shedding her footwear and cloak at the door before trailing after Stil. She stopped at the threshold of the room the craftmage had entered.</p><p>The bathroom was just as beautiful and over-the-top as the parlor.</p><p>The bathtub was immense. Gemma suspected Pricker Patch\u2014if he could be goaded into going down on his knees\u2014could comfortably bathe in it. There were gold, brocade curtains that could be pulled around the tub for privacy, a chandelier, several gold-framed mirrors, a well-padded arm chair, and two white vanities accented with gold.</p> <p>An iron grid was built above a fire. The grid was laden with rocks, which the flickering flames licked, heating the rocks.</p><p>\u201cSpend as long as you want,\u201d Stil said, pulling a rope. To Gemma\u2019s astonishment, part of the ceiling pulled down, and water rushed from it, filling the tub. \u201cI have business I must attend to in the rest of the house. When you\u2019re finished, go back to the parlor\u2014there will be tea and refreshments waiting for you,\u201d Stil said, releasing the rope\u2014cutting off the water\u2014and using a pair of tongs to remove stones from the fire. He dropped them into the tub\u2014making steam hiss whenever a rock hit the water.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find something for you to wear\u2014you must be sick of your uniform by now\u2014and leave it by the door, but here is a robe and towels. Explore. Use anything you want here. I don\u2019t know what I have, sorry,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Stil smiled and pushed Gemma\u2019s hair-band\u2014which had fallen low over her eyebrows\u2014up with two fingers. \u201cOf course. I will leave you to it. You look dead on your feet. Enjoy,\u201d he said, leaving the room with a flourish.</p><p>Gemma hesitatingly made use of the bathroom. She felt far too self-conscious to do more than cast a wondering eye at the various bottles, bath salts, perfumes, creams, and scrubs lined up on one of the vanities.</p><p>The bathwater was warm and restored feeling to Gemma\u2019s numb fingers and toes. It was a delight to wash off the bits of dungeon grime she had been wearing for the past few weeks, but she moved quickly, feeling like an intruder in a lady\u2019s private powder room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma cautiously poked her head into the parlor to find Stil had kept his promise. Waiting for her was a pair of black buckle shoes, black stockings, and a dress that was beautiful enough to pass off as Verglas wedding clothes for a civilian like Gemma.</p><p>The skirt was black wool with a high waist and a ribbon for a belt. The edge of the skirt and the ribbon belt had pink and green floral designs. The ribbon belt covered the hem between the dress, and a black vest that had similar embroidery on it. Black string looped around gold buttons and criss-crossed the front of the vest. A white, linen shirt that had the same embroidery on the cuffs and collar was set out to go under the vest, completing the look.</p><p>Gemma searched the bathroom for a much less expensive gown to wear\u2014something more appropriate of her station. Finding no alternative, she reluctantly put on the dress and crept into the parlor.</p><p>Stil was there, taking inventory of a number of jeweled items spread out on the low table. His hair was damp\u2014signaling he too had taken a bath of some sort\u2014and was much, much shorter. It was slicked back out of his face, with the exception of a few tendrils that hung over his forehead, and was closely cropped to his head in an almost military style.</p> <p>His clothing style was\u2014once again\u2014unlike anything Gemma had ever seen before. He had knee-high brown boots that had elaborate, royal blue embroidery on the heel and toe. He wore black breeches\u2014but the inner caves and leg were colored royal blue, and a dove-gray jacket that cut off at the knees was strapped into place by a giant leather belt that encircled his torso. The jacket was decorated with blue embroidery on the cuffs and lapels that matched the embroidery on his boots.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Stil said, smiling when his blue eyes landed on Gemma. \u201cI was wondering if I picked the wrong size clothes for you. But you look just as beautiful in it as I thought you would. What would you like to do first: see your room or enjoy some refreshments?\u201d</p><p>Gemma briefly considered saying something about his hair as she stared at it before she brushed the thought away. \u201cI think I would like to see my room,\u201d Gemma said, holding up her silk bag.</p><p>\u201cOf course. This way,\u201d Stil said, going through a different door. He led Gemma down a hallway that was dotted with doors. When they reached the end, he opened a room.</p><p>Gemma peeked inside before she backed up. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here,\u201d Gemma said, gesturing to the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Is it not fine enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too fine.\u201d</p><p>Stil gave Gemma an amused smirk. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever heard a lady complain that something is too fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still have yet to, for I am not a titled lady,\u201d Gemma reminded him. \u201cDo you have a less decorous room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt does not matter if I do. This is my camp, and it is for me to decide where you will stay.\u201d</p><p>Gemma ventured another peek in the room. \u201cYou cannot be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your room. I will carve your name into the door if you do not believe me,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma mulishly tucked her head.</p><p>\u201cYou will not win this one, Gemma Kielland. This is your room. Return to the parlor when you have finished putting your things away,\u201d Stil said, sauntering back down the hallway.</p><p>Gemma watched the craftmage go with a scowl before she returned her attention to the room. The walls were a pale blue, like snow in the evening light. The floor was wood stained the color of a rich, dark honey, but there was a beautiful, elaborately woven rug spread on the ground. The furniture\u2014the bed frame, vanity, armoire, and nightstand\u2014were all a beautiful, medium shade of wood decorated with dark colored, carved swirls. The air was fragrant with the smell of pine, and the slightest hint of mint. Gemma didn\u2019t know if it was from the furniture or a hidden nosegay, but the scent was welcoming.</p><p>Gemma had seen Lady Linnea\u2019s bedroom before. This room easily rivaled it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma said, moving down the hallway. She tried turning door knobs, but none of them budged. Gemma rummaged in her silk bag before pulling out the needles Grandmother Guri had sent. She tried using the dullest needle to pick a lock, but the door shook and boomed like thunder, discouraging Gemma from trying again.</p> <p>After five minutes of wandering, Gemma was forced to admit defeat. She returned to the bedroom and unpacked her things, setting them out on the beautiful vanity table.</p><p>She dragged her feet as she wandered back to the parlor.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t sitting right with her. It was the environment, and the way Stil was acting\u2014like she was a dear companion he wanted to comfortably house instead of a vagrant on which he was taking pity.</p><p>Magic users do not befriend civilians. They aid us, yes, but only to address whatever our common problem is before they set us on our way. They do not invite civilians into their homes, dress them, and give them such a room. Perhaps they would do something like that for royalty, or heroes on a quest, but for a poor seamstress?</p><p>Gemma paused outside the parlor door. Why is Stil doing all of this? Why is his kindness going so far? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hope you found the room to your satisfaction?\u201d Stil said when Gemma entered the parlor.</p><p>Gemma glared at Stil.</p><p>\u201cI thought it would suit your tastes\u2014stop giving me that look. I have tea and food,\u201d Stil said, patting the spot next to him on the settee.</p><p>Gemma inspected the food piled on the platters before she took a plate and loaded it with sausages, salted pork, fresh bread, and apple slices, avoiding most of the delicious-smelling but foreign-looking meat pies and pastries.</p> <p>Gemma sat on the empty settee across from Stil, making the craftmage shake his head in amusement.</p><p>\u201cSo my plan is for us to spend the day and night here\u2014we won\u2019t be found by any soldiers King Torgen sends after us as long as we are inside. No normal civilian could break through my security measures. Tomorrow we will start our journey, moving south towards the Loire border. Is that acceptable?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma said, eating her food with relish.</p><p>\u201cAs we will be walking, I assume it will take us some time to get to the border, but I do not think it is necessary to rush. The bigger trick will be remaining unseen as we travel,\u201d Stil said, serving Gemma a cup of tea.</p><p>\u201cThank you. That light you were using last night, what was it?\u201d Gemma asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe starfire?\u201d Stil said, slipping a glass prism out of his pocket.</p><p>Gemma nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe name is a little fancy considering how easy it is to make these. It\u2019s one of the first skills you learn as a craftmage. It\u2019s a bit of magic light trapped in a prism. It will shine brighter or dimmer based on your orders. Their only real purpose is to shed light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to be very useful,\u201d Gemma said, eyeing the prism.</p><p>\u201cIt can be, but they aren\u2019t very practical for everyday use. Even mages still need fire to truly light a room. Starfires are best used for temporary cases, or in cases of bad weather, as they can\u2019t be put out. Most often, we make them for children who are frightened of the dark,\u201d Stil said. He was silent for a moment. \u201cWould you like one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow expensive are they?\u201d Gemma asked.</p> <p>Stil chuckled. \u201cI fear I have made you wary of any gifts from me forever. There is no charge. Making a starfire can be done in a matter of minutes. As I\u2019m giving you a finished product and not performing magic for you, no trade is necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I have a wooden crate of them in my shop leftover from my apprentice days. I will take you back there, and you can have as many as you can carry,\u201d Stil promised.</p><p>Gemma ate an apple slice and mulled over Stil\u2019s offer. It seems to me that he didn\u2019t need to perform specific magic for the thimble either, and he still requested a payment for that.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gemma said, deciding to take the risk and accept his offer. She was silent until she finished her meal, in which she excused herself to her room.</p><p>After casting a critical eye on her surroundings and then turning the same critical eye on the black, wool cape, Gemma set her unease aside and embroidered the cloak for the remainder of the day, until she fell asleep early that night.</p><p>It took every ounce of Lady Linnea\u2019s will to remain seated at the table as her mother droned on over breakfast.</p><p>\u201c\u2014will sadly have to find a new seamstress to replace Gemma, although it will be difficult to find anyone as talented as she was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs,\u201d Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cPardon, darling? What did you say?\u201d Lady Lovland said.</p><p>\u201cGemma is talented. She is still alive,\u201d Lady Linnea said, her usual mask of indifference pasted on her face.</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose so,\u201d Lady Lovland hesitantly agreed. \u201cIn any case, I have asked your father to send word to our Loire friends and associates. A Loire seamstress would do quite well with you, I am certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I be excused?\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cBut, darling, you\u2019ve hardly eaten any breakfast at all,\u201d Lady Lovland said.</p><p>\u201cI feel ill,\u201d Lady Linnea lied. Nothing could be farther from the truth. She couldn\u2019t eat because she could barely contain her joy!</p><p>\u201cI see, poor dear. Yes, you may return to your rooms. I will send a maid with tea to you in a bit to see if you can eat something then,\u201d Lady Lovland said.</p><p>Lady Linnea curtseyed to her mother and swept out of the room, the skirts of her elegant dress\u2014designed and sewn by Gemma\u2014sweeping the floor.</p><p>When the door closed behind her, Lady Linnea burst forth in an impatient march. A scullery maid\u2014Sissel\u2014bobbed a curtsey before she handed a shawl to her and whispered, \u201cOut the eastern side door, My Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Lady Linnea said. She wrapped the shawl around her shoulders before hurrying to the eastern side door.</p><p>The back gardens were empty\u2014except for snow-covered hedges\u2014so Lady Linnea tucked the shawl over her head and trotted in the direction of the stables.</p><p>A young stable boy\u2014wearing a coat made by Gemma\u2014stood in the stable entrance, kicking up his heels. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s back by Captain\u2019s stall, My Lady,\u201d the stable boy said, naming one of the farm horses.</p><p>Learning from Gemma, Lady Linnea tossed the boy a pastry she smuggled out of breakfast. \u201cGood lad,\u201d she said before slipping in the stables, leaving the boy to keep watch.</p><p>Lady Linnea ran down the aisle, frightening horses in her wake. \u201cShe escaped?\u201d she asked, throwing herself over the top of Captain\u2019s stall.</p><p>The large draft horse didn\u2019t react at all and kept chewing his hay, but Prince Toril popped out from behind him.</p> <p>\u201cShe escaped,\u201d he confirmed, exiting the stall. \u201cLike a ghost in the night. She talked my father into removing her guard. He stubbornly watched for the first few hours, but sometime in the early morning, she gave him the slip. She still managed to spin a great deal of the flax, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToril, this is marvelous!\u201d Lady Linnea said, throwing herself at the prince to hug him tightly. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d the prince stammered around the same time that Lady Linnea realized she was hugging a boy and not Gemma, a horse, or her parents. The prince\u2019s body was much stronger and, oddly enough, was as comforting as hugging a large dog.</p><p>Still, it felt foreign and...different.</p><p>Lady Linnea hastily backed off and brushed her dress off, trying to restore some of her equilibrium. \u201cBut you did help us,\u201d she argued, inspecting her shoes for a moment so she wouldn\u2019t have to meet Prince Toril\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou have helped us since the start of this nightmare. I cannot thank you enough,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Prince Toril grimly said.</p><p>Lady Linnea almost bit her tongue when she hastily brought her chin up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour maid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is my seamstress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, she won\u2019t be safe until she\u2019s across the Verglas border. My father is sending out a small army of soldiers after her,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cShe will make it,\u201d Lady Linnea said. \u201cUnless something happens, and she feels she has no choice but to give herself up, Gemma will wriggle out of Verglas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sound so certain,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cSomeone is helping her\u2014someone who cares for her very much. I don\u2019t think they will allow her to be captured. Which reminds me...are any male servants, guards, or soldiers missing from the palace?\u201d Lady Linnea asked.</p><p>Prince Toril blinked. \u201cMissing? No. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d Lady Linnea said before smiling again. \u201cI\u2019m so happy I could scream,\u201d she said. When she threw her hands in the air, a carriage horse across the aisle spooked.</p><p>\u201cSo, you think this mission is over?\u201d Prince Toril asked, scuffing the toe of his boot on the dirt floor.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Linnea said, her smile mixed with joy and sadness. She would miss Gemma like she would miss her right hand or favorite sword, and although the past few weeks were dangerous, they were also thrilling compared to her normal, boring life. And if she was being completely honest, she would miss the secretive meetings with the prince.</p><p>Prince Toril lifted his gaze so he looked above Lady Linnea\u2019s head. \u201cAlthough it is over...would you care to continue our acquaintance?\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea adjusted her grip on her shawl. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean...could we still arrange to meet?\u201d the prince asked, his words going up an octave, as if he was afraid of her answer.</p><p>Lady Linnea studied the bashful prince before nodding. \u201cI would enjoy that,\u201d she said.</p><p>Prince Toril relaxed, dropping his hunched shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said with a painfully genuine/puppy smile that made Lady Linnea want to throw something at him in embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Linnea said, pressing her lips together.</p><p>The pair stood in the stable for several awkward moments before the stable boy interrupted them. \u201cMy Lady? It looks like your father is coming to see his horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should leave,\u201d Lady Linnea awkwardly said.</p><p>Prince Toril nodded. \u201cOf course. I will see you...tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Until tomorrow,\u201d Lady Linnea agreed, wrapping her shawl around her head again. She scurried out a door on one side of the stable while Prince Toril scurried out of the door directly opposite. Both of them managed to miss Lady Linnea\u2019s father as he greeted the stable boy at the entrance.</p><p>\u201cHow are the horses?\u201d Lord Lovland asked.</p><p>\u201cQuite well, sir. Aerie is back on her grain,\u201d the stable boy said, luring Lord Lovland into the stable.</p><p>When the two of them had left the entryway, Lady Linnea hurried past the gardens, heading for the house. When someone released a sharp, piercing whistle, Lady Linnea turned around. Prince Toril stood at the border of their lands. He waved, and didn\u2019t slip into the street until Lady Linnea returned the gesture.</p><p>Lady Linnea smiled as she returned to the house. Yes, I will miss Gemma terribly. But maybe this won\u2019t be so bad.</p><p>Chapter 13 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Traveling with Stil was an interesting experience, less because he was a mage and more because of his relationship with his donkey, Pricker Patch.</p><p>Pricker Patch was a stoic animal. He did not like to move more than necessary, but when he was finally coaxed to walk, Gemma had to trot to keep up. Pricker Patch set the pace for the day, and when Pricker Patch stopped, Gemma and Stil stopped, for the donkey could not be pushed, urged, coaxed, or bribed into taking another step. Usually the animal was willing to go for most of the day, so on the third day of their travels, when Pricker Patch stopped mid-morning at the edge of the forest\u2014just as they were about to leave the protection of the trees\u2014and would continue no farther, Gemma thought it was odd.</p><p>\u201cDoes he normally do this?\u201d Gemma asked, studying the displeased donkey.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, but not usually without a purpose,\u201d Stil said. He ran his hands down the donkey\u2019s legs and inspected his hooves.</p> <p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Gemma said, leaning against a tree to look out at the ambling, open field. The field was at least a mile long before it plunged back into a small copse of trees. \u201c...Stil,\u201d Gemma said, shielding her eyes from the bright sun and squinting.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stil asked, rubbing one of Pricker Patch\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cDo you see that?\u201d Gemma asked, pointing at the shapes moving at the perimeter of the field.</p><p>Stil looked where Gemma was pointing before slipping a tube from his belt and flicking it open into a beautiful and ornate spyglass. \u201cSoldiers,\u201d he said, passing the spyglass to Gemma so she could see as well.</p><p>When Gemma held it to her right eye, it brought the shapes into focus, revealing uniforms and weapons.</p> <p>Stil scratched his head in aggravation. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they would come this way. I assumed they would think we would follow a river south. That will teach me to skimp on charms and spells,\u201d he said before pulling on Pricker Patch\u2019s halter and changing directions.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cWe change directions and head farther east. I have no idea how they got farther south of us, but we should be able to circle around them. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll set some spells and charms up before we travel,\u201d Stil said, leading the way.</p><p>Pricker Patch surprisingly accepted the change and started walking again.</p><p>Gemma glanced back at the soldiers before she hurried to carry the spyglass to Stil as they continued their journey, safely screened by the trees.</p><p>Several days later\u2014this time late in the afternoon\u2014Pricker Patch decided they had traveled far enough. As there was still an hour or two of sunlight left, Stil tried to persuade the donkey to continue, but in a fit of anger Pricker Patch (moving with a surprising amount of swiftness), grabbed an edge of Stil\u2019s cloak, and yanked it, badly ripping the fabric.</p> <p>\u201cThis...,\u201d Stil darkly trailed off and glared at his donkey. \u201cHow am I supposed to fix this?\u201d he asked an unrepentant Pricker Patch, shaking his cloak in front of the animal. \u201cIt\u2019s already falling to pieces! If it rips much more, I\u2019m going to start losing some of the spells and charms fixed in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you buy a new one?\u201d Gemma asked, working to undo the buckles and ties that held the tent poles and material on the donkey\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cNot easily,\u201d Stil frowned, studying the tear. \u201cIt\u2019s blasted hard to get a tailor talented enough to make a clothing item in which I can invest a large amount of spells\u2014like this cloak. I bought it from a Ringsted tailor when I first made apprentice\u2014I should have bought ten of them, for I haven\u2019t found another tailor as skilled since. Wretched creature,\u201d Still said, narrowing his eyes at the donkey.</p><p>Gemma patted Pricker Patch\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t comfort him; he doesn\u2019t deserve it,\u201d Stil said, flipping his hair over his shoulder. (It was long again, today. Gemma had no idea how he did it, but Stil changed hair styles\u2014and lengths\u2014at least once a day. He seemed to expect her to comment on it, so naturally she did not.)</p><p>\u201cI doubt it comforts him. I think he dislikes human touch,\u201d Gemma dryly said, stepping back to slide the tent poles off the donkey.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps normal humans, but he clearly likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? How can you tell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe looks very happy,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma stared at the donkey.</p><p>Pricker Patch looked just as cantankerous and stoic as he had since she first set eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s thrilled. He\u2019s merely skilled at hiding it,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said as she finished unpacking the tent.</p><p>Stil finished mourning his cloak and moved between Gemma and the tent. \u201cI\u2019ll set it up.\u201d</p><p>Gemma mutely backed up and patted Pricker Patch as she squinted at the horizon. \u201cI am surprised we haven\u2019t seen the soldiers, again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have a misdirection spell active, as well as a screening charm. King Torgen\u2019s men would be hard-pressed to find us. And given your unusual relationship with your guards, I imagine they are not strenuously searching you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Gemma agreed. When she turned to study Stil she noticed that his cloak\u2014normally a stark black\u2014seemed to...swirl. There were faint swirls of blue, purple, green, and even reds that crawled across his cloak as if it were rolling like an ocean. \u201cI think I finally see the magic in your cloak.\u201d</p><p>Stil looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said before glancing at his cape. He breathed an oath and dropped a tent pole. \u201cIt\u2019s leaking magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat demon donkey you\u2019re petting damaged the cloak so much it can\u2019t retain the spells anymore, and they\u2019re dripping out,\u201d Stil said, redoubling his efforts to get the tent up.</p><p>\u201cWould you picket Pricker Patch? I\u2019ve got to see if I can repair the damage and stop the leak,\u201d Stil said when the tent was almost set up.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Stil said before disappearing though the tent flap.</p><p>Pricker Patch gave one loud bray, as if sensing his triumph.</p> <p>Gemma picketed the donkey, tying his rope to one of the tent pegs. She entered the tent and made her way through the parlor to the hallway of doors. She found the small storage room Stil had shown her on their first day of traveling, where grain, carrots, apples, and hay was stored for Pricker Patch. She struggled to carry the hay through the parlor (wincing whenever flecks of alfalfa and strands of grass dropped) and threw the hay in front of the donkey. She gave the stubborn creature a carrot, and when she returned to the parlor, all traces of hay were gone.</p><p>Gemma shrugged off her new cloak\u2014one made in a style similar to Stil\u2019s but in dark green\u2014and made her way to her uncomfortably beautiful bedroom.</p><p>She pulled out the black wool cape and studied it with narrowed eyes. The cloak, to Gemma\u2019s critical gaze, was well made. The midnight-blue silk lining was perfectly joined to the black cloak with stitching so tiny and straight, it was perfect. The embroidery\u2014vine-work with the occasional leaf, all made with silver-colored thread\u2014glowed on the dark backdrop, circling the shoulders in liquid lines.</p><p>The only work left on it was to finish one embroidered leaf. But even though Gemma had used every bit of skill she had on the item and could detect no imperfection, she doubted it would meet Stil\u2019s standards.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it could hold him over, until he finds a new cloak,\u201d Gemma said, threading her needle to finish the final leaf. Her stomach growled with hunger when she finally put her needle down and trimmed away the last bit of unnecessary thread. She studied the cloak and sighed. \u201cI feel like a fool. Like a peasant offering a king a chicken,\u201d she said before folding up the cloak and draping it over her arm.</p><p>On a hunch, she made her way to the parlor and peered inside. Stil was there, stretched out on a settee. His mouth and chin were visible, but his eyes and forehead were tucked under a pillow.</p> <p>\u201cI would say we should slay the donkey and eat him for dinner, but I suspect leather would be more palatable,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cThe damage is that bad?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worse than I would like when I am in an already uncomfortable situation,\u201d Stil sighed, sitting upright. He gave Gemma a tired smile, tilting his head in interest when he noticed she carried something.</p><p>Gemma nodded and furrowed her forehead. She took a moment to rally her courage before she said, \u201cI have something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Gemma wordlessly passed the cloak to the mage.</p><p>Stil took the bundle of cloth and unfurled it. His eyes traced the embroidery, and he nudged the inner lining, examining the stitching and the hemming.</p><p>\u201cI made it,\u201d Gemma said, for the first time in her life uncomfortable with heavy silence.</p> <p>\u201cYou made this?\u201d Stil asked, briefly pulling his eyes from the cloak.</p><p>Gemma nodded. \u201cI apologize if it is not up to your usual standards, but perhaps it could serve as a temporary substitute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubstitute?\u201d Stil laughed. \u201cGemma this is\u2014it\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s perfect. You really made it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Stil shook his head. \u201cYou cannot fathom how rare it is to find something this well made, this perfect. You must have some magic in your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cSewing is not magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours practically is. Any kind of craftsmanship has touches of magic\u2014that\u2019s why items can hold magic. But this cloak, Gemma\u2014you must be a genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Gemma wryly said.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m storying you, but I\u2019m serious. It takes great talent and a masterful mind to create something like this, something that practically begs to have magic added to it,\u201d Stil said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it kill you to give up your creations?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. I sew for other people, not myself. That is the way it has always been,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if it has to do with that blasted sense of sacrifice you have. You sew for other people\u2014hah!\u201d Stil said, shaking his head. \u201cI will have to introduce you to my fellow craftmages. They will love you, and you will never have to worry again about money. You practically can spin straw into gold\u2014that is, you can make an item normally useless into a priceless treasure,\u201d Stil snorted.</p><p>Gemma shrugged, not quite believing his praise.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gemma. You have given me something so valuable it cannot be fathomed,\u201d Stil said, dragging his eyes from the cloak.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for all your help...and for using your magic on my behalf,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Stil\u2019s eyes glowed as a soft, tender smile stole across his lips. He crossed the room to stand in front of her. He slid an arm around her, scooping her against her chest, and he lowered his face\u2014his lips, more correctly\u2014towards her.</p><p>Gemma came to a realization. Stil quite possibly found her attractive.</p><p>The incoming kiss told Gemma he might actually find her more than attractive; he perhaps even liked her, or fancied her.</p><p>She immediately rejected the idea.</p> <p>It was preposterous. Magic users never fell in love with civilians. There was the occasional heart-breaking love story, where a mage or enchanter fell in love with a princess or some such nonsense, but they were rare.</p><p>No. Magic users loved other magic users. It was the rule.</p><p>Gemma, paralyzed where she stood, waited for Stil to back off to declare it all a joke.</p><p>When he was so close, she could feel his breath on her lips, Gemma exploded backwards.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking a finger at Stil as if he were a miscreant dog.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stil asked, tilting his head.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re doing, NO.\u201d</p><p>Stil tilted his head in the other direction. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d he asked, taking a step towards Gemma.</p><p>Gemma rushed to put the settee in between them. \u201cYou,\u201d she said, \u201care...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Gemma said, shaken by the ordeal. Mages didn\u2019t go around almost kissing people. It just wasn\u2019t done. Wars could be started that way!</p><p>\u201cYou are a smart girl. Try to figure it out. I think you will find there is one easy conclusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that conclusion is impossible,\u201d Gemma squeaked, scared out of her usual indifference when Stil stepped around the settee. Gemma circled it to keep it between herself and the mage.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so impossible that I should love you\u2014,\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNO!\u201d Gemma shouted.</p><p>\u201cOh, come now. You can\u2019t really think I am doing this because I\u2019m a flirt,\u201d Stil chuckled before he lunged around the settee.</p><p>Frightened by the throaty noise, Gemma fled to the far side of the room, scampering behind the second settee. \u201cMages don\u2019t fall in love with normal people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your defense, you are not normal,\u201d Stil said, strolling across the parlor.</p><p>\u201cYou...are,\u201d Gemma struggled for a moment. \u201cBlinded by your, ah, inaccessibility to other mages. What you\u2019re feeling isn\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d</p><p>Gemma was starting to get a better hold on herself and was able to bring down the octave of her voice. \u201cI thought you were acting oddly. The fine clothes and the bedroom, accompanying me to the border instead of sending me on my way like any proper storybook magician. Clearly, you are under some sort of mental strain,\u201d Gemma said, faking out Stil to make him circle around the settee again, leaving her to flee in the opposite direction.</p><p>When she was safe on the other side of the settee, she smoothed her dress and lifted her chin. \u201cLove affairs between mages and seamstresses just aren\u2019t done,\u201d she finished primly before leaping out of the way when Stil tried to pounce on her.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy else do you think I demanded your firstborn child as a payment for spinning?\u201d Stil said, carefully enunciating the words.</p><p>Gemma blinked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t love you, why would I want your firstborn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be a house-servant? I don\u2019t know! Magic folk are all eccentric. We did establish that I don\u2019t want children, so it hardly matters,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cIt matters because my required payment means if you ever change your mind, I will be your child\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>Gemma screwed up her face. \u201cYou are the most ridiculous mage\u2014,\u201d her words died on her lips as she recalled Stil\u2019s odd wording. She hadn\u2019t paid much attention\u2014mostly because she didn\u2019t particularly want children, and the idea of getting married was so far off and unlikely after all she went through it wasn\u2019t like it mattered.</p><p>But the wording. He had said, \u201cYour firstborn child will be mine.\u201d</p><p>Gemma narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou,\u201d she growled.</p><p>Stil\u2019s eyebrows popped up. \u201cSo, now you\u2019re mad?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf COURSE I\u2019m mad, you sneaky, conniving, mage!\u201d Gemma said, whipping a pillow at the craftmage.</p><p>\u201cI must say I pictured many reactions when I confessed my love to you. Rage was not one of them,\u201d Stil said, ducking the pillow.</p><p>\u201cHow could you do this!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are we shouting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW!\u201d</p><p>There was a creak, and Stil and Gemma turned to face the front door.</p><p>A woman stood in the doorway. The most beautiful woman in the world, in fact. Stil was handsome, but this woman had such great beauty it made Gemma\u2019s soul hurt just to look at her.</p><p>The woman wore an opalescent dress that was in the process of changing from a shade of pale green to a pale blue. \u201cI seem to have caught you at a bad time,\u201d she said in a voice that was so lovely it was breathtaking. \u201cI\u2019ll just go for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back in an hour,\u201d Stil said.</p> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d Gemma called, instantly recognizing the woman for who she must be\u2014a magic user. Gemma rushed across the parlor. \u201cYou must be here to see Stil. I apologize for our loud discussion, but you have not interrupted anything. Please, come in. Can I get you something to drink?\u201d Gemma asked, angling to get out of the room and as far away from Stil as possible.</p><p>To her shock, the beautiful woman stared at her for a moment before bursting into tears\u2014still looking breathtaking and gorgeous as tears spilled down her cheeks.</p><p>Gemma helplessly looked to Stil, who hurried forward, his forehead creased with worry. He slid an arm around the beautiful woman\u2019s back to guide her to a settee. When she was seated, he crouched in front of her. \u201cAngelique, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Gemma carefully carried a full tea tray down the hallway, pausing when she reached the parlor door. It was cracked, and she could hear the conversation taking place inside.</p><p>\u201cI hate crying,\u201d the beautiful woman\u2014Stil had called her Angelique\u2014sniffed. \u201cIt\u2019s so useless, and it only serves to make a person damp and weary,\u201d she said before crying again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m certain that after all you\u2019ve gone through, and after all you\u2019ve done, you deserve a good cry,\u201d Stil said, his voice soft. The craftmage was silent as the beautiful woman cried harder. It wasn\u2019t the gentle sniff she made with her beautiful tears earlier. It was the sound of a person\u2019s heart breaking.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find him, Stil,\u201d Angelique cried. \u201cI have looked everywhere and combed every country, and I haven\u2019t found a hint of him! I even forced my way to Ringsted to see if he was carried down there. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t! I haven\u2019t any place left to look! I have tracked him with magic; I have looked for him in enchanted mirrors; and I have even tried to use our bond as master and apprentice. Nothing works! He might be\u2014,\u201d</p><p>Dead.</p><p>Although the beautiful magic user couldn\u2019t bring herself to say it, even Gemma could feel the word hanging in the air.</p><p>\u201cI hate to mention this, but it must be connected to the evil and darkness that has been stirring across the continent,\u201d Stil said. \u201cThe attacks against the countries and royalty are too well done to be coincidence. Whoever is responsible for this has been planning it for years. It is very likely they knew Enchanter Evariste needed to be removed before they could launch their first attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seem to be doing a fine job of sabotaging themselves,\u201d Angelique said, her voice growing stronger as her tears stopped. \u201cEvery blasted country I run into has someone cursed\u2014a curse which can be broken by true love.\u201d</p> <p>Judging by the scornful tone of Angelique\u2019s voice, the subject was a safe one to intrude upon, so Gemma nudged the door open wider and carried the tea tray into the parlor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sick of true love, the very thought makes me ill,\u201d Angelique said. The beautiful lady was seated on a settee. Stil stood next to her, his arms folded across his chest.</p><p>\u201cI know love is the most powerful, righteous emotion possible, but this is sheer folly,\u201d Angelique continued. \u201cThe number of curses that have popped up in the past few years with love as the counter-agent is mind-boggling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does seem rather odd that such a wide-spread campaign to spread darkness would have such a specific, repeatable weakness,\u201d Stil said, smiling at Gemma when she set the tea tray down. \u201cOne would think they would grow aware of this detail and change their arrangement.\u201d</p><p>Gemma ignored him and served Angelique a cup of black tea.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Even if we manage to break the curses, I still wouldn\u2019t say we are winning,\u201d Angelique dully said. She shook her head and remembered her manners. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said to Gemma with a serene smile, taking the teacup and saucer.</p><p>\u201cAye. There are plenty of predicaments that have yet to be addressed,\u201d Stil said. \u201cThe Sole Princess, the Princesses of Farset, someone must take care of Kozlovka, and so on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma moved to slip out of the parlor, but before she could leave the tea tray behind, Stil caught her wrist and anchored her to the spot.</p><p>Gemma tried to discreetly pull, unwilling to ruin the conversation but eager to leave the delusional Stil. His grip was as malleable as iron.</p><p>\u201cIt gets worse,\u201d Angelique sighed wearily. \u201cRingsted is plagued by a sea witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stil blinked, surprise and unease coloring his voice.</p> <p>Angelique nodded. \u201cThe selkies are trying to take care of her, but the humans are proving to be more of a hindrance than a help,\u201d she sighed and sipped her tea. \u201cI ran into a selkie that was forcibly landed\u2014some terrible man stole her pelt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe feared he would make her use her powers over water for ill and asked me to seal her voice. I didn\u2019t want to take it forever, so I gave her the only escape contract I have learned to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue love?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>\u201cAs usual,\u201d Angelique said with some bitterness to her voice. \u201cI meant to stay and help her, but I needed to be in Sole for the Princess\u2019s birthday, and I was forced to leave her. I meant to return to Ringsted with Blanche and Rein, but then I received word that you were in trouble,\u201d Angelique said, offering Stil a smile. Her eyes flicked curiously to Gemma, and Stil moved.</p> <p>\u201cAh, please forgive my terrible manners. Allow me to introduce you with great pleasure to Gemma Kielland, one of the most talented seamstresses in the continent. Gemma, this is Enchantress Angelique\u2014one of the highest ranked magic users in the Veneno Conclave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d Gemma said, curtseying.</p><p>\u201cI am charmed, Gemma,\u201d Angelique said with a smile as caressing as silk. \u201cAlthough, I fear Stil has mislead you: I am only an enchantress in training.\u201d</p><p>Stil heaved a disgusted sigh worthy of Pricker Patch. \u201cEveryone knows you have the capabilities. It\u2019s is merely that with Enchanter Evariste...missing, he cannot bring you to the Conclave and declare you. You\u2019re an enchantress, Angelique.\u201d</p><p>Angelique delicately shook her head. \u201cIf I was ready to be an enchantress I would know more ways to counter curses besides using love,\u201d she said. She watched Gemma try to pull her hand from Stil\u2019s grasp without success. \u201cI received your letter. You said you were being followed?\u201d Angelique asked.</p><p>\u201cHunted, really,\u201d Stil said. \u201cBy a hellhound and a rider mounted on a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Angelique\u2019s teacup clicked when she set it down abruptly. \u201cWhat? How can this be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand why, either,\u201d Stil said. \u201cBut it\u2019s why I fled to Verglas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were smart to do so,\u201d Angelique said, knitting her fingers together as she thought. \u201cIs the rider chasing you as well?\u201d Angelique asked, looking to Gemma.</p><p>\u201cNo. Absolutely not,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cGemma is fleeing the country with me. She\u2019s in a spot of trouble with King Torgen,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cAh, him,\u201d Angelique said knowingly.</p><p>\u201cWith all respect, Craftmage Stil, you were going to take me to the border, and then we were going to part ways,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but now we don\u2019t have to. Angelique will take care of the rider for me, won\u2019t you?\u201d Stil said, turning to the beautiful enchantress.</p> <p>Angelique sighed. \u201cSometimes you overestimate my capabilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. If your learned magic fails, you will just have to rely on your core magic. The rider is no match for that,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cCore magic?\u201d Gemma asked, too curious to let the comment pass her.</p><p>\u201cEnchanters are the highest rank of magic user there is,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>Gemma nodded.</p><p>\u201cThis is because we are able to use two types of magic: core magic and learned magic. Core magic is something all magic users have. It is what decides their focus. Stil\u2019s core magic is craft related. Weather mages have weather core magic, and so on. All enchanters and enchantresses have core magic as well\u2014although the kind and strength varies from enchanter to enchanter. It is our learned magic that gives us a higher rank. Learned magic\u2014things like curse breaking, enchantments, working with elements, charms, general magic\u2014are things only enchanters and enchantresses display the ability to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor instance, no matter how hard I study, I can never control rain,\u201d Stil said. \u201cBut Angelique\u2014to a certain extent\u2014can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cThere are checks and balances of course,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cAs an enchantress, I will never be as powerful in weather magic as a weather mage. And no enchanters are capable of infusing magic into weapons like Stil is\u2014although that is to be expected as he is a genius in his core magic,\u201d Angelique smiled.</p><p>The embarrassed smile Stil exposed made Gemma pause. She looked back and forth between Angelique and Stil as she realized, Angelique is the person who taught him about the obligation to help those in need. She is the magic user that is precious to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma wryly lifted an eyebrow. In love with me, indeed. Now that the original is here, there is no need to settle for a lesser, like me.</p><p>\u201cEnchanters and enchantresses generally have highly specialized types of core magic, too, and they are typically very powerful,\u201d Stil added. \u201cAngelique\u2019s Master is considered to be one of the greatest magic users since the Snow Queen. He was the youngest enchanter ever approved,\u201d Stil added. \u201cBut we are getting off topic. Angelique, I know you can destroy the rider with your core magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if I was approved to use my core magic. The Conclave still hasn\u2019t agreed to it,\u201d Angelique said. For Gemma\u2019s benefit she added, \u201cMy apprenticeship was and continues to be unusual because my core magic makes most...squeamish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said, politely refraining from further questions.</p> <p>\u201cRegardless, I am certain I could drive the rider off for a time,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cAlthough we will have to be careful. The forest is crawling with soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re King Torgen\u2019s men. At first I thought they were the followers you referred to in your letter, Stil. But now I suppose they are searching for you, Gemma?\u201d Angelique asked.</p><p>Gemma shifted uncomfortably. \u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>Angelique smiled. \u201cDo not worry yourself over it. You are safe in Stil\u2019s home, and the border is but a short ride away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it? That\u2019s a relief,\u201d Stil said. \u201cIt feels like molasses runs faster than Pricker Patch is willing to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Pegasus can speak sense into him, although I fear he is growing to be just as ornery as your donkey,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cThe time away from Master Evariste has been hard on him.\u201d</p><p>Stil shrugged. \u201cPets,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, it would appear we are here for the night, so we should enjoy it. Tonight we will have a feast,\u201d Stil promised.</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d Angelique smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt will take me a while to get everything ready. Do you need to see to Pegasus or anything?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but if you do not mind, I think I would like...rest for a while,\u201d Angelique said, standing up.</p> <p>\u201cCertainly. Any of the rooms are open\u2014except mine and the frost room,\u201d Stil said, finally releasing Gemma. \u201cTake all the time you need,\u201d he added, calling over his shoulder as he left the parlor.</p><p>\u201cExcept for...Gemma, are you in the last room in the hallway?\u201d Angelique asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Angelique said, her eyes wide. She turned a thoughtful eye on Gemma and studied her from head to toe. \u201cI\u2019m glad you are so lovely. If you will excuse me, I will see you at our banquet.\u201d</p><p>When the enchantress left, Gemma stood, alone, in the parlor, trying to organize her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m lovely?\u201d she snorted. She shook her head and looked around the room for the cape she made Stil. She didn\u2019t see it\u2014he must have carried it off or stowed it while she was fetching tea.</p><p>Recalling the cape made Gemma, unfortunately, recall Stil\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a phase,\u201d she decided. \u201cNow that Angelique has joined us, he will stop this foolishness.</p><p>\u201cSo, how long have you known Stil?\u201d Angelique asked.</p> <p>Gemma and Angelique were seated at a table in a dining room Gemma didn\u2019t previously know existed. They had just finished the massive amount of food Stil\u2014or, more correctly, Stil\u2019s magical kitchen\u2014had prepared for them. The craftmage was off getting dessert. Gemma didn\u2019t think she had any room to spare, and she thought they had already eaten dessert between the fresh fruits, candied nuts, and pastries, but Stil insisted she eat more.</p><p>So, Gemma and Angelique sat together, waiting for Stil to return.</p><p>It was a little awkward, truth be told.</p><p>\u201cA few weeks,\u201d Gemma said, clasping her hands in her lap. \u201cAnd you, Lady Enchantress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost track of the time, but years. Would you like to know more?\u201d the beautiful enchantress asked.</p><p>Lacking any other discussion topics, Gemma nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy Master and I were traveling when we found Stil in a market in Baris. He was a youngster\u2014twelve or thirteen I believe\u2014and was selling stone beads. My Master recognized him for what he was and tried to get him to leave with us, but Stil was suspicious of him,\u201d Angelique said, pausing to take a sip of wine.</p><p>Gemma nodded again to show she was listening.</p><p>\u201cEventually, my Master realized Stil found me less intimidating and instructed me to talk him around. I...managed it. We brought him to the school at the Veneno Conclave where he proved to be a veritable genius at craft magic,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>Is she trying to show that she knows him better? Or that she has first preference? That is silly. I am not in a position to be competition. I better make that clear.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cIt is obvious you have a bright relationship with Mage Stil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriendship,\u201d Angelique corrected. \u201cI flatter myself to say I am like an older sister to him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Gemma said, shaking her head. \u201cHe cares for you much more than as a sister.\u201d</p><p>Angelique smiled. \u201cI fear my crying episode earlier gave you the wrong impression. I treasure Stil\u2019s friendship, but that is all we have,\u201d she said, taking another sip of her wine.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that is all you think you have,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Angelique choked on her wine and coughed, placing her hand on her chest.</p> <p>\u201cRight! The tarts finally set\u2014what happened?\u201d Stil asked, blowing into the room, carrying a number of tarts on a silver platter.</p><p>Angelique tried to speak but could only cough.</p><p>\u201cI was clearing up a miscommunication,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Angelique gave Gemma a look of horror.</p><p>Unsure to interpret whether that meant her guess was correct and Angelique wanted more, or that her guess was dead wrong on Angelique\u2019s end, she shrugged at the enchantress.</p> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d Stil said, putting the platter down on the table.</p><p>\u201cAs marvelous as all this food was, I find that I am simply exhausted, and I must beg your pardon and excuse myself,\u201d Angelique said, daintily yawning when she recovered. \u201cThank you, Stil. The food was outstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed it,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she have to eat dessert?\u201d Gemma asked as Stil set three different tarts on a pewter plate in front of her.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t care what she does,\u201d Stil said, tapping the end of Gemma\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed conversing with you, Gemma. I will see both of you in the morning,\u201d Angelique said with another one of her beautiful smiles.</p> <p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Stil said before Angelique disappeared through the door. \u201cThat was excellent timing,\u201d he said, picking up his chair from the head of the table and placing it directly next to Gemma\u2019s.</p><p>Gemma shifted her chair down. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause now we can talk. We never did finish our earlier conversation,\u201d Stil said, inching his chair closer.</p><p>Gemma shifted her chair farther down the table again. \u201cI don\u2019t recall there being anything to talk about. You were obviously under a lot of pressure, but now the Lady Enchantress is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma, I\u2019m not a rare animal. I don\u2019t undergo metamorphosis if I\u2019m not near other magic users. The truth is, I don\u2019t really like many magic users,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true; you like the Lady Enchantress Angelique,\u201d Gemma said. She realized that might sound like jealousy, so she quickly added, \u201cWhich is to be expected. She\u2019s lovely, and I think you two would do quite well together.\u201d</p><p>Stil snorted. \u201cI am not in love with Angelique. I\u2019m in love with you,\u201d he said, scooting closer.</p><p>Gemma pushed her chair away. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not proper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I am not a magic user.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no rule that mages can only love fellow mages. Even if there was, your work is beautiful enough, I think it\u2019s fairly obvious you have a faint strain of magic in your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so, it still wouldn\u2019t be proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Stil asked, butting his chair up against Gemma\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the age difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAge difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Surely you can\u2019t be a day younger than fifty or sixty,\u201d Gemma said in surprise.</p><p>Stil\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>At his outraged expression, Gemma tried to shift her chair but found she was stuck against a table leg.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m an old man?!\u201d Stil thundered.</p><p>\u201cMost magic users are not the age they physically appear to be,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cAnd it is well known that they age much more slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m an OLD MAN?!\u201d he repeated, his voice even louder.</p><p>Gemma frowned and lost her fake pleasant edge. \u201cYou dress...uniquely, and you went through the schooling. That must have taken at least a decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even twenty-five yet, you mean-spirited mule, and my clothes are fashionable among mages!\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma rolled her eyes. \u201cNow you sound like you are talking to Pricker Patch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI very well may be for all the attention you give me!\u201d Stil said. \u201cThis whole time you\u2019ve thought I am OLD?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t remove your hood until a few days ago. I had no idea what you looked like\u2014or even if your appearance would represent your proper age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the enchanters and enchantresses who never seem to age. I\u2019m a craftmage! I will outlive you by a little, but only by decade or two! You thought I was OLD?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the impression that offends you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIT DOES.\u201d</p><p>Gemma only lifted her eyebrows and prodded a tart.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to apologize?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor thinking I\u2019m OLD!\u201d</p><p>Gemma shrugged. \u201cIt seems you have only yourself to blame for that misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>Stil glowered and stabbed a tart with a knife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you are not yet twenty-five, and if Lady Enchantress Angelique met you with her master when you were twelve or thirteen, you must be freshly out of the Conclave school,\u201d Gemma observed.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you are accusing me of being a green mage! No. I went through the schooling system quite quickly and finished my apprenticeship by the time I was eighteen,\u201d Stil said, his voice wry but at a much lower volume.</p><p>\u201cImpressive. You must be the genius the Lady Enchantress says you are.\u201d</p><p>Stil ran a hand through his feathered, black hair\u2014it was short again\u2014and sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know about genius. I would reserve that word for people like Angelique\u2019s master enchanter, Evariste. It is true, though, that I am the most gifted craftmage in the past few decades. Possibly the century. Which isn\u2019t quite as impressive as it sounds. Craft magic is useful for luxuries\u2014protection charms in jewelry, clothes spelled to dazzle, that kind of thing\u2014and for everyday work\u2014like wagon wheels spelled to last extra long or wood furniture charmed to resist fire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut when one reaches your level, your usefulness expands,\u201d Gemma guessed.</p><p>Stil reluctantly nodded. \u201cI can place higher-level charms and magic into objects, and I am one of a few living craftmages who can spell weapons.\u201d</p><p>Gemma narrowed her eyes. \u201cIf others can spell weapons, why would Angelique call you a genius?\u201d</p><p>Stil made a face at Gemma. \u201cI don\u2019t like to boast,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I can bespell weapons faster with higher spells and at a greater rate than anyone else. I could spend a day spelling a hundred weapons to hold lightning magic. The other mages would take an hour just to produce one or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you could outfit an army,\u201d Gemma said.</p> <p>Stil shrugged. \u201cIf I chose to. Most members of nobility are unaware of that particular skill of mine. They treasure me for spelled jewelry and clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it would explain why you are being hunted.\u201d</p><p>Stil blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could supply spelled weapons for an entire army in a matter of days, that would make you a great threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo this plague of darkness you spoke of. You said Angelique\u2019s master was done away with by the masterminds, yes? Wouldn\u2019t it be plausible that they know of your abilities and realized that if war is declared, your skills would give us a significant advantage?\u201d Gemma asked.</p> <p>Stil was a frozen statue. He didn\u2019t blink, even when Gemma shifted, attempting to untangle her chair from his.</p><p>\u201cYou are right,\u201d he said. \u201cGemma, you are brilliant!\u201d</p><p>Gemma shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how you missed it before.\u201d</p><p>Stil abruptly stood, pushing his chair away. \u201cI need to tell Angelique this. I hadn\u2019t thought of the possibility of actual war, but if they are planning for it, there is much to be done,\u201d he said before glancing down at Gemma. \u201cDon\u2019t think our conversation about my love for you is over.\u201d</p><p>Gemma raised an eyebrow. \u201cI expect you will come to your senses eventually.\u201d</p><p>Stil chuckled and swooped in, quickly kissing Gemma on her cheek. \u201cSleep well. Thank you, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not your darling!\u201d Gemma said to his retreating back.</p><p>The mage only laughed and disappeared through the door.</p> <p>Gemma scrubbed at her cheek and tried a tart. \u201cDelicious,\u201d she said, scrubbing her cheek harder when she could feel her face heating up. She cast an apprehensive look at the door through which Stil had disappeared and shook her head. \u201cHe will learn. No mage would love a poor seamstress with a drunk for a father. It\u2019s just not possible.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you do not want to ride Pegasus with me, Gemma? The border is but a short distance away. We are nearly there,\u201d Angelique said, seated on her unusual mount.</p><p>The equine\u2014Gemma found it difficult to call it a horse\u2014had a horse-like body structure and face, but its shape was oddly fathomless thanks to its fur. The animal looked like a portion of the night sky was removed to fashion its body, for it was blue-black like night, and there were star formations dappling its hide. Eerily, its mane and tail were not made of strands of hair, but more closely resembled black and blue flames.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you,\u201d Gemma said, laying a hand on Pricker Patch\u2019s neck for reassurance.</p><p>The glowering donkey ignored the touch and plowed forward through the light dusting of snow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pet him too much, Gemma, or Pricker Patch will be too deliriously happy to eat tonight,\u201d Stil said, adjusting his cape\u2014the cape Gemma made for him.</p><p>Gemma eyed the stoic donkey whose expression hadn\u2019t budged. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStil is right,\u201d Angelique said from the back of her unnatural mount. \u201cI have never seen Pricker Patch so content before,\u201d she said as her dress changed into the same deep blue/purple color as the sky was taking on while the sun sank farther over the horizon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stil squinted at the darkening horizon, or what could be seen of it through the few mountains that jutted up into the sky. \u201cWe will confront the rider tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I will leave soon after. Pegasus runs better at night, and I must tell the Conclave of Gemma\u2019s observations,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cSo, you think it\u2019s true?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think Stil is being targeted for his unique skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Normally, one would not think of Stil as being a threat. He hasn\u2019t the fire power of some other mages. But if one is looking at widespread war that will cause countries to form an alliance...Stil would have a larger impact than any single enchanter,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhen Angelique and I go face the rider, Gemma, I ask that you remain at camp,\u201d Stil piped in. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a battle, and I fear the rider would attack you,\u201d he said, reaching over Pricker Patch\u2019s neck to smooth Gemma\u2019s wavy hair.</p><p>Gemma fixed her hair when Stil finished. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cYou agree so easily?\u201d Angelique asked as her mount pinned its ears and shook its head.</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cMy survival instincts are quite strong, and I know I have few\u2014or perhaps even no\u2014skills of combat. It would be safer for me to remain as far away as possible. Besides, someone must see that Pricker Patch and...,\u201d</p><p>\u201cPegasus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPricker Patch and Pegasus are fed and watered,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cGood. And thank you,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Angelique laughed. \u201cI like her, Stil. You\u2019ve chosen well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Stil glowed.</p><p>Gemma sighed loudly.</p><p>\u201cAlthough the lady does not seem joyous,\u201d Angelique added, struggling with her mount, who pranced with impatience.</p><p>\u201cI will wear her down,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma raised her eyebrows.</p><p>After a few more minutes of travel\u2014when it was barely light enough to still see\u2014Stil called a halt. \u201cWe\u2019ll pitch the tent here,\u201d Stil said. \u201cEven after Angelique clears the rider off, I\u2019m not keen to sleep in a realm outside the Snow Queen\u2019s protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will you go tomorrow?\u201d Angelique asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Stil admitted, unpacking the tent from Pricker Patch\u2019s back.</p> <p>\u201cI suggest you go to Loire and seek out Prince Severin and Princess Elle,\u201d Angelique said. \u201cThough Severin\u2019s curse is broken, I feel out of all the royals in the continent, he has the best understanding of what we are up against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should offer my services to him,\u201d Stil said as he started piecing the tent together.</p><p>Angelique nodded. \u201cHe and Princess Elle recently hosted Crown Prince Cristoph and Princess Cinderella\u2014although by now she is almost Queen Cinderella\u2014of Erlauf. I believe he meant to speak to them about their goblin infestation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he\u2019s starting to organize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen as long as Gemma has no objections, I think we will call upon the Price and Princess,\u201d Stil said, looking to Gemma.</p><p>\u201cDo they live in Noyers?\u201d Gemma asked, naming the capital of Loire.</p><p>\u201cNo. They live in a chateau that is quite close, though, since the roads have been repaired,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>Gemma nodded. \u201cI would like to travel to Loire.\u201d</p><p>Stil finished pitching the tent and studied her with narrowed eyes. \u201cYou plan to abandon me for Noyers.\u201d</p><p>Gemma pressed her lips together.</p><p>\u201cYou will be able to find work there, but you will be safer with me,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cThis I doubt so long as you are sought out by darkness,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Angelique laughed as she slid from her mount\u2019s back. \u201cShe has you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I will be going to see Prince Severin and Princess Elle. She sets all the fashions for Loire. Don\u2019t you want to see her?\u201d Stil tempted.</p><p>Gemma softened her stance as she considered the idea. As much as Gemma would love to see Princess Elle, there was also the business of getting a glimpse of Prince Severin. Lady Linnea will throttle me if I pass on an opportunity to meet one of her military heroes.</p><p>\u201cThink about it. In the meantime, Angelique and I must leave to get rid of my stalker. Go inside and warm up before you bother with Pricker Patch. He can wait to have his dinner,\u201d Stil said, sliding one arm around Gemma\u2019s waist to force her closer to him. He used his free hand to take one of Gemma\u2019s mittened hands and placed it on his face.</p><p>Gemma exhaled loudly to voice her lack of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI hope you can wear her down before you both die of old age,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>Stil scowled. \u201cThank you for the show of support, Angelique,\u201d he said before smiling at Gemma. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said before kissing her on the center of her hair-band.</p><p>After a moment, he was gone, taking his heat with him.</p><p>\u201cHow on earth do you stay warm in that dress?\u201d Stil asked as Angelique took a white muff from the single bag she had slung over her mount\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s spelled. Master Evariste got it for me,\u201d Angelique said as they started out for the border.</p><p>\u201cHm. Spared no expense for his apprentice, did he?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnough, Stil,\u201d Angelique said before she and the craftmage fell out of hearing range.</p><p>Gemma watched them go, pressing her lips together in worry. \u201cThey will be alright,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her reverie was broken by Pricker Patch, who stomped his hooves.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m going. I\u2019ll bring hay for the...guest too,\u201d Gemma said, glancing at Angelique\u2019s unusual animal.</p> <p>Gemma ignored Stil\u2019s orders and immediately fetched hay and a bit of grain for both of the equines.</p><p>Pricker Patch ate his hay with delight\u2014or as much delight as the stoic donkey ever showed\u2014and Pegasus lipped his and shook it around. When it became apparent he wasn\u2019t going to eat it, Gemma gave the extra hay to Pricker Patch and tried feeding the strange horse grain instead.</p><p>He ate that, and Gemma had just tempted him into drinking lukewarm water when there was a loud explosion that shook the ground.</p><p>Pegasus launched into motion, rearing and snorting with a noise that was even less horse-like than his body. Gemma jumped backwards and yelped.</p><p>Pricker Patch ate his hay.</p> <p>Gemma retreated to Pricker Patch\u2019s side and leaned against him for warmth and support. Darkness fell like a suffocating mantle, and Gemma dug in her pockets for one of the seven or eight starfires Stil had given her.</p><p>\u201cShine,\u201d she whispered to the prism. The crystal glowed, bathing the makeshift camp in soft, white light.</p><p>It was several minutes\u2014several very long minutes\u2014before Gemma saw the spot of light through the trees that was Angelique\u2019s glowing dress.</p><p>\u201cBrighter,\u201d Gemma said to the prism as the magic users approached. Its fire kindled again; its light shone brighter.</p><p>\u201cHow did it go?\u201d Gemma asked when Angelique and Stil drew close enough.</p><p>Stil clasped his hands over his head and shook them. \u201cVictory!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe exaggerates,\u201d Angelique said, removing one of her hands from her white muff to touch her hair. \u201cI did not manage to eradicate the rider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you landed him an exceptional wound,\u201d Stil said. \u201cHe ran away with his tail tucked between his legs to recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cPositive. Well done, Angelique. You didn\u2019t even have to use your core magic,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the better. The Conclave is still mad at me about Arcainia,\u201d Angelique said before she boosted herself onto her mount\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cWait, you\u2019re leaving already?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cI said I would leave tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t coming inside at all? Don\u2019t you want a bit of supper?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing would delight me more, but great haste is required at the moment,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it seem that you don\u2019t want to be alone with me?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>\u201cI could make tea,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Angelique smiled, stealing Gemma\u2019s breath with her beauty. \u201cYou are too kind, but I must refuse. Don\u2019t worry. He won\u2019t eat you alive,\u201d she said, turning her horse in a circle.</p><p>Gemma said nothing but laid her head against Pricker Patch\u2019s thick neck.</p><p>\u201cWait a moment, Angelique. I have something for you,\u201d Stil said, disappearing into the tent. When he emerged, he carried the black cloak he used to wear. He passed it up to the beautiful enchantress.</p><p>\u201cYour cloak?\u201d Angelique blinked. \u201cI noticed you have a new one, but...,\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the magic is drained from it,\u201d Stil admitted. \u201cBut it still has a few good spells left in the cloth that you might find useful\u2014invisibility, heat and cooling charms, and fire resistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Thank you,\u201d Angelique said, her voice warm with affection as she tucked the cloak into her saddlebag with her muff.</p><p>Stil bowed at the waist. \u201cSafe journeys,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTo you, as well. I look forward to the next time we meet\u2014that includes you, Gemma,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Farewell,\u201d Angelique said before leaning over her horse\u2019s neck. Pegasus leapt forward into a canter. He seemed to glow as he ran, resembling a comet the way his fiery tail streamed behind him.</p><p>Stil and Gemma watched until the horse and rider disappeared.</p><p>When they were gone, Stil turned to smile at Gemma. \u201cI see you are using a starfire. How do you like them?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>\u201cDim,\u201d Gemma said to the prism, which grew dimmer in response. \u201cQuite a bit. They are very useful. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Stil shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just a trinket, but I\u2019m glad you like them.\u201d</p><p>The craftmage was quiet as he ran his hands over Pricker Patch and checked the donkey\u2019s feet. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re coming to Loire with me,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t yet agreed to call upon their majesties Prince Severin and Princess Elle,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cI am choosing to thank you in advance. Or, I will stay with you in Noyers as long as it takes to convince you to travel with me,\u201d Stil said. The silver embroidery on his shoulders glowed in the moonlight and the dim illumination of Gemma\u2019s starfire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma pet Pricker Patch.</p><p>\u201cNo complaints? I am already gaining ground,\u201d Stil said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI am nothing but a phase,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cWhen we rejoin the rest of the continent, you will forget Verglas and everything related to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Stil said. \u201cAnd I will be level with you: I find your complete lack of faith in my fidelity hurtful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are a mage\u2014a very wealthy one, I might add,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still a human, Gemma. I still have a heart and breathe like a man. See?\u201d Stil said, plucking her mittened hand off Pricker Patch and sliding it under his black, wool cape.</p><p>Gemma couldn\u2019t feel his heartbeat, but she felt his chest rise and fall with each breath he took.</p><p>\u201cIs it me?\u201d Stil asked, his eyes narrowed, his head tilted. \u201cAm I lacking in some way? Is it something about me?\u201d</p><p>Gemma shook her head once.</p> <p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>Gemma lifted her icy eyes to meet Stil\u2019s searing blue gaze. \u201cMy life has taught me that I cannot expect happy endings.\u201d</p><p>No sooner were the words out of Gemma\u2019s mouth than a piercing scream flooded the air.</p><p>Gemma whipped around, pulling her hand from Stil\u2019s grasp. \u201cThat was Angelique,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cImpossible. Angelique must already be at least two miles from here. There isn\u2019t a horse alive than can keep pace with Pegasus,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cThat was her voice,\u201d Gemma argued. \u201cI haven\u2019t known her for long, and even I recognized it as hers.\u201d</p> <p>By the dim light the starfire shed, Gemma could see the unease in Stil\u2019s eyes. He was worried about her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s investigate,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying here,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cYou said the rider is taken care of. There is no danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is less danger, but it hasn\u2019t all disappeared. Verglas is still crawling with soldiers,\u201d Stil argued.</p><p>\u201cAngelique\u2019s scream was surely past the border. We\u2019re wasting time,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cIt may be a trap,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cI can bet you it\u2019s a trap,\u201d Gemma agreed. \u201cBut are you willing to chance it that Angelique is unharmed?\u201d</p> <p>Still inhaled and fussed with his sleeves as he thought. \u201cFine. Let me grab supplies from inside, and we can go,\u201d he said, disappearing into the tent.</p><p>Gemma picketed Pricker Patch to a tent pole and dragged the water to his side. \u201cBe good. Guard the camp,\u201d she said.</p><p>The donkey flicked an ear but kept eating his hay.</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d Stil said, reappeared with a length of rope hanging from his elbow. \u201cWould you put out your starfire? I would prefer to approach the situation undetected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Gemma said, shaking the starfire to clear away the light. When it stopped glowing, she slipped it back in a pocket on the side of her cape. It clinked like glass when it landed on several other starfires.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Stil said, holding his cape out after pulling up his hood.</p><p>Gemma frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to cover both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d Stil promised. When he dropped the cloth over Gemma, she felt warmer\u2014as though she were standing with her back to the fire\u2014and was able to see through the black silk lining and wool cape as if it were made of gauze even though she knew it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIs this the invisibility you mentioned to Angelique?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Stil affirmed. \u201cWe still leave a scent to track, not to mention foot prints, but it is better than nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far away did the scream sound?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain. I imagine it is over the Loire border, though,\u201d Stil said, guiding them through the trees so they stayed in the shadows but didn\u2019t brush any foliage or greenery to give away their position. Looking back, Gemma could occasionally see their footprints if the moonlight landed just so, but it was dark, and they were creeping soundlessly. She doubted anyone would see their path.</p><p>They moved slowly, creeping their way closer and closer in the direction from which they heard the scream. They had nearly turned the wrong way when they heard the scream again.</p><p>\u201cAngelique,\u201d Stil whispered.</p><p>Though she couldn\u2019t see his face, Gemma felt all of Stil\u2019s muscles stiffen in worry.</p><p>\u201cYou must really care for her,\u201d Gemma whispered. Her slowness to speak was gone, burned away by the concern lining Stil\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d Stil said. \u201cOr maybe it was when I first met her and was enrolled in the Conclave\u2019s school. She saved me, you know? But I haven\u2019t thought of her in that way in years,\u201d Stil said. \u201cI outgrew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you will outgrow me,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stil said, his voice soft and patient. \u201cI was a child back then. Now, I am a grown man. My love for you is far different and far greater.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to discuss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but I don\u2019t know when you will discuss it\u2014\u201d Stil hushed himself when a branch snapped somewhere past the wall of pine trees along which they crept. Stil peeled back the cape long enough to show Gemma his finger pressed to his lips before he drew her back in the depths of the cloak.</p><p>They crouched and crawled under the tree branches, careful not to scrape anything or make a noise. They made it through the tree wall and squinted in the darkness. Gemma didn\u2019t see the tell-tale glow of Angelique\u2019s dress anywhere. Perhaps the Lady Enchantress had already escaped?</p><p>Stil and Gemma took two steps into the dark clearing before the hellhound jumped them from behind. The animal pounced on Stil, knocking Gemma out of the warmth of the craftmage\u2019s cape and into the cold snow. Gemma gasped at the temperature change and the jarring pain in her knees and arms from catching herself, but she scrambled to her feet.</p> <p>The hellhound had Stil pinned beneath him, its giant claws digging into Stil\u2019s shoulders\u2014but oddly not piercing through the cloth of Stil\u2019s cape as it lowered is massive head. Stil caught the thing by the throat and jaws, keeping it from snapping at his face.</p><p>While the two struggled, Gemma tucked her chin and ran. She rammed into the hellhound\u2019s side, knocking the beast off Stil.</p><p>\u201cCudere,\u201d Stil shouted, his voice hoarse as he tossed a metal bar into the air. He grabbed Gemma\u2019s arm and dragged her to the side, barely moving aside in time to miss the hellhound lunging at their legs.</p><p>\u201cBlaze!\u201d Stil said before he caught his bar\u2014which had transformed into a double tipped spear while in the air. Gemma couldn\u2019t say she noticed how or when. The spear glowed with the intensity of lightning. It crackled as Stil swiped it through the air, narrowing missing the hellhound.</p><p>The beast leap backwards and growled. Its hackles raised as it crouched on the ground.</p> <p>And then Angelique screamed again.</p><p>A nightmareish horse skulked into the clearing. Its eyes were milky white; its nostrils flared red, and it was thin and wretched looking.</p><p>On its back was a rider clothed in black with a hood shadowing its face. He\u2014or it\u2014had a grievous chest wound that oozed a black, tarry substance, and its breath came in pained wheezes. The rider held a small orb of black fire, and when it squeezed the fire, the scream was produced.</p><p>Angelique wasn\u2019t injured at all. It was a trick to draw Stil across the border.</p><p>\u201cGemma, run back Verglas,\u201d Stil whispered as he stepped between Gemma and the black creatures. \u201cGet to the tent. Stay there until daylight. Then send word for Angelique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContact her yourself,\u201d Gemma hissed, picking up a large rock.</p> <p>\u201cGemma, I can\u2019t protect you. I\u2019m not the right kind of mage!\u201d he said before bringing his spear up to take a blow from the hellhound. He twisted, using momentum and his weight to send the beast flying.</p><p>\u201cThen we run together,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Stil mirthlessly laughed. \u201cFine. Stay close,\u201d he said, twirling his spear.</p><p>There was no exchange of insults with the rider. There was no attempt to reason or speak because there was no need. As Gemma stared at the cloaked figure, she could feel nothing but evil and an endless thirst for bloodshed. The rider could not be reasoned with. He and his beasts were made entirely of darkness. Stil fought the hellhound, alternating between blinding the beast with his weapon and driving it away with his spear. The dog snarled, foam dripping from its mouth as it blindly lunged at Stil. Stil rammed the pole of his spear into the beast\u2019s mouth. The dog snapped its jaws around the pole, but Stil threw his weight into the weapon and flipped the beast backwards.</p><p>The rider loaded a black bolt into its crossbow and aimed the weapon.</p><p>Gemma threw her rock. It missed the rider but hit its horse, making the animal shriek and dance sideways. The rider released the bolt from his crossbow, but Stil dodged it, running forward to spear the hellhound.</p><p>The dog slipped under Stil\u2019s spear and lunged for him, but it missed and locked its jaws on Stil\u2019s new cape.</p><p>\u201cBlaze!\u201d Stil said, slamming his weapon on the beast\u2019s skull while lighting the clearing up like a fire.</p> <p>Gemma threw her second rock at the rider\u2014this time pelting him in the chest. The rider turned its horse in a circle and hissed.</p><p>The hellhound disengaged from Stil and ran at Gemma.</p><p>\u201cClimb a tree!\u201d Stil shouted, chasing the hound. He managed to land a blow on the beast\u2019s shoulder, opening a deep wound, but the mongrel ignored it and scrabbled for Gemma. Gemma had just enough time to throw herself on the trunk of a tree and clear the first branch. The hellhound caught the hem of her cape and pulled, yanking her back by the clasp at her neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She choked and almost lost hold of the tree, but the hellhound let go and leapt backwards to avoid the spear Stil tossed at it like a javelin. The spear missed.</p><p>\u201cCudere,\u201d Stil called, holding his arm out in front of him. The spear shook before flying out of the ground in which it was impaled and hurtling back to the craftmage. Stil spun around and thrust the spear out in front just in time to intercept another bolt from the rider.</p><p>The hellhound growled and snapped at Gemma\u2019s feet; she kept her cloak wrapped tightly around herself so none of it draped. She pulled a fairly sizable dead branch off the tree and dropped it on the hellhound. It cracked in half after hitting the animal\u2019s skull.</p><p>The hound snarled, but it held its ground between Stil and Gemma.</p> <p>Stil faked a jab to the beast\u2019s left before carrying through, turning the jab into a slash that landed squarely on its already-wounded shoulder. The beast yelped and scrambled backwards. Stil was about to finish the animal off with a well-placed jab when he froze. He turned to face the rider before he fell to his knees, letting Gemma see the black arrow that poked out of his left shoulder.</p><p>Stil fell face forward into the ground, his breath rattling in his chest.</p><p>No, no, NO!</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d Gemma shouted, leaping from the tree. She landed on the injured hellhound that was dragging itself towards Stil. Her entire body jarred when she hit the animal, making a faint clinking noise.</p><p>Panic poured through her, unleashed by the sight of Stil\u2019s bleeding shoulder. Her usual calm abandoned her like warmth in a snowstorm.</p> <p>Not Stil! Anything\u2014except that!</p><p>Gemma grabbed the idea and used it to push her mind into motion. She needed to understand what was happening! There was a distinct pattern to the battle, and more than the obvious tactic that the hellhound attacked while the rider shot arrows. There was something missing\u2014like hems and seams, hidden from sight but stitching cloth together. Wait, could it be...?</p><p>\u201cGemma, run,\u201d Stil grimaced as Gemma scrambled the few feet to him.</p><p>\u201cIts weakness is light, right?\u201d Gemma asked, her breath coming in heavy pants as her heart pounded in her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stil groaned as the nightmare mount sauntered in their direction.</p><p>\u201cThe rider and hellhound! They cannot abide light, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Gemma said, digging in her pockets as the hellhound dragged itself in their direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Run, you mule,\u201d Stil coughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier to take apart a piece of clothing if you rip out the seams. We were just stabbing at the cloth,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stil said, confused by Gemma\u2019s babble</p><p>The rider was almost on them when Gemma\u2019s fingers closed on what she was looking for. Gemma plucked at least four starfires out and shouted \u201cSHINE! Shine your brightest!\u201d</p><p>The prisms glowed with the intensity of the sun, bathing the clearing in light so brilliant, even Gemma couldn\u2019t see. The hellhound, nightmare, and the rider shrieked with pain as the light poured over their bodies, invading every crevice.</p><p>Gemma dropped the prisms on the ground and turned her back to the light to pick two more starfires out of her pocket. \u201cSHINE!\u201d she shouted when she realized she faced the blinded, injured hellhound. The animal scrunched its eyes shut and leapt at her, mouth gaping. It latched down on Gemma\u2019s arm, making her scream when its fangs sank into the flesh of her arm.</p> <p>Gemma gritted her teeth and kneed the creature in the chest, trying to make it release her. It flopped but didn\u2019t let go. Gemma punched its head with her fist that held the starfires. The animal released her and choked, writhing on the ground when one of the prisms fell down its throat.</p><p>Light erupted from its mouth, and the hellhound howled.</p><p>\u201cDim!\u201d Gemma shouted.</p><p>The star fires dimmed enough that Gemma could see without stars in her eyes.</p><p>It was still too much for the nightmare mount; it reared, unseating the rider, and took off, galloping through the dark woods with angry screams.</p><p>Gemma glanced over her shoulder at the writhing hellhound, her shoulders heaving as she observed the creature\u2019s pain while light invaded it from the inside out.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s fist tightened around an unlit starfire. She ran towards the rider, kicking up snow. \u201cSHINE!\u201d she shouted, grabbing the thrown rider by its cloak.</p><p>The rider was even more terrifying to behold than Gemma had steeled herself for. Instead of a flesh-covered face it had a bare skull. The rider\u2019s jaw was square and blocky to support its bloated incisors that were coated with a red so dark and rusty, it was almost black. There were gaping holes instead of eyes, and its breath reeked of sulfur and brimstone.</p><p>The rider wasn\u2019t a mindless creature\u2014like the hellhound or the horse\u2014nor was it crazed and mad with greed\u2014like King Torgen. Instead it was a hole of darkness, seeking to devour everything good and righteous in its path. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the rider struggled to bring up its loaded crossbow, Gemma said to her starfire, \u201cShine even brighter.\u201d</p><p>She shoved the blazing prism into the rider\u2019s chest wound as the rider scrabbled with the crossbow trigger. Its tarry blood burned her hand, but she gritted her teeth and let go of the starfire before she ripped her hand from the creature\u2019s chest cavity\u2014which now shown like a comet.</p><p>The rider dropped its crossbow and tried to tear the prism out of its chest, but it was in vain. Light coursed from its head to its toes, and it raised its hands in a silent scream before turning to ash and blowing away in the wind, leaving behind the starfire\u2014which still shone brilliantly.</p><p>\u201cDim,\u201d Gemma called. To her relief, the painful brightness of the starfires decreased. Gemma pushed herself to her feet and staggered to Stil, who had pushed himself up on his elbows.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was THAT?\u201d Stil said, struggling to lift his head.</p><p>\u201cWe were concentrating too much on fighting. All we needed was to make it bright, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you realized that how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said they couldn\u2019t travel in daylight.\u201d Gemma said, swallowing to make her voice strong as she looked at Stil\u2019s wound. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it looks,\u201d he said when he managed to raise his head. \u201cLeave it in for now\u2014to staunch the blood flow. It\u2019s not in very deep. If we get back to the tent, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he grimaced. \u201cI have a kit and some potions there. By stars and fire dust, does this hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you stand? I could get Pricker Patch, but I don\u2019t want to leave you,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can walk. If you would just help me stand\u2014,\u201d Stil broke off when a dog whined behind them.</p><p>\u201c...What happened to the hellhound?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>Gemma scrambled for her starfires and turned around, scooping up the prisms and snow, but she needn\u2019t bother.</p><p>The snarling, emaciated hellhound was gone. In its place was a good-sized canine/wolf-ish looking creature. It had thick white fur, but the tip of its tail was black, as were its paws and legs, almost as if it wore boots. The tips of its ears were flecked with black too, and it had a number of odd but beautiful black marks around its eyes, like they had been inked by an artist.</p><p>It sniffed its wet, inquisitive nose at Stil and Gemma and wagged its tail.</p> <p>\u201cI have never seen a creature like that,\u201d Stil said, clamping his jaws together in pain as Gemma helped him stand.</p><p>\u201cIf we ignore it, will it go away?\u201d Gemma asked, hefting Stil\u2019s arm over his shoulder so she could bear some of his weight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I find I just don\u2019t care enough to deal with it right now. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Stil said, nodding in the direction of their camp.</p><p>The walk back was long and excruciating. Gemma\u2019s heart beat painfully in her throat, and she could only imagine the pain Stil felt.</p><p>The craftmage bore it all without a noise, although he did gasp occasionally.</p><p>When they pushed through the last layer of trees and could see the brown spot on a field of white snow that was Pricker Patch\u2014even this far away he looked displeased\u2014both Gemma and Stil sighed in relief.</p><p>\u201cJust a little ways,\u201d Stil said, teetering dangerously for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYes. Just a little,\u201d Gemma said, supporting the mage. She blinked when snow started to fall and settled on her eyelashes. \u201cJust put one foot in front of the other,\u201d she coached before they started walking again.</p> <p>They were halfway across the field when the first beam of light broke over the hill. Just as the light broke, soldiers in the Verglas uniform poured over the crest.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Gemma breathed.</p><p>\u201cLeave me,\u201d Stil said. \u201cRun to the tent. Once you get in, it will lock itself if anyone tries to follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cGemma, don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me they\u2019re looking for,\u201d Gemma said, a clear-headed calmness falling over her.</p><p>The options were obvious. If she ran, they would take Stil. Who knew if he would survive the arrow, much less King Torgen. If they tried to run together, they would never reach the tent, and they both would be captured.</p><p>The least dangerous option was to turn herself in. Gemma had made up her mind to even before she made her evaluations.</p><p>Stil had to be saved. Not because he would be more useful to the countries in the fight against darkness, or even because Gemma owed him a great debt. In fact, her decision had nothing to do with practicality, and everything to do with her heart.</p><p>I will have to ponder this later, Gemma thought.</p><p>Stil gripped her shoulder with the hand thrown over her. \u201cGemma, I won\u2019t let you sacrifice yourself for me! You deserve the happy ending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma Kielland?\u201d a soldier shouted.</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t get it if King Torgen has you thrown into a prison.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stil didn\u2019t even hear what she was admitting to. \u201cHe can\u2019t keep me forever. The Conclave would come for me. You\u2019re running out of time. Run!\u201d Stil said, trying to push Gemma away from him.</p><p>Gemma slipped away and folded Stil on to his knees before she placed her handful of starfires in his hand. \u201cThank you, for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma Kielland, we are armed and have you in our sights. Turn yourself in, and you will come to no harm,\u201d the soldier shouted. In the moonlight, Gemma could see rows of soldiers carrying bows glittering on the snow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think of it!\u201d Stil hissed. \u201cBlast your sacrifices and practicality! RUN!\u201d</p> <p>Gemma shook her head, her eyes filling with tears. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand, Stil,\u201d she said, her heart breaking.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Gemma,\u201d Stil pleaded. He scattered the starfires as he dropped them to reach for her hands.</p><p>Gemma smiled and leaned forward, kissing Stil on the forehead. \u201cTake care, Stil,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGemma!\u201d</p><p>Gemma turned to the soldiers and walked to them, her heart twisting with each step she took away from Stil. She didn\u2019t turn around. She couldn\u2019t. If she did, she would lose all the strength she had.</p> <p>\u201cGEMMA!\u201d Stil shouted.</p><p>Four soldiers met Gemma halfway to the army. They searched her for weapons\u2014tossing the few remaining starfires she had on her\u2014and restrained her hands in iron shackles.</p><p>\u201cGemma Kielland has been found. We return to Ostfold immediately. Ready the horses!\u201d a soldier shouted.</p><p>Within moments, a chestnut horse was brought forward. A soldier mounted it, and Gemma was passed up to him.</p><p>\u201cGEMMA!\u201d Stil shouted again.</p><p>The soldiers ignored him and trekked back up the hill, aiming north...for Ostfold.</p> <p>Gemma squirmed in the soldier\u2019s grip to get one last look of Stil.</p><p>He was a dab of black among the snow that was falling in large, beautiful flakes. Gemma\u2019s starfires were littered around him like tiny flames. He had managed to partially stand, but as the soldier spurred his horse into a trot, Stil fell to his knees, calling out for Gemma.</p><p>Far back, in the shadows of the field, Gemma saw the white lupine.</p><p>They started down the hill, and the snowy field veered from sight. \u201cGoodbye, Stil,\u201d Gemma whispered before she lost sight of him.</p><p>\u201cPress on to Ostfold. The King wants her,\u201d the soldier leading the hunt told Gemma\u2019s captor, joining them on a bay-colored horse.</p><p>\u201cYessir,\u201d Gemma\u2019s captor said.</p><p>\u201cI apologize, Miss Kielland. I wish we could release you, but we haven\u2019t a choice,\u201d the leading soldier said.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Gemma said.</p> <p>\u201cSend a messenger ahead. I\u2019m sure the King will want to know his future queen is on the way home. Let\u2019s move out!\u201d the soldier said, heeling his horse into a canter.</p><p>Above the thunder of pounding hooves, Gemma heard the howl of a wolf.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Considering how long it took Gemma and Stil to walk to the Loire border with Pricker Patch, traveling back to Ostfold took a painfully short time. The soldiers stopped every few hours for fresh horses, which allowed them to keep their grueling pace, and they stopped to rest only whenever Gemma was in danger of falling off due to exhaustion.</p><p>In far too short a time, Gemma stood before King Torgen, saddle sore, bruised, with her arm injured from the hellhound and her hand burnt from the rider\u2019s black blood.</p><p>King Torgen received her in a palace courtyard, where the wind blew and snow stung all who were stationed outside.</p><p>\u201cGemma Kielland, you have returned to me,\u201d King Torgen said. He approached her with his arms spread wide, as if to hug her. When he drew close, he back-handed her and encircled her neck with his hands. \u201cAlthough you will be punished for fleeing.\u201d</p><p>Gemma gagged but kicked out, kneeing King Torgen in the stomach.</p><p>The King staggered backwards with an \u201coomph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRestrain her,\u201d King Torgen snarled, clutching his gut.</p><p>Two soldiers placed their hands on Gemma\u2019s shoulders, their faces wiped of emotion.</p><p>When King Torgen came at Gemma again, Gemma didn\u2019t wait. She swung her shackled arms through the air, snapping the chains in the king\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI said restrain her!\u201d King Torgen howled, his hands covering his face.</p><p>The soldiers lowered their grasp to her elbows, holding Gemma still.</p><p>King Torgen cursed and roared in pain as Gemma lifted her chin and raised an eyebrow up in the most arrogant expression she could muster.</p><p>Gemma was done behaving. She would rather be dead than let Torgen touch her. It was over.</p><p>\u201cYou think you are safe because you are to become my queen?\u201d King Torgen said, finally lowering his hands.</p><p>\u201cNo. I think I did not keep my part of the bargain and failed to spin all the flax into gold,\u201d Gemma said, recalling the vast spread of flax. \u201cThus, I am subject to death.\u201d</p><p>King Torgen\u2019s ugly glower faded from his face, and instead his features were pinched as hysterical laughter poured from his mouth. \u201cYou think I will let you go? You think I will let you escape into death?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>King Torgen abruptly stopped laughing and grabbed Gemma by the throat of her cape, yanking her\u2014and the soldiers\u2014forward. \u201cI will never set you free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will never spin for you again,\u201d Gemma said, the strength of her heart helping her to meet King Torgen\u2019s feverish eyes with all the ice she could muster in her own gaze. \u201cYou may clutch my broken body for all eternity, but I will never give you even a glimmer of gold.\u201d</p><p>King Torgen released one bark of laughter. \u201cWe shall see, Gemma Kielland. I have ways of making people obey my orders,\u201d he snarled. \u201cToril!\u201d</p><p>The prince, who was standing in the doorway, hesitantly joined King Torgen. \u201cYes, Father?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake Gemma\u2014your soon to be step-mother\u2014to her new chambers. See to it that she has everything she needs to present herself as a bride. Tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Gemma said, choking on disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYes. Tomorrow, Verglas will have a new queen,\u201d King Torgen smirked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Farther,\u201d Prince Toril said, his voice a whisper. He motioned to the soldiers holding Gemma to follow him before he turned and walked back to the refuge of the palace.</p><p>Toril and the soldiers were silent as they marched through the palace, moving up hallways and crossing corridors.</p> <p>Toril glanced over his shoulder, his eyes lingering on Gemma\u2019s hurt hand. \u201cYou were injured?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Gemma shrugged. \u201cI was hurt before I was found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Toril said before addressing the soldiers. \u201cTake her to the queen\u2019s chambers. I will have a squadron of palace guards replace you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Lord?\u201d one of the soldiers said as the prince abruptly turned and walked in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cI have other things to attend to,\u201d Toril called over his shoulder.</p><p>The soldiers walked on, escorting Gemma to a beautiful, luxurious room.</p> <p>The bedroom was bathed in soft shades of cream and yellow. The ceiling was vaulted, painted with a mural of blue skies and snowflakes. The furniture was simple but elegant in taste, painted white and smooth to the touch.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like a typical Verglas luxurious bedroom. It was brighter, happier, and perfectly preserved.</p><p>\u201cThese are the queen\u2019s rooms?\u201d Gemma said, confused.</p><p>\u201cKing Torgen had the room decorated for the previous queen,\u201d a soldier said.</p><p>Gemma looked around the room as the soldiers unlatched her shackles. \u201cDid he love her?\u201d she asked. She could barely remember the queen. She died in childbirth, the unborn baby dying with her, when Gemma was still a toddler.</p><p>The soldier removing her shackles briefly stilled. \u201cYah,\u201d he said. \u201cShe tamed him.\u201d The silence stretched on as the second soldier checked that the two windows were locked and secured.</p><p>The soldiers bowed to Gemma and moved to leave the room. The soldier who answered Gemma\u2019s question lingered in the doorway. \u201cWhatever our queen saw in him that she loved is gone now,\u201d he said before closing the door.</p><p>Gemma heard the familiar clank as the door was locked from the outside. She was left alone in the room that seemed to whisper with ghosts of the past. She sat down on a stool and leaned against the wall, shutting her eyes.</p> <p>Gemma had no memories of King Torgen and his queen together, but the care and love that went into the decorating of the room was unmistakable. However, Gemma knew the soldier was right. Whatever part of King Torgen that cared about this room was gone, killed off long ago by the onslaught of bitterness and unquenchable hatred.</p><p>When the door clanked and was thrown open an hour later, Gemma tumbled off her stool in surprise.</p><p>\u201cGemma\u2014you look terrible! But that is to be expected, I suppose. I am a healer, I am here to heal. That\u2019s what healers do. Hah-hah.\u201d</p><p>Gemma\u2019s jaw dropped as she looked up at the cloaked figure. Even though she was veiled, Gemma would recognize the owner of that voice anywhere.</p><p>\u201cYou strapping guards should leave the healing to those who know what how to heal: healers. When I\u2019m ready to come out, I will knock,\u201d the cloaked figure said, patting the basket that swung from her arm.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d a guard at the door said\u2014Gemma recognized it was Foss. The guard winked at her before shutting the door.</p><p>\u201cThat is an excessively bad disguise, My Lady,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Lady Linnea waddled forward, wearing robes that drowned her body and a mismatched veil that covered her face. \u201cI know, but how else was I supposed to get in here? Besides, the guards aren\u2019t going to tell anyone,\u201d Lady Linnea. \u201cI hope you know what to do with this stuff,\u201d she added, setting a heavy basket on the floor. \u201cI\u2019ve got bandages, but I don\u2019t know what any of these balms are. By the Snow Queen, do they ever reek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m visiting you, of course. Hello, Gemma. I missed you\u2014though I am sorry you didn\u2019t successfully escape,\u201d Lady Linnea said, wrapping her arms around Gemma in a warm hug.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gemma said, her voice strong but lined with relief. \u201cWhat am I to do, My Lady? I don\u2019t think I will be able to escape him a second time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lady Linnea nodded. \u201cCould you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gemma admitted.</p><p>\u201cHe will make you hate him enough that you will want to,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t want to become a person capable of murder.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are right. I wish to shield you from that as well. I don\u2019t think you could handle it. We\u2019re very different, you know,\u201d Lady Linnea said. \u201cYou are like the ice and snow that you love so much. Dazzling, without blemish, and a cover that makes all things beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Gemma cracked a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s romanticizing me quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea shook her head. \u201cYou bring out the good in people, and those who scorn you, you freeze with your eyes and words. So, it\u2019s a good thing I am your friend and companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I am a sword, dangerous and deadly. And Gemma, I will not hesitate to kill the king to save you,\u201d Lady Linnea said, her voice hard. \u201cIt will not be tomorrow, or perhaps even this year, but I will free you. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>As Gemma studied Lady Linnea, she saw that the noble woman was serious. Lady Linnea was a soldier at heart: dedicated, loyal, and willing to shed blood to make a difference and to fight for what was right. This was a real vow. Gemma could see it in the coldness of her eyes and the set of her chin. Lady Linnea would kill for her, and Gemma thought it likely she would succeed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to force that burden on you,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Lady Linnea smiled. \u201cYou aren\u2019t. And it\u2019s not like anyone will truly care. Tor\u2014some people will mourn what was. But the prince will make a better king.\u201d</p><p>Gemma pushed an eyebrow up. \u201cOh? Not long ago you were telling me he was far more stupid than you originally estimated.\u201d</p><p>A pink blush heated Lady Linnea\u2019s cheeks. \u201cThat was before I knew him. He\u2019s different from his father. He is willing\u2014someone just needs to teach him about love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be the one to do that, My Lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness, no!\u201d Lady Linnea snorted. \u201cI still want to see the world. I want to observe Commanding General Severin and set eyes on the famed military of Erlauf. I want to meet a female captain of Farset and perhaps even speak to an assassin from our very own assassins\u2019 guild.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToril can\u2019t love someone like me, Gemma,\u201d Lady Linnea said. \u201cI\u2019m too brash and bloodthirsty. He likes the sweet, delicate girls. Like Princess Elise.\u201d Gemma thought she could discern the same note of longing in Lady Linnea\u2019s voice that the young woman used when she spoke of visiting other countries, but judging by the pain in the last admission, it was unlikely the lady wanted to address her affection for the Verglas prince.</p><p>\u201cIs that so,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cBut enough of that. Your hand does look horrible. Do you think you can guess which of these wretched-smelling ointments are best for...what, is that, a burn?\u201d Lady Linnea said, digging through her basket.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea hissed through her teeth. \u201cIt looks nasty. How did you manage to get it? Moreover, how did you manage to escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mage,\u201d Gemma said, opening a pot and grimacing at the smell.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Lady Linnea said, unconvinced. \u201cOh, this is it! I remember\u2014the real healer told me this one is good for burns. It has a very distinctive smell\u2014like horse droppings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was not the best way to endorse its use,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cIf it kills the pain and heals the skin, does it matter what ingredients are used?\u201d Lady Linnea asked, passing the little container over. \u201cBesides, I think the healer said the main ingredients were vinegar, honey, and potato peelings.\u201d</p><p>Gemma wiped the smelly balm on her hand, wincing when her fingers traced the tender skin. Although the smell was noxious, the ointment began to soften the pain almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cHere, I can at least bandage your arm,\u201d Lady Linnea said, waving a roll of bandages.</p><p>\u201cHow did you learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read the Erlauf army makes sure all of their soldiers know how to wrap wounds, so I found a book in Papa\u2019s library,\u201d Lady Linnea said, starting to clean and wrap Gemma\u2019s hand and arm. \u201cToril told me what you can expect: King Torgen is indeed holding the wedding tomorrow. Tonight, a wedding dress will be delivered to your rooms, and the ceremony is to commence before the noon hour tomorrow. It seems that a squadron will be posted out your door all night and in the courtyard below. Unless you want to see all those men killed, I do not think you can escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma agreed. \u201cWe will see what my security measures are like after the wedding,\u201d she said, stifling the desire to flinch.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Linnea said, her reply heavy with unspoken words. \u201cIs there no possibility that your sweetheart will try to rescue you tomorrow?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma started to correct the lady before she gave up and broke off in a sigh. \u201cNo. There\u2019s not even a glimmer of hope,\u201d she said.</p><p>Stil was probably still treating his shoulder from the rider\u2019s arrow. And even if he was well enough to move, Pricker Patch could not cover the distance Gemma and the soldiers had covered in such a short amount of time.</p><p>\u201cThen we will have to play the waiting game. When you become queen, I will be able to more easily pay social calls to you,\u201d Lady Linnea said. She finished bandaging Gemma\u2019s hand and slipped the tail end of the bandage under one of the wrapped layers.</p><p>\u201cYour parents will lock you in your room if you do,\u201d Gemma said.</p> <p>Lady Linnea gave Gemma a playful grin. \u201cThey can try. I will merely have to expand my list of recruits to help me slip out. Sissel has become my newest ally. She is a great help. I am starting to see why you gave your handiwork to those you did. They have come out of the shadows one by one to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am glad,\u201d Gemma smiled.</p><p>Lady Linnea picked up her basket of smelly concoctions. \u201cUnfortunately, I need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea stared into Gemma\u2019s grey eyes. She placed her free hand on Gemma\u2019s shoulder and pulled her close for a hug. \u201cBe strong, and have courage. I will not abandon you. You can survive this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Take care, until next time,\u201d Lady Linnea winked before adjusting her ill-fitting robe and imperiously knocking on the door.</p><p>The door opened, and Lady Linnea slipped out, leaving Gemma alone with her thoughts.</p><p>Lady Linnea will move too late. Even if she does attempt to kill King Torgen, he will crush me before she gets the chance to finish him off. King Torgen will ruin me before Lady Linnea can rescue me.</p><p>\u201cLady Linnea is so very valiant...but I don\u2019t think she understands King Torgen\u2019s darkness,\u201d Gemma said, her voice breaking the silence. The thought brought her no comfort, but it stiffened her resolve.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just as well. I won\u2019t let him break me,\u201d she vowed, straightening a bit of her bandage.</p> <p>A memory of Stil holding her hands to his face swam through her mind.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma decided, pushing the thought away. I refuse to become a silly girl who sighs and grows despondent over matters of the heart.</p><p>\u201cAlthough I do love him, I think,\u201d Gemma admitted, ever practical. What was it Grandmother Guri said? To be open to love? Well, I wasn\u2019t. And it still got me in the end\u2014unreasonable heart!</p><p>Gemma scowled at the thought. \u201cWell, it\u2019s done,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no use ruminating over it. I may as well focus on something productive: making King Torgen angry.\u201d</p><p>The following morning, the guards opened the door for two lady\u2019s maids, who shrieked when they entered the bedroom.</p><p>The wedding dress\u2014which followed royal styles as opposed to civilian styles and was a giant white, puffball of a dress\u2014was ruined. Over night, Gemma had industriously ripped the eyesore to shreds, so no piece bigger than the size of her palm remained.</p><p>The pieces were scattered around the room, making it look like a snowstorm had swept through over the course of the night.</p><p>Gemma was in the middle of a yawn and was sitting on a padded window seat as opposed to sleeping. \u201cGood morning,\u201d she said with a pleased smile. The lady\u2019s maids said nothing but flounced out of the room in a huff, their skirts billowing behind them.</p> <p>Gemma smirked at their retreat and turned to look outside, which looked just as dreary as she felt. Today was the day she was to marry King Torgen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame I haven\u2019t any Starfires,\u201d Gemma muttered as she thought of the oddly changed hellhound. \u201cI imagine a prism shoved down his throat would greatly alter King Torgen as well.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>All too soon, the lady\u2019s maids returned, armed with another ill-fitting, terribly styled dress. Gemma argued with the lady\u2019s maids that she could be married in what she was wearing, but judging by their tight motions and squeaky voices, they would face consequences if Gemma did not put on the white monstrosity.</p><p>Gemma eventually complied, and, as Lady Linnea had said, by noon she found herself in the Ostfold Cathedral.</p><p>The church was breathtaking\u2014the entire thing was made with sanded, unstained wood. It was almost triangular in shape, but tiered like a cake. It followed the Verglas tradition of elaborate woodcarvings of reindeer and snowflakes, and the center tower had windows to let in sunlight. The only spot of color\u2014besides the beautiful reds and browns of the wood\u2014was an intricate, circular stained-glass window set above the altar. It was high up the wall so, should the sun happen to shine, it would cast colored light on the church congregation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The church was packed with nobles and villagers alike. Gemma was certain it was mandatory for all of Ostfold to attend, as those who couldn\u2019t fit in the church were waiting in the streets outside. The citizens were as exuberant for their King\u2019s marriage as they were for a funeral.</p><p>Gemma tried to appreciate the beauty of the building, but her stomach heaved when she saw King Torgen staring her down from the far end of the church. She would have turned around and stormed back out of the church, but a team of three guards were escorting her down the church aisle, and Gemma doubted they would let her flee.</p><p>King Torgen sneered, his face twisted in its usual ugly and half-mad expression. Prince Toril stood behind him, looking sorry. He glanced at a pew in the middle of the church and, following his gaze, Gemma discovered he was looking to the Lovland family, specifically Lady Linnea.</p><p>Lady Linnea wore her public expression of refinement and disdain, but Gemma could see the noble lady was unhappy by the way she clenched her jaw.</p> <p>Gemma grabbed the heat charm and the magic thimble from where they hung from a white ribbon looped her neck. (It had taken Gemma half an hour to talk the lady\u2019s maids into letting her keep them, but they had insisted Gemma take the charm and thimble off the silver thread and hang them from the ribbon instead.)</p><p>The farther they got down the aisle, the more Gemma\u2019s spirits sunk, and the slower she walked. When she was a few lengths from King Torgen, the soldiers had to nudge her to keep her moving.</p><p>When Gemma climbed the dais to join King Torgen and the priest, Gemma said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry this man,\u201d to the priest.</p><p>The priest\u2014an elderly man who was obviously under just as much threat as Gemma\u2014sucked his neck into his shoulders and looked like he wished himself a hundred leagues away.</p><p>\u201cSilence, Gemma Kielland,\u201d King Torgen ordered</p> <p>\u201cOr what, you will kill me? I would much prefer that,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>Guessing by the gasp in the first few pews, her voice was audible to at least some of the attendees.</p><p>King Torgen grabbed Gemma\u2019s chin. Unlike Stil\u2019s tender touch, King Torgen gripped Gemma like a snake hinged on prey. He roughly shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI can make you plenty wretched without killing you,\u201d King Torgen hissed.</p><p>Gemma kicked King Torgen in the shins. He shouted and pushed Gemma backwards. She would have fallen off the dais if the guards hadn\u2019t caught her.</p><p>\u201cRestrain her,\u201d King Torgen growled to the guards, who set Gemma on her feet before holding her in place. \u201cDon\u2019t just stand there, begin!\u201d King Torgen said to the poor priest.</p> <p>The priest cast an anxious look between King Torgen and Gemma. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou refuse me?\u201d King Torgen said. Gemma couldn\u2019t see his face as he loomed over the priest, but she could hear the promise of death in his voice.</p><p>Gemma sighed. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d she said.</p><p>The priest, who had shrunk a foot, looked to her.</p><p>\u201cI know you cannot help it. Go ahead,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>The priest squared his shoulders and cleared his throat. \u201cWe are gathered here today for a...glorious event and occasion. The wedding of our monarch and this...lovely girl.\u201d</p><p>The priest warbled on, but Gemma ignored his words\u2014if she took them in, she would start panicking. She turned around so she didn\u2019t even face the priest and King Torgen\u2014who didn\u2019t seem to care\u2014and peered past her guard escort to get a glimpse of the crowd.</p><p>She saw two of the merchants she frequently bought fabric and thread from, Otto\u2014the barkeeper of Sno Hauk\u2014and Mrs. Hagen and her neighbor, Mrs. Nystrom. Besides the Lovlands, there were several other noble families, but no matter how carefully she looked over the crowd, she didn\u2019t find the two faces she was looking for: her parents.</p> <p>Gemma raised an eyebrow. That shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. They have never bothered themselves with me before. Why should they start now?</p><p>But what was surprising was the absence of Grandmother Guri, although Gemma suspected it may be because the old woman did not want to see Gemma wed a crazed tyrant.</p><p>\u201c\u2014Do you, Gemma Kielland,\u201d the priest started.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>The priest hesitated, but continued with his speech when King Torgen glared at him.</p><p>Gemma only half listened when he did. Her heart twisted in her chest as she pictured her dark future. Almost against her will, she reached up and clasped the heat charm and thimble. \u201cStil,\u201d she whispered, the name seeped with longing.</p><p>She really was cursed. She managed to save him\u2014hopefully\u2014but in the end she was still going to end up with an unhappy ending.</p><p>It is just as well I rebuffed him. It will make this ever-after easier to accept.</p><p>Gemma lifted her chin as the priest started his ending remarks.</p><p>\u201cOn behalf of this country\u2014civilians and nobility,\u201d the priest said.</p><p>This is it.</p><p>\u201cIt is with...resignation\u2014,\u201d</p><p>Unless King Torgen chokes on a fishbone, I am stuck with him\u2014and whatever torture he decrees to try to force me to spin flax into gold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat I announce the marriage of our King Torgen\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gemma shut her eyes, wishing she could shut up her grieving heart just as easily.

The thimble heated up and chimed like the smallest of goat bells, but the noise was blocked out by the smashing of glass. The gorgeous stained-glass window cracked and broke, raining glass shards like rain.</p><p>A figure in a black wool cloak with intricate silver embroidery fell with the glass, landing on the dais with a thump.</p><p>The figure stood and tilted its head. \u201cIs your fashion sense sliding, Gemma?\u201d the figure said with a smile. \u201cThat dress is hideous.\u201d</p><p>Gemma was glued to the ground. \u201c...Stil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called for me?\u201d Stil asked. His hood was still up, but his easy smile was in place as he bridged the distance between them to kiss Gemma on her cheek.</p> <p>\u201cYou wretch\u2014arrest him!\u201d King Torgen shouted, red with rage.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Stil said, taking Gemma\u2019s hand. He mowed over the guards who\u2014truth be told\u2014were slow to reach for their weapons, even if they were surprised.</p><p>Stil and Gemma ran down the aisle, hurrying for the back door.</p><p>As if she could silence herself no longer, Lady Linnea leapt to her feet. \u201cRUN, Gemma!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>\u201cOpen the doors,\u201d Jentine\u2014Lady Lovland\u2019s lady\u2019s maid\u2014called.</p><p>\u201cRun, lass,\u201d Otto echoed, his voice booming in the cathedral. Soon, a number of people stood and shouted encouragement.</p> <p>King Torgen roared and rampaged down the aisle after Gemma and Stil.</p><p>Gemma tripped and almost fell when she glanced over her shoulder and saw her mother\u2014using the cane Grandmother Guri usually carried\u2014whack King Torgen on the head so hard, the wood cracked.</p><p>\u201cNever. Again!\u201d her mother shouted, still hitting King Torgen. \u201cYou won\u2019t get my daughter! This time I\u2019ll stop you!\u201d</p><p>Gemma gaped as Stil helped her stand while other villages moved to help Gemma\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stand there like a stork, my girl. Get moving!\u201d Grandmother Guri shouted from inside a pew.</p><p>Gemma regained her balance and raced the remaining distance, gripping Stil\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cStil, what on earth are we doing?\u201d Gemma said as the doors opened. They had to slow down to pick their way across the icy steps.</p><p>\u201cI have a hunch,\u201d Stil said as they cleared the steps and ran across the courtyard. The wind howled and pulled on Gemma\u2019s terrible dress.</p> <p>\u201cA hunch,\u201d Gemma repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Stil said when they reached the far end of the courtyard. Instead of running into the village to lose the guards, Stil turned around and stood his ground.</p><p>\u201cAnd what hunch would that be?\u201d Gemma asked, her voice was calm with a ring of ire to it.</p><p>\u201cThat the Snow Queen will care for her own,\u201d Stil said, rummaging through his cloak. \u201cSHINE!\u201d He shouted. At the top of the church tower, a cluster of starfire prisms burst into brilliance, casting as much light as the noon sun.</p><p>Up on the lone tower of the castle, another bundle of starfires ignited, glowing like a comet.</p><p>At the gate of Ostfold, another bunch of prisms exploded in light. The city glowed like a radiant jewel, lit from the three different points.</p><p>As Gemma\u2014and the townsfolk who waiting in the courtyard\u2014gazed slack-jawed at the light, Stil threw a fistful of snowflakes into air. \u201cSpread,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Obeying his order, a gust of wind carried the paper snowflakes into the air. When they disappeared, it started to snow. A snow cloud formed above the city, and a twin cloud formed at the base of the mountains behind the palace\u2014specifically Fresler\u2019s Helm.</p><p>The snow started to fall in thick flakes and at a greater pace when King Torgen finally struggled out of the crowd in the cathedral.</p><p>\u201cGuards, ARREST THEM! Kill the man!\u201d King Torgen ordered, pointing a finger at Stil and Gemma.</p><p>The guards behind King Torgen were motionless.</p><p>King Torgen twisted around. \u201cMOVE!\u201d he shouted, spittle flying from his lips. \u201cOr I shall have your families slaughtered for your insolence!\u201d</p><p>More guards entered the courtyard, streaming from the palace until they lined the sides of the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cSeize them!\u201d King Torgen shouted to the newcomers.</p><p>None of the guards moved.</p><p>\u201cYou refuse? You are traitors! You will all suffer!\u201d King Torgen shouted.</p><p>\u201cGuards of Ostfold and Verglas, stand down,\u201d Prince Toril ordered, emerging from the cathedral.</p><p>In a well-practiced movement, the guards sheathed their swords or reversed their hold on their spears and jabbed the tips into the ground.</p><p>King Torgen whipped around. \u201cYou rebel against me, son?\u201d he sneered. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.

While the Snow Queen\u2019s magic guards your country, the people have languished under your rule. You kill without restraint and persecute any who displease you or stand against you. But no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what can you do to stop me?\u201d King Torgen roared with mad laughter. \u201cYou cannot kill me, or you will be hunted like a dog by your fellow mages!\u201d he said in delight.</p><p>\u201cI will not have to dirty my hands with your blood,\u201d Stil said, his musical voice ringing across the courtyard. \u201cThe Snow Queen will do it for me.\u201d</p> <p>King Torgen stopped laughing. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really think she wouldn\u2019t consider that the next threat to Verglas might not come from outside its borders, but from the blood of her own family?\u201d Stil said, a harsh half smile crossing his lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d King Torgen demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou should have learned from your Snow Queen, King Torgen. You should have known better than to touch the beloved of a mage,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cYou can do nothing,\u201d King Torgen said. All traces of amusement and laughter were gone, and he glowered like the hellhound or Hunter had, with evil and bitterness.</p><p>\u201cWe shall see,\u201d Stil said, his cloak billowing in the raging wind of the snowstorm. He raised a hand into the air and shouted over the wind.</p> <p>\u201cI, mage Rumpelstiltskin\u2014Grandmaster craftmage\u2014speak a vow to protect Gemma Kielland, civilian of Ostfold, whose very life is in danger through the actions of King Torgen,\u201d Stil shouted. \u201cGemma Kielland is the love of my life and the light in my soul. And I will put forth every bit of my magic to shield and protect her, whether the cost be my life or limbs, until my heart beats its last!\u201d Stil shouted.</p><p>As he spoke, a mountain\u2014Fresler\u2019s Helm\u2014started to rumble. In the palace, the windows of the throne room started to frost over, and the second, beautiful throne started to glow.</p><p>\u201cMy vow begins now, as she has been abused, threatened, and blackmailed, in her own homeland\u2014the place that should be a safe haven!\u201d Stil said, his voice like a trumpet in the rage of the storm.</p><p>The snow shifted from soft and fluffy to stinging bits of ice as the wind howled and swirled.</p><p>\u201cI will have you killed!\u201d King Torgen yelled.</p><p>Stil shook his head, his blue eyes hypnotic. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>The ground of the courtyard frosted over, and ice formed on King Torgen\u2019s boots.</p><p>\u201cWha-what?\u201d King Torgen said, tottering several steps to shake the ice off. \u201cWhat villainy are you doing? Black magic is not tolerated in Verglas! This will be your end! You will die for attacking a monarch!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am doing nothing, Oh King,\u201d Stil said, his expression hard.</p><p>King Torgen looked down and shouted in fright when he realized his boots were iced over. He tried to move, but he was frozen to the ground. He twisted, his feverish eyes searching. \u201cToril, help me, son! Save me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have wrought your future.

Help me, I order it!\u201d</p><p>Some folk shielded their eyes; others clamped their hands over their ears as the protective ice magic left behind by the Snow Queen spread on King Torgen, freezing him and clamping him into place.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot do this. I AM KING!\u201d King Torgen shouted.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d King Torgen shouted, before the ice encased his face, and he was frozen solid, a statue of ice.</p><p>Gemma stared at the ice husk of King Torgen.

She owed it to him! \u201cI\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d</p><p>Gemma blinked and turned her head, disengaging from Stil\u2019s touch. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said to Lady Linnea, the interrupter.</p><p>Stil groaned and dropped his head into Gemma\u2019s shoulder where he growled for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cI knew your lover was helping you!\u201d Lady Linnea said with a smug smile.</p><p>\u201cBut he is a mage,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cHe is still your lover!\u201d Lady Linnea said, folding her arms across her chest and squinting at Stil, who still had his head buried in the puffy fabric on Gemma\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI guess he\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess? After what he just did?\u201d Gemma asked, surprised by Lady Linnea\u2019s begrudging appraisal.</p><p>\u201cYes, he does make a good presentation. But he seems like a whiner,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>Stil finally pulled his head from Gemma\u2019s shoulder and tilted his head to touch Gemma\u2019s as he addressed Lady Linnea. \u201cDo you have any idea how I have fought for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I happened to interrupt?\u201d Lady Linnea asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been fond of nobility,\u201d Stil said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve never liked mages,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cStop it. Both of you,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cMy Lady, I don\u2019t understand the sudden dislike. You were rooting for my supposed lover since the first night of spinning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before I knew he was a mage,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cBut I told you!\u201d Gemma said at the same time Stil said, \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a mage, he is sure to hustle you away and rip you from Verglas\u2014and from me,\u201d Lady Linnea said, turning her sad, blue eyes to Gemma.</p><p>Gemma stepped out of Stil\u2019s arms so she could embrace Lady Linnea. \u201cNo matter our futures, My Lady, you will be a companion of my heart,\u201d she said, her voice fierce. \u201cI will always care for you.\u201d</p><p>Lady Linnea sniffed. \u201cAnd I will always care for you.\u201d</p><p>Stil politely looked away as the two girls cried and smiled together.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you won\u2019t go away forever. You love this frozen wasteland too much,\u201d Lady Linnea wryly smiled as she wiped a tear away.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Gemma admitted. She lifted her gaze to look to Prince Toril, who was standing in front of the ice statue that was his father. His expression was filled with regret and sadness. \u201cI wonder what will happen next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will need help,\u201d Lady Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cWhat he needs is an army of scholars to fill that empty mind of his,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cYou are sinking even further in my esteem, craftmage,\u201d Lady Linnea tightly said.</p><p>Gemma placed a hand on her friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCan\u2019t you aid him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see the world, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if he asked, would you sacrifice it all?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>Lady Linnea looked back to the crestfallen prince. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d she said. She squared her shoulders and crossed the courtyard. \u201cLong live King Toril,\u201d Linnea called. Her voice was strong in a sea of whispers and uncertainty.</p><p>Toril twisted around, his eyes wide in surprise.</p><p>\u201cLong live King Toril,\u201d Linnea repeated.</p><p>\u201cLong Live King Toril!\u201d some of the civilians shouted with her.</p><p>People began to clap; guards banged their spears on the ground in a solid beat, and the nobles gave sweeping bows and curtseys to their new monarch.</p><p>\u201cShe is quite smitten with him,\u201d Stil observed.</p><p>\u201cPainfully so,\u201d Gemma agreed, barely audible above the cheers and shouts of the crowd as Verglas welcomed its new King.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>By the time night fell, both much and little had changed.</p><p>Dispatch riders were sent out to inform all of Verglas; Gemma was able to change into one of her dresses\u2014courtesy of Grandmother Guri who delivered the dark blue dress to her at the palace\u2014and everyone had acknowledged, in as few words as possible, that they were overjoyed with King Torgen\u2019s passing.</p><p>The unexpected problem was who would rule. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s out of the question,\u201d Gemma said, fussing with her cloak. (Servants caught her trying to sneak out after changing and hauled her back into the palace.)</p><p>\u201cIt is not,\u201d Prince Toril said. \u201cMy Father meant to marry you, and he very nearly did. It is within your rights to be the ruler of Verglas. I will step aside for you.\u201d</p><p>Gemma pushed her reclaimed snow-blue hair-band up her forehead. \u201cMy Lord\u2014My Lords,\u201d she said, adjusting her stance so she addressed Prince Toril and the various lords and statesmen rallied around him. \u201cIt is an inappropriate idea,\u201d she said, catching sight of Stil at the very back of the throne room. \u201cI never actually married King Torgen, nor did I want to. I am not royal, and I am not learned. I am a seamstress, not a monarch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2014,\u201d Prince Toril started.</p> <p>\u201cI have on good authority that Prince Toril is capable as a leader, and I hold him in the highest esteem,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cAs heir to the throne, it is Prince Toril who should rule Verglas.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril\u2019s expression was pinched. \u201cMy father wronged you, Miss Kielland. I wish to correct it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not need a kingdom to make up for a few uncomfortable weeks,\u201d Gemma wryly said. \u201cIt would only make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could marry you,\u201d Prince Toril said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Stil said in the back of the room, which promptly dropped several degrees.</p> <p>Annoyed by the prince\u2019s thickheaded actions, Gemma flattened her eyebrows, disgruntled. He\u2019s trying, I suppose, in his own, bumbling way. Linnea better teach him better, or he is going to be swindled by every country surrounding us.</p><p>\u201cMy Lord,\u201d Gemma firmly said. \u201cNothing about that arrangement would please either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can give you?\u201d Prince Toril argued. \u201cIf not a crown, perhaps gold? We have quite a bit now...since...you...spun it,\u201d Prince Toril said, crestfallen as he made the connection.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s lips quirked in an amused curve. \u201cGold is a silly thing, My Lord. It is easily spent or lost and can bring forth the darkness in people. It is a person\u2019s actions that have real value. If you wish to make amends for your father\u2019s reign, I ask that you would reinstate the market in the Ostfold village square and allow the ambassadors to return to their foreign posts.\u201d</p><p>Prince Toril looked relieved. \u201cI shall do that,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Gemma almost felt bad about the request\u2014the prince probably didn\u2019t know or realize Lady Linnea was the daughter of the ambassador to Loire\u2014but she owed it to Linnea to open the door for her.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, My Lord. If that is all?\u201d Gemma said, curtsying.</p><p>\u201cIt is. Thank you, Miss Kielland.\u201d</p><p>Gemma curtseyed again before she fled.</p><p>Still followed her out of the throne room and was quiet as Gemma soaked in the sanctuary of the poorly-lit hallway.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do next?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gemma said, struggling to stay upright in a world swiftly changing. The idea of returning to Lovland manor was not pleasing after her exit from it, though she knew Lady Linnea and Lady Lovland would welcome her back.</p><p>She would not return to her parents\u2019 mill, even though her mother had helped her earlier, it wouldn\u2019t be wise. Her heart was softened enough to mend her relationship with her mother, but living with her would undo all her newfound good will. Perhaps she could stay with Grandmother Guri?</p><p>\u201cIf you like, you could stay with Angelique and me in my camp, for tonight at least,\u201d Stil said, edging up behind Gemma.</p> <p>Gemma smiled at the craftmage. \u201cThat would be nice,\u201d she admitted, before frowning. \u201cAngelique? She\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I managed to call her back. She is why we were able to arrive in time,\u201d Stil admitted, extending his hand.</p><p>\u201cPegasus?\u201d Gemma said, hesitating before she took Stil\u2019s hand and allowed him to lead her.</p><p>\u201cYes. I owe her for more than that, though. She summoned up the snow storm\u2014I could never have done it without her. I wanted to get the Snow Queen\u2019s magic riled, and the fastest way I know of is to add to the ice and snow in this country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere the starfires a signal to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I had her stationed at the base of Fresler\u2019s Helm. Communicating with her would not be easy with all I needed to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho started the starfires at the palace and city gate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said their names were Rudd and B?rres,\u201d Stil said as they strolled down the corridors of the palace.</p><p>Servants wove around them, carrying letters, documents, books, or food. Gemma had a feeling they weren\u2019t supposed to let random citizens wander the halls, but after the public spectacle Stil put on with King Torgen, it was unlikely anyone in Ostfold didn\u2019t recognize Gemma\u2014even without the hideous dress.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Gemma said, a fond smile flickering on her face. \u201cMy dungeon guards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems your sense of sacrifice has earned you a few friends,\u201d Stil said, leading the way outside.</p><p>When the brisk wind hit her, Gemma shivered and let go of Stil\u2019s hand to pull her cloak closer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Stil called, trudging through the snow, moving towards Lake Sno.</p><p>\u201cHow is your shoulder?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It aches a little, but it will pass. Angelique used some of her healing magic on me before we left for Ostfold,\u201d Stil said. \u201cAlthough that does remind me,\u201d he said, pointing to the forest.</p><p>Standing at the edge of the forest was the white lupine with black paws and black facial markings. When the canine saw Gemma, its curled tail wagged.</p> <p>\u201cIt followed you?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, it followed you. It was already here, sniffing outside the palace walls when we arrived this morning,\u201d Stil confirmed.</p><p>\u201cBut it is a hellhound, and it crossed the border?\u201d Gemma said, observing the creature.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019s not a hellhound anymore,\u201d Stil said. \u201cIt glows like a firefly in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it was the starfire it swallowed?\u201d Gemma asked. \u201cAnd when it passes through its system, it will go back to being a hellhound?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Whatever you did was permanent. I haven\u2019t seen a creature like it\u2014and neither has Angelique. Hellhounds are exclusively used by practitioners of dark magic. By claiming it with light, you have forged a new kind of canine,\u201d Stil said as they hiked past the creature.</p><p>Gemma hesitated before she wriggled her fingers at the dog.</p><p>The white furred animal happily yipped and broke away from the trees, its tail twirling wildly as it followed Gemma and Stil.</p><p>Stil and Gemma walked the shores of Lake Snow\u2014the unusual dog following them. When they rounded a bend of the lake, Gemma saw the familiar tent and donkey waiting.</p><p>Angelique was outside, leading a bare-backed Pegasus, who gleamed like the patches of night sky that could be seen through breaks in the clouds.</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d Angelique said, a smile blooming on her lovely face. \u201cI am so glad you are safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs am I. Thank you for all you have done to help me.\u201d</p><p>Angelique laughed. \u201cIt was no trouble at all. It was a pleasure, actually. It is relieving to deliver happiness in a time like this,\u201d she said, patting her mount.</p><p>\u201cPricker Patch? When did he get here?\u201d Stil asked, rubbing the donkey\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNot over an hour ago. He was quite unhappy and put out. I don\u2019t think he appreciated being left behind,\u201d Angelique said.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have possibly kept up with Pegasus, and we left him with a farmer who promised to feed him. One would have thought it was the ideal situation for such a disagreeable animal,\u201d Stil said as the donkey\u2014to Gemma\u2019s shock\u2014tilted his head forward the tiniest degree to lean into Stil\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Angelique said. She glanced between Stil and Gemma before adding, \u201cIf you will excuse me, I need to set Pegasus loose for the night. He needs to stretch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Gemma said, slightly confused by Angelique\u2019s language. \u201cEnjoy?\u201d</p><p>The enchantress raised her hand in acknowledgment and walked off, leading Pegasus away from the camp.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of this wind,\u201d Stil said, giving Pricker Patch a final scratch before motioning to the tent. Gemma followed him in, nearly tripping when the white lupine dove in front of her to wriggle its way inside.</p><p>\u201cYou...,\u201d Gemma said to the dog.</p><p>The white canine gave Gemma a doggy smile and scampered behind a settee. He poked his head out from behind it, his triangular ears pricked.</p><p>\u201cLeave him. He\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Stil said, taking off his cape. His hair was short, and his clothes were unusually plain\u2014black boots with tan cotton pants and a loose, royal blue shirt.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? He is a wild animal. He\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d</p><p>Gemma slowly raised her eyes to meet Stil\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d the craftmage said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma agreed, shedding her cape.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Gemma repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Gemma pursed her lips. \u201cI tried to run. Servants tracked me down and dragged me back. I think Lady Linnea underestimates Prince\u2014excuse me\u2014King Toril\u2019s backbone\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Stil said, his voice patient as he spoke over her. \u201cI was referring to the rider, and to when the soldiers found us. I told you to run.\u201d</p><p>Gemma sat in a settee and felt awkward. Why do I feel awkward? I know he loves me. I should tell him that I lov\u2014no, maybe not.</p><p>\u201cGemma,\u201d Stil said, crouching down in front of her.</p><p>The look in Stil\u2019s uniquely beautiful eyes tore the words from Gemma\u2019s mouth. \u201cBecause I love you,\u201d she hiccupped.</p><p>Stil and Gemma stared at each other, both a little shocked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to say that,\u201d Gemma said, sliding down the settee and moving across the room.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to say it, or you didn\u2019t mean it?\u201d Stil asked, gliding after Gemma with an infuriating amount of elegance.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make matters simple and pretend I didn\u2019t say it,\u201d Gemma said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t run from the rider because I couldn\u2019t leave you like that. When I finally got my head on straight, I realized that we were so busy countering him that we weren\u2019t bothering to take advantage of his greatest weakness,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cAlthough, I did not know the light would have such an effect on the hellhound,\u201d she added, glancing at the white lupine sniffing her shoes.</p><p>\u201cI can understand that. You thought to use something I see as only a trinket as an ultimate weapon. Well done,\u201d Stil said. \u201cSo, about love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs for the soldiers, it made the most sense. Obviously,\u201d Gemma stiffly said.</p> <p>\u201cSo, about love,\u201d Stil repeated.</p><p>Gemma strode back to the settee. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it amusing that a hellhound, a mad king, and the threat of death won\u2019t make you bat an eye, but mentioning love makes you lose your eternal serenity.\u201d</p><p>Gemma narrowed icy eyes at Stil. \u201cI am perfectly fine\u2014STOP IT,\u201d she barked when Stil reached out to touch her cheek.</p><p>Stil\u2019s lips quirked in the slightest smile. \u201cGemma,\u201d he said, his voice gentle. \u201cYou can trust me. I\u2019m not going to let you go. That is not to say that I will not disappoint you in the future or make you glare at me frequently, but I will never stop loving you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever wonder if your Lady Linnea will stop your friendship?\u201d Stil asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I any different from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to list the differences alphabetically or numerically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean\u2014what is different about her that would have you readily believe her love?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything,\u201d Gemma admitted.</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem possible...or plausible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You are an incredible woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a mage, wealthy, and handsome, and I\u2014,\u201d</p><p>Stil held up a hand. \u201cWait, you think I\u2019m handsome?\u201d</p><p>Gemma paused. \u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did notice my stylish hair and charming good looks.

Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it hard to believe in people,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cWith your background, I can understand that, but I\u2019ve never done anything to make you doubt me,\u201d Stil said, edging towards Gemma as if she were an easily frightened deer. \u201cI have come to your rescue whenever you need me. I won\u2019t let you fall,\u201d Stil promised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d Gemma whispered.</p><p>\u201cOf me?\u201d Stil asked, resting his arms on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gemma said as Stil pulled her in to hold her. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s so confusing, and that is unacceptable,\u201d she said, glaring into Stil\u2019s shirt.</p><p>Stil chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid something will happen, and you\u2019ll feel the need to run off and sacrifice yourself,\u201d he dryly said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you will keep pushing me away, and that I\u2019ll never get to see that firstborn child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStil,\u201d Gemma hissed.</p><p>\u201cBut most of all, I\u2019m afraid you will never let me love you. I choose you, Gemma. I love your loyalty, your practicality, and those rare smiles you will occasionally shed. I love you. Please, let that be enough,\u201d Stil whispered in Gemma\u2019s ear.</p><p>Gemma moved her arms to embrace him back. They stood together for a few silent moments that seemed to stretch on for ages.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d Gemma finally admitted, her shoulders hunching in defeat.</p><p>\u201cYou sound so enthused,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma gave Stil a wan smile.</p><p>\u201cGemma, I love you,\u201d Stil repeated.</p><p>Gemma raised an eyebrow, wondering at the response, when Stil abruptly kissed her on the lips.</p><p>Although the movement was sudden, the feeling behind Stil\u2019s kiss was anything but. It was passionate and warmer than the heat charm. It reminded Gemma of the starfires at their most brilliant\u2014overwhelming but beautiful.</p><p>They parted when the white canine wriggled its way between them, making the pair chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Gemma asked as Stil adjusted his hold on her waist to bring her closer to him.</p><p>\u201cLoire?

He kissed Gemma\u2019s lower jaw. \u201cIs there nothing I can say that will change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you that much?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cI will miss you fiercely, but I won\u2019t begrudge you this time.

Arguing with you is tiresome,\u201d Gemma frowned.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Stil said, pressing his cheek to Gemma\u2019s head. \u201cI will miss you,\u201d he repeated.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that lock of my hair you have tucked away somewhere will aid the pain in your heart,\u201d Gemma dryly said.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you would pick up on that,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cMmhmm. There wasn\u2019t really a price to your magic, was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is, but only for pieces of magic I deliberately perform for a person. The thimble wouldn\u2019t have counted,\u201d Stil admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou are a hack,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cIt could be worse. I could have made you play the question game with me.\u201d</p><p>Gemma raised her eyebrows in an expression of apathy, but she couldn\u2019t help but laugh when Stil soundly kissed her again.</p><p>The pair settled on the settee and laughed and chatted late into the night, petting the transformed hellhound and enjoying each other\u2019s presence. (They did stop to hold a brief celebration when Angelique returned and Stil told the enchantress in training that he finally won Gemma over.)</p> <p>Gemma rested her head on Stil\u2019s chest and listened to his heartbeat. \u201cYou have to go tomorrow,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Stil kissed the top of Gemma\u2019s head. \u201cMe too, Gemma. Me too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>In spring, the wedding all of Verglas had waited for was finally held.</p><p>The bride was beautiful, dressed in a gorgeous white dress\u2014the likes of which had never been seen before. The groom was a dashing figure, waiting patiently for his bride with a smile as she walked down the aisle of the same cathedral that, months ago, had witnessed a battle.</p><p>The crowd gathered on this spring day was very different from those gathered for King Torgen\u2019s and Gemma\u2019s near-wedding. Today, the witnesses wore smiles and waved small replicas of the Verglas flag. The citizens of Ostfold were particularly overjoyed, and they cheered and hollered with abandon as the bride joined the groom on the dais.</p><p>\u201cStick a quill in my head and call me a rooster, but that savage miss of yours looks right beautiful today. You did fine work on that dress of hers,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, elbowing Gemma and speaking loudly to be heard over the joyous cheers of their fellow civilians.</p><p>\u201cLady Linnea has always been beautiful,\u201d Gemma loyally said, watching her close friend curtsey to the priest and her future husband\u2014King Toril.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but she doesn\u2019t look so false,\u201d Grandmother Guri agreed, \u201clike her expression is carved from marble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma said, smiling fondly as her eyes rested on the beautiful but serviceable dagger strapped to Lady Linnea\u2019s waist.</p><p>In the middle of winter, after he was crowned King and had ruled for a little time alone, King Toril\u2014to the shock of no civilians and all Verglas nobles\u2014asked Lady Linnea to marry him. Lady Linnea put aside all of her dreams of meeting military leaders and studying foreign armies to say yes, only to be surprised when King Toril modestly asked her to take charge of the Verglas military once they were married\u2014which would, of course, mean she would need to travel and observe what other countries were doing and, most importantly, answer the summons of nations from the Commanding General of Loire, Prince Severin.</p><p>That particular request shocked everyone\u2014except for those who lived near Grandmother Guri and pressed close to the walls of her house when, for one week straight, King Toril called upon the legendary seamstress, Gemma Kielland, and sought her advice.</p><p>He is one of the few men who could understand her, and she will make his reign even better, Gemma thought, smiling at the pair.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure the bumpkin could tame her, but he managed,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, as if she could hear Gemma\u2019s thoughts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gemma agreed, sitting down when the priest motioned for the congregation to be seated.</p><p>Gemma and Grandmother Guri were separated from the crowd, seated in chairs of honor near the base of the dais rather than the pews. Since Stil\u2019s public vow, Gemma had become something of a local legend, known as the girl who brought about King Torgen\u2019s demise.</p><p>Lady Linnea used the excuse to give Gemma special treatment, but truth be told, Gemma wished everyone wouldn\u2019t treat her so reverently. She missed haggling with the merchants\u2014who would now give her whatever price she asked for cloth\u2014and holding dislikable people, like Malfrid and Mrs. Hagen, in distaste. (Mrs. Hagen hadn\u2019t dared to criticize her chosen occupation since her return to Ostfold society, and Malfrid immediately married a farmer and moved away when the dust settled from Gemma\u2019s adventures.)</p><p>But most of all, she missed Stil.</p> <p>She wished she could talk to him about fine craftsmanship and show him her work on Lady Linnea\u2019s wedding dress. She missed his handsome smiles and even his stupid, wretched, question game.</p><p>\u201cWe are gathered here today for a beautiful event and occasion: the wedding of our monarch, King Toril, to the honorable Lady Linnea Lovland,\u201d the priest said when the cathedral had quieted enough that his squeaky voice could be heard.</p><p>His declaration brought about more cheers, and he was unable to continue as the civilians whistled and rejoiced.</p><p>The priest bore it well, smiling and folding his hands as he waited.</p><p>Before this winter, we have had precious little to celebrate, Gemma thought as she, too, clapped. But it is different now.</p> <p>\u201cVerglas is coming back, my girl,\u201d Grandmother Guri said, her voice just above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can feel it in the air. It\u2019s crisp and clean\u2014finally. People smile more\u2014which is a scary sight in some cases. No one fears to stick out anymore, and there\u2019s laughter. Yep, everything is right again. And your lady up there will make sure bumpkin keeps it that way,\u201d Grandmother Guri nodded.</p><p>If anyone deserved to call Toril bumpkin, it was Grandmother Guri. When the young king called on Gemma to ask for advice about Lady Linnea, Grandmother Guri had smacked the monarch upside the head a number of times when he was particularly slow to understand a point about the battle-crazed lady.</p><p>\u201cSo, that means you can finally leave with that mage of yours,\u201d Grandmother Guri added.</p><p>Gemma gaped at the elderly woman. The fact that they were witnessing the marriage of their monarch and Gemma\u2019s close companion was forgotten. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Gemma hissed.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sighing all the time and looking off into space like Jo-Jo when she\u2019s about to urp up her cud. You miss your mage, and that\u2019s fine. Now things have settled here; you\u2019ve got your barbaric lady taken care of, and there\u2019s nothing left for you to do. You can go,\u201d Grandmother Guri whispered.</p><p>\u201cHow did you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy girl, all of Ostfold was treated to a public performance of your love with that man. You can\u2019t think I didn\u2019t know\u2014that everyone in town doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Gemma adjusted her posture in her chair and fixed her gaze on Lady Linnea and King Toril, ignoring the astute observations of Grandmother Guri.</p><p>Within a few minutes, the ceremony was over.</p><p>\u201cOn behalf of this country\u2014civilians and nobility\u2014it is with great joy that I announce the marriage of our King Toril to Lady Linnea!\u201d the priest said. Even he could not contain his enthusiasm as he raised his hands in the air.</p><p>Church bells clanged, and everyone in the cathedral roared so much the floor vibrated. The citizens who could not cram their way into the church with the nobles cheered outside. When the doors opened up, Gemma could see that they threw rice and flower petals.</p><p>King Toril and Lady Linnea\u2014soon to be Queen Linnea once the royal couple arrived at the palace for her crowning\u2014swept down the aisle. Their faces were bright with happiness, and they laughed and clasped hands as they emerged from the cathedral and into the street.</p> <p>Verglas had good, valiant monarchs once again.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for making my dress, Gemma,\u201d Queen Linnea said, embracing Gemma when she caught her sneaking towards a table of drinks.</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure, My Lady,\u201d Gemma smiled.</p><p>Queen Linnea beamed and glanced over her shoulder at King Toril, who was seated at their table, laughing with one of his advisors.</p><p>The wedding feast was barely halfway over, and everyone was still exuberant and filled with joy and laughter. Well-wishers were lined up out the door, hoping to congratulate their king and new queen.</p><p>\u201cI know I asked you right after I agreed to marry him, but, what do you think of Toril?\u201d Queen Linnea asked, shyly looking at Gemma from under her eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s a gallant gentleman who loves you very much, and I know the two of you will be wonderful rulers,\u201d Gemma said.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d Queen Linnea asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gemma raised an eyebrow. \u201cHave I lied to you before, My Lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m just so happy. I can\u2019t believe it!\u201d Queen Linnea laughed, squeezing Gemma in another embrace that was so tight Gemma\u2019s spine cracked.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve this happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gemma. No, I mean it,\u201d Queen Linnea said when Gemma started to curtsey. \u201cNone of this would have happened\u2014none of this would have been possible without you.\u201d The new queen hesitated, her hand lingering on her dagger. \u201cI know I asked you to stay with me before this all began.\u201d</p> <p>Gemma nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cI realize now that\u2019s not possible,\u201d Queen Linnea continued as she shifted her gaze to her husband. \u201cI don\u2019t have the right to stand between you and that mage,\u201d she said, her voice dripping with disdain as she mentioned Stil. \u201cAnd I will miss you terribly, terribly much. When he comes to take you away, you must promise to write!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Lady, Stil is busy aiding Prince Severin and his allies. In all likelihood, you will see him before I do when you answer Prince Severin\u2019s summons,\u201d Gemma soothed.</p><p>Queen Linnea shook her head. \u201cGemma, the man faced down a monarch and a country for you. The truth is, as soon as he thinks Verglas will not mind your absence as much, he\u2019s going to come for you,\u201d she said, speaking the secret desires of Gemma\u2019s heart.</p><p>Gemma smiled. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is your wedding feast\u2014a time to rejoice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Queen Linnea sighed, looking down to adjust the skirt of her dress. When she looked up, her eyes landed on King Toril, and she smiled again. She turned to look at Gemma, her smile still in place. \u201cAll I wanted to say is that...I understand. I understand why you will leave, and whenever you come back, I will put aside everything\u2014even the army\u2014to welcome you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, My Lady,\u201d Gemma said, deeply touched by her friend\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cLinnea,\u201d Toril called.</p><p>\u201cRight. I should return to the rest of the guests. Enjoy the food\u2014take some back for the furball!\u201d Queen Linnea called over her shoulder as she headed for her husband, her magnificent dress dragging behind her.</p><p>Gemma shook her head at her friend\u2019s retreat and turned herself in the direction of her table. Grandmother Guri was holding court with a number of villager ladies. They were eagerly swapping gossip and stories as they crowded around the table that was specially prepared for Gemma, munching on dried fruit and krumkake\u2014thin cake rolls filled with whipped cream. A passing villager bowed to Gemma as he would to royalty, and a servant bearing a platter mimicked the motion when she noticed Gemma.</p><p>The heat of the hall beat on Gemma\u2019s shoulders like a giant, and all the laughter and shouts of celebration made her head throb. She cautiously inspected her surroundings to make sure she was not being watched before she slipped through a servant door.</p> <p>Her head eased the instant she closed the door behind her, but Gemma walked on, navigating her way through the palace\u2014which she now knew quite well. She found her way to the courtyard and gardens that overlooked Lake Sno and breathed in the cool, spring air.</p><p>The tranquility of the lake and the silence of the gardens soothed Gemma.</p><p>When a cold, wet nose bumped her hand, Gemma did not scream in surprise, but smiled. \u201cSorry, Hvit. I didn\u2019t bring you anything,\u201d she said, kneeling down to run her hands through the luxurious fur of her hellhound-turned-guardian.</p><p>The wolfish creature panted happily, his tongue hanging out as he twirled his curled tail. Somehow, the canine always knew where Gemma was and found her\u2014even if she locked him in Grandmother Guri\u2019s cottage. (Thank goodness Jo-Jo was even less impressed with Hvit than she was with Grandmother Guri!)</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finally settled,\u201d Gemma said, resting her head on her companion\u2019s shoulder. She was sure to get white hair all over her clothes, but she didn\u2019t care. With King Toril properly crowned and Lady Linnea married, there was little else Gemma had left to see to in Verglas. She was free. Free to travel and, hopefully, find Stil.</p><p>She missed him so much, even though they hadn\u2019t been together long. When she closed her eyes, she could still see the way his blue eyes gleamed when he teased her. Winter in Verglas was beautiful as usual, but Gemma was surprised by how deeply she felt Stil\u2019s absence. It was like a piece of her left with him.</p><p>Hvit went completely still for a moment\u2014going so far as to collect his tongue into his mouth. Then his nose twitched, and he returned to his happy pants, smearing his cold nose in Gemma\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Gemma missed Stil too much. She could have sworn she heard his rich, melodic voice.</p><p>\u201cGemma.\u201d</p><p>Gemma peered over Hvit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stil was standing just in reach of the torchlight, the silver embroidery on his cape gleaming. His hood was pushed down, and his unusual eyes were ringed by dark circles, but he was whole, and healthy, and he was here.</p><p>Gemma couldn\u2019t say a word. She scrambled to her feet and threw herself at the craftmage, clinging to him as the tears fell. Stil chuckled and slid his arms around Gemma. \u201cI know I\u2019m early, but I believe the deal was you would not leave until you saw Linnea happy?\u201d he said teasingly, resting his head on Gemma\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d Gemma whispered, her heart singing with joy.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Stil said.</p> <p>When Gemma finally looked up at him, Stil slid a hand under her jaw and kissed her long and passionately. After a minute, he pulled back and rested his forehead against hers. \u201cAlthough I must admit, a season was too long to be away from you. Let\u2019s not do this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Gemma said, sagging in Stil\u2019s arms. It was like coming home.</p><p>He smelled of metal and forges, but also of pine trees and the outdoors. He really was here!</p><p>\u201cI have come to take you away,\u201d Stil whispered in Gemma\u2019s ear. \u201cThis time...will you come?\u201d</p><p>Gemma smiled\u2014not a small one or soft one, but a rare smile. A wide smile that lit up her face and threatened to steal all of her good sense. \u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cFinally,\u201d Stil said, kissing her again.</p><p>The couple staggered when Hvit playfully bit on and pulled Stil\u2019s cloak. The craftmage released Gemma long enough to pet the mischievous lupine before picking Gemma up and twirling her around for the fun of it.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d Stil demanded, holding Gemma propped up.</p><p>\u201cYes. Will you marry me?\u201d Gemma asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019re going to have a charmed life,\u201d Stil decreed, setting Gemma down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fair pleased with yourself for marrying a seamstress, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Gemma wryly asked.</p> <p>\u201cOnly because you\u2019re a genius,\u201d Stil said. \u201cOne genius deserves another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see. We can play the question game whenever we travel\u2014and wherever we travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, joy,\u201d Gemma said, her voice dead.</p><p>\u201cI will have a house built for you wherever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerglas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepend upon it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will make so many cloaks and capes, you may have a different one for each occasion,\u201d Gemma said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I would really like is a rug,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>\u201cIt may take me time to learn how to weave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wait. In the meantime, I will have to hide you away. I told some of the other craftmages at Prince Severin\u2019s summit about you, and now they all want to get their paws on you,\u201d Stil said.</p><p>Gemma smiled at Stil, and Stil smiled at Gemma. They embraced and kissed again, breaking apart and laughing when Hvit circled them, snapping at Stil\u2019s cloak.</p><p>On an upper balcony, Queen Linnea seethed as she watched the spectacle below. \u201cI knew that rat wouldn\u2019t take long to show up and spirit her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling?\u201d King Toril tried.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s even craftier than I am. What a snake,\u201d Queen Linnea said.</p><p>\u201cLinnea,\u201d King Toril said, placing a hand on Queen Linnea\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s happy. Leave her. She has sacrificed plenty; it is her turn now,\u201d the young king said.</p><p>Queen Linnea studied her new husband. \u201cYour understanding of love is rapidly improving,\u201d she said.</p><p>King Toril allowed himself a smile. \u201cA wise lady once said to me that it takes work to build a lasting relationship. You both have done the work. Your relationship will be a lasting one. She will not forget you, Linnea, anymore than you could forget her.\u201d</p><p>Linnea\u2019s anger withdrew, and she smiled. \u201cYou are right. I love Gemma\u2014no matter where she wanders in this land. I love you, and I am so happy...and so blessed.\u201d</p><p>King Toril offered his arm. Queen Linnea took it, and the royal couple left the balcony and returned to the celebration while the Craftmage and Seamstress remained in the courtyard, talking, laughing, and loving.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Peder the miller was known to be a generally useless man. Even after his daughter became the savior of Verglas, was the best friend to the queen, married a craftmage, and was renown across the continent for her skill with a needle and her ability to make clothes that could take and hold spells and enchantments for ages, Peder still had a reputation as the town drunkard. The only thing that changed was he now occasionally had useful bits of information on the much-esteemed Gemma.</p><p>On any given night, one could still find him in the Sno Hauk tavern, in his usual seat at the dilapidated bar. Tonight was no different.</p><p>Peder marched into the Sno Hauk, bearing a pocket of money and, unusually so, a framed portrait that he carried with rare care.</p><p>\u201cAlf Skeie, you lying sunk,\u201d Peder declared, setting the portrait on the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Alf said, his weasel face scrunching up with displeasure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been spreading rumors about my Gemma and her mage,\u201d Peder said. As he hadn\u2019t yet drunken anything, he could shake a finger at Alf without falling over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave not,\u201d Alf said.</p><p>\u201cBest not lie, Alf Skeie,\u201d Otto the barkeep said. \u201cNot two nights ago, I heard you telling an out-of-town guest that craftmage Stil was not quite three feet tall and as ugly as a warped cabbage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?

I didn\u2019t say nothing,\u201d Alf squeaked.</p><p>\u201cAlf Skeie,\u201d the guard said, making Alf shrink. \u201cI will remember your weasel face. If I hear you talking badly of our Gemma Kielland again, there will be a reckoning,\u201d he said.</p><p>Alf swallowed sharply.</p><p>\u201cYou want some help, Foss?\u201d the sword-wielding guard asked.</p><p>\u201cNah, this one isn\u2019t worth it,\u201d the unarmed guard said, scowling darkly at Alf before returning to his table.</p><p>\u201cWell, how do you like that?\u201d Peder happily said, plopping down on his stool and popping a coin onto the counter. \u201cOtto, a pint, if you will!\u201d</p> <p>Otto poured a drink for Peder as Big Tim and Small Tim joined the miller.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha got there?\u201d Small Tim asked, squinting at the painted portrait.</p><p>\u201cMy son-in-law sent it to me. It\u2019s him and Gemma,\u201d Peder proudly said after taking a swig of his beer. \u201cIsn\u2019t she beautiful?\u201d</p><p>Small Tim studied the painting with eagerness\u2014planning to carry the details of it in his mind to relay to his wife.</p><p>The portrait was of Gemma and her husband\u2014the famous craftmage Stil\u2014or Rumpelstiltskin. Stil was reclining on mound of pillows, his blue eyes lit with adoration and affection as he looked across the painting at Gemma.</p><p>Gemma was seated on a cushioned settee, a soft smile on her lips, and her hand raised as she appeared to pull a needle through an exquisitely embroidered piece of fabric. She wore a Loire-style dress, which was soft blue in color, didn\u2019t cover either of her shoulders, and had wide sleeves and a tight bodice.</p><p>Gemma\u2019s hair was elaborately braided, although wavy strands had come loose and framed her face. She had gold bracelets and necklaces, and gold barrettes secured her hair.</p><p>Curled up at her feet was a giant, white, wolf-ish creature. It had a woven collar that was the same color as Gemma\u2019s dress, although it looked out of the portrait with blazing blue eyes.</p> <p>Long ago, before King Torgen died, Small Tim would have been hard-pressed to call Gemma beautiful. But seeing the portrait\u2014the way happiness softened her face and made her glow, and seeing her relaxed, almost liquid posture\u2014Small Tim couldn\u2019t think of a prettier girl in Ostfold.</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Small Tim finally said.</p><p>\u201cThat Gemma Kielland,\u201d Big Tim said, peering over Small Tim\u2019s shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s done well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGemma Kielland has done more than well,\u201d one of the guards said. \u201cShe has done great things, and she continues to do so as she aids other countries in their battle against dark magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d said several other Sno Hauk patrons.</p><p>Otto raised his own mug. \u201cTo Gemma Kielland,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTo Gemma Kielland!\u201d</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
