AboveWorld roared and flashed, turning dark-time to light-time. But there was something more, something different that trembled through the strands of silk. Something she\u2019d never felt before.</p> <p>AboveWorld roared and flashed again. Then something screamed\u2014a terrible shuddering in her web\u2014and a piece of AboveWorld crashed into World, ripping, tearing, roaring, shrieking.</p><p>Dark Wet splashed her, splashed her web, at the same moment something struck the web near the center. Prey?</p><p>Hunger overcame hesitation. She hurried along the threads, intending to secure her meal before heading back to the safer, more sheltered edge of her web.</p><p>But the something was hard and had no meat. As she tried to sink her fangs into it, she ingested some of the Dark Wet, and that . . . filled her, flowed through her, sang inside her.</p><p>Changed her.</p> <p>After cleaning off every bit of Dark Wet, she discarded the something and hurried back to the sheltered edge of her web to wait out the storm.</p><p>2</p><p>Light. And a hunger. For meat, yes. But also for something more.</p><p>Leaving her web, she traveled along the Rough that stretched out over World until she reached a place where the piece of AboveWorld had crashed into World. The Dark Wet still sang inside her, almost too quiet to feel, but it was enough to guide her to more of the Dark Wet.</p><p>Fixing an anchor thread to the Rough, she spun out silk. The World trembled with anger. The air quivered with grief and despair . . . and longing.</p><p>Her legs touched the piece of AboveWorld. Hard, like the something that had struck her web. Moving cautiously, she found a place where the Hard was torn away, revealing meat\u2014and the Dark Wet.</p> <p>After consuming as much of the Dark Wet as she could, she sank her fangs into meat and pumped her venom into the spot. It would only liquefy a tiny bit of meat, but that tiny bit would feed her well.</p><p>So she spun a web as close as she could to the meat\u2014and the Dark Wet that seeped over the meat.</p><p>3</p><p>In dreams, she unfurled her wings and sailed through the Darkness\u2014a vastness that was outside the body, and yet the body became its vessel; a power reached by heart and mind and spirit. Through it flowed the whispers of creation . . . and the silence of destruction. Her race had spiraled down its chasms and canyons and strange abysses for years beyond memory\u2014and had understood that they would never understand this place that was, and wasn\u2019t, a place.</p><p>In dreams, the vision of webs shining in the Darkness hadn\u2019t dazzled and overwhelmed her mind, hadn\u2019t blinded her to the danger of the storm, and she had reached the caves on this island that she had chosen as her final resting place. But the wounds received because of the storm were fatal, and the caves were too far away.</p><p>No. Not quite true. She could have used her power to shift her broken body to the caves, but she felt a small tug, a small promise that her unique gift would not be lost if she remained where she was.</p><p>So in a dream that was more than a dream, she sent her last vision to her mother, Draca, showing her Queen how the new caretakers of the world would be able to travel safely through the Darkness: shimmering, colored webs of power stretched through that vastness\u2014pathways that could be reached from the Realms.</p><p>She could not say why the beautiful symmetry of the web resonated so strongly inside her, but the image didn\u2019t fade from her mind, despite the agony that clawed at her flesh. Nor could she say why, as she drifted between visions and dreams, she felt certain there was something nearby, something small and golden, that would be able to hold her particular gift.</p> <p>She would have enough time. Just enough time. If this potential Weaver wanted what she had to give.</p><p>4</p><p>Light-time ... day. Dark-time ... night. AboveWorld ... sky. Rough . . . tree. Hard . . . scale. Dark Wet . . . blood. Meat . . .</p><p>Sorrow. Pain. Longing. Need. Hope.</p><p>... dragon.</p><p>She . . . spider. Small. Golden.</p><p>Momentarily distracted by the strange thoughts, the spider returned to her housekeeping, rolled up the tattered remains of her old web, along with the discarded prey, then spun a fresh web. She did not spin in order to catch prey. She spun to keep other things away from the flesh that not only fed her body but sang to her about things she had never known existed. The World kept shifting as she absorbed the Weaver, showing her new things in the familiar.</p><p>Showing her ancient things in the familiar.</p><p>Showing her a Need for Weavers who could spin dreams into shapes that could walk in the World, for Weavers who could spin dreams into flesh.</p><p>She did not understand this Need, but it flavored the flesh her venom liquefied for her to ingest. So at night, when she was safely tucked beneath the scales in the hollow created by her feedings, she drifted on the tangled, silken threads of the dragon\u2019s longings and dreams\u2014and began to learn how to weave a different kind of web.</p><p>5</p><p>Perhaps the other Seers were right. Perhaps her particular gift was too dangerous to give to the new caretakers of the Realms. Perhaps there was no other race that could, or should, take the deepest heart-dreams and provide a bridge for those dreams to become flesh.</p><p>But those dreams would be needed in the world. She knew that with unshakable certainty. They would be needed\u2014and it was unlikely even the simplest of those dreams would ever exist because she hadn\u2019t reached the caves as she\u2019d intended. She wouldn\u2019t make the same transition as the rest of her race, transforming her scales into Jewels that would serve as a reservoir for the power the new caretakers could not contain in their smaller, weaker bodies. The Jewels that came from her should have been the vessels that contained her gift and would have changed the wearer into a Seer that could shape dreams into flesh. Now . . .</p><p>Did her mother know she was trapped on this island, exposed and dying? Did her sire, the great Prince of the Dragons, sense her fading presence in the world? Would they feel disappointment in her that, during moments of despair and heartache and hope, she was trying to pass her gift to a small, golden spider?</p><p>She should have stayed in the dark mountain that was the lair of the Prince and the Queen. She should have curled up in one of the deep hollows within that mountain and followed the rest of her race into the forever sleep. Instead she had followed a vision of a cave filled with dreams\u2014a vision that would never come to pass.</p><p>Soon now. Soon. Her body was failing. Her power was fading. Soon she would be free of the world. Soon.</p><p>Closing her gold eyes, she drifted on dreams.</p><p>6</p><p>So much sorrow gave the flesh a bitter taste, but the spider remained, burrowing deeper beneath the scales for meat that still seeped blood, was still fresh. And it wasn\u2019t all bitter. When the daring male had approached her and indicated his willingness to mate, Dragon\u2019s flesh had been tastier that day, as if the mating had drawn sweeter memories to the surface.</p><p>Since she wanted her hatchlings to feed on this flesh that was making her more than just a spider, she worked to find a way to reach the memories, to see the dreams.</p><p>Dragon had shown her before. Why wouldn\u2019t Dragon show her now?</p><p>Frustrated, she climbed up to Dragon\u2019s jaw, anchored a strand of silk, and began to build a web. But as she built the web, she . . . felt things. So she spun them into the web, ignoring instinct and placing the threads where they needed to be. Sorrow. Pain. Longing. Need. Hope.</p><p>As she cautiously traveled the strands of the completed tangled web, warmth flowed through her. She paused, absorbed the feel of this sensation, and added one more small thread. Joy.</p><p>Suddenly she saw the caves, the place Dragon had intended to go to do the finest dreaming. And in those caves, she saw golden spiders, much larger than herself, spinning tangled webs.</p><p>Sound, faint and fading, filled her.</p><p>*You have learned well,* Dragon said. *But heed me, little one. You must guard the webs you weave that make dreams into flesh. Many beings will cherish those webs because they are spun out of magic that lives in the heart. But there will be others who will want to destroy that heart-magic before it can touch the world. Guard the webs . . . Weaver of Dreams.*</p><p>Dragon\u2019s breath came out in a long sigh . . . and then there was silence.</p><p>7</p><p>The golden spider spun out the last thread of the web that filled the space between Dragon\u2019s jaw and shoulder. Most of her offspring had gone away, just ordinary spiders who would spin ordinary webs and catch ordinary prey. But the few who were different, who were like her, had stayed nearby, learning how to spin the tangled webs.</p><p>Despite the size of her web, she had caught only one small dream, but that one held a deep well of yearning . . . and a taste of sorrow that was, somehow, connected to Dragon. So she plucked the thread of yearning, sending it back to the heart it had come from.</p><p>As day turned to night, she settled into the most sheltered edge of her web\u2014and wondered about the dreamer.</p><p>8</p><p>Day had barely touched the sky when she sensed a Presence that resonated with her tangled web. She waited, feeling the faint tremble of footfalls on the earth, the change in the air.</p><p>*Sso. My daughter wass able to passs on her gift after all.*</p><p>The voice that flowed through her felt like Dragon, but wasn\u2019t quite Dragon.</p><p>The Presence approached her web. Her offspring plucked the strands of their own webs, trying to ensnare the Presence\u2019s mind. But the Presence didn\u2019t respond, didn\u2019t give any sign that it had felt the tugs and whispers in those webs.</p><p>*Blood singss to blood,* the Presence said, leaning over the spider\u2019s tangled web. *Remember me.*</p><p>A drop of blood fell on a knot of tangled threads, a glistening bead of power.</p><p>The spider waited until the Presence went away before hurrying over to devour the offering.</p><p>Power flowed through her, a power even stronger and richer than Dragon\u2019s had been.</p><p>Draca.</p><p>Dragon\u2019s Mother. Dragon\u2019s Queen.</p><p>Remember me.</p><p>For hours that day, the spider stroked the strands of her tangled web, remembering Dragon, remembering the feel of Draca. Not shaped like Dragon, but still a dragon.</p><p>This dream web had done what it was meant to do. Draca would not sorrow for Dragon anymore because she had seen that, in the most important way, Dragon was still in the world. Small now, and golden, but still in the world.</p><p>The spider carefully cut the anchoring threads and just as carefully rolled the web into a cocoon. She traveled down Dragon\u2019s neck and shoulder until she reached the hole in the chest.</p><p>Perhaps it was the way of Dragon\u2019s kind, or perhaps it was some last bit of magic that had changed Dragon\u2019s flesh into porous rock covered with hard stone scales. Inside Dragon were several chambers where she could spin the first stage of a web, then listen, quiet and protected, while the strongest heart-dreams drifted over her, guiding her as she created her web.</p><p>The time would come when she and her offspring would make the long journey to the caves where the golden spiders would protect the webs of dreams that would become flesh. But not yet.</p><p>She squeezed through the opening that led to a small chamber and pulled the cocoon in with her.</p><p>Dragon\u2019s body was hollow stone now, but the heart hadn\u2019t rotted like the rest of the organs. It had changed to smooth stone. Whenever the spider came to this chamber and brushed a leg over that stone, the chamber filled with warmth, and she felt Dragon\u2019s joy that the Weaver\u2019s gift had not been lost.</p><p>The day would come when she no longer felt that warmth, and the stone would be no more than a stone. When that day came, she would leave. But even then, whatever bit of heart-memory might remain wouldn\u2019t be alone.</p><p>Before leaving the chamber, she spun out some silk and attached the cocoon of Draca\u2019s dream to Dragon\u2019s stone heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THE PRINCE OF EBON RIH</p><p>This story takes place after the events in Heir to the Shadows</p><p>ONE</p><p>Lucivar Yaslana stood at the far end of the flagstone courtyard of his new home, enjoying the early morning sunlight that had begun warming the stones beneath his feet. The mountain air felt chilly against his bare skin, and the freshly made coffee he sipped from a plain white mug tasted rough enough to make him wince. Didn\u2019t matter. The coffee might not have the smooth potency that Mrs. Beale produced for his father\u2019s table, but it wasn\u2019t any worse than what he made when he went hunting and spent a night out on the land. Couldn\u2019t be any worse, since he\u2019d made it the same way.</p> <p>He looked over his shoulder at the open door that led into the warren of rooms that made up the eyrie. Some of the rooms had been carved out of the living mountain; others had been built from the extracted stone. The result would have been a nightmare for any race that needed predictable lines and angles in a structure, but for anyone born of the Eyrien race, it was perfect.</p><p>And this particular eyrie was now his.</p><p>Smiling, he closed his gold eyes and tipped his head back to feel the sun on his face. Slowly opening his dark, membranous wings, he savored the feel of sunlight and chilly air playing over his wings and light-brown skin.</p><p>In all of his seventeen hundred years, he\u2019d never had a home until three years ago when he\u2019d been reunited with his father\u2014the man who, through the machinations of Dorothea, Hayll\u2019s High Priestess, had had his two younger sons taken from him. The man who had never forgotten or forgiven the betrayals that had left scars on all of them.</p><p>He\u2019d been happy living in the suite of rooms at SaDiablo Hall, but the Hall was still his father\u2019s house. This place was his. Exclusively, totally his.</p> <p>*Yas?*</p><p>Well, maybe not exclusively his.</p><p>Sipping his coffee, Lucivar watched the adolescent wolf trot toward him. The youngster had been ready to leave the pack that lived in the north woods of his father\u2019s estate but hadn\u2019t wanted to go back to the Territory most of the kindred wolves called home. Tassle had grown up near humans and wanted to learn more about them, but there still weren\u2019t many places where the wild kindred could safely live in human Territories\u2014and there still weren\u2019t many humans beyond Jaenelle Angelline\u2019s court who felt easy about living around an animal who had the same power as the human Blood. Since he now had plenty of land for a wolf to roam in, it was easy enough to share the space.</p><p>Tassle, Lucivar thought, raising the mug to hide his smile. What kind of name was Tassle for a Warlord wolf? \u201cGood morning. Smell anything interesting?\u201d</p><p>*Yes. Yas, you aren\u2019t wearing your cow skin.*</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called leather.\u201d Which Tassle knew perfectly well. Humans had prejudices, but so did the kindred. If something could be described by referring to the animal it came from, they ignored the human word for the end result. They viewed the world from their own furry perspective, which was fair, he supposed, since no two people, let alone two species, would view the world around them in quite the same way. \u201cI don\u2019t need clothes right now. It\u2019s a fine morning, we\u2019re alone up here, and it\u2019s not like anyone living in the valley is going to see me.\u201d</p> <p>*But, Yas\u2014*</p><p>He sensed it then. Someone coming up the stone stairs from the landing area below had passed through the perimeter shield he\u2019d placed around the eyrie. The shield wasn\u2019t meant to keep anyone out, just to alert him if someone approached his home.</p><p>As he turned toward the intruder, Helene, his father\u2019s housekeeper, hurried up the last few steps, then stopped abruptly when she reached the flagstones and saw him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Prince Yaslana,\u201d she said politely.</p><p>\u201cHelene,\u201d he replied with equal, if forced, politeness\u2014especially when a dozen maids who worked at the Hall came up the stairs and gave him a quick, and approving, glance before going into the eyrie.</p><p>Well, Lucivar thought sourly, they all got an eyeful to perk up their morning. \u201cWhat brings you here, Helene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that all the workmen are done with the renovations the High Lord felt were necessary to make Prince Andulvar\u2019s old eyrie livable again, we\u2019ve come to give it a good cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already cleaned the place.\u201d</p> <p>She made a sound that told him what she thought of his ability to clean anything. But that was a hearth witch for you. If it didn\u2019t sparkle, shine, or gleam, it wasn\u2019t clean. Never mind that stone walls weren\u2019t supposed to sparkle, shine, or gleam.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Lucivar said, knowing he was cornered and arguing was a waste of breath. \u201cI\u2019ll get dressed and show you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Helene waved her hand dismissively. \u201cYou were obviously enjoying a fine morning. There\u2019s no reason why you should do otherwise. I\u2019m sure we can find everything. What there is of it,\u201d she added under her breath.</p><p>He bared his teeth in what he hoped would be mistaken as a smile. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be a distraction.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a fast sweep with her eyes. \u201cYou won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar just stared at her, too stunned to think of anything to say.</p><p>Helene sniffed delicately. \u201cI won\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen better, but I\u2019ve seen just as good.\u201d</p><p>Who? He could think of one man Helene could have walked in on and surprised.</p><p>As she headed for the door, another woman\u2019s voice, coming from the stairs, said, \u201cCome along, ladies. We don\u2019t want to interrupt too much of the Prince\u2019s day.\u201d</p><p>Helene turned toward the stairs, the light of battle in her eyes, as Merry bounded up the last few stairs and saw him. Along with her husband, Briggs, Merry ran a tavern and inn in Riada, the closest Blood village in the valley.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Merry said with approval. Then she noticed Helene, and the glint in her eyes didn\u2019t bode well for a peaceful morning.</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d Lucivar said, wondering if he was going to start his day breaking up a brawl outside his door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to clean up the eyrie for the Prince,\u201d Merry said stiffly, indicating the women crowding the stairs behind her. \u201cAs a welcome to Ebon Rih since he\u2019ll be living here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Prince Yaslana appreciates the gesture, but I\u2019ve brought some of my staff from the Hall to take care of things,\u201d Helene replied.</p><p>\u201cLadies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to be taking time away from your own duties. We can look after him. He is the Warlord Prince of Ebon Rih now,\u201d Merry said.</p><p>\u201cWhich doesn\u2019t make him any less his father\u2019s son\u2014\u201d Helene said, raising her voice.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire! They were squaring off like two bitches ready to fight over a meaty bone\u2014and he was not going to become the prize of whoever won this battle.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I won\u2019t have it said that any of the High Lord\u2019s children are living in squalor,\u201d Helene continued.</p><p>Lucivar gritted his teeth. Squalor? Squalor? He\u2019d moved to the eyrie two days ago. There hadn\u2019t been time to accumulate squalor. \u201cLadies.\u201d</p><p>They turned on him, and after studying them the way he\u2019d study any adversary, he wisely swallowed his rising temper. Helene worked for his father, and since he would, no doubt, continue to spend time at the Hall, telling her to leave would be an insult he didn\u2019t want to live with. And Merry made the best steak pies he\u2019d ever tasted. If he told her to go, it might be years before he had another slice of steak pie.</p><p>Finally Helene turned to Merry and said, \u201cWhile yours is the more recent claim, it is equally valid. And there\u2019s more than enough work for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Merry nodded, then clapped her hands. \u201cCome along, ladies. We\u2019ve work to do.\u201d</p><p>Four of the women who\u2019d come with Merry were married or, at least, had acknowledged lovers. The other seven were younger and unattached\u2014and would have dawdled a lot longer if Merry and Helene hadn\u2019t herded them into the eyrie.</p><p>When he\u2019d been a slave in Terreillean courts, he\u2019d been stripped down and displayed for the enjoyment of the Queen who controlled the Ring of Obedience. He\u2019d never felt the need to smile politely while he was being ogled. But here he was, smiling\u2014showing his teeth, anyway\u2014as Helene pushed the last witch inside and closed the door.</p><p>Rage danced in his belly, twisting it into knots. He closed his eyes and tightened the leash on his temper. He had an explosive one, and it had served him well when he\u2019d lived in Terreille, but this wasn\u2019t the same. He hadn\u2019t been forced to strip down. He\u2019d been standing outside of his own free will, and if the women who had suddenly appeared appreciated the view he provided, he couldn\u2019t blame them for it.</p><p>Thank the Darkness none of them had tried to touch him. He wasn\u2019t sure what he would have done if any of them had tried.</p><p>No. That wasn\u2019t true. He knew what he would have done. He just didn\u2019t know how he would have explained breaking a woman\u2019s arm for a touch they\u2019d all think of as harmless or, at the very worst, an invitation.</p><p>*Yas?* Tassle\u2019s sending on a psychic thread sounded hesitant, a little fearful.</p><p>Turning, Lucivar looked at the young wolf. \u201cWomen are a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Confusion replaced fear. *Pain? They didn\u2019t nip you. Why is there pain?* After a pause, Tassle added, *I could lick it to make it better.*</p><p>Maybe it wasn\u2019t just for Tassle\u2019s sake that he\u2019d offered to share his home with a wolf, Lucivar decided as amusement eased the knots in his belly. You could never tell what the kindred would pick up from human behavior and decide to make their own. Obviously, Tassle had decided the wolf version of \u201ckiss it and make it better\u201d was the appropriate response to this situation.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Lucivar said, moving away from the eyrie to walk in the rock-strewn grass that might have been a lawn or a garden once upon a time. He swallowed a mouthful of coffee and swore. Not only rough enough to bite but now it was also cold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noticing the way Tassle sniffed the air, Lucivar made a \u201cgo forward\u201d gesture with one hand. \u201cGo on. Go explore. If you stay around here, you\u2019ll end up getting washed and polished.\u201d</p><p>*You come too?*</p><p>He hadn\u2019t had a chance yet to really walk the land around the eyrie and get a feel for it, but leaving right now felt a bit too much like running away\u2014and it went against his nature as an Eyrien Warlord Prince to run from a battleground. \u201cYou go on. I\u2019ll keep an eye on things here.\u201d</p><p>As he watched Tassle trot off to mark the home territory, he felt the weight of the eyrie at his back and wondered if it really would be running away to get out of sight while all of those women cluttered up his home. Besides, if his presence wasn\u2019t a distraction from the allure of buckets and mops, his absence wouldn\u2019t be noted either. Which should have pleased him. The fact that it didn\u2019t was an annoyance he\u2019d think about later.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d wish you a good morning,\u201d a deep, amused voice said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Turning, he watched the slender, brown-skinned man cross the rock-strewn ground with feline grace. The movement lifted the edges of the knee-length black cape, revealing the red lining and providing slashes of color to accent the black tunic jacket and trousers.</p><p>His brother Daemon moved with the same feline grace.</p><p>He tried not to think about Daemon too much, tried not to wonder too often if his brother had found a way out of the madness the Blood called the Twisted Kingdom. There was nothing he could do for Daemon, wherever he was.</p><p>He pushed those thoughts aside and focused on the man settling on a stone that time and the elements had weathered into a natural seat. He looked like a handsome man at the end of his prime, his black hair silvered at the temples and faint lines around his golden eyes\u2014an aristo Hayllian male who would be in his element at a dinner party and wouldn\u2019t know what to do on a killing field.</p> <p>Looks could be deceiving. This was Saetan Daemon SaDiablo, a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince who was the Prince of the Darkness, High Lord of Hell, Warlord Prince of Dhemlan, Steward of the Dark Court at Ebon Askavi ... and his father.</p><p>It was the last title that made Lucivar wary. There weren\u2019t any clear rules when it came to sons dealing with fathers. Not that he paid much attention to rules, but it would have been nice to know when he was about to do something that would stomp on Saetan\u2019s toes and end with them yelling at each other. Which he did know, actually. Every time Jaenelle said, \u201cLucivar, I have a wonderful idea\u201d and he went along with it, he could pretty much count on ending up in Saetan\u2019s study to receive a blistering lecture. Too bad he enjoyed squaring off with his father as much as he enjoyed getting into trouble with the golden-haired, sapphire-eyed witch who was Saetan\u2019s adopted daughter\u2014and, therefore, his sister. The fact that Jaenelle was the Queen of Ebon Askavi and they both served in the First Circle of her court just added spice to their shouting matches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business, but I am curious,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cWhy are you standing out here displaying your assets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing out here because my home has been invaded by two dozen women with brooms and buckets\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo dozen? I wasn\u2019t aware Helene brought that many from the Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t. Some of the women from Riada showed up right after Helene did. And this is how I was dressed\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2014or not dressed,\u201d Saetan murmured.</p><p>\u201c\u2014when they showed up.\u201d Lucivar took another gulp of coffee and shuddered. \u201cAnd getting dressed after I\u2019d been assured I wouldn\u2019t be a distraction seemed like . . . bragging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Who told you this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelene. She said she\u2019d seen just as good.\u201d Lucivar eyed his father.</p><p>Saetan shook his head. \u201cNo. I will not indulge in a pissing contest with you to appease your curiosity. Besides, you\u2019ve seen me naked.\u201d</p><p>True enough, but he\u2019d only noticed Saetan looked damn fit for a man who\u2019d seen over fifty thousand years. He hadn\u2019t paid attention to particulars.</p><p>\u201cSo Helene said you wouldn\u2019t be a distraction,\u201d Saetan said, looking more amused. \u201cAnd you believed her because . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Hell\u2019s fire, she\u2019s your housekeeper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s also a woman in her prime who is, in fact, only a few centuries older than you.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar stared at Saetan. \u201cShe lied to me?\u201d</p><p>Saetan\u2019s gold eyes gleamed with suppressed laughter. \u201cLet me put it this way: Your floors won\u2019t be swept, but you\u2019ll have the cleanest windows in Ebon Rih\u2014at least on this side of the eyrie.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar spun around. Female faces were pressed against every window, watching him. Oh, there were cleaning rags pressed against the windows, too, but nothing was being done with them\u2014until the women realized he\u2019d seen them. Then there was a lot of vigorous polishing.</p><p>Swearing under his breath, he used Craft to vanish the coffee mug and call in a pair of leather trousers. As he pulled them on, he snarled, \u201cIt was easier when I could use my fists. If this was Terreille, I would have thrown the lot of them off the mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still can.\u201d</p><p>It surprised him that the words hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Warlord Prince of Ebon Rih,\u201d Saetan said quietly. \u201cYou are the law here and answer to no one but your Queen. If you want to use your fists, there\u2019s no one who will stop you. No one here who can stop you since you wear the Ebon-gray Jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to that code of honor you live by and insist is followed in the court?\u201d Lucivar snapped, letting temper ride the crest of wounded feelings. \u201cWhat happened to the lines that are drawn for what a Blood male can and can\u2019t do? If I hurt them for no good reason, what does that say to every other man? That he can strike out for the least little thing? We serve. We\u2019re the defenders and protectors. I\u2019ve hurt women, and I\u2019ve killed women. They were the enemy and the court was the battleground. But I will not be the kind of man women cower from because they\u2019re afraid of being brutalized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cYou\u2019ll decide what is and isn\u2019t acceptable in Ebon Rih, and you\u2019ll stand as defender and protector. As volatile as your temper is, as physical as your responses are most of the time, I\u2019ve never worried about you hurting the coven. If you\u2019re pushed, you push back. That\u2019s not a bad thing. I\u2019m sure there were times in the past three years when something scraped a nerve and reminded you too much of what it was like living in Terreille, but you didn\u2019t lash out automatically. You won\u2019t now.\u201d</p><p>The temper faded, but his feelings were still raw. \u201cThen why did you say that?\u201d</p><p>Saetan smiled. \u201cBecause you needed to hear yourself draw the line. You\u2019re the strongest living male in this valley. The strongest Blood, regardless of gender, when Jaenelle isn\u2019t at the Keep or staying at her cottage. Having that much power isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>He would know, Lucivar thought. Saetan wore the Black Jewels. Until Daemon made the Offering to the Darkness and came away wearing the Black, Saetan had been the only male in the history of the Blood to wear that Jewel. If anyone knew the price that came with that much power, it was the High Lord.</p><p>Lucivar glanced at the eyrie. \u201cWhat should I do about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHire a housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cHell\u2019s fire. Then I\u2019ll have a female underfoot all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom where I\u2019m sitting, your choice is one hearth witch who works for you or dealing with this lot two or three times a week.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar felt his knees weaken. \u201cTwo or three\u2014Why? How many times can they polish the same few pieces of furniture?\u201d</p><p>Saetan just looked at him pityingly. \u201cIf you hire a housekeeper, your home is her domain, and if she\u2019s worth what you pay her, she\u2019ll be territorial enough to take care of any unwanted help without you having to do a thing.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound bad. But he sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to hire a housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>Saetan stood up and arranged the folds of his cape. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the Keep and discuss it over breakfast?\u201d He looked back at the eyrie. \u201cOr were you planning to stay here and get in the middle of the tussle over who would cook it for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can cook my own damn breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could try, boyo, but the odds are against you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah. If he walked back in there now, somebody would be pissed off at him before he even got close to a piece of toast, let alone something more substantial. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the Keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wise choice.\u201d</p><p>As they walked back to the eyrie to inform Helene that they were leaving, Lucivar said, \u201cIf I\u2019m so wise and so powerful, tell me again why I have to hire a housekeeper I don\u2019t want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not a fool,\u201d Saetan replied. \u201cAnd given your choices, only a fool would put up with this any longer than he had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is more than I bargained for when Jaenelle appointed me the Warlord Prince of Ebon Rih.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything has a price. This is yours. Deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar sighed and gave up. So he\u2019d have to put up with having one little hearth witch underfoot. How bad could it be?</p><p>TWO</p><p>Saetan stepped out of the carriage and walked away from the Hall, wanting a few minutes to savor the sweet night air. It had been a pleasure escorting Sylvia to see her oldest son\u2019s debut theater performance. Watching her play the role of \u201cQueen enjoying an amateur production put on by her village\u2019s theater group\u201d had been more entertaining than the play. No one would have guessed she was a nervous mother\u2014unless she\u2019d been grabbing that person\u2019s hand and squeezing his fingers numb every time Beron came onstage.</p><p>He enjoyed spending time with Sylvia. They\u2019d clashed sometimes, but she\u2019d offered support and understanding\u2014and, occasionally, a caustic tongue\u2014while Jaenelle was an adolescent, and they\u2019d become friends in the process. So it gave him pleasure to stand as her escort when she needed the company of a friend who wouldn\u2019t expect her to act like Halaway\u2019s Queen.</p><p>But it also had produced a dull ache inside him to watch Sylvia\u2019s face while she watched her son, to see her eyes shine with pride and remember the times when his wife, Hekatah, had sat beside him during an amateur performance, her face set in bored tolerance, or when the seat beside him had been empty because she wouldn\u2019t make an appearance at something so common\u2014not even for one of her sons.</p><p>When he\u2019d first met her, Hekatah had given a performance to rival any actress on the stage. She\u2019d made him believe she loved him. But she\u2019d never loved the man, just the dark power he wielded. She\u2019d never loved her sons. She\u2019d never loved anything but herself and her ambition.</p><p>He locked those thoughts away, as he locked so many away. He didn\u2019t want to think about Hekatah and a past that was long gone\u2014and still had the power to hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was for the best that he and Sylvia could never be more than friends. Being a Guardian, he was one of the few Blood who straddled the line between living and dead in order to extend their lifetimes into years beyond counting. But everything had a price, and the sheer weight of the years he had lived had silenced the craving for sex.</p><p>Just as well. He could protect his heart while he and Sylvia were friends. If it had been possible for them to become lovers . . .</p><p>Too many years between them. And he was who and what he was.</p><p>It was better this way. He would continue to tell himself that. One day, he might even believe it.</p> <p>Any thoughts of Sylvia fled when he walked into the Hall and found Beale, his butler, waiting for him. That wasn\u2019t unusual in itself, except . . . something didn\u2019t feel quite right. Something was missing.</p><p>He opened his psychic senses, searching, probing. It took a moment because her dark psychic scent permeated the walls of SaDiablo Hall, but he knew what was missing. Who was missing.</p><p>And yet the anticipation in Beale\u2019s gold eyes didn\u2019t seem anxious in any way, so Saetan removed his cape and used Craft to vanish it before making the opening statement in this game of verbal chess. \u201cGood evening, Beale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh Lord,\u201d Beale replied. \u201cYou had a pleasant evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. The play was charming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the dinner?\u201d</p><p>Ah. \u201cIt was quite good. Not up to Mrs. Beale\u2019s standards, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Now that he had given Beale the expected\u2014and only acceptable\u2014response, his butler was ready to move on to what he found a trifle more important\u2014like the whereabouts of his daughter and Queen.</p><p>\u201cThe Lady went to the Keep about an hour ago,\u201d Beale said. \u201cShe left a message for you on your desk in the study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf there is nothing else you require, High Lord, I will lock up and retire.\u201d</p><p>Saetan shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing. Good night, Beale.\u201d</p><p>He walked to the end of the great hall and paused at his study door to watch Beale lock the front doors. Not really a necessary precaution since there were other ways of safeguarding the people and things he treasured. Even with those protection spells, it was simple enough to get into the Hall. Getting out was another matter.</p><p>He went inside his study, flicked a thought at the lamp on his desk. The candle-light inside glowed softly. He picked up the half sheet of parchment that had been folded into thirds and sealed with a few drops of black wax, called in his half-moon glasses, opened the note, and read.</p><p>Saetan,</p><p>Meet me at the Keep at dawn. The High Lord\u2019s expertise will be required.</p><p>Jaenelle</p><p>Vanishing the paper and glasses, he stared at nothing for a moment before extinguishing the lamp and leaving the study. As he crossed the great hall to reach the informal receiving room and climbed the stairs that led to the family wing, a chill spread through him. He knew what kind of expertise Jaenelle might require from the High Lord of Hell. What he didn\u2019t know was why.</p> <p>When he reached her suite of rooms, he knocked on the sitting room door. He didn\u2019t expect an answer since she wasn\u2019t there, but the knock was a habit\u2014and a precaution, since some of the kindred Warlord Princes who served her were fiercely protective.</p><p>As he opened the door, the cold rage filling the room stopped him before he\u2019d taken the first step. He gritted his teeth and moved forward, each step a test of will, until he stood in front of the worktable and stared at the reason Jaenelle had declined Sylvia\u2019s invitation to see the play.</p><p>The curtains were still open, and the moonlight was enough to make the spider silk look silvery in the dark room.</p><p>A tangled web. The kind of web Black Widows used to see dreams and visions. Besides being a Queen, Jaenelle was a natural Black Widow and Healer. That rare combination of gifts made her an extraordinary witch. The Ebony Jewels she now wore\u2014Jewels that indicated power he couldn\u2019t begin to estimate\u2014made her the most powerful\u2014and lethal\u2014witch in the history of the Blood.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t cut any of the threads. Hadn\u2019t destroyed the web. She\u2019d left it intact, knowing there was another Black Widow living at the Hall who could look into that web and see the same vision. Him.</p><p>Not quite an invitation to look, but the tacit offer to let him see what she had seen was the reason he turned and walked out of the room. It was enough to know whatever she\u2019d seen had produced the cold rage that lingered in the room.</p><p>As he retraced his steps through the corridors and down the stairs, he called in his black cape and settled it over his shoulders, hooked the silver chain that held it together in front, and flicked the material so that the front edges folded back to reveal the red lining. He didn\u2019t bother unlocking the front doors. He simply used Craft to pass through the wood.</p><p>A few moments later, he reached the stone landing web in front of the Hall, caught the Black Wind, and was riding that psychic roadway through the Darkness to Ebon Askavi.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take him long to reach the Keep, despite the distance between the Hall in Dhemlan and the Keep in Askavi. He dropped from the Winds, appearing on the landing web closest to the residential section within the mountain. Not the area that housed scholars when they came to study the books in the library, but the part of the Keep set aside for the Queen and her court.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised to see Draca waiting for him by the time he reached the first common room. She was the Keep\u2019s Seneschal. Had always been the Keep\u2019s Seneschal. And a very, very long time ago, she had been the dragon Queen who, when her own race\u2019s time in the world had finally come to an end, had shed her power along with her scales. The females those scales touched had become the first Blood, inheriting an old power in order to become the new guardians of the Realms. She looked human now, and ancient, but the reptilian cast to her features intimidated most people.</p><p>Even as he walked toward her, his mind was reaching out, searching, probing. Not finding what he sought honed his temper. But this was the Keep, and this was Draca, so he tightened the leash on his growing rage . . . and fear.</p><p>\u201cDraca,\u201d he said, bowing slightly when he stood before her.</p><p>\u201cSsaetan,\u201d she replied, inclining her head in a mark of respect she rarely gave anyone.</p><p>\u201cJaenelle told me to meet her here. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSshe iss expecting you at dawn, High Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now. My daughter is not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Queen hass gone to the Keep in Terreille.\u201d</p><p>Anger flamed, then turned icy. He understood the distinction she made, heard the warning in it, but he still turned away, intending to go to the Dark Altar within the mountain\u2014one of the thirteen Gates that linked the Realms of Terreille, Kaeleer, and Hell.</p><p>\u201cHigh Lord.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and looked over his shoulder. \u201cNo. Terreille is enemy territory. She shouldn\u2019t be there, and she certainly shouldn\u2019t be there alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Keep iss protected.\u201d</p><p>He knew that, but the need to protect\u2014a need that was part of what made a Warlord Prince so deadly\u2014was swelling in him until he couldn\u2019t think past it, couldn\u2019t feel anything but the drive to defend his Queen.</p><p>\u201cSsaetan.\u201d</p><p>Centuries of training made him hesitate.</p><p>\u201cSshe doess not expect you until dawn.\u201d</p><p>He fought a vicious internal battle, instincts warring with training.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Draca said, her voice gentled with understanding. The door of the common room silently opened, untouched by any hand. \u201cI will have yarbarah brought for you. When you are needed, you will be nearby.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes. Breath by breath, he pulled himself back from the killing edge, that state of mind that stripped Warlord Princes of the veneer of civilized behavior\u2014and was an intrinsic part of their nature. When he was sure he wouldn\u2019t respond by striking out with lethal intent, he opened his eyes, and said, \u201cThank you. Yarbarah would be welcome.\u201d</p><p>He walked past her and entered the common room, feeling as if he\u2019d stepped into a cage. In a way, he had. But he had made the choice to obey. That was the only thing that made staying in that room tolerable.</p><p>Removing the cape, he dropped it over a chair, then walked to the windows that overlooked one of the many gardens. He heard a servant enter and set the blood wine and a glass on a table, but he kept his eyes focused on the garden . . . and the night sky. And waited for the long hours to pass until dawn.</p><p>THREE</p><p>Listening to the voices just beyond the kitchen, Marian watched batter drip from the wooden spoon back into the mixing bowl, nervous that even the quiet sound of a spoon against a bowl might call attention to herself. It wasn\u2019t likely anyone would notice sounds in the kitchen if she continued making breakfast. No one in her family noticed she was around unless there was some hearth-Craft they wanted done. But there was something about the anger and desperation edging her father\u2019s wheedling voice and the strained annoyance in her mother\u2019s that made her draw her wings in tight to her body in a defensive gesture and want to play least-in-sight.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, woman,\u201d her father said, his voice rising. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much to ask. I need the errand done, and I need it done now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it wait until after breakfast? One of the girls\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A pause. \u201cA Priestess-in-training and a Healer-in-training can\u2019t take valuable time away from their studies for something simple like this. Besides, Marian isn\u2019t doing anything important. She won\u2019t be missed.\u201d</p><p>Marian pressed her lips together as she looked at the biscuits ready for baking. She wouldn\u2019t allow her father\u2019s words to cut her this morning. She wouldn\u2019t. Besides, she\u2019d been hearing that sentiment in one way or another her whole life\u2014more in the past few years since her younger sisters had been accepted into training. A hearth witch was a convenience, but her skills wouldn\u2019t enhance the status of a family who wasn\u2019t aristo, wouldn\u2019t aid her father\u2019s ambition to be more than a Fifth Circle guard for a light-Jeweled Queen.</p><p>She heard her mother\u2019s exasperated \u201cVery well, then\u201d and went back to mixing the batter as Dorian entered the kitchen. Her mother hesitated, then moved briskly to the table where Marian was working.</p><p>\u201cYou heard,\u201d Dorian said.</p><p>\u201cHard not to,\u201d Marian replied, keeping her attention on the mixing bowl.</p><p>With a huff, Dorian pulled the bowl and spoon out of Marian\u2019s hands. \u201cWell, go on then. Take care of this errand that\u2019s got him so bothered and get back here as quick as you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do more things that are unimportant?\u201d Marian asked, surprised to hear the resentment that had been building inside her for a long time actually color the words.</p><p>Dorian\u2019s face flushed with temper, but she kept her voice low. \u201cDon\u2019t you use that tone with me, girl. I won\u2019t put up with you getting snippy and acting above yourself.\u201d</p><p>Marian swallowed the lump in her throat. Yes, this had been building for a while now. It might as well be said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be treated like hired help instead of family, I should at least get a wage for the labor.\u201d</p><p>Dorian dropped the spoon on the table. Her hand swung back. Then she regained enough control to press her hand against the table. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a roof over your head and food in your belly. You shouldn\u2019t have to be paid to help me provide those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sisters get those same things\u2014and spending money besides\u2014without doing any of the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the delay?\u201d Her father\u2019s voice boomed from the kitchen doorway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll finish this later,\u201d Dorian said.</p><p>She disliked confrontation, couldn\u2019t hold on to anger. She\u2019d end up doing more work to make up for her show of defiance\u2014and nothing would change.</p><p>As she walked through the kitchen doorway, her father raised his hand as if to cuff her, but she hurried past him and stayed ahead of him until they were outside the eyrie. Then he caught up to her and grabbed her arm hard enough to bruise.</p><p>She saw temper in his face, but it made her think of a scared bully rather than a dangerous Eyrien Warlord. Still, a scared bully could become dangerous if he needed to convince himself that he was strong.</p> <p>He started to speak, then held back, clearly deciding to ignore a household squabble since it wouldn\u2019t interfere with what he wanted.</p><p>Using Craft, he called in a thick envelope and handed it to her. \u201cMessenger\u2019s waiting for that. Needs it before the day begins at court, so don\u2019t be dawdling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s so important, why don\u2019t you deliver it?\u201d Marian said.</p><p>His fingers dug into her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t sass me, girl. Just do as you\u2019re told.\u201d His other hand pointed at a small wood in the valley below. \u201cHe\u2019ll be waiting for you there. You fly down, then take the path through the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t find him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll find you.\u201d He released her arm with enough force that she staggered a couple of steps to keep her balance. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d</p><p>Vanishing the envelope, she moved farther away from him before she spread her wings and launched herself skyward. She forgot him as she pumped her wings to take her up into the pale dawn sky, dismissed the troubles waiting for her at home as she focused on the joy of soaring over the land. She loved flying\u2014loved the feel of it, the freedom of it. When she was in the air, she could almost believe her dreams were possible. A home of her own, with a garden big enough to grow food, flowers, and the herbs and other plants she could sell to Healers for their special brews. A place of her own, where her hearth-skills wouldn\u2019t be dismissed and she wouldn\u2019t have to tiptoe around male temper and moods.</p><p>It was nothing more than a dream. Her Purple Dusk Jewels didn\u2019t give her enough power or status to keep her safe from stronger males if she were on her own. She didn\u2019t have the temperament to cope with the cruelty and vicious games that were played in the courts and in aristo houses, so there was no point thinking she could work in one of them. If her mother turned her out, she\u2019d end up working somewhere for room and board and little else. Or, worse, she could end up begging for a place in one of the large eyries that stabled the warriors who served in the Eyrien Queens\u2019 courts. She\u2019d seen some of the women who did the cooking and laundry in those eyries\u2014and who were expected to take care of other needs as well. She wouldn\u2019t survive long in one of those places. So it always came back to accepting that she would be her mother\u2019s unpaid help.</p><p>But she still wished for something better.</p><p>Blinking back tears\u2014and telling herself it was the wind that created them\u2014she looked up . . . and saw the Black Mountain in the distance.</p><p>Ebon Askavi. The Keep. Rumors had been flying recently that there was a Queen there now\u2014a powerful, terrible, Black-Jeweled Queen. But no one had actually seen her. No one could say for certain.</p> <p>She paused, moving her wings to hover, unable to look away from that mountain. Unable to shake the feeling that something was aware of her, watching her. From that mountain.</p><p>Heart pounding, she shook her head to pull her gaze away from the Keep, folded her wings, and did a fast dive toward the woods in the valley. She was an unimportant hearth witch. There was no reason for anyone to look in her direction.</p><p>Unless it had something to do with the envelope her father wanted delivered to a messenger without the court he served in being aware of it.</p><p>Pulling out of the dive, she glided to the edge of the woods, then backwinged to land lightly on the path. She\u2019d deliver the envelope and go home. Once she was safely back in her mother\u2019s kitchen, she\u2019d convince herself that the uneasiness growing in her was her own doing, that there wasn\u2019t something in the woods that made her want to turn and run, that she wasn\u2019t sensing ripples of dark power far, far, far below the strength of her Purple Dusk Jewel\u2014ripples of power that were rising up from the abyss and coming toward her.</p><p>She kept to a fast walk, afraid to run because that would incite a predator\u2019s instinct to hunt. And there were predators out there, somewhere. She was certain of it.</p><p>She\u2019d almost reached the other end of the small woods when an Eyrien Warlord stepped out of the trees and spread his wings to block the path. Four other Warlords stepped out of the trees behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou have a message for me?\u201d the first Warlord asked.</p><p>They were all wearing clothes that were old but of good quality. The kind of quality only aristo families could afford. That didn\u2019t make her feel easier.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Calling in the envelope, she walked toward him until she was close enough to hand him the envelope by extending her arm its full length.</p><p>He snatched it from her, tore it open, read the first page quickly, then tossed all of it aside. When he looked at her, his smile was amused and cruel.</p><p>\u201cThe message wasn\u2019t meant for you?\u201d Marian said, backing away from him.</p><p>\u201cOh, it was for me. You\u2019re the payment, witchling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>She felt the other men moving closer, surrounding her. \u201cIf you hurt me, my father\u2014\u201d</p><p>The Warlord laughed, a vicious sound. \u201cHe sent you here, didn\u2019t he? He knew well enough what\u2019s going to happen. But nobody is going to miss the likes of you.\u201d</p><p>She leaped skyward. There wasn\u2019t much room to maneuver under the trees, but she was only a few wingstrokes away from open land\u2014and open sky. If she could get past the Warlords, she might be able to stay ahead of them long enough to catch one of the Winds and . . . head where?</p><p>The Black Mountain. If she could reach the Keep, she could beg for sanctuary, and the Warlords couldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>She\u2019d almost reached the open land when she heard the crack of a whip, felt the leather cut her skin as it wrapped around her ankle. They hauled her back under the cover of the trees\u2014and they were on her, flying around her, letting her flail and struggle and try to fly while their knives and war blades sliced her. Blood flowed from dozens of shallow cuts. When they sliced her wings, she managed a rough landing, but there was nowhere to run, no way to escape.</p><p>Ripples of dark power coming closer. Closer.</p><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d she screamed. \u201cPlease! Help me!\u201d</p><p>Laughing, the Warlords grabbed her arms and legs and flipped her over on her back, holding her down. The fifth man dropped to his knees between her legs and ripped her torn, bloody clothes to expose her.</p><p>\u201cHurry up,\u201d another Warlord said, \u201cor the bitch will bleed out before we all have a chance to use her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll last long enough,\u201d the Warlord kneeling between her legs replied as he opened his trousers.</p><p>No, Marian thought. No.</p><p>\u201cYou want to play with a witch?\u201d a midnight voice said quietly. \u201cThen play with me.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Marian saw before her vision blurred was the fear on the face of the Warlord in front of her. Then a wave of freezing black rage washed over her, pulling her under. She thought she heard muted screams of agony and terror, then the sounds were gone. Everything was gone . . .</p><p>... until she felt a hand close over hers, felt power that wasn\u2019t hers flowing into her. She forced her eyes open and stared at the golden-haired, sapphire-eyed woman kneeling beside her. Stared at the Black Jewel that hung from a chain around the woman\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Queen,\u201d Marian said, barely able to draw enough breath to shape the words.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m the Queen,\u201d the woman replied.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d The woman placed her other hand on Marian\u2019s forehead.</p><p>The dark power closed in around her again, but it was warm now, gentle, a cocoon of soft blankets. Power not her own kept her heart beating, kept her lungs moving.</p><p>Her last thought before she surrendered to it was, I\u2019ve seen the Queen of Ebon Askavi.</p><p>As soon as Saetan stepped through the Gate, he knew Jaenelle wasn\u2019t in the Keep in Terreille. A moment later, when her psychic scent flooded the corridors, he knew she\u2019d returned\u2014and the control on his temper frayed a bit more.</p><p>That she was his Queen didn\u2019t matter. That her power eclipsed his didn\u2019t matter. By the time he was done explaining things, his Lady would be in no doubt about how her Steward felt about her entering Terreille, which was the enemy\u2019s territory, without even one escort going with her.</p><p>Then he stepped out of the room that held the Dark Altar and saw her moving toward him, one hand under the blankets wrapped around . . .</p><p>He smelled the blood, noted the dangerous, feral look in Jaenelle\u2019s eyes, and felt the heat of his temper chill to cold rage as he rose to the killing edge.</p><p>Jaenelle stopped in front of him. She said nothing while he carefully pulled aside a part of the blankets and looked at the young Eyrien woman, while he studied the torn clothing and the slices in her skin that still seeped blood despite the healing web he sensed Jaenelle weaving around her.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jaenelle turned her head. \u201cAsk them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Five bodies appeared in the hallway. Saetan used Craft to probe the bodies. He felt equally chilled by and approving of what Jaenelle had done. From neck to toes, the bones of the Eyrien males had been crushed into small pebbles, making the bodies look like oddly shaped sacks. The muscles and internal organs had been ripped apart, as if claws had slipped beneath the skin, leaving it untouched while they tore through everything else in long, leisurely strokes. Which, he imagined, is exactly what she\u2019d done. And for the few seconds it took her to do it, the pain would have been exquisite . . .</p><p>He looked at the Eyrien woman.</p><p>... but not enough to pay the debt.</p><p>\u201cThis is what you saw in the tangled web last night?\u201d he asked too softly.</p> <p>\u201cI saw emptiness where something bright and joyful should have been. I saw happiness wither like a plant that couldn\u2019t find the right soil to take root in. And I saw the terrace where I was standing at dawn, but it was empty\u2014a warning that my presence, or absence, would make the difference in what would come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He looked at the bodies again. \u201cNow I understand what kind of expertise you need from me.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle nodded. \u201cFind out why this happened, High Lord . . . and settle the debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be a pleasure, Lady.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, watched her hurry into the room that held the Dark Altar and the Gate that would take her and the woman to Kaeleer.</p> <p>He waited a few minutes, studying the bodies that flopped in unnatural positions. Then he raised his right hand. His Black-Jeweled ring flashed with the reservoir of power it held. The bodies rose from the floor and floated toward him. Turning, he walked back to the Dark Altar, lit the four black candles in the candelabra in the proper sequence, and walked through the misty Gate, the bodies floating behind him.</p><p>When he walked out of the Gate, he felt the difference between this Realm and the two Realms that belonged to the living. Hell was the land of the demon-dead Blood who still had too much power even after the body\u2019s death to return to the Darkness. A cold, ever-twilight Realm. He\u2019d begun ruling here while he still walked among the living. He\u2019d been ruling the Dark Realm ever since.</p><p>Turning to look at the bodies floating behind him, he smiled a cold, cruel smile. He accepted that executions were sometimes necessary, and he performed them with exacting skill when duty required it of him. He\u2019d never developed a taste for them, but he suspected finishing what Jaenelle had begun was truly going to be a pleasure.</p><p>Walking through the corridors of the Keep, he went to the closest landing web, caught the Black Wind, and took the five bodies with him to the Hall he\u2019d built in this Realm. There, he would have everything he needed to make sure the debt owed to the Eyrien woman was paid in full.</p><p>The sun had set by the time Saetan returned to the Keep in Kaeleer and entered Jaenelle\u2019s suite of rooms. She was on the couch in her sitting room, reading one of those romances that was as close as she was willing to get when it came to experiencing intimacy with a man. With Lucivar as her First Escort, she didn\u2019t need a man just to fill the position of Consort, and when Daemon finally . . .</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t allow himself to travel down that road. He would defend Jaenelle\u2019s choice not to have a Consort\u2014and he would hope that, with the right man, someday her interest in sex would go beyond the pages of a book.</p> <p>Jaenelle closed the book and looked at him with sapphire eyes that still held a touch of feral rage. His daughter hadn\u2019t come back yet. Not completely. He was still dealing with Witch\u2014and his Queen\u2014and he needed to tread carefully.</p><p>\u201cHow is the woman?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cMarian will be all right,\u201d Jaenelle replied just as quietly.</p><p>Marian. Saetan tightened the chain on his temper. The bastards hadn\u2019t known her name, hadn\u2019t cared who she was. Finishing the kill shouldn\u2019t have taken more than a few minutes for each of them. It was why they\u2019d done it that had spurred him to prolong their suffering with a viciousness that wasn\u2019t a side of himself that usually surfaced. But they had deserved everything he\u2019d done after he helped them make the transition to demon-dead\u2014and then proceeded to rip their minds apart before he drained what was left of their psychic power, finishing the kill so they could become a whisper in the Darkness.</p><p>\u201cShe lost a lot of blood,\u201d Jaenelle continued, \u201cbut all the wounds were shallow. Her wings were sliced in several places, but they were easily repaired. A couple of days of bed rest and good food will rebuild her strength. There won\u2019t be any permanent damage to her body.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Jaenelle would make the distinction between body and heart. Her body had healed from the brutal rape that had almost destroyed her when she was twelve years old, but she carried the emotional scars . . . and always would.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Saetan asked, noticing the decanter of yarbarah on the table in front of the couch.</p><p>When she gave him a wary smile, he knew his daughter was back.</p> <p>\u201cI was waiting for you.\u201d Shifting her legs, Jaenelle poured a glass of yarbarah, warmed it over a tongue of witchfire, and offered it to him.</p><p>Accepting the glass, he sat on the couch, and tipped his head to read the title of the book between them. \u201cAre you going to loan that to me when you\u2019re done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. His daughter was back. \u201cA father should be aware of his children\u2019s interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you ask Lucivar what he\u2019s reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Lucivar rarely picks up a book, let alone reads any of it. If he showed an interest in one, any comment from me would more than likely embarrass him into putting it down and not picking up another for at least a decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could point out some of the stories have sex in them,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>A topic his son found even less interesting than his daughter did.</p><p>A quiet chime sounded. Moments later the small table on one side of the sitting room held a basket of fresh bread, a small bowl of whipped butter, and two steaming bowls of soup.</p><p>Grateful for the interruption, Saetan offered his hand and led Jaenelle to the table. As a Guardian, he really didn\u2019t need more than yarbarah and a token amount of fresh blood once in a while, but he could eat and enjoy food again, thanks to the tonics Jaenelle made for him, and she\u2019d eat more if someone joined her than she would alone.</p><p>She settled into her meal with a healthy appetite that relieved him\u2014and enforced the decision not to tell her why Marian had been attacked by those five Eyrien males unless she specifically asked him.</p><p>They\u2019d finished the soup and were halfway through the prime rib that followed before Jaenelle spoke again.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d she said with enough hesitation to make him watch her sharply. \u201cIf Marian doesn\u2019t want to return to Askavi in Terreille, she\u2019ll need a place to stay. So I was thinking she could stay with Luthvian for a while. Help out a little with small hearth-Craft things while she regains her strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Luthvian?\u201d Saetan asked, keeping his voice painfully neutral.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the only Eyrien female in Ebon Rih. She could help Marian adjust to living here. And she\u2019s a Healer, so she could keep an eye on how well Marian is recovering.\u201d</p><p>He focused his attention on his meal, biting back all the comments that were ready to spill out if he wasn\u2019t careful. His relationship with Luthvian, who was Lucivar\u2019s mother, was too tangled and adversarial, and any response he made would reflect that. But he understood why Jaenelle would think staying with another woman would be easier for Marian right now, and she could be right. So he offered no opinion.</p><p>\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll find another place for her,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201d He didn\u2019t feel easy about it, but he let it go. For now. \u201cIn that case, witch-child, tell me about this book you\u2019re reading.\u201d</p><p>She evaded, he pursued, and they ended the evening with a delightful hour of haggling over the value of various kinds of stories that helped them both step back from the blood and the fury that had started the day.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>As twilight softly deepened into night, Marian stood behind Luthvian\u2019s house, relishing a quiet moment with nothing to do. Her back was sore, and it worried her because Lady Angelline had been very insistent that she take things easy for a fortnight and not overwork muscles that still needed time to fully heal. But every time she mentioned feeling strain in her back or legs, Luthvian dismissed the concern and implied\u2014when she didn\u2019t say it outright\u2014that Marian was just trying to get out of earning her keep. The criticism stung. Since arriving at Luthvian\u2019s, she\u2019d done nothing but wash, scrub, polish, and mend. And everything she did was adequate but not good enough that she should even dream of looking for a position in another household. Luthvian was letting her stay as a favor to Jaenelle.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter, she told herself, feeling despair rise up before she choked it down again. She was alive, and she was living in Kaeleer, the Shadow Realm most people had thought nothing more than a myth until a few years ago. She didn\u2019t have to go back to Terreille, didn\u2019t have to trust her life to the whims of male temper.</p><p>Not as much, anyway.</p><p>Luthvian had also made it very clear that anything that displeased her would also displease her son, the Warlord Prince who ruled Ebon Rih.</p><p>Marian understood the threat. What had been done to her in Terreille would be a slap on the wrist compared to what an enraged Warlord Prince who wore Ebon-gray Jewels could do to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She carefully spread her wings as far as she could until she felt her back muscles pull. Gritting her teeth, she counted to five, then slowly closed her wings and waited a few seconds before beginning the exercise again.</p><p>She would find other work\u2014paying work\u2014and she would work hard and save and one day have that place of her own. And she would soar again, riding thermals over land that was more beautiful than anything she\u2019d ever seen back home. She would\u2014</p><p>\u201cDid you hem that dress?\u201d Luthvian\u2019s voice stabbed out of the dark.</p><p>Marian winced, wondering how long the Black Widow Healer had been watching her. Reminding herself that she had nowhere else to go\u2014yet\u2014she turned. \u201cAs I explained, Lady Luthvian, I can\u2019t hem the dress until you have the time for a fitting so that I can make sure the length is correct.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you how much to take it up.\u201d</p><p>Her younger sisters had said the same thing to her in the same sneering voice\u2014and complained bitterly to their mother when the hem fell too long or too short because they insisted she should be able to hem something without wasting their time.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless,\u201d Marian said, fighting to keep her voice respectful, \u201cI would feel more confident about the length if I pin the dress while you\u2019re wearing it.\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed made Marian uneasy. A Black Widow was too dangerous a witch to antagonize, and Luthvian could do far more than hurt her body.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t work. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d Luthvian said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d A ball of fear settled in her belly.</p><p>\u201cThe wings. They were damaged too severely. You\u2019ll never fly again.\u201d</p><p>The fear sharpened into pain. \u201cNo. Lady Angelline said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaenelle is a decent Healer, but she has little knowledge or experience when it comes to Eyriens. I have both. And I\u2019m telling you those are only for display now. You\u2019ll never fly again. If you try, you\u2019ll only end up damaging your back so badly you won\u2019t be able to work enough to earn your keep, and then where will you be?\u201d Luthvian\u2019s voice softened. \u201cYou\u2019d be better off having them removed. If they\u2019re gone, you won\u2019t be tempted to do something that would cripple you.\u201d</p><p>No, Marian thought as tears filled her eyes. No!</p><p>\u201cI can do it for you.\u201d Luthvian\u2019s voice was quiet and persuasive. \u201cIn a month, you won\u2019t remember what it felt like to have them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Luthvian\u2019s voice turned cold. \u201cPlease yourself. But if you do something that makes you useless, don\u2019t expect to remain here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hear Luthvian walk away, but she heard the kitchen door close. She stayed outside for a long time, hunched over to try to ease the pain that twisted her up inside.</p><p>She\u2019d hoped being in Kaeleer meant a promise at a new life, a better life. But nothing had changed for the better. If anything, the life ahead of her was worse than the one she\u2019d left behind.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Lucivar glided toward the courtyard in front of his eyrie, glad to be home. He\u2019d spent the past week visiting the villages in Ebon Rih, meeting with the Queens who ruled the Rihlander Blood villages of Doun and Agio, and talking to the council members who ran the larger landen villages. The non-Blood Rihlanders were afraid of him\u2014with good reason. The Blood might be a minority among any race, but the power that lived within them made them the rulers and guardians of the Realms. For the most part, the Blood ignored the landens and the landens kept away from the Blood. Reminding village council members that they were now answerable to an Ebon-gray Warlord Prince wasn\u2019t going to make them sleep easy for a while.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. It didn\u2019t make him sleep easy. He\u2019d spent most of his life ignoring or defying anyone\u2019s claim of authority over him. Now he was the authority who was going to draw the line and stand against anyone in his territory who dared step over it.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he liked being on that side of the line, but he\u2019d adjust to the formality directed at him from the Queens\u2019 courts in Doun and Agio. At least in Riada, which was the closest village to Ebon Askavi and was also his \u201chome\u201d village, the informal respect the villagers had shown him since he\u2019d arrived in Kaeleer hadn\u2019t changed. Not much, anyway. There was a proprietary interest in him now. What he did affected all of them.</p> <p>Which made him wonder why Merry had looked so uneasy when he\u2019d stopped by The Tavern to see what she was serving that night that he could take home with him.</p><p>\u201cA dinner for two, Prince Yaslana?\u201d Merry had asked.</p><p>\u201cOr one hungry man,\u201d he\u2019d replied, grinning.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she smiled back when she\u2019d prepared the basket of food for him?</p><p>As he landed lightly on the flagstone courtyard, he sent a thought out on a psychic spear thread. *Tassle?*</p><p>*Yas.*</p><p>The wolf sounded sulky, almost edgy.</p><p>*What\u2019s wrong?*</p><p>A pause. Then, *I don\u2019t like that female. I don\u2019t want to be friends.*</p><p>Lucivar felt his temper unsheath as he studied the front door of his home. An Ebon-gray shield formed a finger-length above his skin, an instinctive response to walking into a situation where it was safer to guard against a potential attack. The fact that he was reacting that way before entering his home honed his temper until the slightest push would have him riding the killing edge.</p><p>He pushed the door open and stepped inside. The female psychic scent hit him the moment he crossed the threshold. He knew that scent. Loathed the young witch it belonged to.</p><p>Roxie.</p><p>She\u2019d been one of Luthvian\u2019s students when he\u2019d first come to Kaeleer\u2014a Rihlander witch from Doun whose family was aristo enough that she thought she could do anything she pleased. She used lovers the way other women used handkerchiefs. She soiled them, then tossed them aside. But from the first day she\u2019d met him, her goal had been to corner him and force him into bedding her. The bitch had never understood that if she had managed to corner him, bedding her would have been the last thing on his mind.</p><p>And now she was here. In his home.</p><p>He moved silently until he reached his bedroom door. The wide corridor reeked of her.</p><p>As he pushed the door open and walked into the bedroom, Roxie raised her bare arms over her head and smiled at him, her body clearly defined under the sheet that covered her.</p><p>He usually had a hot, explosive temper. As he approached the bed, he felt chillingly calm.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my bed,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She shifted a little, the movement uncovering more of her breasts. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join me? You want to. You know you do.\u201d</p><p>The revulsion that washed through him almost sheared his self-control.</p><p>A triumphant look filled her face when he stepped up to the bed. A moment later, the look changed to terror.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t consciously made the decision to call in his Eyrien war blade. But the edge of that blade, honed so sharp it could make air bleed, suddenly hovered just above Roxie\u2019s neck. If he relaxed his hand, the blade would slide through skin and muscle until it gently came to rest against bone. He wouldn\u2019t have to do anything, wouldn\u2019t have to exert any force. Just relax his hand.</p><p>\u201cIf I ever find you in my bed again, I\u2019ll slit your throat,\u201d he said, his voice still calm and soft.</p><p>Roxie swallowed. The movement was enough to push her skin against the blade.</p><p>Lucivar watched the blood trickle from the shallow wound, becoming seduced by the heat of it, the smell of it. He stepped back before the temptation to let the war blade sing became too great. As he stepped back, the cold inside him broke and hot temper flared.</p><p>Vanishing the war blade, he scooped up her clothes in one hand, hauled her out of bed with the other, and dragged her through the eyrie, ignoring her squeals and protests. He flung her and her clothes out the door and slammed it shut, not knowing or caring if she got hurt when she landed.</p><p>Then he stood with his teeth clenched and his hands curled into fists, fighting the urge to open that door and purge the memories of all the witches he\u2019d known in Terreille who were just like her. He wanted to pound those memories into her flesh, exorcising them from his own.</p><p>Minutes passed, but the feelings didn\u2019t. He still rode the killing edge. Violence still sang in his blood. He had to purge that violence\u2014or have it purged out of him. There was only one person who could do that for him.</p><p>Roxie was gone when he left the eyrie. That spared him the inconvenience of killing her and taking the bitch\u2019s mangled body back to her family. He would have killed her if she\u2019d still been there. He couldn\u2019t have stopped himself. A Warlord Prince was a born predator, a natural killer, and the \u201ctraining\u201d he\u2019d received under the hands of the witches in Terreille had honed that killing instinct instead of providing a sheath for it. Right now, he was a danger to everyone.</p><p>With one exception.</p><p>He opened his psychic senses, searching until he brushed against the dark power that eclipsed his own.</p><p>Launching himself skyward, he flew to the cottage beyond the outskirts of Riada. He landed close enough to the porch that two steps and a leap had him standing in front of the door of the neat little cottage Saetan had built for Jaenelle as a place where she could spend solitary time when she needed it. Not that she was ever really alone. There was always a kindred male with her, but a wolf or dog was content to nap for hours while she got lost in a book or would walk with her for miles without wanting conversation.</p><p>He hesitated a moment, then opened the door and entered the cottage\u2019s main room. Jaenelle stood near the hearth as if she\u2019d been expecting him. She probably had. She would have felt that flash of temper, would have sensed him coming toward her.</p><p>He stood close to the door, wanting to go to her, needing to go to her. He couldn\u2019t do that. Not yet. Not until he\u2019d smoothed some of the jagged edges off his temper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLucivar,\u201d Jaenelle said quietly.</p><p>He stared at her, focused on her sapphire eyes.</p><p>She walked up to him and placed one hand against his cheek. \u201cLucivar.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and breathed in the physical scent of her and the dark psychic scent that was both a balm and an enticement. He didn\u2019t want her sexually\u2014had never wanted her that way\u2014but the hugs and sisterly kisses kept him balanced in a way nothing else had ever done.</p> <p>Hold the leash, he silently pleaded. Choke me into obedience if that\u2019s what it takes.</p><p>She just stood there, her hand against his cheek, until those jagged edges of temper receded\u2014and made him aware of something that brought a different edge to his temper.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your escort?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a warm afternoon,\u201d Jaenelle replied. \u201cJaal is sprawled in the stream out back.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar snarled. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even rouse himself to find out who had entered the cottage.\u201d</p> <p>Jaenelle lifted both eyebrows to express surprise. \u201cYou wanted to be pounced on by a wet tiger?\u201d</p><p>Being near her had restored enough of his balance that he took a moment to consider that. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so. That\u2019s why I told him to stay where he was.\u201d She stepped back and turned toward the archway that led to the kitchen. \u201cI have a small keg of ale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have half a steak pie, cheese, and a fresh loaf of bread.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle grinned at him. \u201cIn that case, you can stay for dinner.\u201d</p><p>He waited until they\u2019d eaten and were sitting on the porch, watching twilight smudge the land into soft shapes.</p> <p>\u201cI need help, Cat,\u201d he said quietly, using his nickname for her to indicate he needed help from his sister, not his Queen.</p><p>\u201cStill being overrun by helpful ladies?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, yes, but . . .\u201d He took a deep breath, knowing he was about to walk the crumbling edge of a sheer cliff. \u201cI found Roxie in my bed when I got home today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoxie,\u201d Jaenelle said in that midnight voice that chilled her court.</p><p>Roxie didn\u2019t like Jaenelle, and Jaenelle didn\u2019t like Roxie. The difference was Roxie didn\u2019t have enough power to do anything with that feeling. Jaenelle disliking someone was out and out dangerous.</p><p>Lucivar rubbed his hands over his face and sighed. \u201cI need a housekeeper. I need a dragon who will\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle cocked her head and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His nerves jumped, making him feel like he had tiny bugs skittering all over his skin. \u201cNot a real dragon.\u201d Not that he didn\u2019t like the dragons who lived in the Fyreborn Islands. He did. He enjoyed wave whomping with them whenever he and Jaenelle visited the islands. But the last thing he needed was a dragon the size of a pony\u2014not including the tail\u2014waiting by the door to flame anyone who crossed the threshold.</p> <p>\u201cIt would solve the problem of uninvited guests,\u201d Jaenelle pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She got that half-puzzled look on her face that always made him think of a kitten puzzling over a large, hoppy bug. \u201cI wonder if any of the kindred have witches with a gift for hearth-Craft. What would they use it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d His voice sounded firm, didn\u2019t it? Hell\u2019s fire, he hoped it sounded firm. \u201cI need a human with enough housekeeping skills that Helene and Merry will be satisfied that the eyrie is being tended and whose presence will keep any other females from thinking that\u2014\u201d He bit back the words. Best not to mention Roxie again.</p><p>Jaenelle hesitated. \u201cThere is a hearth witch who has come to Kaeleer recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough the service fairs?\u201d Lucivar asked, wondering about Jaenelle\u2019s hesitation. The twice-yearly service fairs in Little Terreille had been set up to deal with the flood of Terreilleans fleeing the cruelty of the courts and Territories under the influence of Dorothea SaDiablo, the High Priestess of Hayll.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jaenelle replied. \u201cI brought her in.\u201d</p><p>What in the name of Hell were you doing in Terreille? He knew better than to ask her that question. He\u2019d just visit the Hall in the next day or two and ask his father.</p><p>\u201cShe may be . . . content . . . where she is,\u201d Jaenelle said, \u201cbut I can ask if she\u2019d consider being your housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle nodded. \u201cI can\u2014\u201d Her mood turned grumpy, and she rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I have to do Queenly things tomorrow, and there\u2019s a formal . . . something . . . late in the evening.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar grinned. \u201cSomething that requires getting all polished and dressed up?\u201d Jaenelle hated fancy dress.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she growled, \u201cit\u2019s dress-up. But there will be time to come back here after your usual dinner hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t give you much time to get ready.\u201d</p><p>The look she gave him could have frozen blood.</p><p>\u201cI could still see if there are hearth witches among the dragons,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>Feeling more relaxed than he\u2019d felt all week, Lucivar stood, stretched, then bent over to give Jaenelle a kiss on the top of her head. \u201cDon\u2019t threaten your older brother,\u201d he scolded mildly. \u201cEspecially after I took the brunt of Father\u2019s snarling over the raft.\u201d</p><p>Wincing, she looked up at him. \u201cWas it bad? He just kept gritting his teeth when he saw me and refused to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar straightened up and leaned against one of the porch\u2019s supporting posts. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t bad. He was actually quite calm about our making a raft out of what he called \u2018twigs and kindling\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what it was,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and holding the whole thing together with nothing but Craft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he said he understood why we felt we needed to be standing on the thing when we put it in the river to test it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else were we supposed to find out if it worked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe even managed to sound calm about our not abandoning the raft after we hit the rapids. And he didn\u2019t yell about our going over the waterfall.\u201d Lucivar scratched his neck. \u201cAlthough, I still haven\u2019t figured out how he could speak so clearly with his teeth clenched like that.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle leaned forward. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him the raft started breaking up before we went over the waterfall, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a fool?\u201d Lucivar demanded. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t tell him that. Besides, what threatened to pop a few blood vessels was his finding out that we went back to the starting point and did the whole thing all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cI\u2019m surprised the walls of the Hall didn\u2019t shake when he started yelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have a chance to yell.\u201d Lucivar smiled that lazy, arrogant smile that always signaled trouble. \u201cBefore he got started, I ended it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him he was jealous.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cLucivar! You told Papa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the only reason he was mad at me was because you\u2019d invited me to go with you to try out this idea instead of inviting him.\u201d</p><p>Her silvery, velvet-coated laugh rang out over the land. \u201cOh,\u201d she gasped. \u201cOh, that was mean. What did he say?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar laughed with her. \u201cHe just gave me that stare that will burn holes through bone, then threw me out of his study. He hasn\u2019t said a thing about it since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Papa.\u201d Jaenelle sighed. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll dress up special tomorrow to make it up to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that, since my wearing a dress won\u2019t do anything for him.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and howled with laughter\u2014which brought an answering roar from behind the cottage.</p><p>Great. Any moment now, he\u2019d be trying to explain to a baffled feline Warlord Prince why their Queen was making those funny noises.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d He leaped off the porch, spread his wings, and launched himself skyward.</p><p>\u201cL-Lucivar!\u201d</p><p>Nope. Fair was fair. He\u2019d dealt with Saetan on his own over the raft, so she could explain her behavior to the \u201ckitty.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let Roxie\u2019s lingering scent spoil his mood when he returned home. Besides, by tomorrow evening, all his female problems might be solved.</p><p>SIX</p><p>As she set the brass basket next to the woodpile, Marian felt her back muscles protest and threaten to seize up. Again. Studying the woodpile, she raised one hand and used Craft to lift the pieces of wood and set them in the basket.</p><p>Luthvian would criticize and sneer, saying\u2014again\u2014that it was laziness to use Craft for simple things, but Marian didn\u2019t care. Using Craft instead of straining muscles wasn\u2019t laziness, it was practical\u2014especially since her back had seized up once today while she was scrubbing the kitchen floor.</p><p>Odd how gentle Luthvian had been when she\u2019d come into the kitchen and found Marian on the floor, unable to get up. At that moment, she had been all Healer, skilled and efficient. But the quiet words she\u2019d said as she eased the pain were the same ones she\u2019d been saying\u2014the useless wings were causing the back pain. Removing them was the only way Marian would fully heal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since she wouldn\u2019t let Luthvian remove her wings, she couldn\u2019t say anything about the chores that made her back hurt. She knew the wounds had been healed, but when she ached, she could close her eyes and mentally trace every knife slash the Warlords had inflicted.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, Marian reached for the handle of the brass basket.</p><p>The basket vanished before she touched it. It reappeared a moment later, waist high and just out of reach. Then it fell to the ground with a heavy thunk.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I wasn\u2019t clear enough when I told you to take it easy for a few days.\u201d The voice didn\u2019t quite hide the ripple of anger beneath the mildly spoken words.</p> <p>Marian turned. Jaenelle stood a few feet away from her.</p><p>\u201cLady Angelline.\u201d Marian swallowed hard, unable to look away from those sapphire eyes. She felt as if fingertips were passing over her body, just above her skin.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t done any permanent damage,\u201d Jaenelle said, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarian!\u201d Luthvian\u2019s voice lashed out through the open kitchen windows. \u201cAre you going to dawdle all night over a few pieces of wood? You have chores to finish.\u201d</p><p>Something deadly flashed in Jaenelle\u2019s eyes, gone so fast Marian wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d actually seen it.</p> <p>\u201cPack your things,\u201d Jaenelle said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to argue with that voice. Moving as fast as her stiff legs could manage, she reached the cottage\u2019s far corner just as Luthvian stepped out of the kitchen door.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, girl,\u201d Luthvian snapped. \u201cWhere\u2019s the wood? Can\u2019t you do anything\u2014\u201d She froze for a moment. \u201cGood evening, Jaenelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Luthvian.\u201d Jaenelle moved forward until she stood next to Marian. \u201cMarian is leaving. Her skills are required elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Luthvian looked as if she\u2019d been slapped, but she recovered quickly. \u201cWe need to discuss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jaenelle replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it while Marian packs her things.\u201d</p><p>The air crackled with suppressed temper. Marian stepped back and swung around both women, too nervous to step between them. As she entered the kitchen, she heard Luthvian say, \u201cShe\u2019s adequate, but anyone who pays wages for her work will be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait to hear Jaenelle\u2019s reply. She simply hurried up to the small, second-floor room Luthvian had given her. There wasn\u2019t much to pack. When Jaenelle had brought her to Luthvian\u2019s cottage, she had only the trousers, tunic, and underthings she\u2019d been given at the Keep since her own clothes had been destroyed in the attack. Luthvian had given her a skirt and two tunics the Healer no longer wanted and had grudgingly purchased two sets of underthings for her. Her only other possessions were the things that, through Craft, she always carried with her\u2014her moontime supplies, the hairbrush and hair ornaments her sisters hadn\u2019t permanently \u201cborrowed,\u201d the book she\u2019d asked for last Winsol and had actually gotten as a gift from her mother, and the small loom and cloth bag of yarns.</p><p>She vanished the clothes, since she had no other way to carry them, and had just walked out of the room when thunder shook the cottage. Her heart pounded as she rested a hand against the wall to steady herself. There had been no sign of a storm when she was outside a few minutes ago. Where had the\u2014</p><p>A different kind of thunder.</p><p>A chill went through her. Her heart pounded harder.</p><p>The kind of thunder that happened when a witch revealed enough of her temper to be a warning to those around her.</p> <p>Biting her lip, Marian gave herself a few seconds to gather her courage before going downstairs to the kitchen. Luthvian sat at the kitchen table, her gold eyes full of resentment and fear. Jaenelle stood in the doorway, not actually in the kitchen but also not waiting outside.</p><p>Marian hesitated. She should say something to Luthvian, but she didn\u2019t know what it would be. She couldn\u2019t thank Luthvian for the hospitality since she\u2019d more than earned her keep while she\u2019d stayed at the cottage\u2014and hadn\u2019t felt welcome in the first place. And she was afraid that no matter what she said right now, Luthvian\u2019s response would be brutal and heart-shattering. So she looked away and walked to the outside kitchen door.</p><p>Jaenelle stepped back and to one side to let her pass. The door closed behind them with a gentleness that was worse than a bad-tempered slam.</p><p>\u201cCan you walk a bit?\u201d Jaenelle asked when they reached the gate in the low stone wall that surrounded Luthvian\u2019s land.</p><p>Marian nodded.</p><p>They walked in silence for several minutes. Then Jaenelle said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry things were difficult for you. I thought\u2014\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I thought. It was an error in judgment, and you paid the price for it.\u201d</p><p>There were things Luthvian had hinted at, reasons why enduring work she knew was harming her was better than being told to leave. But now that she\u2019d been taken from the cottage . . .</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to Terreille,\u201d Marian said, the words bursting out of her.</p><p>\u201cNo one said you had to,\u201d Jaenelle replied.</p><p>\u201cBut if I don\u2019t serve Lady Luthvian\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle swore. Marian didn\u2019t know the language, but she understand the vicious way the words were said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t serve Luthvian,\u201d Jaenelle said tightly. \u201cYou serve in my court.\u201d</p><p>Marian stopped walking, too stunned to keep moving. \u201cI\u2014Your court?\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle turned to face Marian. After studying the hearth witch, she said, \u201cEighth Circle. Don\u2019t you remember signing the contract after I explained that you needed to serve in a court for eighteen months if you wanted to stay in Kaeleer?\u201d</p><p>She remembered Jaenelle handing her a piece of parchment and explaining something about her needing to sign the document in order to stay in Kaeleer, but she\u2019d still been feeling too weak and woozy to take in anything except that signing would let her stay. And when Luthvian had implied that staying or being sent back to Terreille rested on her decision . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d Marian asked.</p><p>Jaenelle shrugged. \u201cService in the Eighth Circle? A meal once in a while when I\u2019m staying at my cottage in Ebon Rih would cover the requirements.\u201d</p><p>A meal. Would Jaenelle supply the food for her to cook, or would she be expected to provide it? How would she provide it? \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>Now Jaenelle smiled. \u201cYour skills really are required elsewhere. I know someone who needs a housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>Marian relaxed a little. If wages were included as well as room and board, she could fulfill her obligation to the Lady\u2019s court.</p><p>Jaenelle looked up at the sky and winced. \u201cCome on. We\u2019d better ride the Winds and get there. If I\u2019m late getting back to the Hall, Papa will give me that patient look. I really hate that patient look\u2014especially when I deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Before Marian could wrap her mind around the idea that the Queen of Ebon Askavi had a papa who would dare criticize her, even if it was just with a look, Jaenelle took her hand and launched both of them onto the Purple Dusk Wind.</p><p>A few minutes later, they dropped from the Winds and landed on a flagstone courtyard in front of an eyrie. Marian winced when she saw the rock-strewn, overgrown mess on one side of the eyrie, but she didn\u2019t have time to decide if it had once been a garden or had always been a wild, overgrown tangle before Jaenelle opened the door without knocking and pulled her inside.</p><p>\u201cLucivar!\u201d Jaenelle called.</p><p>A sharp whistle came from another room in the eyrie.</p><p>Lucivar? Fear rushed back into Marian as Jaenelle pulled her toward the archway on one side of the big empty room.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2014\u201d a male voice said.</p><p>One last tug and Marian was in the kitchen facing an Eyrien male. A Warlord Prince. Who wore Ebon-gray Jewels.</p><p>The room spun. Her knees weakened. Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. Not him. Please, not him.</p><p>\u201cMarian,\u201d Jaenelle said, \u201cthis is Lucivar Yaslana, the Warlord Prince of Ebon Rih. Lucivar, this is Marian\u2014your new housekeeper.\u201d</p><p>No. No no no. She\u2019d heard of Lucivar Yaslana. Who in Askavi hadn\u2019t heard of Lucivar Yaslana, even though it had been centuries since he\u2019d actually lived in Askavi. He was Luthvian\u2019s son? The ruler of Ebon Rih? She couldn\u2019t possibly stay here. She couldn\u2019t. When Luthvian complained to him about her leaving . . . He could do anything he wanted to her and no one would mutter a word. Warlord Princes were a law unto themselves. Even in Terreille the ones who weren\u2019t kept on a tight chain were treated cautiously, and everyone knew the rules that applied to every other male didn\u2019t apply to them. Couldn\u2019t apply to them.</p><p>\u201cLady Marian,\u201d he said.</p><p>Had she already done something wrong? Was he already angry with her? She couldn\u2019t stay here.</p><p>Jaenelle huffed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I really have to go.\u201d Her hand brushed Marian\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a day or two to see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Then she was gone, and Marian was left facing a man who, even doing nothing, was a hundred times more dangerous than the five Warlords who had tried to kill her.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sit down?\u201d Lucivar said, tipping his head to indicate the nearest of four chairs that were on either side of a large pine table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not knowing what else do to, Marian pulled out the chair and sat down.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded, but kept her eyes focused on the table.

He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>She heard the click of nails on stone a few seconds before a wolf appeared in the archway. Yaslana kept a wild animal for a pet?</p> <p>The wolf came forward slowly, the tip of his tail waving as he sniffed her hand. She didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t dare even twitch when he stepped closer to sniff her feet and legs, his tail waving with more enthusiasm. But she jumped when he suddenly pushed his muzzle between her legs. That\u2019s when Yaslana stepped forward, grabbed the wolf by the scruff of the neck, and pulled him away.</p><p>\u201cGo outside, Tassle,\u201d Lucivar said, his voice, although quiet, demanding instant obedience.</p><p>With a whuffle-whine, the wolf left the kitchen.</p><p>Lucivar stepped away. The move brought him to the archway rather than moving back into the kitchen. \u201cRelax for a few minutes and finish your coffee. Then I\u2019ll show you to your room.\u201d He left, not waiting for her answer.</p><p>Just as well. She wasn\u2019t sure she could have answered. Her hands trembled as she lifted the mug and took a large swallow of\u2014</p><p>She shuddered. He\u2019d said this was coffee. She wasn\u2019t sure what it was, but she was certain it wasn\u2019t coffee. At least, she hoped it wasn\u2019t. Setting the mug down, she braced her head in her hands. She was alone with an Ebon-gray Warlord Prince and a wolf. Sweet Darkness, what was she supposed to do?</p> <p>Lucivar wound his way through the rocks, needing to put some distance between himself and the witch trembling in his kitchen. Tassle danced beside him, a furry bundle of excitement.</p><p>*Can we keep her, Yas?* Tassle asked. *She can be the female for our pack.*</p><p>Since he didn\u2019t think Marian wanted to be part of their \u201cpack,\u201d he answered the question with a question. \u201cWhy all the tail wagging?\u201d</p><p>*Ladvarian says dogs wag their tails to let humans know they want to be friends.*</p><p>Ladvarian was a Sceltie Warlord Jaenelle had brought to the Hall when he was a puppy. Since dogs had more experience living with and around humans, the wild kindred who were part of Jaenelle\u2019s court considered Ladvarian an expert on human behavior and looked to him to explain the bewildering things humans did.</p><p>*So I wagged my tail,* Tassle continued happily. *I want to be friends. I like her smells.*</p><p>Lucivar\u2019s feet rooted to the ground. This was a statement he couldn\u2019t ignore . . . no matter how much he wanted to. He scrubbed his hands over his face and sighed. \u201cTassle . . . Don\u2019t sniff her crotch.\u201d</p><p>*But . . . Yas\u2014*</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s acceptable among wolves, but you cannot do it with human females. It makes them snarly.\u201d</p><p>*But\u2014*</p><p>\u201cNo, Tassle.\u201d</p><p>Tassle hung his head and looked up at Lucivar with woeful eyes. *Would she snarl at you if you sniffed her crotch?*</p><p>The picture formed in his mind before he could stop it. Marian, sitting in the chair in the kitchen. Him on his knees in front of her, his arms around her waist, his face pressed against the juncture of her thighs, breathing in the smell of her as her scent changed from warm and quiet to hot and aroused.</p><p>He turned away from Tassle, not sure if he should curse himself, curse Marian, curse Jaenelle, or curse the wolf for asking the question.</p><p>Because that was the question, wasn\u2019t it? One look at Marian and everything in him had sharpened with interest, had churned toward desire. If he\u2019d met her in any other way, he would have staked a claim. That was Protocol. That was permissible.</p><p>Warlord Princes weren\u2019t like other men. They were passionately violent and violently passionate and far more territorial than other males. And when a particular woman intrigued a Warlord Prince sexually, he had a simple way of dealing with potential rivals: He killed them.</p><p>Because that lethal response was part of the nature of Warlord Princes, the Blood had long ago established Protocols to give other males a chance of survival. When a Warlord Prince indicated interest in a female, the other males stood back, giving him time to get to know her\u2014and for her to get to know him and consider if she wanted that formidable temper and driving sexual hunger focused exclusively on her. Because it would be exclusive. But the choice was always hers. When she\u2019d spent enough time with him to make a decision, she would either accept him as a lover . . . or tell him to go. And if she told him to go, he didn\u2019t argue, didn\u2019t try to persuade her\u2014he had to walk away. That was part of Protocol, too.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t even follow Protocol because she was his damn housekeeper. She had every right to expect him to protect her from any male\u2019s unwanted sexual attention\u2014and that included him.</p><p>But . . . Hell\u2019s fire, she was pulling at him in too many ways. Her fear spiked his temper because his instincts demanded that he defend and protect\u2014and destroy whatever was causing that fear. He couldn\u2019t do that because he was the cause. And underneath that fear he sensed a warm, quiet strength that intrigued and aroused him, that made him want to wrap himself around her and breathe in her psychic scent as well as her physical smells. Oh, he\u2019d been stirred by a few women over the past three years, and there had been times when the hunger inside him had been fierce, but never enough to give in, never enough for him to forget the rage and bitterness that had flavored most of his sexual experience. So it had been easy enough to turn away from that stirring, to chain that hunger. Until Marian had walked into the kitchen. Now he wanted, and he wasn\u2019t sure if he could keep that hunger chained.</p><p>Lucivar looked toward the eyrie. Maybe, once she was settled in the housekeeper\u2019s room, her fear would ease a little. Maybe it would ease enough that she would stay, although he wasn\u2019t sure if her staying would be a torment or a boon.</p><p>He sighed, then turned back to look at Tassle. \u201cI\u2019m going to get her settled in for the night. You stay here. I don\u2019t think she can handle more than one male at a time right now.\u201d</p><p>Tassle whined but didn\u2019t follow him when he went back to the eyrie.</p><p>She was still in the kitchen, her eyes too bright with fear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you to your room.\u201d His voice was as calm as he could make it, but there was a hint of a growl that was a response to her fear.</p><p>Silent, she followed him to a room that was on the opposite side of the eyrie from his bedroom. She shuddered when he opened the door and she realized she had to walk past him.</p><p>Watching her look around the room, he said, \u201cMy father\u2019s housekeeper brought over the furniture and set up the room. There\u2019s a private bathroom through that door. I expect you\u2019ll find everything you need.\u201d At least for tonight.</p><p>She still didn\u2019t say anything. She looked bruised and exhausted, and the only thing he could do to help her was to leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Lady.\u201d He closed the door and stared at it for a few moments. Damn you, Cat. You really kicked me in the guts this time.</p><p>But as he went back outside to tell Tassle it was all right to come in, he had a bad feeling it wasn\u2019t his guts that would feel the pain.</p><p>Marian stared at the door. No lock. No way to prevent someone from coming in during the night to . . .</p><p>She could put a Purple Dusk shield around the room, but that would probably just insult him\u2014or amuse him. It certainly wouldn\u2019t stop him if he . . .</p><p>She shuddered, then clenched her hands until they ached. She couldn\u2019t think like that. Fear was already a living thing crawling inside her. If she was going to survive staying here, she had to beat it back, not feed it.</p><p>She called in her nightgown\u2014another piece of clothing Luthvian had been ready to discard and had given to her instead. She wouldn\u2019t think about that either. Just wouldn\u2019t think anymore. Couldn\u2019t think anymore.</p><p>After changing her clothes, she settled into bed and called in her book, sure she wouldn\u2019t get any sleep.</p><p>Later, she roused enough from a deep sleep to realize someone was gently pulling the book out of her hands and turning off the lamp on the bedside table, but not enough to wonder who it was.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Marian jolted awake, her heart pounding. She kept her eyes closed, feigning sleep to give her scrambled brain a few precious seconds to catch up and identify what had ripped her out of a deep sleep.</p><p>There. Warm breath against her hand. Someone was in her room, next to her bed. Someone who would know by the change in her breathing that she wasn\u2019t asleep, and pretending only kept her blind to the danger.</p><p>She opened her eyes . . . and stared at the wolf who was watching her intently.</p><p>*You are awake. Yas told me not to wake you and I didn\u2019t wake you but now you are awake.* The wolf stretched his neck so that they were nose-to-nose. *You can pet me.* </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She raised her hand to obey. Then her brain identified what was wrong with this \u201cconversation.\u201d</p><p>A breathless shriek, a wild kick to free herself from the bedcovers, and a hasty scramble had her standing on the opposite side of the bed from the wolf, who looked equally startled.</p><p>The bedroom door was open. She was closer to it. If she could reach the door . . .</p><p>She shuffled sideways, never taking her eyes off the wolf\u2014until he put one paw on the bed as if intending to spring over it and reach her.</p> <p>She bolted through the doorway, sprinted down the corridor, turning the corner so fast she almost hit the opposite wall, and ran down the wide main corridor of the eyrie. Seeing the archway of the only room she recognized, she grabbed at the stone wall and swung into the kitchen, startling Yaslana enough that he almost dropped the mug he was holding.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell\u2014\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cThe wolf talks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Yaslana replied. \u201cHe\u2019s kindred. Since you\u2019re up, do you want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>Marian stared at him. Maybe he wasn\u2019t awake enough to understand what she\u2019d said. \u201cThe wolf talks. In sentences.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d He studied her for a moment, then added, \u201cHe\u2019s kindred. Blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood?\u201d She suddenly felt a bit weak and woozy.</p><p>\u201cThe Blood from the nonhuman races are called kindred.\u201d Yaslana scratched his cheek. \u201cTassle is a Warlord, as a matter of fact. Wears the Purple Dusk Jewels.\u201d</p><p>Marian groped for the nearest chair to keep from sinking to the floor. Blood? Warlord? Purple Dusk Jewels?</p><p>A whine.</p><p>She turned. Standing in the archway, the wolf gave her the most woeful look she\u2019d ever seen.</p> <p>He whined again and slunk away\u2014and she felt as if a small boy had tried to give her something he thought was a wonderful present . . . and she\u2019d smacked him for it.</p><p>Confused and feeling guilty, she focused on the familiar sound of sizzling meat\u2014and frowned. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Turning back to the stove, Yaslana picked up a fork and flipped the two steaks sizzling in a skillet. \u201cMaking breakfast. You want some? There\u2019s plenty.\u201d He poked at something else in the other skillet.</p><p>Marian slumped in the chair. \u201cBut . . . I should be making breakfast.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou were asleep.\u201d</p><p>She quailed at the implied criticism. Then she bristled at the unfairness of it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Prince Yaslana. You didn\u2019t tell me what time you expected\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI woke up early and decided to make breakfast,\u201d he said testily. \u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>Not important. The words cut into her, telling her clearly enough what he thought of the skills that usually gave her such pleasure.</p> <p>He picked up a pot, poured dark liquid into a mug, brought the mug over to the table, and plunked it down in front of her.</p><p>She looked at the mug\u2014and shuddered.</p><p>He stiffened as if she\u2019d slapped him, then grabbed two plates from the counter, returned to the stove, and started dishing out the food. Every move he made radiated temper as he put the plates of food on the table, then dug out silverware from a drawer and dropped it on the table.</p><p>As he pulled out his chair, she gathered her courage to ask, \u201cMay I have some cream and sugar?\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cYou didn\u2019t use any last night.\u201d</p><p>True, but last night she hadn\u2019t known how bad this stuff tasted.</p><p>A sugar bowl and a small glass bottle appeared above the table. They hovered for a moment before gently coming to rest within easy reach.</p><p>She added two teaspoons of sugar\u2014then added a heaping third when he turned away from the table for a moment\u2014and as much cream as she could fit into the mug without having it spill over the rim. She stirred carefully and tasted cautiously. It was lighter and sweeter\u2014and it was still terrible.</p><p>He sat down, chose some silverware from the pile on the table, and said, \u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>She stared mournfully at what could have been a very fine steak if it hadn\u2019t been slapped into a skillet with no regard for its potential. Suppressing a sigh she was sure would only irritate him further, she selected her silverware and began to eat. The fried potatoes were quite good, the scrambled eggs were bland but not bad, and the steak, despite its treatment, was still tender. But every bite she chewed and swallowed was an effort of will. She was too aware of the annoyed man sitting across from her, too aware that she hadn\u2019t yet performed her first task in her new position and he was already displeased with her.</p><p>After a few bites, her aching stomach threatened to rebel if she forced another mouthful of food into it, so she pushed the food around, wishing the meal would end\u2014and afraid to consider what might happen when it did.</p><p>Suddenly, Yaslana set his knife and fork down and pushed back his chair, his half-eaten meal another silent criticism.</p><p>\u201cI have to go out for a few hours,\u201d he said. \u201cI should be back by midday.\u201d</p><p>As he moved toward the archway, she half turned in her chair but couldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cWhat\u2014What would you like me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever hearth witches do.\u201d</p><p>Defeated, she said, \u201cNothing important.\u201d</p><p>She thought she\u2019d said it quietly enough that he wouldn\u2019t hear, but he stopped in the archway and stared at her for a long moment. Then he was gone.</p><p>She sat at the table for a long time, trying to convince herself that she had work to do. The dishes to wash at the very least, and the remains of the meal to store, and the midday meal to plan once she\u2019d taken a look at what was available. The task of exploring her domain should have delighted her. Instead, she sat.</p><p>She was a hearth witch whose Jewels weren\u2019t dark enough to give her any status worth mentioning, and her skills had no value. So what was the point of trying, always trying? The only time anyone had valued her was when those five Warlords wanted to kill her. What did that say about a woman who, being from one of the three long-lived races, had already lived thirteen centuries and would live many more\u2014and would never do or be anything important?</p><p>Maybe Lady Angelline didn\u2019t do me a favor when she rescued me. Maybe it would have been better if\u2014</p><p>Marian shook her head. No. This was just another rough patch of road, just another part of the journey that she had to get through before she could turn the dream of having a place of her own into a reality.</p><p>A whine made her turn toward the archway. The wolf was back, still looking woeful.</p><p>Kindred. Blood. Warlord. Young.</p><p>She finally realized why he made her think of a small boy. He was still young.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Lord Tassle.\u201d When he didn\u2019t respond, she tried again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I reacted badly. I\u2014I\u2019ve never talked to a wolf before.\u201d</p><p>*We do not talk to many humans. Only friends.*</p><p>She raised one hand. \u201cWould you still like me to pet you?\u201d</p><p>*Pet?* He came forward, slipping his head under her hand. *Pet.*</p><p>So she petted\u2014and the wonder of touching a wild animal who was more than a wild animal began to fill her.</p><p>She glanced at the unfinished meals. \u201cWould you like some steak, Tassle?\u201d</p><p>*Burned meat?*</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t burned\u2014\u201d Oh. Wolf. \u201c\u2014but it is cooked.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. *I will eat it anyway.*</p><p>She gave the meat to Tassle, ignoring the fact that she could have made a nice steak pie out of it, and began to clear the table.</p><p>\u201cAfter I wash up and get dressed, could you show me around?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>*I can show you,* Tassle replied. *You do not have to mark territory. I mark our territory. Even Yas cannot mark territory as well as I can.*</p><p>She thought about that for a moment, then bent her head so her long black hair fell forward and hid her grin. Even if nothing else was what she\u2019d hoped for, learning about the kindred was going to be interesting.</p><p>Lucivar stormed into Saetan\u2019s study at the Hall and slammed the door behind him. Saetan didn\u2019t even flinch, just set the documents he\u2019d been reading aside and leaned back in his chair.</p><p>It figured that the High Lord wouldn\u2019t have much reaction to that kind of entrance. After all, he\u2019d been dealing with Jaenelle, the coven, and the boyos for the past five years, and the combination of adolescence, power, and those particularly agile minds when it came to using Craft would have shattered the nerves of a less strong- willed man.</p><p>But that lack of reaction annoyed Lucivar. He needed a battleground on which to vent the emotions churning inside him, and his father wasn\u2019t being accommodating. So he shaped the battleground himself.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d he snarled as he paced in front of Saetan\u2019s desk. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cMarian.\u201d</p><p>Saetan sighed, but there was exasperation underneath the sound. \u201cThe woman has barely had time to unpack. What has she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand this!\u201d Lucivar shouted. \u201cThis is my home. I don\u2019t want this in my home.\u201d He stopped pacing and raked one hand through his hair. \u201cShe\u2019s bringing out everything that\u2019s savage in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s afraid! She\u2019s afraid of Tassle and\u2014\u201d It burned him to say it. \u201c\u2014she\u2019s afraid of me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe has good reason to be afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, now. Here was a battleground and an opponent who wouldn\u2019t flinch at his temper. His voice became quiet and deadly. \u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how Marian came to live in Kaeleer?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cJaenelle brought her in.\u201d Another battleground. \u201cAnd what in the name of Hell was Jaenelle doing in Askavi Terreille?\u201d he roared.</p> <p>\u201cRescuing a hearth witch.\u201d</p><p>He heard it then. It wasn\u2019t anger under Saetan\u2019s calmly spoken words; it was rage. So he chained his temper, no longer sure if he was dealing with Saetan, his father, or Saetan, the High Lord of Hell. He didn\u2019t understand why Andulvar Yaslana, the Ebon-gray Eyrien Warlord Prince who had been Saetan\u2019s closest friend for more than fifty thousand years, made a point of warning him to be careful when he dealt with the High Lord, but the fact that the Demon Prince felt the need to make the distinction was reason enough for him to be cautious.</p><p>Saetan rose, came around his desk, and leaned against the front of it. That informal stance, rather than his remaining behind the desk, usually signaled a discussion between equals.</p><p>\u201cMarian\u2019s father is a Warlord serving as a Fifth Circle guard in a Queen\u2019s court,\u201d Saetan said, his voice still quiet\u2014and still filled with suppressed rage. \u201cFrom the information I gathered, he doesn\u2019t have the brains, the backbone, or the balls to advance any higher, but he deludes himself by thinking it\u2019s his lack of the proper social connections rather than his lack of abilities that keeps him from being in the First or Second Circle. He likes to rub elbows with the aristo males in the court, and he likes to gamble\u2014and some of them tolerate him because they find his expectations amusing and they like winning the quarterly pittance he earns whenever they consent to let him gamble with them. But they wouldn\u2019t let him play on credit because they\u2019d quickly realized he had no way to pay them back.</p><p>\u201cBut one night, a few weeks ago, they let him play beyond the marks he\u2019d brought to the table. They kept refilling his glass, and they let him play because he had something they wanted. He\u2019d been bragging recently about his younger daughters and how he expected them to become prominent witches once they completed their training as a Healer and a Priestess. But the eldest daughter was an embarrassment to him. A witch whose skills would never provide the family with any status, a witch who did\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing important,\u201d Lucivar murmured, remembering the defeated way Marian had held herself when she\u2019d said those words.</p><p>Saetan nodded. \u201cThat was exactly what those aristo males wanted\u2014a witch who did nothing important, a witch whose disappearance wouldn\u2019t draw the attention of anyone in the court.\u201d His hands curled around the edge of the blackwood desk. \u201cSo they let the bastard gamble until he was so far in debt he would never be able to repay them. And when he sobered up enough to realize his standing in the court would be ruined if he didn\u2019t repay them, they offered him a trade\u2014and he took it.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t even have the courage to take her to the meeting place so she would know why she was being sacrificed. He just sent her there. Five Warlords with knives and Eyrien war blades. One terrified hearth witch, tethered so she could fly, since that made it more interesting, but couldn\u2019t escape. Shallow slices to prolong the pain and fear. And when she couldn\u2019t fight anymore, they pulled her down, intending to rape her while she bled out under them.\u201d</p><p>Feeling sick, Lucivar closed his eyes. \u201cSo they raped her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Jaenelle arrived before they began that part of their entertainment.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar shuddered. Jaenelle had been brutally raped when she was twelve. Her body had healed, but she, and those who loved her, lived with the emotional scars. There was nothing that turned Jaenelle lethal and merciless faster than rape.</p> <p>He opened his eyes, needing to see Saetan\u2019s confirmation. \u201cShe killed those Warlords.\u201d Then he shook his head. \u201cIf she intended to begin the healing in order to save Marian, it would have been a fast kill.\u201d Which meant they hadn\u2019t suffered nearly enough to repay the debt of pain and terror they\u2019d inflicted.</p><p>\u201cA fast kill,\u201d Saetan agreed. \u201cAlthough, considering the condition of their bodies, it was sufficient for the initial payment.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar said nothing, just waited for the rest.</p><p>\u201cJaenelle gave them to me to extract the rest of the payment,\u201d Saetan said too softly. \u201cAnd they paid the debt in full.\u201d</p><p>The knowledge of what Saetan could do to one of the Blood after the physical death should have frightened him, but he took a grim satisfaction in knowing every wound Marian had received, every moment of terror she\u2019d experienced, had been accounted for. While Saetan ripped their minds apart, piece by piece, he would have found out everything there was to know about why and how Marian had ended up being attacked by those men.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her father?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no authority in Askavi Terreille. I can\u2019t touch her father.\u201d</p><p>Yet.</p> <p>The word hung unsaid between them, and Lucivar knew with absolute certainty that it didn\u2019t matter how many more centuries Marian\u2019s father lived. The day would come when his body died, and he would make the transition to become one of the demon-dead. He would end up in the Dark Realm\u2014and the High Lord would be waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cSo you have a choice, Lucivar,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cI can appreciate, quite well, what it means to have Marian\u2019s fear scraping against the instincts that bring out the best, and the deadliest, side of your nature. If you can\u2019t tolerate it, then you should dismiss her. Between Jaenelle and me, we should be able to find her another position. Or you can grit your teeth for a while and endure it, giving her time to settle and regain her balance. Giving both of you time to find out if it\u2019s you she really fears.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar turned away. He couldn\u2019t dismiss her. Not just because of what he\u2019d learned from Saetan, but because it would confirm that she did nothing important, that her skills had no value. That she believed it, accepted it, chafed as much as anything else.</p><p>But having her stay wasn\u2019t going to ease the other part of his frustration\u2014especially now that he knew there were five\u2014the bastards!\u2014more reasons why she\u2019d run from him.</p><p>Lucivar started pacing again.</p><p>Saetan watched him for a while, then cocked his head. \u201cSomething else?\u201d</p><p>He tried to think of a delicate way to say it, but in the end, he blurted it out. \u201cShe makes me hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014\u201d Saetan paused. Crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>Lucivar glanced at his father, expecting to see criticism or anger in Saetan\u2019s expression. Instead, he saw . . . interest.</p><p>\u201cI know it isn\u2019t possible,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar stopped pacing and stared at Saetan in disbelief. \u201cFor one thing, she works for me. If she thinks that\u2019s part of what I expect from her\u2014\u201d He raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it if she came to my bed because she thought she had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she worked for someone else?\u201d</p><p>Where he couldn\u2019t protect her, especially now that he knew she needed protecting? Not while he was breathing. But the question made his temper soar. \u201cI\u2019d follow Protocol and stake a claim,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t do that,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cShe works for me.\u201d</p><p>Saetan made an exasperated sound. \u201cThere\u2019s just the three of you. If she worked somewhere else and you expressed interest in her, she\u2019d be scrutinized by everyone in that household because your interest would be public knowledge. This way, you can get to know her\u2014and she can get to know you\u2014in private. The end result will be the same. If she wants to be your lover, she\u2019ll make the choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still might think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever have so much as an inkling that you\u2019re doing anything that makes her feel cornered, I will kick your ass from one end of Kaeleer to the other and back again.\u201d</p><p>The threat, which was sincere, shouldn\u2019t have cheered him up, but it did.</p><p>\u201cYou want advice about how to deal with Marian?\u201d Saetan said. \u201cTreat her the same way you treat the coven.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar clenched his fists. The coven could take anything he dished out, but ... \u201cShe\u2019s too fragile to be handled that way.\u201d</p><p>Saetan just looked at him for a long time, then said quietly, \u201cI saw her when Jaenelle brought her to the Keep. The woman who survived that attack has strength she\u2019s never tested, strength she probably doesn\u2019t even realize is inside her. Give her the chance to find it. Give her a reason to test it.\u201d</p><p>Marian stared at the open kitchen cupboards. The empty kitchen cupboards. The man had two skillets, a pot, a chipped mixing bowl, four mismatched dishes, two coffee mugs, three glasses, two kitchen knives, and an odd assortment of silverware. No baking dishes, no baking sheets, no measuring cups. No coffeepot or coffee grinder. He didn\u2019t even have wooden spoons. How was she supposed to prepare decent meals for him without any tools?</p><p>And the pantry. The size and design of it thrilled her, but the barren shelves made her want to cry. There was a small keg of ale and a wine rack that held three bottles labeled \u201cyarbarah,\u201d which she assumed was the name of a vineyard somewhere in Kaeleer because the only other \u201cyarbarah\u201d she knew about was the blood wine warriors drank at special ceremonies, and Yaslana wouldn\u2019t have three bottles of that. But the flour, sugar, and coffee beans were just left in their sacks without so much as a light shield to keep the bugs out, and they were the only food items. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The cold box was a delightful discovery, especially when she realized the top third of it was a separate freeze box, but leaving hunks of meat wrapped in nothing more than brown paper was just . . . scandalous. The only other things in the cold box were a half-full butter bowl, the glass bottle of cream, and one egg.</p><p>Marian slumped in a chair. There had been no mention of wages last night, and she\u2019d been too frightened to ask, but now she was glad she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>The pine table and chairs in the kitchen were new. So were the stove, the cold box, and the furniture in Prince Yaslana\u2019s bedroom. The furniture in her room was not, but it was good quality.</p><p>The rest of the rooms were empty.</p> <p>Which made her wonder if Prince Yaslana was just getting by until it was time for the next tithe. After all, Luthvian had said he\u2019d just recently become the Prince of Ebon Rih, so he wouldn\u2019t have received any of the income yet that came with the title. Maybe he couldn\u2019t afford anything more yet. Maybe that\u2019s why he hadn\u2019t mentioned wages.</p><p>Dark power washed through the eyrie, warning her that he\u2019d returned. She jumped up and quickly shut all the cupboards and drawers so he wouldn\u2019t wonder what she\u2019d been doing. Then she stopped and looked around. Better if he found her doing something useful, but . . . what?</p><p>Yaslana walked into the kitchen, checked his stride, then advanced toward her more slowly, almost warily.</p><p>Marian\u2019s heart leaped into her throat. It was midday, wasn\u2019t it? He was expecting a meal, and she didn\u2019t have anything to serve him.</p><p>Three dishes suddenly appeared on the counter\u2014two large glass baking dishes with covers and a brown crock.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Beale sent these, with her compliments. She said it wasn\u2019t likely that you\u2019d get to the market today since you\u2019d need a little time to settle in and\u2014\u201d He made a face. \u201cAnd since she doubted I had more than salt and pepper on hand for spices, you\u2019d want to make a list before you went shopping.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Beale, whoever she was, was an optimist, Marian thought as she eyed the dishes. She hadn\u2019t even found salt and pepper when she\u2019d gone through the cupboards and pantry.</p><p>\u201cSo this should take care of today\u2019s meals,\u201d Yaslana said.</p><p>While she was grateful for the meals, Marian really wanted to know how long she could keep the dishes.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s this.\u201d He took another step toward her and held out a thin stack of papers.</p><p>She took them, fanning them out before she actually looked at them. Her heart leaped into her throat, and she had to bite back a squeal.</p> <p>Silver marks. A lot of silver marks. More than she\u2019d ever seen in her life.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2014\u201d She had to clear her throat before she could get the words out. \u201cThis is the housekeeping account?\u201d Oh, the meals she could make with these kinds of funds.</p><p>Frowning, he shifted his weight. \u201cI have accounts set up at all the shops in Riada. When you do the marketing, just tell the shopkeeper to put it on my account.\u201d He tipped his head toward the marks. \u201cThat\u2019s for you. An advance in your wages. Since you haven\u2019t been in Kaeleer very long, I figured there were things you\u2019d need to buy for yourself.\u201d</p><p>She felt the blood draining out of her head as she stared at the silver marks. \u201cYou\u2019re advancing me a month\u2019s wages?\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened. \u201cHalf a month.\u201d</p><p>Now she did squeal as she thrust out her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t take this!\u201d</p><p>He took a step back. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201d Too agitated to think about what she was doing, she took a step toward him, still holding out the marks.</p> <p>He took another step back.</p><p>\u201cWho says it\u2019s too much?\u201d He sounded testy. \u201cBesides, I can afford it.\u201d</p><p>Marian shook her head. If you can afford it, why don\u2019t you have any furniture? \u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said, a snarl rising in his voice. \u201cMy father suggested that as an acceptable wage for a housekeeper, and he should know. Hell\u2019s fire, woman, there are enough servants at the Hall to populate a small village.\u201d</p><p>She finally looked at him\u2014and realized he was defensive . . . and nervous. It suddenly occurred to her that he\u2019d never done this before, never had to decide things like wages or define the duties of household staff. So she folded the silver marks, put them in her skirt pocket, and said, \u201cThank you, Prince Yaslana.\u201d</p><p>He looked as relieved as a man walking off a battlefield. \u201cFine. That\u2019s settled.\u201d He took another step back toward the archway. \u201cI\u2019ll go out and chop some wood.\u201d</p><p>Marian glanced at the dishes on the counter. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll be out there. Just yell when it\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>The man could certainly move, Marian thought as she stared at the empty archway.</p><p>It was rather sweet, the way he got all testy and nervous about giving her wages. And it was considerate of him to realize there were things she would need to buy for herself.</p><p>She pulled the silver marks out of her pocket, fanned them out again\u2014and smiled.</p><p>It was still excessive for a half-month\u2019s wages, but if she kept half of it for herself, the other half would give her a good start on buying the basics she needed for the kitchen.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Marian sipped her coffee, looked around her clean kitchen\u2014and sighed. It was barely midmorning, and she\u2019d already made a casserole, cleaned up the kitchen, stripped the beds and put on fresh linens, had all the laundry washed and hanging in the drying room, dusted the furniture, and swept the floors. There was nothing left to do\u2014and Prince Yaslana would be gone for the next two days.</p><p>She still wasn\u2019t sure how service in Lady Angelline\u2019s court worked. It all seemed so . . . casual. She knew Prince Yaslana went back to SaDiablo Hall one or two days each week for a few hours, but she wasn\u2019t sure if he went there for court business or just to visit family. He\u2019d explained that since all the males in the First Circle had other responsibilities, his father, as Steward of the Court, worked out a rotation so that each male fulfilled his obligation to Queen and court by being on duty for two or three days twice a month.</p><p>So he\u2019d left before sunrise, and she had the next two days stretching out in front of her. She could read, but reading was the reward after the day\u2019s labor. She\u2019d finished the weaving she\u2019d started on her small hand loom and had made a decorative mat for the kitchen table. She didn\u2019t feel like making something just to fill up time. So what . . .</p><p>Turning to look out the window, she studied the mess of rocks and weeds. It had been a garden a long time ago. She\u2019d found herbs growing wild among the weeds and suspected there had been an herb bed and a kitchen garden on this side of the eyrie.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t Yaslana done anything to at least clean it up? For a man who was always aware of his surroundings, he seemed willfully blind to the fact that a natural meadow, which had its own kind of beauty, wasn\u2019t the same as the tangled mess she was staring at now.</p><p>Besides, it would be so nice to have a little kitchen garden to tend.</p><p>Marian refilled her coffee mug and took a moment to admire the coffeepot she\u2019d bought with part of her wages. Yaslana hadn\u2019t said a word about the pot\u2019s sudden appearance in his kitchen, but he\u2019d definitely approved of the taste of the coffee she could brew in it.</p><p>She walked down what she\u2019d labeled the \u201cdomestic\u201d corridor, since it provided entry to the pantry and the laundry and drying room\u2014and the small area between the pantry and laundry that had a door to the outside and a purpose she was still puzzling over. Opening the door, she studied the land in front of her.</p><p>The growing season was already well along, and she wasn\u2019t sure what kinds of plants might be available. But the women in Riada would know\u2014or she could ask Lady Angelline the next time the Queen stopped by for a brief visit. A few vegetables, a few herbs. Maybe some flowers. Yaslana wouldn\u2019t mind if she cleared a little ground. At least, she was almost certain he wouldn\u2019t mind.</p><p>He was, and wasn\u2019t, what she\u2019d expected, based on the things she\u2019d heard about Warlord Princes and him in particular. She had no doubt he was a trained warrior and a born predator whose temper could turn deadly in a heartbeat. She could see it in the way he moved, the way he looked at everything around him. But she hadn\u2019t actually seen a display of temper. Well, not much of one. The only time he\u2019d snarled at her since she\u2019d arrived was when he\u2019d come home early one afternoon, taken a long look at her, and decided she needed something to eat. When she\u2019d told him she wasn\u2019t hungry, he informed her that anyone who worked as hard as she did was not going to deprive her body of food. Then he marched her into the kitchen and rummaged through the cold box until he put together a plate of food that he considered sufficient. His idea of sufficient was vastly different from hers, but her token effort at eating had satisfied him enough that he\u2019d eaten what was left on her plate.</p><p>Since he didn\u2019t seem to care what she did as long as she was pleased with the result, she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d mind her clearing some ground and having the pleasure of a little garden of her own.</p><p>After vanishing her coffee mug, then calling it back in so that it would reappear on the kitchen counter next to the sink, Marian pushed up her sleeves, stepped outside, and got to work.</p><p>As she stepped back into the eyrie, Marian understood the purpose of the little room. If it had pegs in the wall or a coat tree, wet or muddy outer garments could be hung in there to dry. Boots could be removed instead of tracking dirt or mud through the rest of the eyrie. And it was close to the big sinks in the laundry room for a quick wash if it was needed.</p><p>If there was a bench in here, it would make removing boots so much easier, Marian thought, groaning softly as she bent over to unlace her boots. At least Tassle was off doing his daily trot around the land surrounding the eyrie and hadn\u2019t heard her groan. He\u2019d just start howling again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wolves had a very effective way of nagging. When he\u2019d started telling her around midday that it was time for her to rest and eat, it had been easy to tell him she would do that in a few minutes, or after she\u2019d moved a couple more rocks. But after she\u2019d done that several times . . .</p><p>That howl rising up over the land was not something that could be ignored. He wouldn\u2019t hush, she couldn\u2019t catch him, and she suspected everyone in Riada could hear him. Since there was no way to shush him except to do what he wanted, she warmed up a piece of casserole and spent an hour reading at the kitchen table. When she came back out, he was pleased enough by his success in taking care of a female that he\u2019d used Craft to help her move rocks until the game bored him and he went off for a while to do something wolfie.</p><p>So it was just as well that she\u2019d announced it was time to quit for the day before he\u2019d decided it was time for her to quit. One howling experience was quite enough.</p><p>She closed the door and touched the stone in the wall that had been spelled to engage the Ebon-gray locks Prince Yaslana had put on all the doors. He\u2019d worked out a way for the spell to recognize her and Tassle so that they could come and go, but he\u2019d been adamant about the doors being locked whenever he wasn\u2019t home, especially the front door. He\u2019d been equally adamant that she not allow anyone but his family to enter the eyrie when he was gone.</p> <p>The command had baffled her, but it was his home, his business. As she hurried along the domestic corridor to the kitchen, she dismissed all thought of the locks, her focus now centered on a long, hot bath to ease the deep ache in her muscles. Those aches, and the shivers of pain that occasionally came with them, worried her sometimes, but she hadn\u2019t said anything to Jaenelle whenever the Lady asked how she was feeling. Luthvian had warned her that removing her wings was the only way her back would completely heal. But she didn\u2019t want to lose her wings, didn\u2019t want to lose the hope that, someday, she might fly again\u2014even though she was too afraid of crippling herself to even try.</p><p>She pushed those thoughts away by focusing on the pleasure of soaking in a hot bath, eating a big piece of casserole for dinner, reading her book, and turning in early so she could get back to her garden at first light tomorrow.</p><p>As she stepped through the kitchen archway, she was concentrating so hard on not thinking about her wings that she let out a breathless shriek when the front door suddenly rattled.</p><p>With a hand pressed against her chest, Marian stared at the door. There were two solid bolts that provided physical locks for the door as well as the Ebon-gray lock, so even if a \u201cvisitor\u201d managed to destroy the front door, he or she still wouldn\u2019t be able to get into the eyrie.</p><p>The rattling stopped. The pounding of fist on wood started.</p> <p>*Tassle?* Marian called on a Purple Dusk psychic thread.</p><p>*Marian!*</p><p>*There\u2019s someone at the front door. They sound quite . . . insistent.*</p><p>*I should call Prothvar?*</p><p>Marian hesitated before saying, *Not yet.*</p><p>*I am coming back to our den.*</p> <p>That was good. She\u2019d feel easier if Tassle was within shouting distance.</p><p>Yaslana had told her his cousin Prothvar, whom she hadn\u2019t met yet, was staying at the Keep while he was gone and would respond if she needed help for any reason. Knowing one cry for help would bring a Warlord wolf and an Eyrien warrior to her defense gave her the courage to go to the front door and draw back the bolts. Besides, it was possible that it was Yaslana\u2019s cousin, just stopping by to check on her. It would be rude not to open the door.</p><p>The woman on the other side of the door was not Yaslana\u2019s cousin. She was young, a Rihlander, a stranger, and was dressed . . .</p><p>Marian couldn\u2019t think of a polite way to describe how she was dressed.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d the woman demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Prince Yaslana\u2019s housekeeper,\u201d Marian replied courteously.</p><p>The woman looked at her sweaty, dirt-smeared tunic and trousers, and said, \u201cOh\u201d in a way that clearly indicated that Marian had been dismissed as unimportant. \u201cI\u2019m here to see Lucivar. He\u2019s expecting me.\u201d</p><p>Not likely, Marian thought, shifting slightly to block the doorway. \u201cPrince Yaslana is not at home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll wait for him.\u201d</p><p>The woman took a step forward. Marian didn\u2019t step back.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be possible,\u201d Marian said, working to remain polite. \u201cHe may not be back until quite late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t mind if I make myself comfortable,\u201d the woman insisted.</p><p>Where? There were only three rooms in the eyrie that were furnished, and Marian didn\u2019t think this woman intended to sit in the kitchen.</p><p>It probably would be easier to say she wasn\u2019t permitted to let anyone enter the eyrie. After all, a servant had to obey her employer. But it wasn\u2019t Yaslana\u2019s order that kept her blocking the door; it was her own dislike of the woman that kept her from stepping back. There was something calculating about this stranger, and there was meanness lurking in the backs of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you would like to leave a message,\u201d Marian said, \u201cI\u2019ll give it to Prince Yaslana as soon as he returns.\u201d</p><p>The meanness filled the woman\u2019s face for a moment before she shifted her hips, pushed out her chest, and smiled in a way Marian supposed was meant to be sultry.</p><p>\u201cThe message I have for Lucivar isn\u2019t something I\u2019d leave with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, good evening, Lady,\u201d Marian said. As she closed the door, the woman shouted, \u201cI won\u2019t forget this!\u201d</p><p>Neither will I, Marian thought as she slid the bolts back into place. She\u2019d bet a month\u2019s wages that she\u2019d just met the reason Yaslana had Ebon-gray locks on his doors.</p><p>NINE</p><p>Lucivar strode over the rock-cleared ground, working up from annoyance to being thoroughly pissed off as he watched Marian set herself to try to lift a rock that weighed more than she did. One slashing look at Tassle was enough to prevent the young wolf from announcing his presence. The fact that his little hearth witch was so focused\u2014or so exhausted\u2014she wasn\u2019t even aware of him coming up behind her just made his temper more volatile and his control more slippery.</p><p>But he would stay calm.</p><p>She groaned a little as she tried to get a better grip on the rock.</p><p>He would be reasonable.</p><p>She braced herself to try again.</p><p>He was on her in a heartbeat, his arms going around her, his hands clamping down on her wrists to keep her from jerking upward. Not that she could move much, with his arms locking her wings against her body, his chest pressed against her back, and his legs bracing hers.</p><p>Even though he\u2019d expected her to react to being restrained by a male, her instant panic still screamed at his instincts to defend and protect. He fought a quick, nasty battle with himself to keep from rising to the killing edge since that was the last thing that would ease her fear.</p><p>So he would stay calm.</p><p>\u201cMarian,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She panted, trembled. But after a few painfully long seconds, she said, \u201cPrince Yaslana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s Lucivar. Let go of the rock now.\u201d</p><p>He waited while she fought her own internal battle. On one level, she knew holding the rock wasn\u2019t a defense against an attack, but it still took a while before she managed to convince her body. When her hands finally relaxed, he drew them away from the rock. Sliding his hands up to her shoulders, he straightened up, bringing her with him.</p><p>Being attracted to her made him aware of her body in ways he\u2019d had to pretend he didn\u2019t notice, but he wasn\u2019t going to ignore this. No, he was not.</p><p>But he would stay calm.</p><p>He led her over to the stone that had weathered into a natural seat. As he helped her ease down to sit on the stone, he noticed the Rose Jewel she wore. Her Birthright Jewel. He could think of one reason why she was wearing the Rose instead of her Purple Dusk, and he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>But he would be reasonable.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell are you doing?\u201d he roared.</p><p>She shrank away from him as he towered over her, but seeing her so tired made him too angry to care that he was scaring her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Marian stammered.</p><p>\u201cYou what? Wanted to see how many rocks you could move before you ruined your back? I know it still bothers you occasionally, so don\u2019t bother trying to deny it.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI used Craft to take most of the weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can see that,\u201d he said, pointing at her Rose Jewel. \u201cAnd you needed to draw so much power to lift things you couldn\u2019t possibly lift otherwise that you drained your Purple Dusk Jewel doing it. Isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re wearing the Rose?\u201d</p><p>When she just stared at him mutely, he swore and started pacing to work off the sharpest edge of temper. Problem was, the movement also gave him time to notice more of what she\u2019d done.</p><p>He snarled at her. \u201cIn order to get this much cleared, you must have started the minute I was out of sight and kept at it for the past two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got my work done,\u201d Marian protested.</p><p>Oh. Well. That certainly made him feel better. And the tears in her eyes and defeated way she held herself ripped at him. He didn\u2019t want her defeated. He didn\u2019t want her afraid. But he\u2019d be damned if he was going to let her hurt herself in order to do . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, Marian?\u201d Lucivar waved his hand to indicate the cleared land. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the ground, a tear sliding down her face. \u201cA kitchen garden,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSome herbs. A few flowers. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His temper had eased back from true anger to just being pissed off again, but that comment came close to snapping the leash. He hauled her to her feet, certain her back and leg muscles were now tight enough that she couldn\u2019t have gotten up by herself, and pulled her toward the eyrie.</p><p>Her emotions battered at him\u2014fear that he was going to punish her for doing something without his permission, fear of what a man of his temper and power would do to her as punishment. The fact that she expected punishment told him more about the males who had been part of her life than he wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted a kitchen garden, you could have spent the past two days figuring out where you wanted it and what you wanted in it,\u201d he said, keeping his voice as level as he could manage. \u201cI could have cleared the ground for you when I got back. Did it even occur to you to ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Marian said in a small voice.</p> <p>No. Well, that was a kick in the balls. Even the coven knew better than that. Blood males served. That was something so deeply ingrained in the males even the cruelty in Terreille couldn\u2019t extinguish it completely. In Kaeleer, where the Blood still lived by the Old Ways, males considered it their right and privilege to serve\u2014and got pretty testy when a witch they knew personally denied them an opportunity to be helpful.</p><p>If Marian didn\u2019t know that yet, it was something she\u2019d better figure out. Fast.</p><p>He pulled her into the eyrie, through the laundry room, and wound his way through curving corridors until he reached the pool Andulvar had built long ago as a place for a warrior to sit back in heated water and ease tired muscles.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t openly fought him in an attempt to get away, but from the first step, she\u2019d been silently resisting like some stubborn puppy tethered to a leash. That was fine since he had the rhythm of this little dance and knew how to use it.</p><p>Treat her like the coven, Saetan had said. Well, he knew exactly what he\u2019d have done to Jaenelle or any of her friends if they\u2019d upset him over something like this.</p> <p>When he got near the edge of the pool, he propelled Marian forward. Her automatic step back gave him time to switch hands so that one now gripped her arm and the other held a fistful of her tunic. A hard shove forward, a swinging lift up, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Marian yelled. \u201cMy boo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u2014splash.</p><p>He used Craft to control her drop so she wouldn\u2019t slip and damage a wing. Now she stood in heated water up to her waist, with a look on her face that was closer to grumpy than fearful.</p><p>Grumpy was fine. Grumpy was good. He wondered just how grumpy he could make her.</p><p>\u201cBoots,\u201d he said. He\u2019d vanished them off her feet just before she hit the water. Now he called them in, dangling them over her head before he vanished them again. \u201cWhich you\u2019ll get back if you do what you\u2019re told.\u201d</p> <p>She stared up at him. \u201cIf I do what I\u2019m told?\u201d</p><p>Pointing at her, he said sternly, \u201cYou\u2019re going to sit your ass down and let that hot water soak out some of the soreness in your muscles. And you\u2019re going to stay there until I come back and fetch you.\u201d He turned and walked to the entrance.</p><p>\u201cFetch me?\u201d Marian said, sputtering. \u201cFetch me? What do you think I am? An addlebrained puppy?\u201d</p><p>He turned back. \u201cNo, you\u2019re female. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to discuss your brains right now.\u201d</p><p>He walked out of the room, stopped as soon as he was out of sight, and listened.</p><p>Mutters. Then the slap of wet cloth on stone.</p><p>Lucivar grinned. So there was a little temper under that quiet disposition. He\u2019d have to work on that. Shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. He excelled at getting witches riled up.</p><p>When he got back to the side doorway, Tassle was waiting for him.</p> <p>*I tried, Yas, but she wouldn\u2019t listen.*</p><p>\u201cNo, she wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Tassle hung his head. *Because I am kindred.*</p><p>\u201cNope. Because you have a cock instead of breasts. She probably patted you on the head and promised to stop soon.\u201d</p><p>*She did.* Tassle looked at Lucivar with interest. *Did she pat your head?*</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t.\u201d If she\u2019d been capable of lifting another rock, she would have tried to brain him, but patting any male wasn\u2019t exactly on her mind at the moment.</p><p>The daylight was almost gone, so he couldn\u2019t see the full extent of what she\u2019d done in the past two days, but what he could see was enough to make him shake his head.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. The woman was insane.</p><p>That was the only explanation he had for Marian trying to clear close to half an acre of land in order to plant a few vegetables, herbs, and flowers. Of course, being a hearth witch meant having a tidy streak that went down to the marrow, so she\u2019d never be content with seeing weeds beyond her little beds. Which meant she\u2019d be out here working too hard every time he turned his back.</p><p>She\u2019d drive him up the walls inside of a week\u2014and she was already doing that on a regular basis just by being where he could see her.</p><p>He understood her wanting the garden. Besides the practical reasons of growing some of their own food, it would be hers. Her work, her accomplishment, her . . . claim.</p><p>He looked at the land again, turning that thought over. Everyone needed something to call their own. She lived in it and took care of it, but she thought of the eyrie as his place. But the garden . . . Something of her own, apart from him. Something she would want to see change with the seasons. Which meant she intended to stay, even if she didn\u2019t realize it yet.</p><p>She\u2019d never be able to clear all of this and have the pleasure of seeing vegetables ripen and flowers bloom this year. And if he tried to help her now, she might see it as his way of reminding her that the land didn\u2019t really belong to her.</p><p>Moving away from the eyrie, Lucivar stopped when he reached a place where he could look down at Riada\u2014and smiled. He had a way he could prepare the ground for her. Now he just needed a reason to get her away from Ebon Rih for a couple of days\u2014and a little help doing it.</p><p>\u201cMy fingers are shriveled,\u201d Marian complained, clutching the towel she\u2019d wrapped around herself.</p><p>\u201cBut you can almost stand up straight,\u201d Lucivar replied as he led her to her bedroom. \u201cAll right. On your belly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>A slash of fear.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he gave her a little push toward the bed. \u201cThe soak was the first part of the treatment. A rubdown is the second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s all right. I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, he didn\u2019t touch her. He just looked at her. The coven never argued with him when they were on the receiving end of that look. Marian didn\u2019t either. She stretched out on the bed.</p><p>After flipping the sheet up to her waist, he straddled her. She jerked up when he vanished the towel. Her shriek of protest turned into a different kind of shriek when he called in a bottle of liniment and poured some on her back without using a warming spell on it first. Leaving the bottle of liniment floating on air freed both hands to push her down and rub her tight muscles.</p><p>\u201cIt stinks,\u201d Marian said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to smell like that,\u201d Lucivar replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder not to do stupid things that make you need it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. Just as well.</p><p>When he finally worked most of the stiffness out of her shoulders, she said, \u201cYou had a visitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d He poured more liniment into his hand and used a warming spell on it since she wasn\u2019t resisting the rubdown anymore.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar stiffened. After a moment, he smoothed the warm liniment over Marian\u2019s back, giving the area around her wings special attention. \u201cProbably Roxie. Did you let her in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Didn\u2019t like her.\u201d Marian\u2019s eyes were closed. Her voice had the slur of someone half asleep. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have locks on the doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought so.\u201d She took a deep breath, let it out in a sigh. \u201cI made stew.\u201d</p><p>He stopped kneading her muscles and leaned over far enough to see her face. \u201cAre we still talking about Roxie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Dinner. Stew. You can eat some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Her messages delivered, Marian fell asleep.</p><p>After studying her for a long moment, Lucivar decided nothing short of dragging her into the bathroom and holding her under a stream of cold water would wake her. So he finished her back, then pulled down the sheet and rubbed liniment on her legs. When he was done, he vanished the bottle of liniment, pulled up the bedcovers, and put a warming spell on them to keep her from getting chilled during the night.</p><p>He ate a bowl of quickly warmed stew, told Tassle to keep watch, and flew to the Keep, where he\u2019d left Jaenelle a couple of hours ago.</p><p>She closed her book and studied him. \u201cWhat brings you back here tonight, Brother?\u201d</p><p>Her knowing he was there as her brother and not as a Warlord Prince who served in her court made this a lot easier. \u201cI need a favor, and I don\u2019t want to explain why.\u201d</p><p>TEN</p><p>Tarl, the head gardener at SaDiablo Hall, was the first man to arrive that morning.</p><p>Which figured, Lucivar thought as he raised a hand in welcome. Tarl had probably come in the Hall\u2019s small private Coach and stayed out of sight until the driver caught the Winds and guided the Coach to the next destination\u2014with Jaenelle and a flustered Marian inside it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jaenelle had timed the note commanding Marian\u2019s assistance perfectly. Arriving late yesterday morning, it had given Marian enough time to wash out clothing and cook enough food that he could heat up so he wouldn\u2019t starve to death in her absence but not enough time to do anything else except get herself cleaned up and pack the small trunk Jaenelle had thoughtfully sent over from the Keep with the note.</p><p>Now Jaenelle and Marian were gone for the next two days to do some shopping, Tarl was here, and the other men would be arriving shortly.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Prince Lucivar,\u201d Tarl said.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Tarl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGoing to be a fine day.\u201d Tarl\u2019s eyes lit up with something close to lust when he looked at that half acre of rocky, weedy ground. \u201cSooo . . . it\u2019s a garden we\u2019re making out of this, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lucivar said cautiously.</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014\u201d Tarl broke off at the sound of other men\u2019s voices coming from the stairs leading up from the landing place. \u201cYou called in the tithe?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Lucivar nodded. \u201cFrom Riada. I need this done in two days.\u201d</p><p>As part of the tithe owed to the Keep, every adult in Ebon Rih owed five days of labor each year along with the financial tithe. As the Warlord Prince ruling on his Queen\u2019s behalf, he received two of those days. He\u2019d spent part of yesterday making sure word was spread throughout the village that he was collecting those two days from the men.</p> <p>The men began to gather round, talking quietly among themselves.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Briggs, who ran The Tavern with his wife, Merry, said. \u201cWhat\u2019s to be done here, Prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA garden,\u201d Tarl replied before Lucivar could. \u201cBut what kind of garden?\u201d</p><p>It sounded like an innocent question until Lucivar realized every man now crowded around them had stopped talking in order to hear the answer. He didn\u2019t look at any of them. He didn\u2019t dare look at Tarl, whom he could have cheerfully strangled at that moment. There wasn\u2019t a man on this mountain who wasn\u2019t going to go home tonight and report Prince Yaslana\u2019s answer to the women in his life\u2014which, in Tarl\u2019s case since he worked at the Hall, was Helene and Mrs. Beale.</p><p>Lucivar took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cLady Marian wants a kitchen garden, a bed for herbs, and some flowers.\u201d</p><p>A few men grinned. Others nudged their neighbors or exchanged knowing looks. By tonight, everyone in Riada would know Lucivar Yaslana was interested in far more than Lady Marian\u2019s housekeeping skills. Which was fine\u2014as long as Marian didn\u2019t panic when she found out.</p> <p>Tarl prowled the ground nearest the eyrie, frowning a bit at one thing, nodding at something else. He made his way through the men, crossed the flagstone courtyard in front of the eyrie, and continued on to the other side. He came back a few minutes later, looking thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got the feel of it. I expect your Lady wants to be doing her own planting on this side of the eyrie, but we can take care of the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther side?\u201d Lucivar said, feeling like he\u2019d taken a bad slide on what he\u2019d thought was solid ground.</p><p>\u201cLady Marian\u2019s a hearth witch, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Tarl said, making the question close to a demand. \u201cShe\u2019ll spend the rest of the summer fretting if this side is put to rights and the other side is left so untidy. We\u2019ve got two days and\u201d\u2014he looked around as men shifted to make room for newcomers\u2014\u201cplenty of hands to do the job.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar closed his eyes and accepted that he\u2019d kicked the first pebble, so he couldn\u2019t complain\u2014too much\u2014about the avalanche that came out of it. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, then,\u201d Tarl said, rubbing his hands together. \u201cThe first thing we have to do is move those rocks.\u201d</p><p>Why am I here? Marian asked herself as she looked around the two-story building packed with furniture.</p><p>\u201cTell me again why I\u2019m here?\u201d the man beside her asked.</p> <p>Jaenelle looked over her shoulder at him. \u201cBecause you\u2019re male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m being punished for this because . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lucivar\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI thought that would be the answer.\u201d He paused, then added, \u201cLucivar wanted to select his own furnishings. He said so. Several times.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle turned to face them. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said. He changed his mind, and he picked me to do the shopping for him. And I picked the two of you to help me.\u201d She smiled at her helpers in a way that was not the least bit reassuring.</p><p>Marian glanced at the man to see what his reaction would be. Lucivar\u2019s father. S. D. SaDiablo. That was how Jaenelle had introduced him when they\u2019d all settled into the Coach for the journey to Nharkhava. It was only because Luci\u2014Prince Yaslana had mentioned it that she knew his father was the Steward of the Dark Court at Ebon Askavi. Being the Steward of the most powerful Queen in Kaeleer made him a very influential man. And yet, here he was, helping his daughter buy furniture for his son.</p><p>Of course, his daughter was the Queen of Ebon Askavi and his son was the Warlord Prince of Ebon Rih. But still . . .</p><p>So it brought her back to the question of why she, a Purple Dusk hearth witch, was here with them. Surely they weren\u2019t interested in the opinions of Prince Yaslana\u2019s housekeeper.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to select furniture for all the rooms Lucivar intends to use, at least for the immediate future, I suggest we split up,\u201d Prince SaDiablo said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to look at more of what\u2019s being offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cI\u2019ll start over there.\u201d As she turned, one of the men who had been hovering nearby leaped forward to meet her. She smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a look at the dining room furniture,\u201d Prince SaDiablo said. His hand lightly brushed Marian\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you accompany Jaenelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Marian said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me rephrase that.\u201d Amusement filled his gold eyes. \u201cAge and rank have their privileges. You, my dear, drew the short straw and, therefore, get to deal with Jaenelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not reassuring,\u201d Marian muttered.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was.\u201d</p><p>As he moved past her, the other man waiting to help them said, \u201cThis way, High Lord.\u201d</p><p>Marian watched the two men make their way down the aisles of furniture. High Lord? What an odd title. Maybe it was his official title as the Steward? Although . . . She\u2019d heard it before. She just couldn\u2019t recall where or why.</p><p>She shook her head and hurried to catch up to Jaenelle.</p><p>It took her less than a quarter of an hour to realize Jaenelle Angelline had more energy than a roomful of puppies and less sense than any of those puppies when it came to choosing furniture that was suitable for an eyrie, let alone the home of a Warlord Prince. How was she supposed to tell the Queen\u2014or even Lucivar\u2019s sister, for that matter\u2014that the lamp Jaenelle was admiring with the lumpy base and the froofy, fringed shade made her shudder just to look at it? Or that the small table, which would probably look lovely in the drawing room of an aristo house, would look pathetic in rooms that had the weight of stone and were extensions of the mountain on which they were built?</p><p>She tried to be tactful, reminding herself that she was just the housekeeper, but when she saw Jaenelle eyeing a hutch with elaborate curlicues . . .</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>Eyebrows rising in surprise, Jaenelle turned to look at her. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Because I don\u2019t want to spend half a day dusting the thing. Which wasn\u2019t an appropriate thing to say, especially when the man assisting them was listening so attentively. \u201cIt\u2019s just not . . . appropriate,\u201d Marian said weakly.</p><p>Jaenelle narrowed her sapphire eyes. \u201cSo far, nothing we\u2019ve looked at has been \u2018appropriate.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>That was true.</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t heard you make any suggestions,\u201d Jaenelle continued.</p><p>\u201cOh, but I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d Those sapphire eyes stopped her\u2014and made her think. She wasn\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d a housekeeper at the moment. She was Eyrien. She didn\u2019t know anything about aristo houses, but she knew Eyrien dwellings. Of the three of them, she probably did know best what was appropriate for Luci\u2014Prince Yaslana\u2019s home.</p><p>Turning away, she began studying the other hutches available. Clean lines. Strong pieces. Lucivar\u2019s eyrie had more windows than most, which gave the rooms more light, but the wood always had to complement stone.</p><p>Seeing two possible hutches, Marian went over to examine them more closely.</p><p>Saetan watched the two women wander among the furniture, amused at the way Jaenelle now meekly followed Marian instead of the other way around.</p><p>*Witch-child?* he called on a Black psychic thread.</p><p>*Papa?*</p><p>*You weren\u2019t really interested in that lamp, were you?*</p><p>Jaenelle snorted. *Of course not. It\u2019s hideous. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have to find so many things that wouldn\u2019t suit before Marian jumped in.*</p><p>Saetan pressed a fist to his mouth and coughed to hide the chuckle. The man attending him wouldn\u2019t understand his amusement. *I found a dining table.*</p><p>*A real one?* </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>*Yes, a real one.* He watched Marian as she opened the doors of a cabinet. Even from a distance, he could see her excitement, almost sense the longing as her fingers stroked the wood\u2014and saw her shoulders slump as she turned away from it. *What is that, witch-child?*</p><p>*A sewing cabinet,* Jaenelle replied, still examining it. *There are shelves for cloth, little pegs for thread, bigger pegs for skeins of wool, all kinds of drawers to hold supplies.*</p><p>*And the asking price is something she can\u2019t afford, even with the wages Lucivar is paying her.*</p><p>Jaenelle nodded, keeping one eye on Marian while she gently closed the cabinet doors.</p> <p>*Are we adding it to our purchases, witch-child?*</p><p>She turned and smiled at him from across the large room. *Yes, we are.*</p><p>Prince SaDiablo had excellent taste, Marian decided as she looked at the table and chairs he\u2019d chosen for the dining room. High Lord, she reminded herself. The men helping them with their purchases kept calling him High Lord, so she should address him that way, too.</p><p>\u201cThis is wonderful,\u201d Marian said, stroking her hand over the gleaming, dark wood. Big enough to seat eight Eyriens, it would still fit easily into the dining room without feeling crowded if a storage hutch and narrow serving table were also added. Looking past the chosen table, she spotted a small pine table. \u201cOh, yes, that\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is this perfect?\u201d Jaenelle said, following her. \u201cIt\u2019s not even finished.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s perfect,\u201d Marian replied, giving the table a push to test its sturdiness. \u201cEyrien males need a worktable for cleaning and honing weapons, doing repairs, things like that. And there\u2019s a small room in the eyrie that seems like it was designed to be a weapons room\u2014a storage place for an extra bow, quivers of arrows. There\u2019s even pegs already in one wall that would hold bladed sticks, so . . .\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSo you want a table that\u2019s sturdy but is going to get rough treatment,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Marian smiled.</p><p>Jaenelle smiled back. \u201cI\u2019m sure it was a weapons room originally and had a similar table in it. Cousin Prothvar and Uncle Andulvar will be pleased with your choice. So will Lucivar.\u201d She brushed a finger over the top of the table. \u201cI noticed some of the other craftsmen are displaying bowls and vases. I\u2019m going to take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Marian said. The room was turning slowly, making her feel light-headed.</p><p>Lucivar was a common name in Askavi, but Prothvar was rarely used anymore, and Andulvar . . .</p> <p>No one had used the name Andulvar since the time of the Demon Prince\u2014the Ebon-gray Warlord Prince who had once ruled the Black Valley . . . just as Lucivar now ruled Ebon Rih. Lucivar had mentioned his cousin Prothvar. He\u2019d mentioned his uncle, too, but not by name. And he\u2019d said his family took a little getting used to, but he hadn\u2019t said why. If what she was thinking, as impossible as it must be, was true . . .</p><p>\u201cMarian?\u201d</p><p>A deep, soothing male voice washed over her. The room swayed. She looked at Lucivar\u2019s father.</p><p>Lucivar Yaslana. Prothvar . . . Yaslana. Andulvar . . . Yaslana.</p><p>\u201cDarling, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>S. D. SaDiablo. High Lord.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you feeling well?\u201d</p><p>She was sitting down, looking up at him as he bent over her, concern in his golden eyes, his hand resting lightly against her face.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re him,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re really him. The High Lord. Of Hell.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, but she could sense the warm man pulling away from her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said quietly, withdrawing his hand. \u201cI\u2019m the High Lord of Hell.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know much about the High Lord except that he was more powerful\u2014because he wore a Black Jewel\u2014and supposedly more dangerous than the Demon Prince, but the one thing she did know about him from the stories Eyriens told was . . .</p><p>\u201cYou were Andulvar Yaslana\u2019s friend. Almost like brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still are.\u201d</p><p>Still are. Oh, Mother Night. \u201cSo, Luci\u2014Prince Yaslana\u2019s uncle is . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndulvar Yaslana. The Demon Prince. Prothvar Yaslana is Andulvar\u2019s grandson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Guardian. Andulvar, Prothvar . . . and my oldest son, Mephis . . . are demon-dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . Lucivar talks as if he sees them all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>Marian stared at him. She was looking at a legend. Oh, not one of her people\u2019s legends, but a legend nonetheless. And one who had known\u2014still knew\u2014the greatest Eyrien Warlord Prince who had ever lived.</p><p>Dazzled, she studied him as if she hadn\u2019t spent the morning around him. He was wearing the Red, which must be his Birthright Jewel. A courteous man who had made her feel welcome. A widely read man, based on the books he and Jaenelle had talked about on the journey. He had a dry sense of humor she didn\u2019t always understand. He obviously loved his children.</p><p>And he was the Prince of the Darkness, the High Lord of Hell\u2014and Andulvar Yaslana\u2019s friend.</p><p>\u201cThis is more exciting than learning that some wolves can talk,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stared at her a moment, then laughed. When he held out his hand, she didn\u2019t hesitate to accept it.</p><p>\u201cCome along,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling up to it, we\u2019d better rescue the poor males who have been trying to deal with Jaenelle.\u201d</p><p>They were going back to the hotel for the afternoon. Marian could have hugged the High Lord for saying the morning had tired him and he needed to rest. Days spent doing heavy cleaning were less exhausting than a shopping trip with Jaenelle Angelline, and she welcomed the chance to get off her feet. They would have their midday meal at the hotel, and then\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis evening I\u2019ll take you two ladies to dinner,\u201d the High Lord said as they waited patiently for a horse-drawn cab that would take them back to the hotel.</p><p>Marian\u2019s heart sank. They\u2019d made it easy for her to forget she was a servant, that the social status between them was as wide a difference as her Purple Dusk Jewels were to the Black. But those differences would become painfully apparent even before they left the hotel, and she didn\u2019t want him to feel ashamed of being seen with her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to include me,\u201d Marian said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you and Lady Angelline\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to join us?\u201d His words were gently spoken, but there was an undercurrent she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She had an odd feeling that it wasn\u2019t their acceptance of her but her acceptance of them that was really being questioned. So she told the truth and hoped he was one of those males who understood female vanity. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything suitable to wear.\u201d Which was true. She was wearing the skirt and tunic Jaenelle had given her, and they were the best clothes she owned\u2014far nicer than the things Luthvian had handed down to her\u2014but they weren\u2019t appropriate for dining out.</p><p>The High Lord froze, and Jaenelle, who had been watching the street for a cab, slowly pivoted to face her. The chilly anger in the High Lord\u2019s eyes made her nervous, but it was the cold fury in the Queen\u2019s eyes that scared her.</p><p>The next thing she knew, a cab pulled up, she was bundled into it, and the High Lord was giving instructions to take them to the clothing shops.</p><p>Not sure what she\u2019d done to upset both of them, she hunched in her seat, her wings curved around her body since that was the only way she could sit in a cab that wasn\u2019t designed for winged passengers. She didn\u2019t dare mention that the High Lord had wanted to rest or that she didn\u2019t think she could afford a dress from any shop he would choose to patronize. She stayed quiet to avoid having that chilling anger focused on her.</p><p>Besides, even though he\u2019d initiated this extra shopping trip, the High Lord was a man, and based on her observations of men who had escorted their ladies to her mother\u2019s shop, his interest wouldn\u2019t last long and they\u2019d be heading back to the hotel in no time, with or without a suitable dress.</p><p>Marian stretched out on the bed, trying not to whimper. Who would have thought any man would have that much knowledge or interest in women\u2019s clothing? And when that man was the High Lord of Hell . . .</p><p>They\u2019d walked into a shop that catered to Blood from aristo families. Within minutes, merchants from the neighboring shops came running, and she was tossed into the middle of a storm that made the furniture shopping seem calm in comparison. The High Lord found a green dress that complemented her light-brown skin. While she was in the dressing room being carefully measured to have wing slits made in the dress, the cobbler displayed his selection of shoes, other merchants brought selections of skirts, trousers, shawls\u2014anything that complemented the Eyrien coloring of brown skin, black hair, and gold eyes was presented to the High Lord for inspection. He selected, Jaenelle bullied her into trying things on, and two hours later, when even Jaenelle\u2019s energy began to flag and the merchants were looking dazed and exhausted, she had a wardrobe of the finest clothes she\u2019d ever owned.</p><p>The door opened and Jaenelle walked into the room they were sharing. \u201cPapa just wants to sleep for a while, but I\u2019m going down to the dining room to get something to eat. What about you?\u201d</p><p>What about her? She couldn\u2019t raise her head off the pillow. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle smiled. \u201cAll right. You get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you so angry about the clothes?\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle came over to the bed and crouched down so Marian wouldn\u2019t have to look up at her. \u201cWhen you were staying with Luthvian, did she take you to any of the shops in Doun?\u201d</p><p>There was something under that question, but she was too tired to be cautious. \u201cFor some underwear. She gave me some clothes that didn\u2019t suit her anymore.\u201d And had implied that even those were too good for a lowly housekeeper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jaenelle nodded, a mix of sadness and anger in her eyes. \u201cI asked Luthvian to take you to the shops so that you could buy new clothes, and since I know her well enough to know she\u2019d complain about spending any of her income on anyone but herself, I gave her enough gold marks to purchase those clothes. The fact that she chose to do otherwise . . .\u201d She sighed. \u201cEverything has a price. She made her choice, and the rest of the family will make theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d Jaenelle gave Marian\u2019s arm a sisterly pat. \u201cGet some rest. We\u2019ll have a lovely dinner tonight, and tomorrow we\u2019ll go to Dharo.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle was at the door before Marian managed to prop herself up on her elbows. \u201cDharo?\u201d</p> <p>Jaenelle grinned. \u201cWe still have to buy carpets, and there\u2019s no one in Kaeleer who makes finer carpets than the weavers of Dharo.\u201d</p><p>Marian stared at the door long after Jaenelle was gone. Dharo. Carpets. Another day of shopping.</p><p>She pressed her face into her pillow . . . and whimpered.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Snarling softly, Lucivar paced the flagstone courtyard in front of his eyrie.</p> <p>Where in the name of Hell was she? He\u2019d told Jaenelle he needed two days. Two days. All right, fine. He understood\u2014eventually\u2014why Marian hadn\u2019t come back last night. Maybe they\u2019d finished their . . . whatever\u2014he couldn\u2019t remember what he\u2019d suggested Jaenelle do as a way to keep Marian out of Ebon Rih\u2014too late to come back last night. And he wouldn\u2019t expect them at sunrise, since Jaenelle wasn\u2019t someone you dared talk to until she\u2019d had her first cup of coffee. But it was almost midday now, and his sister still hadn\u2019t returned his hearth witch.</p><p>He missed her. He hadn\u2019t noticed her absence too much while the men were working all around him, but at the end of the day, when he went into the eyrie alone . . .</p><p>She warmed the place, just by being there. When he stepped inside, he could feel the comfort of her presence. There were days when he thought she was really getting used to him, and they were two people who were interested in each other and moving toward living together instead of living in the same place. And there were other days when she withdrew from him for no reason, when the way she held herself made it clear that he was the Prince and she was the housekeeper.</p><p>He\u2019d been careful. He kept a choke hold on his body\u2019s response to her so that he wouldn\u2019t touch her in a way that made her think he required sex from her. But he wanted an invitation to her bed, wanted to take her into his bed, just . . . wanted. Not knowing what he did that made her turn away from him put a dangerous edge of frustration on an already well-honed temper.</p><p>She needed time. He would give her time. She would be skittish until she really trusted that he wouldn\u2019t hurt her. So he would be patient.</p><p>He. Would. Be. Patient.</p> <p>He glanced at the empty stairs leading down to the landing place and snarled.</p><p>Where was she?</p><p>A few moments later, he felt her presence at the landing place, along with Jaenelle and . . .</p><p>He glanced up at the sky. What was Saetan doing here at this time of day?</p><p>His anticipation of having her home again suddenly tangled with an attack of nerves. What if she hated what he\u2019d done here in the past two days? What if she was disappointed?</p><p>Then he saw her coming up the last few steps. She looked tired. She looked wonderful. He wanted to sweep her up into his arms and hold on, just to be close to her. Because he couldn\u2019t do that, he stood waiting, motionless.</p><p>Marian smiled at him when she reached the flagstones, with Jaenelle right behind her. Since his nerves were fraying, he directed a searing look\u2014and his temper\u2014at his sister. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarian and I had been talking about books, and since we stopped at the town house in Amdarh overnight, we waited until the book shops opened this morning,\u201d Jaenelle replied coolly.</p> <p>Marian hurried toward him, stopping just out of reach. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. There were so many books to choose from, and I hadn\u2019t realized you\u2019d expected me back at a . . . particular . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as she noticed the new stone wall and the wooden gate that opened off the courtyard. Silent, she went over to the gate, opened it, and followed the flagstone path Tarl had laid out around the beds that were bordered by stone or wood. She looked around, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s got you in such a snit this morning,\u201d Jaenelle said as she came up beside him, \u201cbut whatever it is\u2014\u201d She stopped. Looked. \u201cOh. Oh, Lucivar.\u201d</p><p>He watched her follow the same path, watched her touch Marian\u2019s shoulder. And he felt a sharp stab in the gut when Marian turned and he saw tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou did well, Prince,\u201d Saetan said quietly.</p><p>Lucivar turned his back on the two women now holding each other. \u201cYeah. I did so well, I made her cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderneath her quiet nature, she is a woman of strong emotions. You gave her a gift that means something. Did you expect her to respond with a polite \u2018thank you\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect her to cry,\u201d Lucivar muttered. Since he didn\u2019t want to deal with weepy females, he studied the man. The pride, and approval, in Saetan\u2019s eyes went a long way toward easing his nerves.</p><p>As Saetan walked to the other side of the courtyard to look at the walled yard and borders Tarl and the other men had planted, Lucivar noticed the slight limp that marred his father\u2019s normally smooth stride. Which meant Saetan\u2019s bad leg was bothering him\u2014something it only did when he worked it too hard.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cTo complete my escort duties,\u201d Saetan replied.</p><p>Lucivar frowned. \u201cWhy were you doing escort duties?\u201d</p><p>Turning back to look at him, Saetan said dryly, \u201cBecause I\u2019m your father.\u201d He gestured toward the eyrie\u2019s open front door. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give the ladies a few more minutes while we take care of the rest?\u201d</p><p>The rest? Lucivar wondered as he followed his father into the eyrie. \u201cThe rest of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe furniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat furniture?\u201d</p><p>Saetan just looked at him, his expression equal parts pity and amused irritation. \u201cWhat, exactly, did you ask your sister to do?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar resisted the urge to squirm. \u201cGet Marian out of Ebon Rih for two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jaenelle was to accomplish this by . . . ?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know where this was leading, but he was certain he wasn\u2019t going to like it. He shrugged, trying to find the arrogance that came naturally to an Eyrien male. That he couldn\u2019t quite find it while his father stared at him worried him. A lot. But he finally remembered what he\u2019d told Jaenelle when she\u2019d asked him what excuse she should use for commanding Marian\u2019s time for two days. \u201cI told her to buy a carpet or a piece of furniture, something that would interest a hearth witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA carpet,\u201d Saetan said slowly. \u201cA piece of furniture. I see.\u201d He sighed and raised his hand.</p><p>The room was suddenly filled with furniture, with barely enough room between the pieces for someone to squeeze by.</p><p>Lucivar stared. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe furniture your sister purchased on your behalf. At your request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put the dining table and chairs in the dining room,\u201d Saetan said, walking down the narrow corridor he\u2019d left open.</p><p>\u201cTable? Chairs?\u201d Lucivar hurried after his father. By the time he reached the room, a table and eight chairs were tucked against one wall.</p><p>Saetan frowned. \u201cProbably best to leave the carpets in here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarpets?\u201d</p><p>A stack of rolled carpets appeared, filling half the room.</p><p>The prick of disappointment surprised him. While he\u2019d had no real desire to endure the miserable task of looking at furniture, he\u2019d wanted to buy his own so that the eyrie would feel like a home that reflected who he was instead of living in a place someone else had created. Not that he actually knew how to achieve that, but still . . .</p><p>\u201cYou did want to choose for yourself, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Saetan asked with too much understanding.</p><p>Lucivar shrugged. Jaenelle had spent the past two days doing this for him\u2014and had dragged Saetan into it as well\u2014so he would never say anything that would dim her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cIf it helps at all,\u201d Saetan said, \u201cMarian selected most of it, and what she didn\u2019t select herself wasn\u2019t purchased without her approval. With one exception.\u201d</p><p>The prick of disappointment changed into a hum of interest as Lucivar returned to the front room and studied the furniture more carefully.</p><p>Marian had chosen these things. Which meant she\u2019d be comfortable living with them. If she was pleased, that was enough to satisfy him.</p><p>Then he remembered the last thing Saetan had said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the exception?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to dig in your heels about this one.\u201d</p><p>They retreated to an empty room. When Saetan called in the last piece of furniture, Lucivar just studied it, trying to figure out why this was different from the rest.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>Saetan lifted a finger. Doors and drawers opened. \u201cIt\u2019s a sewing cabinet. To store supplies. Marian enjoys weaving in her free time, and she\u2019s used to sewing most of her own clothes. She wanted this but couldn\u2019t afford it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can buy anything she damn well wants to,\u201d Lucivar growled.</p><p>Saetan nodded. \u201cYou know that, I know that, and Jaenelle knows that. Marian hasn\u2019t figured it out yet, and I think her status as a lowly housekeeper is being reinforced on a regular basis.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His growl deepened, and he turned on his father. \u201cShe isn\u2019t a lowly anything. She\u2019s a warm, caring woman with her own talents and her own skills and just because she earns a wage for using those skills\u2014\u201d</p><p>The chilling anger in Saetan\u2019s eyes stopped him. Something had pricked the High Lord\u2019s temper in the last two days. It simmered below the surface, tightly leashed, but it was going to explode. Soon.</p><p>His mind raced, thinking of the way Marian retreated from him some days, using the position of housekeeper as a wall between them. Saetan must have brushed against that same wall, but the High Lord, who had a far keener understanding of women than his son did, had realized what reinforced that wall. Since she lived in Ebon Rih, who would keep telling Marian she was nothing but a lowly\u2014</p><p>His eyes locked with Saetan\u2019s, and seeing the answer, he swore softly, viciously, while his temper soared.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Saetan said too softly. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tangle with your mother over this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lucivar snapped. \u201cShe loves me because I\u2019m her son and hates me because I\u2019m an Eyrien warrior, so we\u2019re not exactly cordial with each other.\u201d And that love, he remembered bitterly, had been skewed enough that she\u2019d given him away and he\u2019d grown up believing he was a half-breed bastard, fighting, always fighting, for a place within Eyrien society.</p><p>\u201cI will deal with this, Lucivar.\u201d</p><p>A father\u2019s command. Besides, Lucivar knew with chilling certainty how he\u2019d respond if Luthvian used her particular kind of Craft to harm Marian in any way, and knowing she had already tried to poison with words what he was trying to build . . . It was better if he stayed away from his mother for a while.</p><p>When they walked out the side door of the eyrie into the garden, Jaenelle gave them a slashing look.</p> <p>*I shielded her,* Jaenelle told them. *Having your tempers wash over her would have spoiled her pleasure, so if it\u2019s not already settled, pick another time and place for it.*</p><p>*It\u2019s settled,* Saetan replied.</p><p>Lucivar nodded.</p><p>Turning back to Marian, Jaenelle smiled. \u201cPapa and I have to go now. I\u2019ll send over those cuttings in a day or two. You\u2019ve got enough to plant right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Marian said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t even think. Would you like something to eat before you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Saetan replied, giving Marian a warm smile.</p> <p>Not sure how annoyed Jaenelle was with him for letting his temper slip, Lucivar breathed a sigh of relief when she kissed him before accepting Saetan\u2019s arm and walking back to the landing place where the Coach waited for them.</p><p>Which left him alone with Marian, who gave him a shy smile. He would have taken a kiss from her, too, but suggesting it, even teasingly, would upset her, so he settled for the smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful. Better than I imagined it could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pleased with it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019ll look even better when you\u2019ve got everything in place.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d meant it as a compliment, so he didn\u2019t know what to think when her eyes widened and she began to look distressed.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cThe furniture.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the work in the eyrie comes first, so I won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped when he raised his hand.</p><p>They were going to learn to compromise. She might as well start learning now.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of plants here,\u201d he said, nodding toward the dozens of clay pots that clogged several of the paths around the beds. \u201cSince they\u2019re living things, you have to deal with them first. So we\u2019re going to compromise.\u201d</p><p>She studied him warily. \u201cCompromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His mood lightened. He was going to piss her off, and she was just going to have to deal with it. \u201cIf you want to stay in the garden from sunrise to sundown until everything is planted, that\u2019s fine with me\u2014as long as you promise not to lift one piece of furniture, using Craft or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the furniture needs to be arranged and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll do the moving, the lifting, whatever it takes to put the pieces where you want them. You try to go around me and do it yourself, you\u2019re going to spend a day in bed resting, no matter what else you think you have to do.\u201d</p><p>He watched her hands curl into fists.</p><p>\u201cYou call that a compromise?\u201d Her voice almost rose to a shout.</p><p>He pretended to consider, then sighed. \u201cAll right. You can move the lamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lamps.\u201d</p><p>It took effort, but he managed not to grin. If he\u2019d done this to Jaenelle, she\u2019d be hissing and spitting at him right about now. Obviously, it would take a little more effort to get Marian to the hissing and spitting stage.</p><p>\u201cYour sister wouldn\u2019t have to compromise.\u201d</p><p>Now he did grin. \u201cYes, she would.\u201d</p><p>That threw her off enough to lose the glint of temper. \u201cBut . . . she\u2019s the Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also a smart woman who recognizes a losing battle when she sees one.\u201d</p><p>He watched her think it through. If Jaenelle couldn\u2019t butt heads with him over something like this and win, she didn\u2019t have a chance of winning, either.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I heat up something to eat?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompromise.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll heat up something to eat, and you can check the tools in the shed to make sure you have everything you need.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up as she spun around to look at the shed the men had built between two of the border beds. She hesitated a moment, then looked back at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll compromise.\u201d</p><p>The happiness that flowed from her as she hurried down the path to the shed made his heart stumble. He wanted this. He wanted her. He wasn\u2019t going to think about anything else for the next day or two, giving himself the pleasure of working with her to build a home for both of them, even if she didn\u2019t realize it yet.</p><p>And he would let his father deal with the obstacle standing in his way.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>Saetan watched the students hurry out the front door of Luthvian\u2019s three-story stone house. They didn\u2019t notice him standing just beyond the low wall that enclosed her land. The shields he\u2019d wrapped around himself guaranteed no one would sense him until he wanted his presence known. So he had time to study the house he\u2019d had built for Lucivar\u2019s mother, had time to tighten the chains that held his temper under control.</p><p>The anger that shimmered through him was a sly thing that had twined around memories he\u2019d pushed aside so long ago he\u2019d felt only the echo of them as he\u2019d watched Marian over the past two days. But the echo had been enough to prick at him, warning him that something wasn\u2019t right\u2014that something might happen again that had happened before. When he finally recognized what it was about a quiet, gentle hearth witch that made him edgy . . .</p><p>He watched his younger son pace the study, a storm waiting to break.</p><p>\u201cPeyton . . . what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hatred in the young Warlord Prince\u2019s eyes. Not quite. But what he saw twisted a knot in his belly.</p><p>\u201cI asked Shira to marry me,\u201d Peyton snarled.</p><p>Where was the joy that should have accompanied those words? Peyton was in love with the Dharo witch, and her feelings for Peyton ran just as deep. He\u2019d been sure of that during the times when Peyton had brought Shira to the Hall to spend time with the family. His son wasn\u2019t a fool. Peyton understood that marrying a witch who didn\u2019t come from one of the three long-lived races meant their union would be a lifetime for her and, for him, a few decades in a life that would span centuries. But everything has a price, and loving deeply for a few decades was better than yearning for that kind of love and never having it be part of your life. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cYou asked her to marry you,\u201d he said cautiously, wondering what had gone wrong, because it was clear something had gone wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me diluting the SaDiablo bloodline with an inferior woman, Father. She\u2019s decided we won\u2019t suit.\u201d</p><p>The insult within Peyton\u2019s words stunned him for a moment. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t have me!\u201d Peyton shouted. \u201cI love her with everything in me, and I know she loves me, but she won\u2019t marry me because\u2014\u201d He stopped, his hands curling into fists as he clenched his teeth.</p><p>He locked his fingers together to hide the trembling in his own hands. \u201cBecause . . . ?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>Peyton stared at him, tears and fury in those gold eyes. \u201cBecause of you.\u201d</p><p>A son couldn\u2019t choose crueler words to lance a father\u2019s heart.</p><p>Breathing hard, Peyton came forward, slapped his hands on the desk. \u201cThe woman I love won\u2019t have me because of you. Because you\u2019re the High Lord of Hell. Because she\u2019s afraid something will happen to her family if she doesn\u2019t take the hints that she\u2019s tolerable as a lover to satisfy a Warlord Prince\u2019s needs but won\u2019t be tolerated if she dares become a wife.\u201d</p><p>His own temper sharpened but couldn\u2019t get past the slicing pain inflicted by the words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never . . . I\u2019ve never done anything to indicate she wasn\u2019t welcome. Peyton, you know that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo I?\u201d Peyton shoved away from the desk. \u201cDo you think I care about our precious bloodline? Do you think it makes any difference to me that she\u2019s a musician and earns her living by using the talents she has? Do you think I give a damn that she doesn\u2019t come from an aristo family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you think those things would matter to me?\u201d It was a heartfelt cry that went unheard.</p><p>Peyton returned to the desk, placed his hands on the glossy surface, and leaned forward. \u201cYou got what you wanted, High Lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what I wanted!\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2014but you aren\u2019t going to get everything.\u201d Peyton stepped away. \u201cI lost Shira\u2014and you lost me.\u201d He turned and walked toward the door.</p><p>\u201cPeyton!\u201d His legs were shaking too much to hold him. He braced his hands against the desk.</p><p>The Warlord Prince who turned to face him was no longer the son he loved, wasn\u2019t anyone he recognized.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d Peyton said quietly. \u201cThe only way you can stop me is by killing me.\u201d</p><p>He sank back into the chair as his son walked out of the study, walked out of the Hall . . . walked out of his life.</p> <p>Saetan closed his eyes and concentrated on breathing. Just breathing.</p><p>The split between him and Peyton had shattered the family for months. It was Mephis who finally realized who had been whispering the poisoned, honeyed words that had made Shira run away from the man she\u2019d loved.</p><p>He\u2019d been so devastated by Peyton\u2019s accusations, he hadn\u2019t thought of Hekatah. Mephis and Peyton had been children when he\u2019d divorced her after she\u2019d tried to shatter his friendship with Andulvar Yaslana by seducing his closest friend and flaunting the pregnancy that had come from that seduction. Instead, Andulvar had kept the child, and Saetan had severed his marriage to a woman who had loved nothing but the power she thought she could control through him.</p><p>When the boys were young, he\u2019d refused to let her see them anywhere except the Hall, where they would be under his watchful eye and protection. But once they\u2019d made the Offering to the Darkness and were old enough\u2014and strong enough\u2014to protect themselves, he hadn\u2019t interfered whenever they wanted to spend time with their mother.</p><p>So he hadn\u2019t thought of her\u2014and he should have. He should have. Hekatah wouldn\u2019t have tolerated her bloodline being fouled by a musician from Dharo, and once Mephis got him to think past the heartache, he\u2019d realized running had saved Shira\u2019s life. Because Hekatah wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to destroy anything or anyone who didn\u2019t suit her own schemes and ambitions.</p><p>And even after Mephis convinced his brother that it had been Hekatah and not Saetan who had slashed love into pieces, even after Peyton began returning again to visit, there was a distance between them neither of them could quite bridge . . . because he was the High Lord of Hell. And because Peyton never loved that deeply again. He\u2019d watched from a distance as Shira made a life for herself, watched her love again enough to accept another man as her husband and the father of her children. Watched those children grow and have children. And when the war came between the Realms of Kaeleer and Terreille, Peyton hadn\u2019t stayed in Dhemlan Terreille to help Mephis defend that Territory. He\u2019d gone to Dharo in Kaeleer to defend the family of the woman who had died centuries before\u2014and had taken his heart with her.</p> <p>Now there was another son who was falling in love\u2014and another mother whose intentions were suspect.</p><p>He didn\u2019t go around to the gate in the wall at the front of the house. He simply used Craft to pass through the stones and walked straight to the kitchen door. He didn\u2019t drop the shields until a thought blasted the kitchen door open and he stepped across the threshold.</p><p>Luthvian dropped the dish she was holding when she saw him. He measured the fear dancing in her eyes and felt a grim pleasure in seeing it. At least he wouldn\u2019t have to put up with her pretending she didn\u2019t know why he was there. But he would give her a chance to defend her own actions. Considering what he was about to tell her, it was the least he could do.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked too softly.</p><p>Luthvian licked her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do, but I\u2019ll be specific since you want to pretend ignorance. Why are you trying to hurt Lucivar?\u201d</p><p>She looked stunned, then offended. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to hurt Lucivar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Fear gave way to temper. \u201cOf course not! He\u2019s my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my son, and I won\u2019t tolerate you interfering in his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterfering?\u201d She stepped over the broken dish, coming closer to him. \u201cI may be protecting him from acting rashly, but that\u2019s hardly interfering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtecting him?\u201d His temper slipped the leash enough that his voice became thunder. \u201cYou think undermining the bond he\u2019s trying to build with a woman is protecting him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s nothing but a hearth witch!\u201d Luthvian yelled. \u201cA nobody! Her family isn\u2019t even a twig on an aristo family tree!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho gives a damn if she\u2019s aristo or not? Lucivar doesn\u2019t. I certainly don\u2019t. I came from a street whore who wasn\u2019t even skilled enough to work in a Red Moon house, so I never had an obsession for bloodlines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have come from a Hayllian slum,\u201d Luthvian sneered, \u201cbut I can trace my line back to Andulvar Yaslana, and that means something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore to the point, you can trace your bloodline back to Andulvar\u2019s son, Ravenar. Which means you can trace your bloodline back to Hekatah\u2014and it\u2019s that bloodline that seems to be rising dominant in you.\u201d</p><p>She staggered back as if he\u2019d struck her. It was possible she\u2019d never known that Ravenar hadn\u2019t been pure Eyrien, but she had to have realized her bloodline wasn\u2019t pure Eyrien. That\u2019s why there were a few Eyrien women each generation who were born without wings. They were throwbacks to Hayllian or Dhemlan women who\u2019d mated with Eyrien males. In Luthvian\u2019s case, that woman had been Hekatah.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I do,\u201d he replied softly. As he looked at her, he knew it was time to finish it. She\u2019d been a troubled young woman when he\u2019d seen her through her Virgin Night. She was still a troubled woman\u2014and there was nothing he could do to help her beyond providing her with this house to live in. But he could, and would, protect Lucivar.</p><p>\u201cI lost Lucivar once because of you,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t lose him again. So listen carefully, Luthvian, because I will only say this once. Stay away from Marian. Don\u2019t interfere in Lucivar\u2019s life. If they want each other, that is their choice, not yours. If you do anything to try to take her away from him, I will show you the darkest corner of Hell\u2014and I will leave you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d\u2014You\u2019d kill me?\u201d</p><p>His voice became viciously gentle. \u201cNo, my dear. You\u2019ll still be among the living when I leave you there.\u201d</p><p>She sank to the floor, shaking.</p><p>Satisfied that she understood he would leave her as prey for everything in the Dark Realm that relished fresh meat and hot blood, he walked out of the kitchen. He waited until he had passed through the low stone wall before he caught the Red Wind and rode it to the Keep. Tonight he needed that dark sanctuary while he wrestled with bitter memories that still had the power to hurt.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Unable to sit a moment longer, Lucivar sprang out of the chair. He didn\u2019t like this. Didn\u2019t like any of this. Especially the fact that Saetan had chosen the sitting area of his study as the place for this discussion. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was talking to his father or the Steward of the Dark Court. Didn\u2019t matter. He knew when he was being cornered. \u201cFind someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no one else,\u201d Saetan said quietly.</p><p>Restless, he prowled from one piece of furniture to the next, never looking directly at Saetan but always keeping him in sight. \u201cWhy not ask Chaosti? He wears the Gray, and he\u2019s First Circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t, as yet, have enough experience in bed to handle something like this. And his physical relationship with Gabrielle is still too new for him to respond . . . appropriately. Besides, his feelings toward Karla are too familial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the maturity to handle this.\u201d Saetan sighed. \u201cI know sex is . . . difficult . . . for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing about it!\u201d Lucivar shouted. \u201cYou have no idea what it was like, being used that way.\u201d</p><p>Seeing Saetan flinch, he regretted the words, but not enough to stop himself from using whatever weapon he could to avoid this particular duty.</p><p>\u201cLucivar,\u201d Saetan said, his voice painfully calm, \u201cKarla is a Gray-Jeweled Queen. Her Territory is divided between the Blood who supported her uncle and the vile changes he was making in their society and the Blood who have waited desperately for Karla to come of age and stand as Glacia\u2019s Queen. Until she has her Virgin Night, she is vulnerable and could be broken, could be stripped of the Gray. Without her strength, civil war could erupt in Glacia and devastate her people.\u201d</p><p>He knew all of that, but it didn\u2019t make it easier. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like men,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNot that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich will make this even harder for her, since she doesn\u2019t have interest in the male body to quicken her own body\u2019s response.\u201d Saetan rubbed his forehead. \u201cIf I was physically able to do this, I wouldn\u2019t have asked you. I would have taken care of it\u2014because it\u2019s Karla.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar stared at his father. When the coven first came to visit Jaenelle here at the Hall, they adopted Saetan as an honorary uncle. But over the five years since then, he\u2019d become an uncle to all of them in heart, the man who had trained them in Craft the way no one else in Kaeleer could have, the man who had helped them with problems, disciplined them for mistakes, taught them about honor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Considering the justifiable fears Karla had had about her uncle by blood, having Uncle Saetan take her to bed for her Virgin Night would have been a nightmarish experience for both of them. But Saetan would have done it, knowing he would lose the young woman he loved like another daughter in order to save the Queen. If Saetan would have been willing to pay that price, could he do any less? He was First Circle in Jaenelle\u2019s court. So was Karla. He couldn\u2019t turn away from a request to help a First Circle Queen. And, really, wasn\u2019t this just another kind of battlefield? Normally, the Virgin Night was a witch\u2019s initiation to sex as well as the act that would protect her power, but the likelihood of Karla ever taking another man to bed were slim to none, so bedroom skills weren\u2019t as necessary as a warrior\u2019s skills. He just had to get her safely from one side of this battlefield to the other.</p><p>He closed his eyes, accepting his duty while his stomach churned.</p><p>\u201cEverything has a price,\u201d he said quietly. He opened his eyes in time to see the hint of disapproval in Saetan\u2019s before it was masked.</p><p>Saetan hesitated before saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure Karla would be willing\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot from Karla. From you.\u201d</p><p>No hesitation this time. \u201cThen name your price. I\u2019ll pay it.\u201d</p><p>That simple. Not even the usual, sensible precaution of asking what the price would be in case it was too high to pay.</p><p>\u201cAfter,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it after I\u2019ve seen her through this.\u201d Because he knew what he wanted. They didn\u2019t need it hanging between them while they both needed to stay focused on the task ahead.</p><p>Saetan rose gracefully. \u201cI\u2019ll inform Karla of your decision and make the preparations. Come up to the room when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p> <p>Lucivar waited until his father left the study before he covered his face with his hands. Please. Sweet Darkness, please let me get her through this.</p><p>Wishing fiercely that his brother Daemon was there to offer advice, he left the study and headed toward the bedroom that would be a very personal kind of battleground.</p><p>Saetan had chosen a guest room in another wing of the Hall. Lucivar felt grateful for that since he wouldn\u2019t have to remember whatever happened here every time he looked at his own bed. And neither would Karla when she stayed in the suite of rooms she\u2019d been given as her own here at the Hall. But the lack of personal effects in the room also made him feel a bit . . . dirty. Just another male acting the slut.</p><p>Leaning one arm against the mantel, he glanced at the small table that held two goblets and a heavy glass container, its contents being kept warm by a small tongue of witchfire.</p><p>Night of Fire. The aphrodisiac brew used for a Virgin Night.</p><p>Remembering the kinds of aphrodisiacs the witches in Terreille used on a man, he shuddered. It didn\u2019t matter that Saetan had made this brew. The thought of drinking it produced a stab of fear in him. The problem was, he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be any use to Karla if he didn\u2019t drink it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Karla said. \u201cIf there was another way . . .\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as he looked at her. Her fair skin had a touch of sickly green. She looked so young, standing there in a simple cotton nightgown, waiting for him to open her body and spill the virginal blood that would protect her power as a witch.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to do this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied honestly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Would it make it easier for both of them if he explained? \u201cI\u2019ve only done this once before.\u201d</p><p>Karla swallowed hard. \u201cAnd it went badly?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar looked away. \u201cNot for her.\u201d The memory he\u2019d pushed away so long ago rose up, choking him. \u201cThe hunting camp I was in at the time ... The young males who were deemed ready were taken to the Blood Run to test their strength against it. Once an Eyrien male successfully makes the Blood Run, he\u2019s considered a warrior.</p> <p>\u201cWell, we all survived the Run, which doesn\u2019t always happen. We guested at a nearby eyrie to celebrate. Plenty of food, plenty to drink . . . and women who were willing to bed newly acknowledged warriors eager to test their other skills.</p><p>\u201cOne young witch lavished attention on me\u2014the kind of attention I seldom got in Askavi. When she led me to one of the bedrooms, I was imagining a lusty night of hot sex\u2014and was young enough and stupid enough to want it. Well, after a few kisses it was clear something was wrong. That\u2019s when she admitted she was a virgin. She\u2019d been refusing the warriors who lived in that eyrie because she was certain any of them would do his best to break her, and she didn\u2019t want to lose what power she had.</p><p>\u201cSo I put aside my own expectations and saw her through her Virgin Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what went wrong?\u201d Karla asked.</p><p>Shame clogged his throat. He swallowed it, just as he\u2019d swallowed it centuries ago. \u201cThe next morning, when I went to join the other warriors for a meal before heading back to the hunting camp . . . She was serving up food with the other women. I went over to her, just to talk to someone who would think kindly of me. But the other women must have told her who I was. What I was. Must have teased her about giving herself to a half-breed bastard. So instead of saying anything or even smiling at me, she . . . spit on me.\u201d</p><p>The memory swamped him. The disgust in her eyes. The cruel laughter of the men. The reminder that they had to accept his status as a warrior but would never accept him.</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>The sudden chill in the air jolted him back to the present. Karla\u2019s glacier blue eyes flashed with fury. Her Gray power rolled through the room.</p><p>Before he could think of how to respond, there was a sharp rap on the door and Saetan walked into the room.</p><p>Great. That was just great. He really needed confirmation that his father was staying so close in case something went wrong.</p><p>After looking at him, then at Karla, Saetan asked quietly, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bitch spit on him after he got her through her Virgin Night!\u201d Karla shouted.</p><p>The room had been chilly before. Now it was frigid as Saetan\u2019s eyes glazed with cold rage.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Saetan asked too softly.</p><p>Oh, no. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Karla grabbed a pillow and began shredding it as she stormed around the room. \u201cThe bitch deserves having her heart ripped out\u2014if she has a heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Saetan asked again.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. Maybe he should have known better, but he hadn\u2019t expected this.</p><p>\u201cCan we discuss this outside?\u201d He gestured toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to let that bitch get away with this, are you, Uncle Saetan?\u201d Karla demanded.</p><p>That\u2019s just what he needed\u2014a Gray-Jeweled Queen goading a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince to rise to the killing edge.</p><p>Saetan walked out of the room. Lucivar followed, closing the door firmly behind him.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Saetan asked for the third time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember her name,\u201d he lied. He remembered everything about her, everything about that night and the morning after.</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Saetan crooned.</p><p>If Daemon had said that to him in that tone of voice, he\u2019d have braced himself for a terrifying kind of fight.</p><p>\u201cYou never saw another witch through her Virgin Night because of that bitch,\u201d Saetan continued. \u201cIsn\u2019t that true?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. Wouldn\u2019t say anything. Not because he gave a damn what happened to that bitch, but because his father\u2019s instant response to a son\u2019s pain was as frightening as it was gratifying.</p><p>\u201cLet it go,\u201d Lucivar said. He deliberately looked at the bedroom door. \u201cThis is more important than avenging an old memory.\u201d</p><p>The fury in Saetan\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t diminish, but he stepped back, walked down the hallway, and entered a room a few doors down from the one Lucivar stood in front of.</p><p>Knowing he\u2019d managed to walk away from one battlefield, Lucivar took a deep breath, opened the door, and prepared to step onto the next one.</p><p>Karla was still storming around the room, bits of pillow stuffing stuck in her spiky white-blond hair. When she saw him, she planted her feet in the fighting stance he\u2019d taught her, her eyes fired up for battle.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to help you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He almost laughed, but as he looked at her, he could hear Daemon\u2019s voice whispering to him. She took the bait. Now use it. As long as she\u2019s focused on helping you perform, she won\u2019t be thinking about why you have to perform. Use what she\u2019s offering to get her through what has to be done.</p><p>He sighed, then said hesitantly, \u201cMaybe if we just sat together for a while.\u201d</p><p>Alarm leaped into her eyes. Had he sounded too uncertain, too hesitant?</p><p>There weren\u2019t many choices in the room. The armchairs by the hearth weren\u2019t made to accommodate a man with wings, but there was one straight-backed chair that had been placed near the window. He led her to it and settled her on his lap.</p><p>They stared at each other.</p><p>Maybe it would have been easier at night, in the dark, instead of late afternoon with the heat and light of late summer pouring through the open window. Saetan had cleared this wing, so there were no gardeners working outside, no servants in the hallways. But there was still that awareness of people working and moving throughout the rest of the Hall. If Marian had been sitting on his lap, he wouldn\u2019t have thought about those people\u2014couldn\u2019t honestly say he\u2019d be thinking about anything at all except her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pushed that thought aside. It wasn\u2019t smart to think of Marian right now. They weren\u2019t lovers. He wasn\u2019t breaking faith with her by being here. And even if they were lovers, seeing a witch through her Virgin Night was a duty to the court, not an act of infidelity.</p><p>Thinking about that wasn\u2019t helping him either.</p><p>He looked at the brew warming in its glass container. No choice.</p><p>Using Craft, he lifted the glass container, poured its contents into the two goblets, set the container back on its stand, and extinguished the small tongue of witchfire. When the goblets floated over to him, he handed one to Karla and took the other.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Karla asked, sniffing cautiously.</p><p>\u201cNight of Fire. A brew made specifically for . . . this.\u201d He braced himself, but couldn\u2019t lift the goblet up to drink.</p><p>Karla took a sip. Took another. She stared into the goblet. \u201cYou only get to have this once?\u201d</p><p>He studied her as she sipped again. \u201cI suppose so. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this stuff is wooonderful.\u201d</p> <p>Wary, he took a swallow of the brew. Nothing happened. The aphrodisiacs he\u2019d experienced in Terreille worked wickedly fast, pumping lust through a man\u2019s body before he realized what had happened to him. But this . . . He drank again. Waited. It did taste good. Warm. Ripe. Some kind of brandy or wine as the base, but . . .</p><p>His limbs felt warm, relaxed, heavy. His cock felt warm and heavy. Desire softly heated his blood, sharpened his senses to the feel and smell of a female. He drained the goblet, then used Craft to send it gliding on air back to the table. Karla\u2019s goblet followed a few moments later.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to help you?\u201d she asked, looking at him with lightly glazed eyes.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>The feel of her mouth on his, hesitant, exploring. The feel of her body as his hands caressed her. Desire, thick and golden, swam in his blood as his hand cupped her breast. Her tongue in his mouth ... Tart and sweet, just like the woman.</p><p>He picked her up and took her to the bed, vanishing her nightgown as he set her down on the sheets. Vanishing his own clothes, he stretched out beside her, putting an Ebon-gray shield around his left hand and forearm before he pinned her wrists above her head. Being a Black Widow as well as a Queen, she had a snake tooth beneath the ring finger of her right hand. He didn\u2019t need her pumping venom into him in a moment of panic.</p> <p>Her body responded to him as he kissed, caressed, and suckled, but he felt a tension rising in her. She\u2019d fight him when the time came. Even knowing he was doing this for her, she\u2019d still fight him\u2014unless she was sufficiently distracted. There were different ways of protecting a witch during that moment when her life hung by a hymenal thread, but this way . . . Yes. If she trusted him enough to let him in, she\u2019d be captured, distracted, and protected.</p><p>\u201cKarla,\u201d he said, his hand still caressing her. \u201cWill you let me in?\u201d</p><p>She panted, but it wasn\u2019t excitement that made her breathless. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>A psychic touch. A soft brush against her first inner barrier. \u201cWill you let me in?\u201d</p><p>She flinched at that light touch, too aware that he was strong enough to force open those barriers. But she opened herself to him, let him glide through the surface layers of her mind. She began to shake when he got close to her core. In another moment, she would try to push him out.</p><p>He moved with a warrior\u2019s speed and training, wrapping his power around her so fast, she had no time to evade. In his mind, he held a picture of his arms wrapped around her naked body, her back pressed against his chest as tendrils of power strapped her legs to his, leaving her helpless.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he said\u2014and launched them both skyward.</p><p>Wings pumping. Blue sky above them. He turned\u2014and sent them diving toward a canyon in Askavi that he knew well. While he pictured the canyon\u2019s physical details, he didn\u2019t take her through the experience of making the Khaldharon Run. He had to keep his attention divided between what he was doing in the real world and this fantasy he was building to distract her. Even in a fantasy, the Khaldharon Run was too dangerous to play with. So he changed it to a straight flight down the center of the canyon, flying at the speed of the Red Wind, flying so close to the river below them a miscalculation would end with them hitting the water with bone-breaking force.</p> <p>She squealed and swore at him, but her body was primed for the taking now. As they approached the wall of stone at the end of the Run, he positioned himself between her legs . . . and waited.</p><p>They swung up out of the Run and continued flying up, up, up. Releasing the bonds that strapped her legs to his, he flipped her between one pump of his wings and the next so they were now face-to-face. Her arms locked around his neck as he strapped their legs again. His arms wrapped around her, his hard cock pressed against her.</p><p>Up, up, up.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d she yelled.</p><p>He laughed, folded his wings, and twisted. For one endless moment, they hung motionless before they plummeted toward the ground far below them. And in that moment when they began the fall, he thrust into her.</p><p>The speed and exhilaration of free fall. He spun them, laughing, while in another place, his body thrust into hers, pushing her toward climax.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut and swore at him as the ground rushed toward them and pleasure burst through their bodies.</p><p>He opened his wings, changing the picture in his mind as he glided over treetops to settle them in a glen that was one of his favorite places in Ebon Rih.</p><p>As he laid her on the grass near a pool of water, he unwrapped the power that had held her captive while he withdrew from her body.</p><p>Fully back in the bedroom now, he settled beside her, pulling the sheet up to their waists. They would deal with the practicalities in a few minutes. It wasn\u2019t something she needed to see just yet.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Karla muttered over and over. She finally opened her eyes. \u201cIs that your idea of a good time?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cActually . . . it is.\u201d</p><p>She swore at him.</p><p>She looked a little pissed, a little dazed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s done?\u201d</p><p>He rested a hand on her belly.</p><p>She stared up at him. \u201cDone? But . . . how? When?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWhen you were watching the ground come up to meet us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I was watching?\u201d She blew out a breath and finally began to relax. \u201cWell, that was a unique experience.\u201d</p><p>He watched the tension build in her and worried about the grim expression that settled over her face.</p><p>\u201cLucivar,\u201d she said, staring at the ceiling. \u201cWhen I asked Uncle Saetan to arrange this, I wasn\u2019t thinking about . . . I wasn\u2019t thinking. But it\u2019s not my fertile time. I swear it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve been drinking a contraceptive brew for a few weeks now.\u201d He\u2019d never had to think about it when he\u2019d lived in Terreille, never had to wonder if the bitches who had used him could get a child out of him. He\u2019d known that he\u2019d somehow made himself infertile in a way the witches who had wanted him for stud couldn\u2019t undo. Just as he\u2019d known within a week of Marian\u2019s coming to live in his eyrie that he\u2019d turned the key in that lock so that he could flood her with ripe seed. He wanted a child with her, but not without a bond, not without commitment.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you drinking a contraceptive brew?\u201d Karla asked. Her eyes widened. \u201cYou have a lover, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She moved fast, surprising him enough that he ended up on his back with her on top of him.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Her mouth curved in a wicked smile. \u201cIt\u2019s the hearth witch, isn\u2019t it? The one you made the garden for.\u201d</p><p>Just the thought of Marian primed him. He shoved Karla off him and slipped out of bed while he still could. \u201cLet\u2019s get cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCleaned\u2014\u201d Karla flipped the sheet back. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>When she turned pale, he grabbed her arm and dragged her out of bed and into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get snarly about it,\u201d Karla said.</p><p>He turned on the shower faucets, waited until there was a hint of hot water, picked her up, and planted her under the spray.</p><p>She let out one breathless squeal and tried to punch him when he stepped in behind her.</p><p>He soaped one cloth and shoved it into her hands. \u201cWash.\u201d Soaping up another one, he spun her around and started on her back.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve been drinking the contraceptive brew for weeks now, you\u2019re safe,\u201d Karla said as she washed her breasts and belly. \u201cSo why aren\u2019t you lovers yet? You want her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Swiping the hair out of her eyes, she turned to face him. \u201cDoes she want you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the name of Hell am I supposed to know what she wants?\u201d Gritting his teeth, he began washing himself. He watched for signs of interest, didn\u2019t he? If he pushed too fast, she\u2019d run. Hell\u2019s fire. He hadn\u2019t even tried to kiss her yet because he was afraid she\u2019d run, and he needed her there. He needed to be around her.</p><p>His hands curled into fists. He closed his eyes. This wasn\u2019t the time or place for anger of any kind. Before he could get his tongue around an apology, Karla nudged him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m washed,\u201d she said. \u201cTrade places. I\u2019ll do your back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frustrated and miserable, he obeyed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s summer,\u201d Karla said as she moved the cloth over his back. \u201cWhich means you wear what Eyrien males usually wear during the summer\u2014which is next to nothing, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo maybe you\u2019re right about not doing anything obvious. Maybe it would be better to wait until she trips by herself and falls into your waiting arms.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d She gave him a light punch. \u201cLook. There you are, flaunting all these lovely muscles day after day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t flaunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do. All the males do. You\u2019ve just got more to flaunt than a lot of them. You can rinse off now.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face her to get his back under the spray. \u201cYour point is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes she ever get a dreamy look when she\u2019s doing something simple?\u201d</p><p>He stuck his head under the spray. \u201cSure. When she\u2019s planning what bulbs to plant for spring flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s she supposed to say? That she\u2019s day-dreaming about your muscles and it\u2019s got her all warm and tingly?\u201d</p><p>He considered that for a moment. \u201cYeah. Why not?\u201d</p><p>Karla shook her head and smiled at him. \u201cWhen she finally gets up the nerve to try to seduce you, don\u2019t make her work too hard, all right? And don\u2019t scare her with that falling out of the sky stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Eyrien. She\u2019d enjoy free fall.\u201d</p> <p>Karla just stared at him, then looked down. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said slowly, \u201csince you\u2019ve got the water so cold, it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s true about wings being in proportion to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to find out how cold a mountain lake is even in late summer?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been in a cold mountain lake until you\u2019ve been in one in Glacia.\u201d She stepped out of the shower. \u201cTaking a swim there will shrivel your assets for a month.\u201d</p><p>His response as he turned off the water was pungent and succinct.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Lucivar we all know and love,\u201d Karla said, giving him that wicked smile. \u201cKiss kiss.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar stared at the study door. Everything has a price. He\u2019d wanted this since coming to Kaeleer and being reunited with his father three years ago. Now he would finally get the answer to a question that had haunted him.</p><p>Now he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted it.</p><p>Taking a deep breath to steady himself, he walked into the study.</p> <p>Saetan rose from the chair behind the blackwood desk and came around the desk so that he could lean against the front of it. \u201cYou did well, Prince.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, warmed by the praise but too edgy to respond to it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your price, Lucivar?\u201d Saetan asked softly.</p><p>\u201cThe answer to a question.\u201d</p><p>Saetan raised one eyebrow and waited.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Lucivar asked, thoughts and feelings swelling that one word until he wasn\u2019t sure what else to say. But when Saetan just looked at him, he tried to shape the question. \u201cWhen Daemon and I were taken away from you, why didn\u2019t you fight to get us back?\u201d</p><p>He watched in amazement as Saetan paled.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d Saetan said after a long pause, his voice rough.</p><p>Lucivar took a step toward him. \u201cWhy? Even if you couldn\u2019t have fought back at that instant, you\u2019re a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince. You could have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d A tremor of some strong emotion went through Saetan. He wouldn\u2019t look at Lucivar. His deep voice was barely a whisper. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. Because of Zuulaman.\u201d</p><p>Puzzled by Saetan\u2019s obvious distress, Lucivar said, \u201cWho is Zuulaman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a person. A place.\u201d Saetan moved fast and was at the door before Lucivar could raise a hand to stop him. But he hesitated as he opened the door. \u201cIf you want to know about Zuulaman, ask Andulvar. In some ways, he remembers better than I do what happened.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone, and Lucivar stared at that closed door a long time, wondering what had happened in that place that could make the High Lord run away.</p><p>He found Andulvar near the small lake that was part of the estate. He could have pounded on the door of Andulvar\u2019s rooms, but the coven had gathered to be with Karla, and he suspected it was better to keep this conversation private. So he\u2019d waited until sundown when the Demon Prince rose from his daylight rest and followed Andulvar to the lake.</p><p>\u201cZuulaman?\u201d Andulvar growled. \u201cWhy in the name of Hell are you asking about Zuulaman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked my father why he didn\u2019t fight to get us back when Daemon and I were taken from him. He said it was because of Zuulaman. He said you\u2019d tell me what that means.\u201d Lucivar waited while Andulvar stared at the lake. \u201cDo you remember it?\u201d</p><p>Andulvar snorted. \u201cYeah. I remember Zuulaman.\u201d Turning his head, he studied Lucivar for a long time. \u201cAre you sure you want to know this?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Andulvar sighed, went back to staring at the lake . . . and began to talk.</p><p>Two hours later, Lucivar walked back into Saetan\u2019s study and stopped just inside the door. His father was standing next to the bookcases that filled the wall behind his desk. He held a book open in his hands. He didn\u2019t look up, didn\u2019t turn a page. Just stood there.</p><p>\u201cHe told you,\u201d Saetan said in a voice stripped of any emotion.</p><p>Unnerved and a little queasy, Lucivar worked to keep his voice steady. \u201cHe told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now you know.\u201d</p><p>Something\u2019s wrong here, Lucivar thought as he studied his father. Something about the way Saetan stood made him think of a brittle object that could shatter at the slightest blow.</p><p>He shook his head, raked a hand through his black hair. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Dorothea let us live. Once she realized she couldn\u2019t use either of us for stud, she should have killed us before we got old enough to make the Offering to the Darkness and come into our full strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t.\u201d Saetan closed the book and put it back on the shelf. \u201cBefore I left Terreille for good, I sent Dorothea a message. I told her that on the day Daemon no longer walked among the living, Hayll would become another Zuulaman. I sent the same message to Prythian about you.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar felt the floor slide out from under him. He took a stagger-step to regain his balance. \u201cBut . . . it was a bluff, wasn\u2019t it? You wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d</p><p>Saetan finally turned and looked at him. \u201cYes,\u201d he said too softly, \u201cI would have.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the man he\u2019d come to know over the past three years. He understood now all of Andulvar\u2019s cautions about dealing with the High Lord. And yet . . .</p><p>He\u2019d seen that look in a man\u2019s eyes before. But not in that face, not in those eyes. That was the difference between him and Andulvar, Prothvar, and Mephis. They didn\u2019t know Daemon. They had never danced with the Sadist.</p><p>He understood the brittleness now. Saetan was waiting for him to turn away. Expected him to turn away. As Andulvar must have done for a while. As his other sons must have done when they became old enough to understand what their father was capable of when provoked beyond rage.</p><p>Everything has a price. Carrying the memory was Saetan\u2019s price. He didn\u2019t have to add to the burden.</p><p>\u201cI need to get back to Askavi,\u201d Lucivar said, feeling awkward and knowing that what he said now could shatter the bond between them. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell Marian I was staying overnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>No, you don\u2019t. You think I\u2019m turning away, and I\u2019m not. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a couple of days.\u201d Turning toward the door, he hesitated. \u201cGood night, Father.\u201d</p><p>He watched the tension seep out of Saetan\u2019s body. Saw what might be a shimmer of tears in those gold eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Lucivar,\u201d his father replied.</p><p>It was after midnight when he landed in the courtyard in front of his eyrie. He\u2019d been too churned up to go home when he got back to Ebon Rih, so he\u2019d flown, working his body while he struggled to empty his mind. Now his body was tired, but his mind . . .</p><p>There were so many ways he could have died. Accidents happened in the hunting camps when youngsters were being trained to handle weapons. Warriors died trying to prove themselves in the Blood Run or the Khaldharon. There were battles between courts\u2014usually staged as contests and exercises with weapons shielded to do nothing more than bruise, but there were always males who used those contests as an excuse to shed a rival\u2019s blood, and there had been plenty of warriors who had resented that a half-breed bastard had fighting skills they could match only in their dreams.</p><p>There were so many ways he could have died. And he almost had died when he escaped and ended up in Kaeleer. If he had . . .</p><p>The door opened behind him. Marian said hesitantly, \u201cPrince Yaslana?\u201d</p><p>He turned and looked at the reason his feelings were still churned up. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She came toward him, her steps uncertain, trying to gauge his mood. \u201cI could heat up something for you to eat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d He reached out, touched her hair. When his fingers trailed along her shoulder, she started to step back. \u201cMarian . . . Let me hold you. Please. I need to hold you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move toward him, but she folded her wings tight so he could wrap his arms around her and draw her up against him. At first, she held herself stiffly, but when he didn\u2019t do anything else, she relaxed enough to rest her head on his shoulder and put her arms around his waist.</p><p>He brushed his cheek against her hair, savoring the feel of her, the smell of her.</p><p>Everything has a price.</p> <p>He would have to talk to Saetan and reach an agreement. He was an Eyrien warrior and Jaenelle\u2019s First Escort. He had to be able to step onto any kind of battlefield and fight to defend his Queen. He had to be willing to die for his Queen. He couldn\u2019t do that until he got a promise from Saetan that there wouldn\u2019t be another Zuulaman.</p><p>His arms tightened around Marian. No Eyrien mattered more to him than she did. So he had to have that promise.</p><p>Because if he died without it, the price would be too high.</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>Marian looked at the sugar spilled on the kitchen floor and wanted to cry. Such a little thing. A bobble of the hand that held the sugar bowl. Normally, it would have caused no more than a moment\u2019s annoyance before she cleaned it up.</p> <p>But not today. Not when a taloned fist had curled around her womb and was squeezing hard.</p><p>She closed her eyes and braced a hand against the kitchen counter. Maybe once in a year, the physical discomfort that came with her moontime escalated to nauseating pain. When it hit, it made her grateful she didn\u2019t wear a Jewel darker than the Purple Dusk because the pain balanced the power that could be wielded the rest of the time, and darker-Jeweled witches always suffered more during the first three days. And no witch could use her Jeweled strength during those first three days without causing herself hideous pain.</p><p>Marian opened her eyes and stared at the spilled sugar. The thought of doing any physical labor made her want to curl into a ball and weep, but she knew from experience that even using basic Craft today would increase the pain.</p><p>With a shaky sigh, she went to the cupboard in the pantry where she kept her broom and dustpan.</p><p>Lucivar stopped in the corridor, the scent hitting him with the force of running into a stone wall. His nostrils flared. His lips pulled back in a silent snarl.</p><p>Moon\u2019s blood.</p> <p>Some change in a witch\u2019s psychic scent or her physical scent triggered that recognition in Blood males once they reached puberty. Maybe it was a trait that had developed long ago as a tool for survival since this was one of the times when the balance of power between the genders swung in the males\u2019 favor. A witch who had to defend herself against a male ended up fighting two adversaries: him and her own body.</p><p>Which was why the males closed ranks around a Queen during those days when she was vulnerable. Even the mildest-tempered Blood male became edgy and aggressive, but moon\u2019s blood drove Warlord Princes to the killing edge. Naturally aggressive and territorial, their response to an unknown male was lethal more often than not. That response was the primary reason Blood males were trained to ignore the scent of moon\u2019s blood except for the females in their own family and the Circle of the court they served in.</p><p>And that was the problem now, wasn\u2019t it? At the Hall, the male servants looked after, and fussed over, the female servants. The family and the boyos took care of Jaenelle and the coven when they were in residence. The boundaries were established, and all the males accepted them.</p><p>But there was just the three of them here. He\u2019d gritted his teeth through it the other times, reminding himself that Marian worked for him, so he couldn\u2019t yell at her for exerting herself. He couldn\u2019t insist that she sit and do something quiet that wouldn\u2019t strain her body. He couldn\u2019t roar until it brought every male in the area running to find out what was wrong the way he could when Jaenelle got stubborn. There were boundaries and\u2014</p><p>Screw boundaries. Marian was not going to make him frantic again, seething in silence and trying to keep a slippery hold on his temper while she scrubbed and polished things that could damn well wait a few days before they got scrubbed and polished. They were going to compromise\u2014and if that meant tying her to a chair to make her rest, so be it.</p><p>With his temper choked back to simmering\u2014and ready to boil\u2014he strode toward the kitchen to explain a few things to his little hearth witch.</p><p>\u201cWHAT IN THE NAME OF HELL ARE YOU DOING?\u201d</p><p>The broom jerked in Marian\u2019s hands, scattering the sugar she\u2019d just swept into a neat pile. Her heart slammed against her chest. She took a step back as Lucivar stepped through the archway into the kitchen, his lips pulled back in a snarl and a wild look in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYou are not going to do this again, do you understand me?\u201d he shouted as he walked toward her. \u201cYou are not going to beat yourself into the ground trying to do more than you should be doing.\u201d</p><p>The weepy mood vanished. Resentment welled up, hot and bitter. Hearth witches weren\u2019t pampered. Other witches might be excused from their work, but hearth witches were expected to grit their teeth and keep going, no matter how they felt. Her mother had worked half days during the first three days of her moontime. Her sisters weren\u2019t required to do more than sit quietly and study\u2014and usually complained about doing even that much. She, on the other hand, was expected to prepare the meals and do the cleaning, excused from her work only if the greasy nausea that sometimes accompanied the start of the moon\u2019s blood made her too sick.</p><p>It had become a matter of pride that she did her work and didn\u2019t complain, since that only brought criticism. Now Lucivar was yelling at her for no reason, just when she\u2019d been about to swallow her pride and tell him she really needed to rest for the day. She was even going to ask him to purchase bread at the baker\u2019s in Riada so she wouldn\u2019t have to make biscuits to go with the stew she was planning to make for the midday meal. Well, she was not going to ask him for anything now.</p><p>\u201cI can do my work,\u201d she said, gritting her teeth as she started sweeping up the sugar again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to rest if I have to tie you down to make sure you do it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d love to rest today, but not on his terms. Not when he was snarling at her. \u201cWhat I do is my own business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink again, witchling,\u201d Lucivar snapped, moving closer to her. \u201cYou live in my eyrie, you\u2019re under my protection. And that means protecting you from yourself when you get too stubborn to do what\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never get stubborn and always do what\u2019s good for you,\u201d she snapped back. The nerve of the man. Who did he think he was, anyway?</p><p>He grabbed the broom handle, his hand closing over it just above her own hands. He tugged. She tugged back, trying to reclaim control. His hand tightened. A fast twist of his wrist and the handle snapped. He took one step back, turned, and threw the piece of wood through the archway.</p><p>Marian flinched, expecting to hear a lamp in the other room smashing. Or, worse, the crash as the handle shattered the glass doors that led out to the lawn on the other side of the eyrie.</p><p>No smash. No crash. Nothing. Not even the clatter of wood as it fell on the floor.</p><p>He must have vanished it before it could hit something.</p><p>Before she could react, he yanked the rest of the broom out of her hands, strode to the archway, and threw the broom away.</p><p>How could she forget how strong he was? She\u2019d seen him exercising to keep his warrior\u2019s body and reflexes sharply honed. She\u2019d seen him chopping wood. Hadn\u2019t she watched those wonderful muscles ripple under his skin all summer? He didn\u2019t need Craft to be dangerous.</p><p>Turning back to the kitchen, he pointed a finger at her, and snarled, \u201cYou are not doing anything today.\u201d</p><p>A wave of temper drowned out nerves. \u201cDon\u2019t you tell me what to do! I can do my work!\u201d Irrationally angry and feeling cornered, she grabbed the pot sitting on the stove and threw it at him.</p><p>He tucked his wings in at the last second. The pot hit the wall next to the archway and fell to the floor.</p><p>Awful silence filled the kitchen.</p><p>Lucivar picked up the pot and walked away.</p><p>Marian crept to the archway and saw him outside, throwing the pot at the bales of hay he\u2019d set up for target practice. She sagged against the wall. Eyrien males didn\u2019t tolerate defiance from a witch who didn\u2019t outrank them. Thank the Darkness Lucivar was taking his anger out on a pot and bales of hay. Her father, who didn\u2019t technically outrank her since he also wore Purple Dusk Jewels, would have slapped her for arguing with him. Throwing the pot at him would have earned her a fist in the belly, inflicting pain where it would hurt the worst today.</p><p>*Marian?*</p><p>She turned and saw Tassle sniffing the spilled sugar.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t step in that. I have to clean it up.\u201d</p><p>Tassle sniffed the air. *You cannot use Craft.*</p><p>She bit back a snappish reply. That furry body made it easy to forget at times that Tassle was more than a wolf. Other times, forgetting that he would respond to some things like any other Warlord would only cause more problems.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t use Craft, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>*I will clean it up for you.*</p><p>The sugar on the floor vanished. He looked at her, obviously expecting praise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even the furry male didn\u2019t think she was capable of doing anything today. But she petted him and thanked him. Pleased with himself and satisfied with the praise, he left her to roam the mountain since Yas was there to protect her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mention Lucivar might be the very thing she needed protection from. Tassle wouldn\u2019t have a chance of surviving if Lucivar decided to punish her and the wolf got in the way.</p><p>When she heard Lucivar come back inside, she looked around for something to do. She winced as she bent over and pulled a skillet from the bottom cupboard. He liked her beef stew. Maybe knowing he\u2019d have it for his midday meal would soften his mood.</p><p>Trembling, she put the skillet on the stove and stepped back as he entered the kitchen. Throwing the pot hadn\u2019t eased his temper. If anything, his mood seemed darker.</p> <p>He set the pot on the counter beside the sink, and growled, \u201cThat won\u2019t do it. The balance is off.\u201d Spotting the skillet, he picked it up and took it outside.</p><p>Returning a few minutes later, he grabbed her arm and hauled her out to the bales of hay.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Marian said, trying to pull back. \u201cPrince Yaslana\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shoved the skillet\u2019s handle into her hand. \u201cThe pot doesn\u2019t have the balance to be an effective weapon. This does.\u201d</p><p>He moved toward her. She swung the skillet up over her head.</p> <p>As his hand closed over her wrist, he shook his head. \u201cNot that way. The move takes too long and tells your adversary too clearly what you intend. It has to be fast and unexpected to do you any good.\u201d He positioned himself behind her, one hand on her waist, the other still holding her wrist. \u201cYou need to attack with a side motion, working from about the same height as if you\u2019d grabbed it off the stove and swung. Your own strength behind the swing would be enough to bruise bone. With a little Craft to enhance it, you can break bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to break anyone\u2019s bones,\u201d Marian said as he moved her arm back and forth in a swing motion. Of course, the thought of denting his head had a lot of appeal at the moment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not tall enough to make a head shot practical,\u201d Lucivar said as if he\u2019d read her thoughts. \u201cBut breaking ribs or a forearm would be a good first strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to attack anyone with a skillet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. But you\u2019re going to learn how to do it anyway.\u201d He released her and stepped back. \u201cNow swing it and release to hit the target.\u201d</p><p>She swung it, put nothing behind it, and let it go. It bounced on the ground halfway between her and the target. Satisfied she\u2019d proven her point, she said, \u201cSee? It doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>The skillet flew through the air, straight to Lucivar\u2019s hand. He just looked at her until she stepped aside. Moving into the same spot where she\u2019d stood, he swung the skillet in that sideways motion and let it go. It hit the target with enough force to get wedged in the hay. It hung there for a moment before he used Craft to bring it flying back to him.</p><p>Saying nothing, he handed the skillet to her.</p><p>Having no choice, she swung the skillet. Damn him, this hurt. But she knew he wouldn\u2019t relent, so she tried to hit the target\u2014and actually came close.</p><p>Studying her, he held out one hand. The skillet came flying back to him. \u201cMarian? Do you have everything you want for the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed through her. The insufferable prick! Of course she didn\u2019t have everything she wanted! It was late autumn now, she\u2019d been working for him for months, and she was still working with the basic tools she\u2019d bought out of her own wages. She\u2019d bought all the canning supplies out of her own wages, was still buying cleaning supplies out of her own wages\u2014and was still waiting for him to broach the subject of a household budget. Oh, he\u2019d told her often enough that she could put anything she needed to buy on his accounts at the stores in Riada, but he only indirectly benefited from her having all the tools she\u2019d like to have, and she didn\u2019t feel easy about running up a bill without first getting his consent, and if he wasn\u2019t observant enough to see what was going on in his own home, he\u2019d hardly understand why having extra casserole dishes would be helpful.</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen could use a few things,\u201d she said, working hard to keep from yelling at him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll make a deal with you. You hit the target three times out of six tries, you can buy everything you want for the kitchen. If you can\u2019t find something you want in the shops in Riada, I\u2019ll take you to Amdarh. Buy everything you\u2019ve wanted but have been doing without and put it on my accounts.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. At home, she\u2019d had to beg and plead to get anything that would have made her work easier. That was part of the reason she\u2019d been reluctant to say anything to him. She hadn\u2019t wanted him to think she was greedy or extravagant, especially when he was so generous with her wages. But now he was offering to let her fill the kitchen, like paying off a wager. All she had to do was win and she could buy more casserole dishes so she could make extra meals and store them in the freeze box so she could just heat them up during her moondays.</p> <p>She took the skillet from him, swung, and threw it. Grim pleasure filled her when the skillet hit the hay bales before bouncing to the ground. It flew back to her, slowing and turning to present the handle to her hand.</p><p>More baking sheets so she wouldn\u2019t have to waste time waiting for one batch to bake and cool before she could prepare the next. More pie plates so she could make a fruit pie and a steak pie to serve at the same meal.</p><p>She threw the skillet and hit the hay bales.</p><p>A good set of kitchen knives. Utensils that were actually designed for different functions. More wooden spoons.</p><p>She swung and threw.</p><p>When the skillet came back again, she reached for it, her mind full of the useful things the kitchen still needed. But Lucivar just held on to the skillet. He gave her a lazy, arrogant smile, but the unhappiness in his eyes ripped at her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said, leading her back to the kitchen. \u201cYou won. Three out of three. As soon as you feel up to shopping, make your purchases.\u201d</p><p>Was that why he was so unhappy? Was he worried about the expense? Maybe she should ask him how much she could spend.</p><p>He released her arm, set the skillet on the counter, and started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cPrince?\u201d</p><p>He stopped at the archway and looked at her. \u201cYou do what you have to, Marian. If you have to scrub and polish this place when every move hurts you just to prove you can do your work, then that\u2019s what you\u2019ll do. Short of fighting you to a standstill, I can\u2019t stop you. But I can\u2019t stay here and watch you do it. We\u2019ll work with the skillet again in a few days\u2014and we\u2019ll keep working at it until you can use it as a weapon.\u201d</p><p>He moved fast. She had to dash to the archway to reach it before he reached the front door.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming back for the midday meal?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at her, didn\u2019t hesitate. He slammed the front door behind him.</p><p>Marian sank down on one of the kitchen chairs and braced her head in her hands. He got mad at her for sweeping up spilled sugar but dragged her outside to throw a skillet at bales of hay. She threw a pot at him and missed, so he was going to teach her how to clobber him with a skillet. Even taking into account that he was an Eyrien male, there was only one explanation for his behavior. The man was insane.</p><p>And she\u2019d made him unhappy. She hadn\u2019t meant to, but she\u2019d made him unhappy. Of course, she would have told him she\u2019d intended to take things easy today if he hadn\u2019t roared at her as soon as he walked into the kitchen, so it was sort of his own fault that he was unhappy now. Which didn\u2019t make her feel any better.</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears. Not only did she feel guilty for making him unhappy, but now that she was alone, her body was screaming at her and, Mother Night, she hurt.</p><p>Marian looked at the roast on the cutting board. It was almost too good to cut up for stew. She looked at the potatoes, carrots, and onions sitting on the counter next to the cutting board and sighed. No, the real reason she felt reluctant to start was that she hadn\u2019t considered how long it would take to cut up a roast into stew-size pieces when she had to use a knife. Using basic Craft, she could have done it in a minute. No help for it. If she didn\u2019t start now, she\u2019d be very late serving the midday meal.</p><p>As she reached for the knife, someone knocked sharply on the front door.</p><p>Her heart galloped as she stepped into the front room and stared at the door. Maybe it was that Roxie woman again. She hadn\u2019t told Lucivar about the young witch\u2019s second attempt to enter the eyrie when he wasn\u2019t home. She hadn\u2019t mentioned that Roxie had implied she was meeting him in Riada for an afternoon of sex. She hadn\u2019t believed the woman for a minute, but it had made her wonder about things she shouldn\u2019t wonder about\u2014like how he kissed . . . and what it would feel like to be in bed with him.</p><p>A second knock, sharper this time.</p><p>She could pretend no one was home\u2014or say she\u2019d been in the laundry room and hadn\u2019t heard the knocking if the person mentioned it to Lucivar. No, not the laundry room. That would upset him. She\u2019d say she\u2019d been in her room, resting. Besides, she didn\u2019t want to deal with anyone today.</p><p>The High Lord walked through the door, passing through the wood as if the Ebon-gray lock wasn\u2019t there. Of course, the High Lord wore a Black Jewel, so an Ebon-gray lock was little more than a moment\u2019s inconvenience to him.</p><p>He stopped as soon as he saw her. His nostrils flared slightly. His expression turned grim, almost menacing.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Saetan asked too softly.</p><p>Marian swallowed to get her heart out of her throat. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did my idiot of a son do?\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d slapped her, he couldn\u2019t have surprised her more. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Saetan moved toward her. \u201cHe upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. It wasn\u2019t . . .\u201d How was she supposed to think when he was staring at her like that?</p><p>He made a quiet sound of disgust and shook his head. The next moment, he was leading her back into the kitchen, the hand on her arm sliding up to rest on her shoulder.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say he pushed her into the chair, but she found herself sitting at the pine table without having decided she wanted to sit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d apologize for him, but there\u2019s really no excuse for upsetting a woman during her moontime,\u201d Saetan said as he removed his cape and laid it over the back of another chair. \u201cHis education in the Terreillean courts was abysmal at best, but he\u2019s been in Kaeleer three years now. He should have acquired some understanding from dealing with the coven. Idiot.\u201d</p><p>Marian\u2019s hands curled into fists as she watched him rinse out the teakettle, fill it with fresh water, and put it on the stove to heat.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Marian said.</p><p>\u201cHe upset you,\u201d Saetan replied in a tone of voice only a fool would challenge. \u201cHe probably walked in here this morning and started roaring, telling you what you could and couldn\u2019t do as if you were a simpleminded child instead of a grown woman who has enough sense to know when her body needs rest and care.\u201d</p><p>The High Lord was on her side. So why did she want to take the skillet that was still sitting on the counter and smack him over the head with it?</p><p>Finding the mugs in one of the upper cupboards, he filled one with hot water and slipped a tea ball into it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me what happened,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough experience with Lucivar to see it all. You have duties and responsibilities that you take seriously. You would have planned for this and wouldn\u2019t be doing more than you had to. But then he comes in, snapping and snarling, so what else can a witch do except defend herself and push back, insisting that she\u2019s capable of doing more than she knows she can?\u201d He brought the mug over to the table and placed it in front of her. \u201cHere, sweetheart. This is a brew I make for Jaenelle when her moontime is troubling her. Drink it up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reluctant to do anything that would please him after he\u2019d insulted Lucivar but not having enough nerve to defy him, she lifted the mug and sniffed.

It tasted even better.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making stew?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He washed his hands and began moving around her kitchen with a confidence that looked like he was used to being in kitchens. Which wasn\u2019t likely.</p> <p>\u201cHis social skills are rough, to put it kindly,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cHe just smashes through an obstacle instead of considering if there\u2019s a quieter way around it.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Lucivar\u2019s social skills were rough compared to a slick Hayllian, but that wasn\u2019t saying much. She\u2019d rather have rough and honest than slick any day.</p><p>\u201cHere, darling.\u201d Saetan returned to the table and placed a cutting board, the carrots, and a knife in front of her. \u201cDo you feel well enough to cut up the carrots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel fine.\u201d As he turned away from the table, she drank the rest of the brew and put the mug aside. She picked up the knife, then looked at the carrots. They were cleaned and the ends were neatly cut off. She didn\u2019t remember doing that, but she must have.</p><p>chop</p> <p>He moved around her kitchen, but she didn\u2019t dare look up to see what he was doing since he kept grumbling about Lucivar and she was afraid of what she might say if she actually looked at him right now.</p><p>chop chop chop</p><p>Who did he think he was, anyway? He had no right to come into Lucivar\u2019s home and criticize. She didn\u2019t care if he was Lucivar\u2019s father and the Steward of the Dark Court and the High Lord of Hell. He had no business criticizing Lucivar in public. Well, maybe not in public, since they were in the kitchen, but he shouldn\u2019t be saying these things to Prince Yaslana\u2019s housekeeper. It wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>chop chop</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t his business, was it? If she and Lucivar had clashed this morning, it had nothing to do with him. He didn\u2019t live here.</p><p>She heard a quiet sizzle, but it was gone so fast she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d really heard anything, so she kept her eyes focused on the cutting board.</p> <p>chop chop chop</p><p>So Lucivar was a little rough around the edges. So what? There wasn\u2019t an Eyrien male who wasn\u2019t. But he was kind, and if he got testy when he thought she was working too hard, wasn\u2019t that better than someone who expected her to work until she was exhausted and still didn\u2019t think she\u2019d done enough? If she hadn\u2019t snapped at him this morning, if she\u2019d kept a tighter hold on her own emotions and told him she was planning to rest today, they wouldn\u2019t have argued, and he wouldn\u2019t have left because she\u2019d made him unhappy.</p><p>chop chop</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the point. The point was his father had no right to be grumbling about his son, and if she were Lucivar\u2019s lover instead of his housekeeper, she\u2019d tell his father a thing or two. Oh, yes, she would.</p><p>Slick Hayllian. Bah!</p><p>\u201cFinished?\u201d</p><p>The amusement in his voice confused her enough that he slipped the knife out of her hand before she realized he\u2019d reached for it. He set another mug down in front of her and took the cutting board away.</p><p>She sniffed. There was a lingering scent of cooked meat in the air. She looked at the counter\u2014and frowned at the bowl of cut vegetables. She looked at the stove and saw the big kettle she used for soups and stews, the witchfire beneath it spread in a circle that was perfect for simmering whatever was in the kettle.</p> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d Saetan said as he settled his cape around his shoulders. \u201cLucivar is what he is. No social skills, or lack of them, can change a Warlord Prince\u2019s nature. If you want to punish him for snapping at you this morning, you go do the kind of heavy work that will most certainly cause you pain today. But if he matters enough to show him kindness, you\u2019ll let him make the biscuits to go with the stew and you\u2019ll tuck yourself in this afternoon and do something that won\u2019t make demands on your body. You\u2019ll let him fuss over you a little. If he doesn\u2019t have to fight you to protect you, it will make things easier for both of you.\u201d</p><p>She studied him. \u201cWhat you said about Lucivar. You didn\u2019t mean any of it, did you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s physical, demanding, and rough around the edges. In other words, he\u2019s Eyrien. I wouldn\u2019t want him to be any other way. But it was an effective way of keeping you distracted.\u201d</p><p>He brushed a hand over her hair, leaned over, and kissed her forehead. There was something so . . . fatherly . . . in the gesture, she felt tears sting her eyes.</p><p>After he left the eyrie, she sat at the table, sipping the brew he\u2019d made for her and thinking about what he\u2019d said.</p><p>Lucivar quietly closed the eyrie\u2019s front door, then stood still a moment, listening. No sounds. No indication of any kind of what he was walking into.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stay away. The worry that she\u2019d do something foolish because he\u2019d jumped on her that morning had gnawed at him. He knew witches tended to snap and snarl when they felt the most vulnerable. Hell\u2019s fire, he\u2019d slammed his will against Jaenelle\u2019s enough times over the past three years to figure out aggression pitted against vulnerability only caused hurt feelings on both sides. Asking for a favor always got better results than making demands. But when he saw Marian sweeping the floor that morning, his temper had snapped the leash. Now all he could do was hope he could repair whatever damage he\u2019d done.</p><p>He found her in the kitchen, her hands wrapped around a mug. She glanced up when she saw him, then looked down at the mug.</p><p>Feeling miserable and awkward, he leaned against the counter. \u201cI . . . ah . . . picked up some bread at the baker\u2019s.\u201d When she just nodded, he winced. Still pissed off at him. \u201cI also picked up this.\u201d He called in a box, set it on the table near her, then stepped back. When she opened it, her lower lip trembled.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. Being whipped didn\u2019t hurt this much. Chocolate fudge was the bribe when it came to being forgiven for doing something stupid and male. At least, it usually worked with Jaenelle and the coven. He knew Marian liked fudge because she\u2019d bought some from that same sweetshop in Riada, but she wasn\u2019t giving in enough to even taste it.</p><p>Looking around the kitchen, he spotted the kettle. \u201cYou made stew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, your father made the stew,\u201d Marian said. \u201cHe showed up a little while after you left.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar clenched his teeth. Well, wasn\u2019t that just fine and wonderful? If he\u2019d offered to help make the stew, she would have snapped at him. But his father could walk in here and make the damn thing without so much as a yip out of her. And, damn it, he was not going to be jealous of his own father.</p><p>Of course he was.</p><p>\u201cYou let him make the stew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t let him do anything,\u201d Marian said, sounding testy. \u201cOne minute he was criticizing you for getting me upset and the next he was making the stew. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s your father, he had no right to criticize you about what you do in your own home. And when he gave me the carrots to cut up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Lucivar raised a hand. \u201cHe gave you the carrots?\u201d</p><p>Marian bristled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? I\u2019m perfectly capable of cutting up a few carrots.\u201d</p><p>He held up both hands in a placating gesture. She did get feisty when she was riled. \u201cI didn\u2019t say there was anything wrong with it. It\u2019s just not the vegetable I would have given a woman who was holding a sharp knife and was pissed off at men.\u201d</p><p>When she gave him a blank look, he decided to move the conversation along before she figured out what he meant. \u201cSo you cut up the carrots and . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was so annoyed with him, I didn\u2019t pay attention to what he was doing, and the next thing I knew the meat was cooking and the rest of the vegetables were ready to go in when it was time.\u201d She frowned at the mug. \u201cAnd he made this brew for me.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar waited. \u201cSo what did he say about me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t mean any of it. He told me so after he made the stew.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t appreciate being criticized, but wasn\u2019t it interesting that it had annoyed her enough that she hadn\u2019t paid attention to what was going on in her own kitchen?</p><p>\u201cBut then he said . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucivar studied her. She looked so baffled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said if I wanted to be kind, I would let you make the biscuits . . . and let you fuss over me a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make biscuits.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou bought some bread.\u201d</p><p>Not sure how she\u2019d respond to him, he moved closer to her and ran a hand over her hair.</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cWhy did he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake the stew?\u201d He leaned over and kissed her forehead, hoping she\u2019d take it as a friendly gesture\u2014and wanting to kiss her in ways that had nothing to do with being friends. \u201cHe\u2019s a Warlord Prince. I guess he couldn\u2019t stand seeing you work when you were hurting.\u201d He eased back a little to look at her. Her eyes held a female awareness of a male that eased one kind of tension in him and created another. \u201cSo. Are you going to let me fuss a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been fussed over before.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThink of it as an adventure. It will be easier that way.\u201d And until someone, like Jaenelle, told Marian the rules about fussing, he was going to make the most of his hearth witch\u2019s ignorance.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>Marian crouched behind the shelves of dishes and glassware. How soon before the shop\u2019s proprietor remembered he had another customer and started wondering what she\u2019d been doing all this time?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t hiding, exactly. She just didn\u2019t want to deal with that Roxie woman. Thank the Darkness she\u2019d been examining some plates on the lower shelves when Roxie walked into the shop. There\u2019d been no mistaking that voice, and one quick look had convinced her she didn\u2019t want to meet Roxie when she couldn\u2019t slam a door in the woman\u2019s face. But having spent the past hour carefully making her selections, she was not leaving without her cookware, which was stacked on one end of the large wooden counter that ran across the back of the store.</p><p>She peeked over the top shelf, then ducked back down out of sight. Poor man. Roxie had been sneering at his merchandise since she walked in the door, proclaiming loudly that the aristo shops in Doun had much better fare. But that hadn\u2019t stopped her from plunking several items on the counter. And now . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean I can\u2019t put it on the account?\u201d Roxie\u2019s voice rose toward a screech. \u201cHe told me I could buy anything I wanted and put it on his account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d the proprietor replied, his voice condemning in its politeness, \u201cPrince Yaslana has not informed me of that fact.\u201d</p><p>Marian winced. She\u2019d bought a few things at the shops she usually patronized, but then it had occurred to her that all the merchants would owe a tithe to Lucivar, so she\u2019d taken one of the horse-drawn cabs over to this side of the village to spread her spending around a little. She\u2019d felt self-conscious about walking into a shop that so obviously catered to the aristo families in Riada. Only the fact that she was buying these things for Lucivar\u2019s home and Lucivar\u2019s table had kept her from walking right back out.</p><p>That and the books. The merchant\u2019s shop she usually went to had a small selection of books, and most of them were used\u2014and there\u2019d been nothing there that she hadn\u2019t already read since Jaenelle was very generous about loaning her books. But there\u2019d been so many to choose from in this shop, she\u2019d lost track of time as she browsed the shelves. If she\u2019d simply picked one that had interested her, she would have completed her purchases and been out of the shop before Roxie came in.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s hardly going to tell every merchant in the village that we\u2019re lovers,\u201d Roxie snapped. \u201cEspecially since we\u2019ve tried to be discreet about our liaison.\u201d</p><p>Marian swallowed wrong and almost choked, so she didn\u2019t hear the proprietor\u2019s response.</p><p>\u201cOh, very well,\u201d Roxie said. \u201cYou can open an account for me, and Lucivar will settle it with you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, Lady, but I cannot open an account for you on the expectation that Prince Yaslana will pay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, we\u2019re lovers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd it has been my experience that a man who is willing to share his bed may not necessarily be willing to share his purse. If you do not have the funds for the purchases, I can hold the items for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Roxie snapped. \u201cThe merchants in Doun wouldn\u2019t treat me this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest you do your shopping in Doun.\u201d</p><p>When she heard the door open, Marian rose from her crouch. But Roxie hadn\u2019t quite left the shop. For a long moment, their eyes met. Then something outside caught Roxie\u2019s attention, and she left the shop in a hurry.</p><p>Working to steady her nerves, Marian approached the counter.</p><p>\u201cHave you found everything you wanted?\u201d the proprietor asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Marian replied, trying not to stammer. She swallowed hard. \u201cPrince Yaslana instructed me to have the household purchases put on his account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He flicked a look at the door as someone entered the shop.</p><p>Why had she come to this part of the village? Why hadn\u2019t she kept to the shops where she felt she belonged? Why\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle was suddenly beside her, looking at the cookware with a gleam in her eyes that was downright scary.</p><p>\u201cLady Angelline,\u201d Marian said.</p><p>Jaenelle smiled. \u201cYou finally informed Lucivar that he wasn\u2019t getting another dinner until you had the proper tools to cook with, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Marian muttered.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lady Marian?\u201d the proprietor asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Maybe she shouldn\u2019t be surprised that he\u2019d heard her name. After all, she and Lucivar were the only Eyriens living near Riada.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you have everything?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure. I thought about\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Jaenelle was already heading toward the part of the shop that held household goods, and remembering their last shopping trip, Marian rushed after her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need the large cheese grater,\u201d Marian said a few minutes later, trying to keep her voice from edging toward desperation. It wasn\u2019t a question of taste, as it had been when they\u2019d shopped for Lucivar\u2019s furniture, it was Jaenelle\u2019s unflagging idea that if Marian needed one of something for the kitchen, two would be better.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cYou only have the little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe smaller one is all I need. Really.\u201d She took the cheese grater out of Jaenelle\u2019s hands and put it back on the shelf.</p><p>Since she couldn\u2019t hold Jaenelle back, she tried to steer the direction of that energy and enthusiasm, so it wasn\u2019t really her fault that they ended up buying a set of dishes . . . and glasses . . . and silverware . . . and a corner shelf for what use she didn\u2019t know except Jaenelle thought it would look nice in the kitchen.</p><p>Numbed by the sheer quantity of purchases, she watched the proprietor tally up the cost and wondered how many years of tithes had just been eliminated.</p><p>Then the proprietor turned to the smaller stack of items on the counter.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Marian said. \u201cThose don\u2019t go on Prince Yaslana\u2019s account. Those are my purchases.\u201d</p><p>As he tallied up her purchases, she called in the wallet she\u2019d bought on her last shopping trip. Most of her wages were tucked in the back of the dresser drawer that held her underthings. The wallet held the funds she allowed herself to spend freely. She opened it and riffled the copper marks just as the proprietor finished his tally.</p><p>Heat flooded her face. Not enough. She hadn\u2019t come to the village to shop for herself and hadn\u2019t checked to see how much was in her wallet before she left the eyrie. And she hadn\u2019t expected to find that wonderful, soft wool material that she wanted to make into a robe for Lucivar as a Winsol gift. She could still afford the material, but . . .</p><p>After a wistful look at the two books she\u2019d selected, she cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t bring enough with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the Lady would like to open an account?\u201d the proprietor asked.</p><p>She just stared at him. Why would he give a housekeeper an account when he wouldn\u2019t open one for Roxie, who came from an aristo family?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s practical,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>That settled it\u2014at least as far as Jaenelle and the proprietor were concerned.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Marian said, after she reviewed the neatly written list and had initialed the paper next to the last item.</p><p>\u201cIt is my pleasure, Lady,\u201d the proprietor replied.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cAre you going home to play with your new toys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not toys, they\u2019re tools,\u201d Marian replied as she vanished the material and books. Before she could deal with the rest of the purchases, they vanished.</p><p>Jaenelle smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019ll come back with you. Then you can tell me what all of those things do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed in the kitchen at the Hall, so I don\u2019t see most of the things you bought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how to cook? Not at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jaenelle said sadly.</p><p>Marian couldn\u2019t believe it. Lucivar could put together an acceptable meal, and he\u2019d mentioned a few times that his father was quite a good cook when the High Lord felt inclined. Why hadn\u2019t either of them taught Jaenelle how to put together a simple meal?</p><p>\u201cI can teach you,\u201d Marian said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have to start with something very simple.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle beamed. \u201cSimple is good.\u201d</p><p>The proprietor looked amused.</p><p>As she and Jaenelle walked out of the shop, Marian wondered how long it would take for the rest of the village to hear that Prince Yaslana\u2019s housekeeper was giving the Queen of Ebon Askavi a cooking lesson.</p><p>Since he\u2019d been greeted by grinning merchants when he stopped in Riada on his way home, Lucivar expected to find Marian in the kitchen playing with her new toys. The counter was stacked with things, but his little hearth witch was just sitting at the table, frowning at two bowls filled with eggs. After studying the bottle on the table and considering the glazed look in her eyes, he doubted the two fingers of brandy in the glass near her hand was the first drink she\u2019d poured.</p><p>Figuring he wasn\u2019t going to see dinner anytime soon, he pointed at the eggs. \u201cAre those cooked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Marian said.</p><p>He took one from the nearest bowl and peeled off the shell. Just as he punched his thumb into the center to break the egg in half, Marian said, \u201cNo! Not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Raw yolk fountained up and flowed over his hands.</p><p>Lucivar looked at Marian. Marian looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou let my sister play in the kitchen, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Which explained why his little hearth witch had indulged in several glasses of brandy.</p><p>Marian stared at the egg dripping off his hands. \u201cShe\u2019s the Queen of Ebon Askavi. She\u2019s the most powerful witch in Kaeleer. And she can\u2019t boil an egg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t let her play in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Marian shook her head. \u201cHow can she not be able to boil an egg? You don\u2019t even need Craft for it. All she did was put the eggs in the water.\u201d She blew out a breath. \u201cHow can you end up with eggs that have the whites fully cooked and the yolks still raw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. My father thinks it\u2019s because she\u2019s so powerful that some things don\u2019t react as expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d explained something wrong,\u201d Marian said. \u201cSo after she left, I cooked the rest of the eggs. They\u2019re perfect.\u201d She wobbled in her chair. \u201cJaenelle felt so bad when she left.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour offer to teach her was a kind gesture,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cBut, Marian? This is a witch who, when she was sixteen, blew up the kitchen at the Hall because she confused the spell she was putting together with the casserole she and her friend Karla were making and put the wrong mixture in the oven. Think about that for a minute. Casserole. Spell. They couldn\u2019t tell the difference by looking at what was in the dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe blew up the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestroyed it. Right down to the last wooden spoon.\u201d</p><p>Marian shuddered.</p> <p>\u201cSo the next time you want to do something kind for Jaenelle, make her a casserole or bake some nutcakes. But don\u2019t let her play in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Putting a shield around his hands so he wouldn\u2019t drip yolk, Lucivar walked over to the sink and used Craft to turn on the water taps. As he washed his hands, he said, \u201cDo I dare ask what\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Marian hiccuped. \u201cEggs.\u201d</p><p>He turned off the water and sighed. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>SIXTEEN</p> <p>\u201cI have work,\u201d Marian said as Lucivar hauled her out of the kitchen and into the eyrie\u2019s front room. Tassle followed them, making worried little huffy sounds.</p><p>\u201cThe work will still be there an hour from now,\u201d Lucivar replied.</p><p>She looked at the thick drops of rain hitting the glass doors that led to the lawn beyond. If it got any colder, that rain would turn to snow. \u201cYou\u2019re just doing this because you\u2019re bored.\u201d</p><p>Using Craft, Lucivar moved the furniture against the walls, leaving a large bare circle of stone floor. \u201cIf I was bored, I\u2019d go to the Hall and annoy my father. That perks up both our days.\u201d</p><p>Bet it doesn\u2019t perk them up in the same way, Marian thought. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhining about it won\u2019t do you any good.\u201d</p> <p>Whining? She bristled at the insult. She wasn\u2019t whining. She was pointing out the obvious to a thickheaded male. Females did not use Eyrien weapons. Ask any Eyrien male\u2014except the one standing in front of her\u2014and he\u2019d tell you that.</p><p>Since being reasonable wasn\u2019t going to work, she lowered her voice and tried menacing. \u201cI\u2019ve got a skillet, and I know how to use it.\u201d</p><p>His quick grin wasn\u2019t the reaction she\u2019d hoped for.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, turning. \u201cNow you\u2019re going to acquire skill with a traditional weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>He spun back toward her, and shouted, \u201cIf you get hurt because you\u2019re too damn stubborn to learn how to defend yourself, I will beat the shit out of you!\u201d</p><p>Goaded by the unexpected verbal shove, she shoved back. \u201cIf you ever raise a hand to me, I will gut you!\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. She had that one moment for fear to zing through her as she realized she\u2019d just threatened a Warlord Prince. Before she could move, his hands clamped on her waist. One quick toss in the air. As she came down, he wrapped his arms around her lower back and buttocks and spun her around and around.</p> <p>\u201cHa! I knew you had it in you!\u201d He laughed as he spun her.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Marian grabbed his shoulders. \u201cLucivar, stop!\u201d</p><p>He stopped. Since the room was still circling, she clung to his shoulders. Her feet didn\u2019t touch the floor, which put them eye to eye. With her heart pounding, she dared to look at him, hoping he wasn\u2019t too angry with her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look angry at all. His eyes were lit with amusement, and he grinned at her as if she\u2019d just done something wonderful.</p><p>Giving her a friendly squeeze, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s my feisty hearth witch. Now give us a snarl. Say Grrrr.\u201d</p><p>Heat flooded her face. She pushed at his shoulders, wanting to get down, wanting to get away. He just tightened his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting you down until I get a snarl,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked away, mortified\u2014and saw Tassle standing to one side, watching them. The wolf curled his lips, revealing an impressive set of teeth. After a moment, the lips relaxed. He waved the tip of his tail, then did the whole thing all over again.</p><p>She lowered her head, let her hair fall forward to hide her face. Great. Wonderful. A wolf was coaching her in how to snarl, and the man holding her off the ground . . .</p><p>She peeked at him. His grin had changed to that lazy, arrogant smile.</p><p>... would hold her like this all day if that\u2019s how long it took to get what he wanted.</p><p>She took a breath. Blew it out.</p><p>As soon as she was free, she was going to hide in her room. He could fix his own meals, wash his own dishes. They\u2019d just see how long he grinned about that.</p><p>She took another breath. Blew it out.</p><p>The way she was pressed against him, there was no mistaking his body\u2019s response to hers. And there were all those warm, lovely muscles under her hands, just waiting to be touched, caressed . . .</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful.</p><p>Before she could do something stupid, she took another breath, raised her head, and said, \u201cgr.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar\u2019s arrogant smile faded. His brows drew together in a frown. \u201cWhat a prissy little gr. But it will have to do.\u201d Sighing, he loosened his arms, letting her slide down his body until her feet touched the floor.</p><p>As soon as he released her, the rational part of her mind scampered off, leaving her with less sense than a rabbit. So she bolted.</p><p>Grab . . . lift . . . swing . . . plop. And she was right back where she\u2019d started.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to learn to defend yourself, Marian,\u201d Lucivar said, an unyielding look in his gold eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like it, but you\u2019re going to learn.\u201d</p><p>When he called in the Eyrien sticks, Marian sagged with relief. At least these were the sparring sticks and not the bladed sticks used for fighting. Even so, an opponent could take a terrible beating. Her father had done it enough times to young warriors he brought to her mother\u2019s eyrie. He\u2019d insist on a sparring session, with his daughters in attendance, so the young warrior could \u201cshow off his skills.\u201d Even a skilled youth couldn\u2019t match a full-grown Eyrien male who had been trained to fight.</p><p>And an unskilled hearth witch was no match for an Eyrien Warlord Prince.</p><p>She tightened her grip on the stick and set her feet in the stance she\u2019d seen her father take.</p><p>Lucivar just looked at her feet. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She tensed, wondering where his first blow would hit. \u201cThis is the stance for sparring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want to be knocked on your ass.\u201d</p><p>She lowered the stick. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou set your feet like that, you\u2019re going to eat dirt unless your opponent is smaller than you are.\u201d</p><p>So that explained why she\u2019d never seen her father spar with anyone but half-trained youths. The fighting skills her father bragged about were nothing more than brags, just words without substance to justify what he did, and didn\u2019t do, for his family.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought about living with a man, hadn\u2019t really wanted to. That had never been part of her dream. Now she wondered what it would be like to live that dream with a man who wasn\u2019t like her father. With Lucivar.</p><p>\u201cMarian?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and realized she had no idea how long he\u2019d been standing there, waiting, while her thoughts had wandered. \u201cAre we going to spar?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to it eventually. First you have to learn how to move.\u201d</p><p>Slow. Quiet. As graceful as a dance. He took her through each move, his voice flowing over her as he explained, corrected, praised. The warmth of his hand on her waist or hip as he guided her body. The movement of his own muscles as he demonstrated the next move. The clean male scent of him.</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019ll put all the moves together,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cWatch.\u201d</p><p>She watched. Grace and power. What would it be like to kiss him? Really kiss him? Would he bring all that grace and power to the bed? Would he be a generous lover? She\u2019d only had one experience with sex after her Virgin Night, and that had been disappointing enough that she\u2019d never been interested in trying again. But when a woman loved, wouldn\u2019t there be some pleasure from the act even if the body received none?</p><p>The thought staggered her, thrilled her, terrified her. Had she been falling in love with him all along? That would be foolish, wouldn\u2019t it? He might take a hearth witch for a lover to satisfy his body\u2019s needs, but he\u2019d never give his heart to one. Would he?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough for the day.\u201d</p><p>She tripped over the sound of his voice, struggled to regain her balance. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d He tugged the stick out of her hands. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where your mind wandered off to, but you weren\u2019t paying attention.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d been paying attention, but she\u2019d been focused on the man and not the lesson.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s close to midday, and the weather has cleared.\u201d Lucivar smiled at her. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we fly down to the village? I\u2019ll buy you a meal.\u201d</p><p>Pain lanced her heart, fierce and deep. She shook her head and backed away from him. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can.\u201d He sighed. \u201cMarian, eating a meal you didn\u2019t cook isn\u2019t neglecting your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He\u2019d mentioned once or twice that he\u2019d never seen her fly, but she\u2019d been able to avoid giving him a reason. Now . . .</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t fly! My wings . . . they were damaged. They\u2019re useless.\u201d</p><p>Grief and understanding filled his eyes. Here was someone who understood what that loss meant to her.</p><p>Then his eyes chilled. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d he asked too softly.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>Uneasy now, she wiped the tears off her face. She could almost see the temper beginning to burn in him, could almost see it rising from spike to spike until it would reach the explosion point.</p><p>\u201cJaenelle brought you to Kaeleer,\u201d Lucivar said, studying her. \u201cShe would have done the healing. If she told you you\u2019d never fly again, you\u2019d have to accept it. But she didn\u2019t, did she? So who told you, Marian?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, not sure if there was any safe ground to stand on.</p> <p>Lucivar bared his teeth. \u201cLuthvian. She\u2019s the one who told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Angelline doesn\u2019t have experience with Eyrien\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn her worst day, Jaenelle is a better Healer than Luthvian can ever hope to be.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou think your wings were damaged? When I came to Kaeleer, mine were so broken, so destroyed by slime mold there was barely enough healthy tissue left to work with. Luthvian wanted to remove them. Jaenelle rebuilt them, healed them. So don\u2019t tell me she doesn\u2019t have experience.\u201d</p><p>Marian\u2019s legs trembled. She could have flown? All these months when she\u2019d been afraid to try, she could have soared over Ebon Rih?</p><p>Swearing viciously, Lucivar circled the room as if he couldn\u2019t stand still a moment longer. Finally, he stopped in front of her. The hand he held out curled into a fist.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let them win, Marian. Don\u2019t let them make you less than you are. Don\u2019t let them take away what means the most to you. Not the family who dismissed your strength and your skills, not the bastards who hurt you\u2014yes, I know about them\u2014and not Luthvian. Don\u2019t let them win. Fight for what you want with everything that\u2019s in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Marian cried. \u201cI\u2019m just a hearth witch and you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a slave!\u201d Lucivar shouted. \u201cA half-breed bastard sold to one court after another, wearing that filthy Ring of Obedience to keep me submissive. But I wouldn\u2019t submit, I wouldn\u2019t break, and I fought back with every breath I took. I refused to be less than a Warlord Prince, and I made them deal with me on my terms. No matter how much pain they inflicted, I gave it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like that. I can\u2019t fight like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever tried?\u201d He raked a hand through his hair. \u201cIf you give up your wings, what else will you give up because someone tells you you\u2019re just a hearth witch?\u201d</p><p>Something broke inside her\u2014broke and reformed in a different pattern. She teetered on the edge of a cliff. She could step back to familiar ground or she could leap\u2014and possibly soar.</p> <p>He\u2019d been pushing her toward that edge. She saw that now. Every time he challenged and she pushed back, he never undermined the sense that she had held her own. She didn\u2019t usually win\u2014his idea of compromise was laughable\u2014but she didn\u2019t actually lose, either.</p><p>He wanted her to win. And he\u2019d throw everything he was behind her to help her do it.</p><p>She swallowed tears and gathered her courage. \u201cCould you help me learn how to fly again?\u201d</p><p>He approached her slowly. No smile. No light words. He reached out and stroked her hair, watching her. He kissed her forehead, something he\u2019d done frequently since the day she threw the pot at him. Then he kissed her mouth. A restrained kiss that made no demands\u2014and left her wishing he would make a few.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you fly again,\u201d he said as he stepped back. \u201cGet your cape. We\u2019ll still go down to the village for a meal.\u201d</p><p>Wondering how soon they could start working to restore her flying skills, she hurried to obey. As she reached the steps that led to the rest of the eyrie, he said, \u201cMarian?\u201d</p><p>She turned.</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cLearning how to fly again isn\u2019t going to get you out of learning the sticks. Just so we\u2019re clear on that.\u201d</p> <p>Hell\u2019s fire, she thought as she hurried to her room to brush her hair and get her cape. She hadn\u2019t thought about doing both. The time it would take out of her daily schedule . . . But he\u2019d already locked the gate on any argument she could make.</p><p>Somehow that didn\u2019t annoy her as much as it should have.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>Marian paused at the side door of the eyrie and looked at the dark, heavy clouds coming over the mountains. No gentle snowfall this time, but a mean storm that would bury Ebon Rih for days. Hopefully, Lucivar would get home before it hit.</p><p>*Tassle?* she called on a psychic thread.</p><p>*I am returning to the den,* Tassle replied.</p><p>Good. A kindred wolf would know how to find shelter if he was caught out in a storm, but she\u2019d feel easier having him at the eyrie.</p><p>Hurrying into the mud room, she shook the snow off her heavy cape before hanging it on the pegs to dry. She traded her boots for soft house shoes, then went into the kitchen to put away the food she\u2019d bought to last them through the storm.</p><p>As she unpacked her cloth market bags, she kept glancing out the window. The snow was already coming down fast. A hard gust of wind turned the world white and blind for a moment. Then she caught a glimpse of Tassle at the far end of her garden and breathed a sigh of relief. One of her males was home and safe. Now if the other one . . .</p><p>For the past few days, ever since they\u2019d returned from celebrating Winsol at his father\u2019s house, Lucivar had been on edge. He denied there was anything wrong, but the looks he\u2019d given her were close to hostile. Something was putting his back up, and she suspected it had to do with her.</p><p>Spending Winsol, the winter holiday that was a celebration of the Darkness, at the Hall had been fun and dazzling. She\u2019d felt disappointed that Andulvar and Prothvar Yaslana hadn\u2019t been there, since she\u2019d been hoping to meet them, but meeting the coven almost made up for that. There had been long walks and snowball fights, afternoons when the women had gathered to talk and laugh. During one of those afternoons, it had suddenly occurred to her that the women who were including her as if she were one of them were the Queens who ruled their respective Territories. But they didn\u2019t seem to notice that she was just a hearth witch, just a housekeeper. And the looks on their faces the day she\u2019d told them she\u2019d spent the morning with Mrs. Beale, helping prepare the midday meal . . .</p><p>No one, she was told, was allowed in Mrs. Beale\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>It was probably for the best that she hadn\u2019t mentioned trading recipes with the woman who ruled the Hall\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>Then there was Lucivar. Seeing him with his family, the coven, and the boyos had been a revelation. Demanding and yielding, stubborn and considerate, arguing with one of them and defending that person in the next breath. He\u2019d insisted on morning workouts, which hadn\u2019t pleased her until she discovered the whole coven showed up without grumbling. Watching them move through the warmups, watching them spar with him and each other, she realized how serious he was about witches being comfortable using weapons in order to defend themselves. And watching him spar with Jaenelle . . . Her heart had been in her throat the whole time she watched that violent dance.</p><p>But the biggest difference was the way he\u2019d responded to her. Ever since the day when he\u2019d promised to help her learn to fly again, he\u2019d been touching her, giving her easy, friendly kisses. The kisses he\u2019d given her at the Hall made her wonder, made her hungry. They were the kisses of a man who wanted. Except he hadn\u2019t asked if he could come to her bed, hadn\u2019t invited her to come to his. So she wasn\u2019t sure what those kisses meant, but she wondered what it would be like to be with him.</p><p>And she shouldn\u2019t wonder. She was his housekeeper. It would be too easy to forget that if she responded to him as a woman.</p><p>Had he wanted her to invite him? Was that why he was so testy now?</p><p>Marian looked out the kitchen window. The snow was falling so fast now, she couldn\u2019t see anything.</p><p>Where was he?</p><p>Lucivar stood on a mountain ledge on the other side of Ebon Rih, watching the storm come over the mountains. It matched his mood, matched a temper already primed to explode.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire! Why had Luthvian wanted to ride out the storm in his home? She had plenty of food, and with warming spells on the pipes that ran from the house to the well, she\u2019d wouldn\u2019t be without water. And hadn\u2019t he filled every damn woodbox in her house? Using Craft, she could call in more wood from the woodpile without going outside. So why did she suddenly want to spend time with him?</p><p>Not that he would have her. Not today. Just the smell of her, and the lingering scent of her female students, had been enough to make him want to smash furniture, shatter bone. And the males in the villages . . .</p><p>The sight of them had been enough to bring him a heartbeat away from the killing edge. They hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, had, in fact, done everything they could to prepare the villages in Ebon Rih to ride out the storm. But he\u2019d wanted to hurt them, had felt something close to blind hatred for all of them.</p><p>His father was at the Keep. He could sense that dark power. So tempting to go to Ebon Askavi and test his precarious control against that darker strength.</p><p>What in the name of Hell was wrong with him? He wanted to get home before the storm really broke. Wanted to get back to his eyrie, back to . . .</p><p>Marian.</p><p>Fury avalanched through him. Changed into something violent, hot, and impossible to resist.</p><p>Marian.</p><p>He knew what this was now. It had never hit him quite this way before, but he recognized it now.</p><p>Rut. That time when a Warlord Prince\u2019s sex drive overwhelmed everything else. Every male was a rival to be eliminated. Every female but the one he\u2019d chosen scraped a temper turned wild and unpredictable.</p><p>Sex or violence. The rut worked itself out one way or the other. Sometimes both. He\u2019d gone into rut several times since coming to Kaeleer and had had no desire to slake that drive in a woman\u2019s body. He\u2019d depended on Jaenelle\u2019s presence to keep him chained. She had soothed his need to be close to a female and had channeled the violence into grueling physical activity that he\u2019d thrown himself into with vicious willingness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Jaenelle was at her house in Scelt for a few weeks, and the woman he wanted, the woman who made his blood burn and sing . . .</p><p>He had to get Marian out of the eyrie, had to get her away from him before the storm closed in and made it too dangerous to travel, even on the Winds. Because if she was still in the eyrie when the storm inside him broke, if they were trapped together for several days . . . If that happened, may the Darkness be merciful . . . because there would be no mercy in him.</p><p>Giving an Eyrien war cry that was filled with fury and desperation, Lucivar launched himself into the face of the storm.</p><p>As Marian pulled the roast out of the oven and set the pan on top of the stove, the front door slammed.</p> <p>\u201cYou made it,\u201d she said as she hurried into the eyrie\u2019s front room. When she saw him, she took a step back. His teeth were bared, and he stared at her with glazed, wild eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cLucivar . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d He ripped off his short wool cape and threw it aside.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off his bare, slick skin. It was freezing out there. Why was he so hot? And why wasn\u2019t he wearing a shirt or vest under the cape?</p> <p>The vicious snarl that erupted from him made her press her back against the wall.</p><p>\u201cI want you out of here. Go to Riada and stay with Merry. Go to the Keep. Go anywhere, but go. Now.\u201d</p><p>Fear shivered through her. She knew what this was. Survival demanded that every witch learn to recognize the rut. Warlord Princes were always violently passionate and passionately violent, but the rut drove them to a savagery that bordered insanity. Other males were nothing more than rivals to destroy. And women . . .</p><p>Her mother had once said that a Warlord Prince in rut had enough sexual hunger that he could service an entire coven twice over and still want more. The problem was, he focused on one female and wouldn\u2019t tolerate the presence of any other. His choice became the vessel for all that drive, all that need.</p><p>She\u2019d heard stories about Warlord Princes. She knew what could happen to the woman under him when he was in rut. Tongues partially bitten off. Nipples bitten off. Bones broken or shattered. Any male who tried to stop him would be killed, and he would turn away from the slaughter to mount the female again, oblivious to the carnage around him until the rut finally wore off.</p><p>\u201cMarian.\u201d</p> <p>Lucivar wore Ebon-gray Jewels. If she stayed, she could be maimed, even killed. But if she didn\u2019t stay, what would he do? Trapped here by the blizzard, driven by the violence inside him, he could hurt himself.</p><p>\u201cMarian.\u201d</p><p>She was young, healthy, stronger than she\u2019d ever been. And she was in love with him. She\u2019d fallen in love with a man who challenged the world to take him on, sometimes with laughing, boyish enthusiasm and other times as a warrior born and trained to kill.</p><p>She could do this for him. Would do this for him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her voice quivered with fear, but her heart didn\u2019t waver. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGET OUT!\u201d Lucivar screamed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d As she stepped away from the wall, she thought of the basic rules of survival. Move slowly because fast moves excite the predator instinct, and he\u2019ll be on you without thought, without mercy. Stay passive. Don\u2019t refuse him. Don\u2019t offer resistance to anything he wants to do to you.</p><p>Lucivar snarled, his glazed eyes watching her.</p> <p>Vanishing her undershirt, Marian slowly unbuttoned her tunic and pulled it open just enough to display her breasts.</p><p>His breathing became ragged. His hands curled into fists.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He was on her so fast, there wasn\u2019t even time to draw breath. One hand fisted in her long hair, pulling her head back, exposing her throat. The other hand pressed her against the cock straining to be free of the leather trousers.</p><p>\u201cYou should have run,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>He lowered his head. His teeth closed on the spot where her neck joined her shoulder\u2014not hard enough to hurt, but hard enough to make her heart pound.</p><p>When she remained passive, he shifted suddenly, his teeth closing on her neck. He licked, explored, until her pulse throbbed against the tip of his tongue.</p><p>Moving slowly, she raised her hands and rested them on his waist. His teeth tightened in warning, then he shifted again, capturing her earlobe.</p><p>Quiet. Passive. The only way to survive. But she couldn\u2019t stop her hands from stroking his hot skin, couldn\u2019t slow her pounding heart when every breath rubbed her breasts against his chest, teasing, arousing.</p><p>\u201cGive me your mouth.\u201d His voice sounded rough, barely human.</p><p>She hesitated, then parted her lips. Those wild, glazed eyes stared at her too long before his mouth covered hers.</p><p>She was prepared for teeth and pain. Instead, he gave her a long, lazy kiss, his tongue playing with hers. Her hands slid up his back, curled around his shoulders, pressing her tighter against him. The fist that gripped her hair relaxed, opening to cradle her head. And still he kissed her as if there was nothing more to want, nothing more to need.</p><p>Then he broke the kiss, yanked her off her feet, and carried her into his bedroom.</p><p>He vanished her clothes as he laid her on the bed, then grabbed her hands and pinned them on either side of her head. When he let go, phantom restraints kept her hands locked in position. He spread her legs, using more phantom restraints to keep her open for his pleasure, then lifted her enough so that she could tuck her wings tight to her body.</p><p>He vanished his clothes and stretched out beside her.</p><p>She expected him to mount her and take his release, fast and hard. Instead, he started with her arms and licked, nibbled, caressed. He suckled one breast while his thumb stroked the nipple of the other. Finally he moved lower, his mouth brushing the hair between her legs, his fingers delicately stroking, slick with her readiness. He moved lower, licking the skin on her inner thighs, nibbling on her calves, his hands always moving.</p><p>Finally, he sheathed himself inside her in one slow stroke. His hips pressed down on hers, denying her any movement while he braced himself on his elbows and went back to suckling her breasts, flexing his hips just enough to keep her on the edge but not enough for release. He held her on that edge for a lifetime while he licked, suckled, demanded kisses.</p><p>If she could have gotten her hands free of the phantom restraints, she would have strangled him.</p><p>Desperate to respond in some way to this tormenting pleasure, she settled for the only thing she could reach. She raised her head, clamped her teeth on his upper arm and bit down.</p><p>His snarl mixed pain and fury. He clamped a hand around her throat.</p><p>\u201cGet your teeth out of my arm.\u201d</p><p>Even knowing she was pushing him toward violence, she paused to lick his skin before she let go.</p><p>His glazed eyes studied her as his hand relaxed around her throat. \u201cYou do get feisty when you\u2019re riled.\u201d His mouth hovered over hers. Hesitated. Withdrew. \u201cDon\u2019t bite me again until you\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>He moved then. Deep, strong thrusts that sent her soaring, sent her over the edge. Before she could glide down all the way, he drove her up again.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, witchling,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou haven\u2019t flown high enough yet.\u201d</p><p>Driving her up and up until her world narrowed to the feel of his cock inside her. When he thrust her over the edge this time, her teeth found his arm again, muffling her scream as she climaxed.</p><p>This time he laughed, a sound ripe with dark pleasure, as he set his teeth into her shoulder and followed her.</p><p>Shivering, Marian eased into the kitchen, wishing she could have put her winter robe on over the flannel nightgown. But the only time Lucivar had turned violent was when she\u2019d offered to get them some food. He\u2019d agreed to that\u2014until she\u2019d put some clothes on. He attacked without warning, ripping the clothes off her before flinging her back on the bed and pinning her down. When she didn\u2019t struggle, his temper shifted back to that raging sexual hunger, and he spent the next hour playing with her and feasting on her arousal and climaxes until they were both wrung dry and exhausted. Since then, he hadn\u2019t allowed her out of the bedroom any farther than the adjoining bathroom.</p><p>The only thing she could figure out was the clothing signaled an attempt to leave him. Coming to the kitchen now might provoke another attack, even though a nightgown was hardly sufficient clothing if she tried to leave the eyrie in this storm, but he\u2019d been gone so long, she\u2019d become worried about him.</p><p>Apparently, she\u2019d worried for nothing. He was standing at the stove, tending the skillets filled with food, looking much the way he did on other mornings when he insisted on cooking breakfast\u2014if she discounted the fact that he was naked, half-aroused, and didn\u2019t seem to notice the warming spells had faded to the point where the eyrie was chilly, almost cold.</p><p>Lucivar had put the warming spells on the eyrie the morning the storm started and told her they would last two days before he\u2019d have to replenish the power in the spells. Which meant they were starting the third day of the rut. Maybe it was over, or at least easing. Should she mention the warming spells? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shifted from one foot to the other as the cold seeping up from the stone floor bit into her bare feet.</p><p>Lucivar gave her a slashing look before turning his attention back to the food. \u201cGo back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2014\u201d</p><p>He charged. She stumbled back and hit the wall. His hands slapped the stone on either side of her head.</p> <p>She stared into those wild, glazed eyes. No, the rut hadn\u2019t eased.</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat,\u201d he snarled. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you food.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cI could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere! There\u2019s a damn blizzard out there. Nothing is going anywhere until it blows out. And the only thing you\u2019re doing is getting back into bed.\u201d He pushed away from the wall and went back to the stove. \u201cGet out of here before I take you where you stand.\u201d</p><p>She recognized a threat when she heard one, so she slipped out of the kitchen while he watched her with eyes that held more cold fury than hot lust. She kept her movements slow until she was on the other side of the wall, out of his sight. Then she ran back to the bedroom.</p> <p>The fires in the other rooms had burned out, but Lucivar had fed the one in the bedroom. A small table and two chairs were set before the hearth. They usually sat under one of the bedroom windows. He had moved them before going into the kitchen. Had she, on some level, taken that gesture to mean a return of the man she knew? An error on her part. Maybe he had some lucid moments, but the rut was still driving Lucivar\u2014and she couldn\u2019t even guess what he would do when he returned to the bedroom.</p><p>Chilled inside and out, Marian sat in a chair close to the fire. That helped warm her, but her feet were freezing. Before she could decide if wrapping herself in a blanket would provoke a violent response, he was back in the bedroom, setting two plates of food on the table.</p><p>The look in his eyes . . . Any man facing him on a battlefield would look at those eyes and see death. All she could do was hope she would survive whatever mood was riding him now.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d he said, sitting down in the other chair.</p><p>Silverware and two mugs of coffee appeared on the table.</p><p>Steak, scrambled eggs, and thick pieces of toasted bread spread with butter and some of the berry jam she\u2019d made.</p> <p>He made no move to begin his own meal. Just watched her.</p><p>Eat, he\u2019d said. The first bite of meat stuck in her throat, but she sensed something in him relax as she accepted the food he\u2019d provided. When she tried the toast, his attention turned to his own meal.</p><p>Despite the fire and the hot food, she was still so chilled, she didn\u2019t hesitate to scramble back into bed when Lucivar told her to. But even with the covers tucked around her, she couldn\u2019t warm up, and she waited impatiently for him to get back from whatever cleanup he was doing in the kitchen.</p><p>The moment he slipped into bed, she felt that wonderful heat that pumped out of him and didn\u2019t hesitate to snuggle up against him. So warm. So wonderfully warm and\u2014</p><p>The sound he made fell between a scream and a roar as he lifted straight up out of bed, flinging the covers every which way. The next moment, he was standing beside the bed, his Eyrien war blade in his hand, his eyes scanning the room.</p><p>Marian scrambled to the head of the bed and crouched there, her heart pounding. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over here,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cThere\u2019s something in the room. Something in the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething touched me,\u201d he snapped. \u201cSomething icy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feet.\u201d Her teeth started to chatter. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was from fear or cold.</p><p>His eyes stopped scanning the room. His head turned slowly until he looked at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feet are cold and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour feet? That was your feet?\u201d He swore with obscene creativity as he vanished the war blade, plopped her back down on the bed, pulled up the covers, and got in with her. He sucked in a breath and let it out in a hiss as he wrapped himself around her and pressed her feet against his legs. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing socks?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to tell him she\u2019d been afraid of provoking his temper, so she said the first thing that came to mind. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem romantic.\u201d</p><p>He propped himself up on one elbow and looked down at her in disbelief. \u201cYou think wearing socks isn\u2019t romantic, but putting a block of ice against a man\u2019s balls is romantic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t close to your balls,\u201d she muttered. Although, if he hadn\u2019t screamed and leaped out of bed like that, she would have tried to tuck her feet a little higher up. After all, his thighs were a lot warmer than his shins.</p><p>Muttering dark things about female logic, he settled down. In a couple of minutes, she was sleepy and toasty warm, even her feet.</p><p>\u201cLucivar?\u201d she said softly.</p><p>No response except to try to pull her a little closer.</p><p>\u201cLucivar?\u201d</p><p>The arm around her grew heavy. His breathing was slow and even.</p><p>For the first time since the rut began, Lucivar was sound asleep.</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>Encouraged by the heat coming from the stone walls, indicating the warming spells had been renewed, Marian made her way to the kitchen the following morning. This time, she wore socks and slippers, as well as a heavy shawl over her nightgown. If Lucivar snarled at her, she could point out that he didn\u2019t like cold feet, but she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d snarl. After he\u2019d slept for several hours yesterday, he\u2019d been just as hungry for her as he\u2019d been the other days, but it had changed as the day wore on. More of their couplings had been leisurely\u2014not a holding back to prolong the moment of climax, just . . . quieter, sweeter. More like she\u2019d imagined he would be as a lover after his initial hunger was sated.</p><p>She paused when she reached the front room. The drapes she\u2019d made to cover the glass doors were pulled back, revealing a clear, sunny day, which meant the storm had finally ended. She hoped the snow piled so high against the glass was due to drifts, but she suspected that wasn\u2019t the case. Which meant Ebon Rih was well and truly buried.</p><p>Buried.</p><p>She looked around\u2014and felt shaky relief when she saw the bowls near the front door. One held water, the other chunks of meat that might have come from a package of venison she\u2019d had in the freeze box. She hadn\u2019t dared ask about Tassle, hadn\u2019t dared try to contact the wolf on a psychic thread to find out if he was all right for fear Lucivar would sense it and think she was trying to summon another male as a rival to him. There was no other sign of Tassle, but Lucivar must have confirmed the wolf was nearby before he put out food and water.</p><p>When she entered the kitchen, she found Lucivar, fully dressed, drinking coffee from one of those plain white mugs he preferred to use. He turned away from the window, gave her one quick look, then turned back to study the world beyond the kitchen.</p><p>His eyes were no longer wild and glazed, but there was no warmth in them, either. If anything, he seemed . . . uneasy.</p><p>Uncertain about what he expected from her, she tried to smile. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStorm\u2019s finally blown out.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if he meant the blizzard or the storm inside himself.</p><p>He moved away from the window, then stopped, as if he didn\u2019t want to get too close to her. And he wouldn\u2019t look at her.</p><p>He took a swallow of coffee, then set the mug on the counter. \u201cDo you need a Healer?\u201d</p><p>The abrupt question startled her. She wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d expected when the rut finally ended, but she hadn\u2019t expected him to act like she was a stranger he\u2019d given shelter to during the storm. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need a Healer.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her\u2014and she could have sworn he cringed before he backed away.</p><p>\u201cI need to check on the villages, make sure everyone got through the storm all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want some breakfast before you go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied too quickly. \u201cI don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d He hesitated, then shook his head. \u201cI have to go.\u201d He gave her one more glance before he hurried down the domestic corridor that led to the side door.</p><p>A moment later, she heard the door slam behind him.</p><p>Stunned, Marian sank into a chair and wrapped her arms around herself for comfort.</p><p>He\u2019d run from her. Lucivar Yaslana, the Ebon-gray Warlord Prince of Ebon Rih, had fled from his own home to get away from her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want. That was it, wasn\u2019t it? That was the reason for his uneasiness, his embarrassment. He didn\u2019t want. What he\u2019d taken out of need, she\u2019d given out of love. But now that the rut was over . . . Was he ashamed that, having no other females to choose from, he\u2019d taken his housekeeper to his bed? Or was he afraid that, having seen him through the rut, she now expected him to reciprocate and accommodate her whenever she wanted a man?</p><p>She hadn\u2019t asked him for anything, had she? Having fallen in love with him, she\u2019d hoped he would feel some warmth for her when the rut was over, maybe even want to remain lovers, but she hadn\u2019t expected anything in return for what she\u2019d given.</p><p>Except courtesy. Or some word of appreciation before he drew the line that separated them into servant and employer would have been nice. A line, she thought with growing resentment, that he made every effort to erase whenever she tried to maintain that distinction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAsk me if I need a Healer,\u201d she muttered as she hurried to her own room and dressed in her warmest clothes. \u201cAs if I\u2019m some feeble female who will collapse after a long bout of lusty sex. Who does he think he is, anyway? He doesn\u2019t want me? Fine. Who asked him to want me? If I have feelings that aren\u2019t returned, well, that\u2019s my problem, isn\u2019t it? I didn\u2019t ask him to love me.\u201d But I want him to. Oh, I do want him to\u2014and all he wanted was to get away from me.</p><p>She had to move, had to work. If she didn\u2019t do something, she\u2019d curl up and cry until her heart broke. And that would be the worst thing of all. If he knew she\u2019d given him her heart as well as her body, he might feel uncomfortable about her staying even as his housekeeper.</p><p>Work didn\u2019t cure a bruised heart, but it gave her an outlet for all that fretful energy. Moving quickly, she fetched the snow shovel from the mud room. When she\u2019d found it in one of the merchant shops, she\u2019d been delighted. It was easy enough to use Craft to remove snow from pathways and streets, but Craft couldn\u2019t take the place of exercise to warm and strengthen the body. Today she wanted to shovel snow until she couldn\u2019t lift another bladeful. Today she\u2019d sweep and scrub and polish the eyrie until she was too tired to think.</p><p>She opened the front door and stared at the waist-high snow. If she wanted to get out without shoveling snow into the eyrie, she\u2019d have to use Craft to clear a space to stand in. Vanishing a block of snow as wide as the front door and as long as the shovel, she called it back in and let it drop in the yard beside the eyrie. Then she stepped outside.</p> <p>*Marian!*</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to look far to find Tassle. His face filled a rough opening in a large mound of snow.</p><p>\u201cTassle?\u201d Was he trapped under the snow? She lifted her hand, prepared to vanish more blocks of snow to reach him, when his face disappeared from the opening. Moments later, he scrambled out of the mound and bounded to the top of the snowbank next to her, dancing in his delight to see her.</p><p>Dancing. On top of the snow.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing that?\u201d Marian asked.</p> <p>*I am air walking.* Tassle danced a little more to show off his skill.</p><p>Well, that explained the times when she\u2019d seen Tassle trot over muddy ground and still enter the eyrie with clean paws.</p><p>*Yas can teach you,* Tassle said. *The Lady taught the kindred to air walk, and she taught Yas and her human friends, too.*</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure Lucivar would be willing to teach her anything at this point. She didn\u2019t want to think about that, so she focused on the wolf. \u201cDid you manage all right during the blizzard?\u201d</p><p>*Yas left food and water for me, and he said I could stay in the front room of the eyrie, and I did stay there at night, but Kaelas and the Lady taught the wolves who live with the High Lord how to make dens out of snow. Kaelas is Arcerian, and they make snow dens to live in during the winter. So I made a den.* He paused. *Now that you and Yas have mated, are you going to have puppies?*</p><p>Mother Night. She hadn\u2019t considered that, hadn\u2019t done anything to prevent that. After a quick, desperate counting of days, she breathed a sigh of relief. She was well past her fertile time. She couldn\u2019t imagine how Lucivar would react to being told a woman he no longer wanted was pregnant with his child. She\u2019d learned enough about his past to feel certain his response would be less than friendly.</p> <p>Work. Hard labor would keep her thoughts from wandering toward things that wouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>She dug in and started flinging shovelfuls of snow as far as she could, ignoring Tassle\u2019s repeated offers to use Craft to clear the path for her. Why should he care if the path was cleared. He, and a certain Eyrien Warlord Prince, could just walk above the snow.</p><p>*Marian?*</p><p>The only person who was trapped in the eyrie by the snow was the female, who was only good for mating and . . . making puppies.</p><p>*Marian!*</p><p>The whine in that sending finally made her stop and look at the wolf\u2014who looked back at her with woeful eyes, his head and shoulders covered with the snow she\u2019d flung in that direction.</p><p>Then someone quietly cleared his throat to gain her attention.</p><p>Marian looked to her left\u2014and considered flinging herself into the deepest drift and just staying there.</p> <p>The High Lord, standing on air, looked down at her. A snow goatee hung from his chin, and his clothes were liberally spattered with the snow she\u2019d thrown at him. Unknowingly, to be sure, but still . . .</p><p>\u201cGood morning, High Lord,\u201d Marian said.</p><p>He brushed the snow from his chin and clothes. \u201cGood morning, Lady Marian.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell by his tone if he was amused or annoyed.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d she asked meekly.</p><p>\u201cThat would be welcome.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. Could the day get any worse?</p><p>Of course, watching him walk down the snow as if he were descending stairs only he could see produced a spurt of resentment that she quickly tamped down. It wasn\u2019t his fault Lucivar hadn\u2019t thought to teach her anything as useful as air walking.</p><p>Pushing that thought aside, she vanished the shovel and her cape and boots as she hurried to the kitchen. Saetan paused in the front room long enough to hang his cape on the coat tree before joining her.</p><p>As she filled the teakettle, she said, \u201cPrince Yaslana isn\u2019t here at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Saetan replied, leaning against the counter. \u201cI came to see you.\u201d He paused. \u201cDo you need a Healer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I need a Healer?\u201d she snapped, slamming the kettle down on the stove. Witchfire flared up beneath it. Cursing silently, she pulled the fire back to its proper level.</p><p>\u201cNooo,\u201d Saetan replied dryly, \u201cbut the question has to be asked.\u201d</p><p>She turned on him. \u201cI can\u2019t be the only woman who spent most of the past three days in bed. Are they going to be asked if they need a Healer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. But they didn\u2019t spend that time with a Warlord Prince in rut.\u201d</p><p>She turned away to get out cups and saucers. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysically, I tend to agree. But you\u2019re not all right, Marian. You\u2019re upset about something, and most likely, it has to do with the rut.\u201d</p><p>She kept silent while she made the tea and set a cup in front of him when he took a seat at the pine table. She didn\u2019t join him. A week ago, she would have. But right now, she felt more like a paid servant than she\u2019d felt in all the months she\u2019d worked for Lucivar.</p><p>\u201cHe ran away,\u201d she said, feeling her heart ache as she said the words. \u201cHe could barely stand to look at me before he . . . bolted out of the eyrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid,\u201d Saetan said quietly.</p><p>Baffled, she studied the man watching her. \u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>Temper flashed in Saetan\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou have no idea what it\u2019s like to be caught in the rut, to be driven by something that eclipses everything else, to lose the veneer of civilized behavior that makes it possible for Warlord Princes to live with other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be with that kind of man,\u201d Marian flashed back.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember everything that happened from the time the rut began until it ended?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She watched Saetan rein in his temper, watched the visible effort to chain strong feelings.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Saetan said again. \u201cWarlord Princes are not held accountable for anything they do during the rut, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have . . . regrets . . . about things that happen.\u201d</p><p>We. It hit her like a fist. Saetan was a Warlord Prince, too, and had gone through the rut.</p><p>Her nerves danced. She licked her dry lips. \u201cHow can a woman know what it\u2019s like for you if you never tell her?\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. The High Lord of Hell actually shuddered. That, more than anything, made her wonder what Lucivar remembered about the past three days.</p><p>Setting the tea aside, Saetan rose. \u201cWell. I have things to see to.\u201d</p><p>Another strong man tucking his tail between his legs and running away because of the rut.</p><p>\u201cThank you for stopping by, High Lord.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wan smile. \u201cIt was my pleasure, Lady.\u201d</p><p>She doubted that, but she smiled and stayed in the kitchen until she was sure he was gone. After making a cup of tea for herself, she sat at the table for a long time.</p><p>It must have required a kind of steely courage for the High Lord to come to the eyrie, not knowing what he might find, what kind of damage he might have to try to repair. Remembering the stories she\u2019d heard about Warlord Princes, she had to admit he and Lucivar both had a valid reason for asking if she needed a Healer. It hadn\u2019t occurred to her that Lucivar wouldn\u2019t know she didn\u2019t need one.</p><p>Maybe Lucivar\u2019s bolting this morning hadn\u2019t been meant as a rejection. If he hadn\u2019t cared, at least a little, he wouldn\u2019t have been as concerned about what had happened during the rut, would he?</p><p>She sighed. There was nothing she could do to settle things between them until he came back, so she might as well get some work done.</p><p>After bundling up again, she opened the front door\u2014and stared. There wasn\u2019t so much as a flake of snow on the entire flagstone courtyard except for Tassle\u2019s den.</p><p>Taking the hint, Marian went back inside. She\u2019d clean Lucivar\u2019s bedroom and make some soup. And she wouldn\u2019t allow herself to wonder if he was afraid to come home because of things he couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>Saetan waited throughout the day, knowing Lucivar would come to him before going to the eyrie. It had been easy enough to keep track of his son. It hadn\u2019t been easy to resist summoning Lucivar to the Keep to offer what reassurance he could. But a summons of any kind would be misunderstood, and Lucivar\u2019s fear had bordered on panic too many times during the day to dare give him any kind of push. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, as the afternoon waned, Lucivar walked into the room where Saetan waited. He looked exhausted, and his hands trembled a little as he poured himself a glass of brandy.</p><p>\u201cYou saw her,\u201d Lucivar said, staring into the glass for a moment before he gulped the brandy and poured another glass.</p><p>\u201cI saw her,\u201d Saetan replied.</p><p>\u201cDid she need a Healer? I asked, but . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t need a Healer.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar sagged with relief. \u201cIs she . . . upset?\u201d</p><p>Saetan hesitated. He thought he\u2019d taken an accurate measure of Marian\u2019s temperament when she\u2019d stayed at the Hall during Winsol, but the woman who had flung snow on him and snapped at him in her kitchen didn\u2019t fit that measure. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t reacting as I would have expected.\u201d He frowned. \u201cShe\u2019d struck me as a quiet-natured woman, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucivar shrugged. \u201cShe usually is, but she gets feisty when she\u2019s riled.\u201d</p><p>Riled. Yes, that was a good way to describe the woman he\u2019d seen that morning.</p> <p>Lucivar set the glass down so carefully, Saetan suspected it was taking every bit of self-control to keep from throwing the glass at the wall.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to leave?\u201d Lucivar asked. \u201cShould I stay away until she can\u2014\u201d He swallowed hard, unable to finish.</p><p>That, Saetan realized, was the root of Lucivar\u2019s fear\u2014that the woman he was in love with, the woman he\u2019d been courting so carefully over the last few months, would want nothing from him except the chance to escape. Lucivar wouldn\u2019t believe him right now if he said escape was the last thing on Marian\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cMay I offer you some advice?\u201d Saetan asked. \u201cNot as your father or as the Steward of the court, but as a man who talked to Marian this morning.\u201d</p><p>Misery filling his gold eyes, Lucivar said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your advice?\u201d</p><p>Saetan smiled dryly. \u201cGet your ass home in time for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>He found her in the kitchen, arranging slices of bread and cheese on plates while something that smelled delicious simmered on the stove. How many times had he come home to find her like this, preparing the evening meal for them, her warm smile of welcome a feast to a heart that had been starving for love for so many centuries? Now he wasn\u2019t sure what he should say to her, what he should do.</p><p>\u201cMarian.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, and the unhappiness in her eyes was a twisting knife in his gut.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you would come back,\u201d she said, turning back to fuss with the bread and cheese.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you wanted me to come back,\u201d he replied honestly.</p><p>She started to speak, then shook her head and picked up the plates. \u201cHave something to eat.\u201d The plates clattered on the counter. She hunched her shoulders, as if to ward off a blow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to run away. I wasn\u2019t expecting anything from you because of this. You didn\u2019t have to run.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he did. But he hadn\u2019t run far. Just down to the orchard, where he would be out of sight of the eyrie while he puked his guts out in sick relief that he hadn\u2019t seen any visible wounds on her, hadn\u2019t seen any missing limbs. He\u2019d been terrified to look when he woke up that morning, hadn\u2019t known how keen an edge panic could have until she\u2019d walked into the kitchen on her own.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain,\u201d he said, flinching at the tears in her eyes when she turned to face him.</p> <p>\u201cHow can a woman understand if no one will explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember!\u201d</p><p>Now she flinched. Then she whispered, \u201cSo I was just a body.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar shook his head. \u201cOh, I remember you, Marian. The taste of you, the smell of you, the sounds you made, the feel of you under my hands. The feel of my cock inside you. I remember you. But I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cI remember bits and pieces, moments that are jumbled together and shrouded in a violent, red haze that needed some kind of release. But . . .\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t he run from this all day? This one picture in his mind. He\u2019d worked himself to exhaustion because every time he thought of her, desire burned through him, and he couldn\u2019t ask her to be with him tonight. He couldn\u2019t. Because of that one fragment of memory. But he had to ask. Had to know. She couldn\u2019t stay here with him if he didn\u2019t know how close he\u2019d come to destroying her.</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at her. \u201cI do remember one thing. Me standing by the bed, holding my war blade. And you cowering in one corner of the bed.\u201d</p><p>Marian shook her head. Then she paled as his words sank in. \u201cNo, Lucivar. No. You weren\u2019t trying to hurt me. You thought something had gotten into the room, into the bed. You were trying to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing could have gotten into that room, not with all the shields I had around it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing did,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t know that. You were startled and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy what?\u201d he snapped, feeling raw\u2014and not sure he really believed her.</p><p>She mumbled something and wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know my feet were that cold, but then you screamed and leaped out of bed and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He looked at her feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wearing socks.\u201d</p><p>She sounded grumpy. Grumpy was good. Grumpy was wonderful.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me, Lucivar. Not in any way.\u201d</p><p>Relief surged through him, but his heart still ached because he\u2019d sensed a lie beneath her words. He tried to smile. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want me for a lover.\u201d He saw hope in her eyes\u2014and maybe something more? \u201cDo you want me, Marian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cYes, I want you.\u201d</p><p>He held out a hand. \u201cThen take me.\u201d</p><p>She turned shy and uncertain. Couldn\u2019t quite look at him. Another kind of woman wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to take what he offered. Marian might, given time and encouragement, initiate sex by giving a quiet invitation, but she would never demand.</p><p>He approached her slowly, his fingers linking with hers when he got close enough to touch her. \u201cTake me, Marian.\u201d He stepped back, bringing her with him, until he could sit in one of the chairs. A quick tug and a deft move had her straddling him. He brushed her hair away from her face, enjoying the feel of that black silk flowing around his fingers. His lips touched hers, a soft kiss. \u201cTake me.\u201d</p><p>He remembered her, but now he could savor the sensations of being with her. The way her mouth opened for him. The timid way her tongue stroked his, encouraging him to take what he wanted. Soft. Sweet. The kind of sex he\u2019d never had before.</p><p>Her fingers flexed on his shoulders, her only signal that she wanted more.</p><p>His mouth drifting along her jaw and down her neck, he undid her tunic lacings and slipped it down her shoulders as he vanished her undershirt. He doubted she was aware of arching her back in an unspoken invitation to suckle, but he took the invitation while his hands slipped under the tunic to caress her back.</p><p>He played with her until she squirmed in his lap, looking for what was still caged behind leather. She gasped, startled, when he vanished all of his clothes and all of hers below the waist. His hands kneaded her buttocks, rubbing her against him.</p><p>\u201cTake me.\u201d He lifted her, sheathed himself inside her. \u201cTake me.\u201d She was too focused on the feel of his cock to understand he was offering more than sex, but he knew he was offering his heart as well as his body.</p><p>She was ready to ride. He wanted to be ridden. But she didn\u2019t have the leverage, so he slid his hands down her legs and cupped her knees, giving her stirrups.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t touch her, had effectively tethered himself so that he could only submit. Watching a woman ride him to her pleasure had never thrilled him before, but watching Marian lose herself in a sexual haze made him wild to touch her, taste her. But he stayed tethered, helping her ride him, gritting his teeth against the need to explode until she cried out and crested\u2014and took him with her.</p><p>She melted against him, limp and trembling, her head pillowed on his shoulder. Feeling his own muscles quiver, he released her knees and wrapped his arms around her, content to hold her. But as the sweat began to dry on his skin, he shivered.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart,\u201d he said, giving her a little squeeze. \u201cWe can\u2019t sleep here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan,\u201d she mumbled, rubbing her cheek against his shoulder.</p><p>He considered picking her up and taking her to bed, then dismissed the thought. With the way his legs were quivering right now, he\u2019d just dump them both on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t sleep here. It\u2019s too cold.\u201d He pushed and prodded until she finally raised her head to look at him. Her eyes were dull with fatigue, and he realized she must have tried to work herself into the ground to run from her own thoughts. \u201cWe\u2019ll have something to eat and then cuddle up in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuddle?\u201d</p><p>Before she could fold around him again, he got her off him enough to dump her in another chair and call in a blanket to wrap around her. After calling in the robe she\u2019d made him for Winsol and putting a light warming spell on it and the blanket, he brought the bread and cheese to the table, then ladled out two bowls of soup. She just watched him, which told him well enough how tired she was.</p><p>Even hunger couldn\u2019t compete with exhaustion, and neither of them managed to finish the soup. But Marian roused enough to insist on putting the food away properly, then stumbled with him to his bedroom.</p><p>It smelled clean. Fresh. He wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d managed to air the room when it was still so wickedly cold outside, but he was grateful the thick musk of sex was gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few minutes to add fresh wood to the fire, add more power to the warming spells, and get Marian focused enough to call in a nightgown. Then he bundled them into bed, set his teeth, and shifted his legs until she could warm her feet on him. Damn, they were cold!</p><p>She curled up against him and sighed in contentment.</p><p>Lucivar brushed his lips against her forehead and smiled. If sex wasn\u2019t enough incentive for his little hearth witch to share his bed, having a man who would keep her feet warm this winter would be.</p><p>NINETEEN</p> <p>After a hard winter, nothing lifted the spirits in quite the same way as the warmth of spring thaw, Marian thought as she went from shop to shop to do the marketing. Even Riada\u2019s muddy streets couldn\u2019t dull her pleasure\u2014especially since Lucivar had taught her how to air walk and she could keep her boots above the mud.</p><p>He\u2019d taught her a lot of things over the winter months.</p><p>As she considered stopping at The Tavern to chat with Merry and have a quick bowl of soup or stew before going home, she almost ran into the woman who stepped out of a shop directly in her path.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen Roxie all winter. Didn\u2019t want to see her now.</p><p>\u201cLady Roxie,\u201d Marian said, stepping to one side to go around the other witch.</p> <p>Roxie stepped into her path again. \u201cYou\u2019d better start looking for a new position. When I move into the eyrie, I\u2019m not sharing Lucivar with the likes of you.\u201d She gave Marian one scathing look from head to toe. \u201cI suppose using you for relief was better than using his own hand, but not by much. Once I\u2019m there, Lucivar won\u2019t have any interest in you, and I\u2019m not going to have a servant working for me who doesn\u2019t know her place.\u201d</p><p>A chill went through Marian. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucivar\u2019s going to be my lover. I\u2019ll be moving into the eyrie with him any day now.\u201d</p><p>Marian shook her head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you. He\u2019d never invite you to live with him.\u201d</p><p>Something ugly glinted in Roxie\u2019s eyes before she smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to have a choice. He\u2019s going to have to do everything I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the Warlord Prince of Ebon Rih,\u201d Marian protested. \u201cYou can\u2019t force him to do anything he doesn\u2019t want to do. He doesn\u2019t serve you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to,\u201d Roxie said smugly. Then she leaned close to Marian. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell everyone he tried to force himself on me but came to his senses before it became an actual rape. The Queens in Ebon Rih won\u2019t demand an execution\u2014they wouldn\u2019t dare, considering who he\u2019s related to. But I\u2019ll insist that he be made to serve me for a year as the price for the trauma inflicted by his unbridled lust. And they\u2019ll give him to me.\u201d</p><p>Marian stared at Roxie, stunned. Accuse Lucivar of rape? The accusation alone would require going before a tribunal of Queens to determine the man\u2019s innocence or guilt, and even if he was declared innocent, the taint of being accused could shadow him the rest of his life. It had happened to a friend of her father\u2019s. Despite being falsely accused, the Warlord had been dismissed from the court\u2014and had ended up leaving Askavi because even his closest friends had turned away from him, afraid their own reputations would be smeared if they were seen with him.</p><p>Even though it still chilled her to think about it, she understood why the Warlords who attacked her had planned to kill her. If she had survived the rape and accused them, at the very least, their standing in society would have been ruined. If a nobody hearth witch could ruin aristo Warlords in Terreille, what would an accusation made by an aristo witch do to a man in Kaeleer, where the laws and Protocols were upheld far more strictly?</p><p>And if the people in Ebon Rih thought Lucivar was freed because of his family connections rather than because he was truly innocent, it would shatter his life. The Blood here would never continue to accept him as the Warlord Prince of Ebon Rih.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Marian said. \u201cEven if they believed you, even if they did demand that he serve you, he\u2019s an Ebon-gray Warlord Prince. You\u2019d never control him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d have to wear a Ring of Obedience,\u201d Roxie replied. \u201cI\u2019ve heard those Rings can control any male.\u201d</p><p>Roxie didn\u2019t care that this would ruin him. She just wanted to enslave him, wanted to force him back into that pain he\u2019d endured when he\u2019d lived in Terreille. Lucivar would never obey Roxie willingly, so she\u2019d have to use the Ring to hurt him\u2014and because he\u2019d never shown any interest in her, she would enjoy hurting him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that to him,\u201d Marian said as something inside her strained to break free.</p> <p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d Roxie turned and started to walk away.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Dropping her basket, Marian threw herself at Roxie.</p><p>Lucivar pushed his way through the crowd, cursing under his breath. A brawl on the main street of Riada. Just what he needed today. He\u2019d hoped to convince Marian to set aside her chores for an hour to go flying with him since it was a lovely day and she hadn\u2019t had much of a chance to enjoy her recovered skills during the winter. Although that icy free fall they\u2019d performed one sunny afternoon had ended with an enjoyable evening keeping each other warm in bed.</p><p>First he\u2019d take care of this mess, then share a midday meal at The Tavern with Jaenelle as they\u2019d planned. After that, he\u2019d go home and see\u2014</p><p>He reached the front of the crowd and stared at the two women rolling around in the mud, punching, slapping, and generally trying to tear each other apart.</p><p>\u201cMother Night, Marian,\u201d he said, shaking his head. What in the name of Hell was she doing?</p><p>Moving forward, he waited for an opening, then grabbed the back of Marian\u2019s belted cape and yanked. He heard cloth rip as he lifted her enough to get his other hand under her and haul her back out of Roxie\u2019s reach.</p><p>He felt her legs tuck up and had a moment to think she was trying to help him set her on her feet before he recognized the intent. Releasing the back of the cape, he pivoted in time to take that two-footed kick on the thigh rather than in the balls. Since he was still holding the front of the cape, when her feet dropped to the ground his fist became the hinge her body swung on. Straightening his arm at the last second prevented her roundhouse punch from connecting with his face hard enough to break his jaw or her hand, but it would still leave a bitch of a bruise.</p><p>And that, he thought, was more than enough.</p><p>One fast jerk that ripped more seams and she landed on his shoulder with a whoof that knocked the air out of her.</p><p>\u201cBring that one,\u201d he growled as he marched toward The Tavern, which was the closest place that had chairs and enough space to deal with . . . whatever this was.</p><p>The crowd, he noted sourly, didn\u2019t move out of his way. Seeing where he was headed, they stampeded toward The Tavern to get ringside seats.</p><p>Great. Wonderful. At least they had sense enough to leave two tables empty.</p><p>He dumped Marian in an empty chair. When she popped right up again, he shoved her back into the chair and held her arms down as he leaned over her and said in his most menacing voice, \u201cSit down, Marian. Sit.\u201d</p><p>His quiet, gentle hearth witch bared her teeth and snarled at him.</p><p>He would have kissed her for finally producing a decent snarl except he was fairly sure she\u2019d bite him if he tried, and then she\u2019d feel bad. Not as bad as he would, but once she came to her senses, she\u2019d feel bad about doing it.</p><p>He kept Marian locked to the chair while two men brought a wailing Roxie into the tavern and settled her at the other empty table. Whatever had gotten Marian so riled up was still churning through her, so when he finally stepped back, he made sure she\u2019d have to go through him in order to tangle with Roxie again.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he snarled as he looked at the people crowded into the tavern\u2019s main room, \u201cwhat in the name of Hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe attacked me!\u201d Roxie wailed. \u201cJust because I told her she wasn\u2019t going to work for us after I moved into the eyrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re never going to move into the eyrie while I\u2019m still living there, that\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Lucivar snapped. He looked at Marian and shook his head. \u201cIs that what this is about? Didn\u2019t it occur to you she was lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I knew she was lying,\u201d Marian snapped back. \u201cBut she said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am going to live with you!\u201d Roxie shouted as she continued to sob. \u201cYou want me. You know you do. When I was in your bed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d slit your throat if I ever found you there again,\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>A collective gasp. Then the room fell silent.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d Roxie sobbed. \u201cYou were bluffing to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bluff.\u201d</p><p>Roxie stared at him.</p><p>Disgusted, Lucivar turned back to Marian. \u201cWas that the whole of it? What else did she say?\u201d</p><p>He saw Marian\u2019s eyes shift from side to side, taking in all the people waiting for her answer. He watched her temper fade and her usual quiet nature surface.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said.</p><p>There was more. He could tell by the way she wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes that there was more. Well, he\u2019d get it out of her after he got her back to the eyrie and checked her over to make sure the minor cuts and bruises he could see were the worst of her injuries.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did she say?\u201d asked a midnight voice from the doorway.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. The last thing he needed right now was Jaenelle stepping into this.</p><p>Marian looked at the Black Jewel hanging from the chain around Jaenelle\u2019s neck, then looked into those sapphire eyes\u2014and swallowed hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe said she was going to tell people Lucivar tried to force himself on her so that he would have to serve her,\u201d Marian said, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an Ebon-gray Warlord Prince,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cHow would she control him?\u201d</p><p>Marian licked her bloody lower lip. \u201cWith a Ring of Obedience.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar swore quietly, viciously, the memory of the pain that a Ring of Obedience could inflict shuddering through him.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lying bitch!\u201d Roxie shouted.</p><p>\u201cIs she?\u201d Jaenelle asked, her eyes never leaving Marian\u2019s face. \u201cThere\u2019s a simple way to tell. Are you willing to open your mind to me, Marian? Will you let me read your thoughts, your feelings, your heart? Will you open yourself to me, knowing that if what you said here is a lie, I will take you down into the abyss so deep it will shatter you, destroy you? Are you willing?\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle, don\u2019t do this, Lucivar thought.</p><p>Marian sat up straight. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll open my mind to you.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the tavern waited, hardly daring to breathe.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you, Roxie?\u201d Jaenelle asked, turning toward the other witch. \u201cWill you open your mind to me, knowing a lie will destroy you?\u201d</p><p>Wailing, Roxie shook her head.</p><p>Lucivar suppressed a shudder when Jaenelle\u2019s eyes pierced him. Her rage was a living thing, and it would take so little right now to set it free\u2014with devastating results.</p><p>*I will deal with this, Lady,* he said.</p><p>*And you will report to me after you\u2019ve dealt with it,* Jaenelle replied. *If Roxie\u2019s taste for manipulating and controlling males has reached this point, it\u2019s not just your life that\u2019s at risk, Prince Yaslana.*</p><p>*I\u2019m aware of that, Lady. I\u2019ll deal with it.*</p> <p>Jaenelle nodded. Then her eyes narrowed slightly as she studied Marian. *She has no injuries that require more healing skill than you possess, but I can do the healing if you prefer.*</p><p>*My thanks, Lady, but I\u2019ll take care of her.* He sent a touch of arrogance through the psychic thread. *Besides, she owes me for trying to kick my balls into my throat.*</p><p>*I see. Then you must be pleased that she learned the lessons you insisted on teaching her.*</p><p>*She still punches like a girl.* He rubbed his sore jaw. *For the most part.*</p><p>He felt a hint of amusement from her, which was exactly what he\u2019d hoped for. Her rage had turned aside, but it wouldn\u2019t take much to bring it back with lethal results. As much as he loved her, he breathed a sigh of relief when she walked out of The Tavern and caught the Winds to go back to the Keep.</p><p>Which left him with his muddy, bruised hearth witch and the sobbing bitch.</p><p>\u201cYou two,\u201d he said, pointing to the two Warlords who had assisted Roxie into the tavern. \u201cEscort Lady Roxie home and inform her father that I\u2019ll see him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her punished!\u201d Roxie wailed as the two men hauled her to her feet. \u201cShe attacked me! I want her punished!\u201d</p> <p>And I want you dead, Lucivar thought. But we can\u2019t always have what we want.</p><p>He waited until Roxie was gone before turning to Marian. \u201cAs for you . . .\u201d</p><p>She shrank back in the chair, her courage gone.</p><p>Shaking his head, he hauled her out of the chair. \u201cCome on, witchling. Let\u2019s get you home while you can still move. You\u2019re not going to believe how sore you\u2019ll be by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about setting a meal on the table, Marian,\u201d Merry called. \u201cI\u2019ll pack a basket and bring up a few dishes in a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasket,\u201d Marian gasped. \u201cMy carry basket. All my shopping.\u201d</p><p>Taking the easy way out of this discussion, Lucivar dumped her over his shoulder, walked out of The Tavern, and caught a Wind that would take them home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Marian said, trying not to wince as Lucivar ripped her clothes off. They were past repairing anyway, and since she was the reason he was limping and had a rather impressive bruise blooming on his jaw, she figured she shouldn\u2019t argue with him about the clothes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not half as sorry as you\u2019re going to be,\u201d Lucivar growled as he knelt to strip off her boots. He led her to the steps at one corner of the heated pool\u2014steps he\u2019d never mentioned the first time he dumped her in there\u2014and kept one hand on her arm to steady her as she descended. Then he stripped off his own clothes and joined her.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at you.\u201d He called in a washcloth, dipped it in the water, and washed the mud off her face.</p><p>Gentle, thorough, grim. She watched his face as he tended each bruise, saw the flash of temper in his eyes when he came to a cut. Then he growled as he carefully checked her hands.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t remember to put a shield around your hands before you threw the first punch, did you?\u201d He probed her knuckles and fingers. \u201cOf course, if you\u2019d thought to put a shield around yourself in the first place, she couldn\u2019t have landed a blow at all.\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cYou didn\u2019t shield, either, when you waded into the fight.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting my lover to try to kick my balls down the street.\u201d</p><p>My lover. The words warmed her more than anything else could. He\u2019d never said he loved her, and she hadn\u2019t wanted to spoil the easy way they were now living together by telling him she loved him. But she thought it, felt it, more with each day\u2014and hoped that someday he would feel the same.</p><p>Then what she\u2019d done finally sank in. She closed her eyes and hunched her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMarian?\u201d Lucivar\u2019s voice was sharp, alarmed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI caused a public scene. I\u2019m sorry I embarrassed you by doing that.\u201d</p><p>His finger rapped her chin hard enough to startle her into opening her eyes. How could he look grim and amused at the same time?</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s going to take more than a public brawl to embarrass me. Especially since I\u2019ve initiated my fair share of public scenes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you this time?\u201d</p><p>Anger spurted through her as she remembered the look on Roxie\u2019s face, the things the woman said. \u201cShe wanted to hurt you. She wanted to take away everything that matters to you. I couldn\u2019t let her do that.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t read the look in his eyes. Soft. Hot. Something more, but she wasn\u2019t sure what it was.</p><p>\u201cDo I mean that much to you?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>I love you. \u201cYes, you mean that much to me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, then brushed his lips over hers. \u201cDo I mean enough to you that you\u2019re going to let me fuss over you without snarling at me today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She frowned and studied his lazy, arrogant smile. \u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He kissed the bruise on her cheek. \u201cBut you can snarl at me. I like the sound of it.\u201d</p><p>His mouth drifted to her neck, and his soft snarl as his teeth scraped over her skin made her float on a wave of desire.</p><p>\u201cLucivar,\u201d she whispered, wrapping arms that felt liquid and heavy around his neck. \u201cLucivar.\u201d She closed her eyes, unable to keep them open anymore.</p><p>She felt him shift her, felt him sheath himself inside her. Hard. Hot. Something more.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, sweetheart,\u201d Lucivar whispered as he moved inside her. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Take all of me. I want to give you all of me.\u201d</p><p>I want . . . Nothing to do but ride the last crest that left her floating.</p><p>She was vaguely aware of being lifted out of the pool, of being dried off and tucked into bed, but she couldn\u2019t rouse herself enough to shake the warm contentment that was pulling her down to a quiet, deep place.</p><p>\u201cYou put a sleep spell on me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll thank me for it later,\u201d Lucivar replied, kissing her temple.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear, witchling, because I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>She was dreaming. Of course she was dreaming. But she smiled and let the dream take her.</p><p>Lucivar made a pot of coffee, then rummaged through the cold box for something to eat. Ah. There was the rest of the country casserole Marian had made for dinner last night. After putting the dish in the oven to heat, he started to look around for something to go with it, but the garden caught his attention, drawing him to the kitchen window.</p><p>Still plenty of snow out there, but where the sun had melted the snow and warmed the earth, he could see the green shoots. She\u2019d been so delighted when she\u2019d seen that her spring bulbs had survived the winter.</p><p>Jaenelle had reacted the same way.</p><p>Was that why Marian pulled at him the way no other woman did? She and Jaenelle were so different in some ways and so similar in others. Hearth witch and Queen, but the same qualities that made them both exceptional women, each in her own way.</p><p>And she loved him.</p><p>Lucivar smiled.</p><p>Did Marian realize she\u2019d said it out loud? Had she heard his reply?</p><p>He called in the jeweler\u2019s box, opened it, and studied the two rings inside. When he\u2019d bought Marian the amber necklace for Winsol, he\u2019d also had Banard make these rings. Amber and jade set in a gold band for Marian. A plain gold band for him.</p><p>Marriage rings. He wanted to slide that ring on her finger, wanted to wear that gold band that was a symbol of commitment, partnership . . . and love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d been together almost a full turn of the seasons. She\u2019d seen the worst of him\u2014no, not the worst; she\u2019d never seen him walk off a killing field, but she\u2019d gone through a rut with him\u2014and, hopefully, he\u2019d also shown her the best, had shown her she could grow in a marriage with him, that she could be everything she wanted to be.</p><p>Maybe it was time to ask her to share her life with him, not just as a lover but as a wife. He wanted, fiercely, to be her husband.</p><p>He closed the box and vanished it. Soon. Very soon.</p><p>First, he had to decide what to do about Roxie.</p> <p>TWENTY</p><p>Lucivar took a deep breath before knocking on the front door of Roxie\u2019s house. The street was too quiet for midday, even in the aristo part of Doun. He could almost feel all the eyes peering at him from behind sheer curtains. They would have heard some version of what happened yesterday, so they knew why he was here. To pass judgment. To draw a line between what would be accepted in Ebon Rih and what would not.</p><p>Jaenelle had been right about that. It was more than his own life at stake in this decision. He\u2019d let his dislike of Roxie color his sense of justice, had avoided her because she reminded him too much of the bitches who\u2019d used him in Terreille\u2014and hadn\u2019t gone after her for using other men as he\u2019d done when he was a slave because, he\u2019d told himself, those men had had a choice about being with her. He wasn\u2019t sure of that anymore, but the Queens in both Doun and Riada had informed him with wary formality that no complaints had been lodged, no man had come forward to say Roxie had mistreated him. Didn\u2019t mean much, although the Queens here could be naive enough to believe it did. As long as an aristo witch didn\u2019t play with an aristo male whose family would protest if his reputation was damaged, the Queens would never know about the others\u2014youths, now ashamed that lust had overruled common sense, who were considered \u201csluts.\u201d Good enough when a woman wanted a warm body in bed, but too \u201cexperienced\u201d to be considered for a public, long-term relationship\u2014or a marriage.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like Roxie, which is why he\u2019d given himself a full day to think hard about what was just\u2014and, thank the Darkness, his Queen had approved of his decision.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean the aristo families in Doun were going to find it easy to swallow. But everything had a price. Males who warmed too many beds sometimes paid dearly. Roxie would be the lesson\u2014and the warning\u2014that witches who used men would pay a price as well. He\u2019d been too passive in dealing with Roxie. He wouldn\u2019t make that mistake again.</p> <p>A servant escorted him into the formal parlor where Roxie\u2019s father waited. The man rocked on his heels, all ruffled indignation and puffed-up anger. But there was fear in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWarlord,\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>\u201cPrince.\u201d Roxie\u2019s father bobbed his head sharply. \u201cI hope you\u2019ve dismissed that servant. Dreadful woman, accosting an innocent girl on a public street and then spreading lies about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re referring to Lady Marian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarian. Yes, that\u2019s the name! Your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLover.\u201d</p> <p>Roxie\u2019s father paled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarian is my lover,\u201d Lucivar said softly.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014But you promised Roxie\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucivar snarled. \u201cThe only thing I ever promised Roxie was that I\u2019d kill her if I found her in my bed again.\u201d</p><p>The man staggered toward a chair and sank into it.</p><p>He loves the little bitch, Lucivar thought as pity stirred in him. But pity couldn\u2019t alter what he\u2019d come here to do. In truth, he was showing Roxie more mercy than she probably deserved. \u201cEverything has a price. The price of rape is execution. Falsely accusing a man of rape also has a price\u2014the witch\u2019s Jewels . . . or her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she didn\u2019t accuse you of anything! You only have that woman\u2019s\u2014that Lady\u2019s word on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have a chance to accuse me,\u201d Lucivar countered. He took a deep breath, let it out in a sigh, and shook his head. Better just to say it and be done. \u201cBecause she didn\u2019t have a chance to play out her game, I can be . . . flexible . . . about the penalty. I can\u2019t justify taking her life, but I won\u2019t have her putting men\u2019s lives at risk in the land where I rule. Therefore, Roxie is exiled from Ebon Rih. You have three days to get her settled beyond the borders of this valley. If she\u2019s not gone by then, I\u2019ll come hunting. And if she ever returns to Ebon Rih, I\u2019ll kill her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d Roxie\u2019s father wailed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the law here,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cThis is as much mercy as I can offer a woman like her. You can accept it and get her out of Ebon Rih\u201d\u2014he called in his war blade\u2014\u201cor I can kill her now. I imagine there will be a fair number of young men who will sleep easier tonight if I do.\u201d</p><p>Roxie\u2019s father clutched his chest. Tears filled his eyes. \u201cWhere is she supposed to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d He vanished the war blade. \u201cJust get her out of Ebon Rih, or her life is forfeit.\u201d</p><p>The man burst out crying.</p><p>Since there was nothing more to say, Lucivar walked out of the house and down the street. It was tempting to fly away, to let speed and height put distance between him and that house. But he walked down the street so the people in the other houses would see him, would know. He was the law in Ebon Rih, and nothing except his Queen\u2019s command could change that.</p><p>\u201cPrince?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar stopped, turned toward the voice. A young man lingered in a carriageway between two of the houses. Decently dressed, but not from an aristo family. Probably a merchant\u2019s son. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was some talk . . .\u201d He glanced down the street. \u201cI mean . . . Roxie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas been exiled from Ebon Rih.\u201d</p><p>The youngster closed his eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar choked back his temper. So. Here was one of Roxie\u2019s victims. \u201cShe won\u2019t bother you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the others?\u201d the young man asked, pleading.</p><p>\u201cWhat others?\u201d Lucivar snapped.</p><p>\u201cWe . . . Roxie and me . . . we only did it twice. Then she lost interest in me, said I wasn\u2019t a good enough tumble for her to keep seeing me. But her friends started coming around to my father\u2019s shop, and they wanted . . . expected . . .\u201d Bitterness filled his eyes. \u201cThey said they\u2019d heard I was an easy romp, and I should accommodate them the way I\u2019d done for Roxie. But I\u2019d cared for her, and I thought she cared . . .\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cIs your family standing by you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. My father says caring enough to be intimate with a girl isn\u2019t a mistake. My mistake was in caring for the wrong kind of girl. And Mother says all young men have a trip and stumble somewhere along the way, that I\u2019ll be a better man for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t keep the other bitches from expecting you to drop your pants,\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>The young man hung his head. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>He almost told the youngster there was nothing he could do for him. Then he thought about Saetan\u2019s rules for anyone staying at the Hall. \u201cThis is an order, puppy, so pay attention.\u201d He waited until the youngster straightened up and stared at him. \u201cUntil I tell you otherwise, you may not have sex with a girl without my permission. That means both of you coming before me and telling me you want each other. I\u2019ll let you make the choice about kissing and petting above the waist. You go any further than that without coming to me first, I will beat the shit out of you. And I\u2019ll beat the shit out of her, just so it\u2019s clear that the penalty to her will be equally harsh if she pushes after you decline. You understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet yourself back home. No man with any sense is going to want to be anywhere near this street today.\u201d</p><p>A restrained smile. \u201cYes, Prince.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar watched the young man move down the street and turn the corner, not quite running as he headed back to his own part of the village, but moving with speed. An example he intended to follow.</p><p>Spreading his wings, he launched himself toward the clean spring sky, then hovered for a moment before catching the Red Wind and heading for the Keep.</p><p>Lucivar watched Saetan sort through books stacked on the large blackwood table in the Keep\u2019s library. He wasn\u2019t sure why his father needed so many reference books, but if it had anything to do with Jaenelle, it wasn\u2019t something he really wanted to know. \u201cDid I do the right thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you asking?\u201d Saetan replied.</p><p>\u201cThe Warlord Prince of Dhemlan.\u201d</p><p>Saetan set aside the books and looked at him. \u201cYou did the right thing. You didn\u2019t have sufficient reason to order an execution or to break Roxie and deprive her of the power she might have used to . . . persuade . . . a lighter-Jeweled male to have sex with her. I imagine some harsh things will be said about you by the aristo families in Doun\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucivar snorted. \u201cAs if I give a damn.\u201d</p><p>Saetan nodded, as if he had expected that answer. \u201cI also imagine, when word of this spreads, the Queens who rule the Blood villages in Ebon Rih are going to think long and hard about this. So are the Warlord Princes who live in the valley. You\u2019ve drawn the line, Lucivar, and they\u2019re the ones who will be expected to help you enforce it.\u201d He paused. \u201cI suggest you stay close to home for the next day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hide because I made a decision some of the Blood won\u2019t like,\u201d Lucivar snarled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saetan smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not hiding, you\u2019re practicing domestic survival skills. If you leave Marian to deal with all the visitors I expect you\u2019ll have in the next few days, she\u2019ll be more than justified in kicking your ass.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Marian rushed into The Tavern, relieved to see Merry behind the bar. Even more relieved that the place hadn\u2019t begun to fill up with the people who stopped by for a midday meal.</p><p>\u201cI need a small keg of ale,\u201d Marian said. Then she frowned. \u201cMaybe two.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHaving a party?\u201d Merry asked as she wiped down the bar.</p><p>\u201cA party would be fun. This is\u2014\u201d Marian perched on a stool. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord got out,\u201d Merry said, cocking her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been having visitors?\u201d</p><p>Marian groaned. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad yesterday. Several aristo Ladies from Doun called on Lucivar to assure him they hadn\u2019t done anything to deserve exile. Which makes you wonder what they had done. But today . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night, everyone who came into our place was talking about Roxie\u2019s exile.\u201d Merry reached for the coffee mug on the bar. \u201cGood for us to be rid of the bitch. Good for Lucivar for doing it.\u201d She raised the mug in a salute. \u201cHere\u2019s to the Prince of Ebon Rih.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how is our Lady Marian today?\u201d Briggs said as he walked in from the back room.</p><p>\u201cShe needs two small kegs of ale,\u201d Merry replied.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll add a couple of bottles of brandy to that,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cThe Prince might need something a bit stronger than ale by the time the day is done.\u201d He grinned. \u201cOr you will.\u201d</p><p>Marian smiled weakly. There was more truth in that than Briggs knew. She\u2019d baked yesterday and early this morning in anticipation of having a few visitors after Lucivar had told her about Roxie, but she hadn\u2019t anticipated so many. She\u2019d already stopped at the bakery since there wasn\u2019t time to tend to the visitors and do more baking herself.</p><p>When the kegs and brandy appeared on the bar, she vanished them and jumped off the stool. \u201cI\u2019d better get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making steak pies to serve this evening,\u201d Merry said. \u201cI\u2019ll make an extra and send it up to you. You\u2019ll have enough to do today without putting a meal together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Marian said with a smile. She hurried out of The Tavern and flew home as fast as she could.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful, Lucivar thought as he went to answer the door\u2014again. How did Saetan tolerate days like this? A fist in the face had always gotten his message across well enough. Why did he have to talk to all these people?</p><p>And where was Marian? The aristo bitches from Doun had looked at her with barely concealed sneers, but the merchants and other family men who were showing up looked relieved when she greeted them and offered some refreshment. He made them nervous. She was someone they felt easy being around. Which is why he\u2019d let her run herself ragged looking after them while they waited for an audience with him.</p><p>As soon as she got back, he was going to lock the door and they were going to sit down for a quick meal and an hour\u2019s peace. Until then . . .</p><p>When he opened the door, the Queen of Riada\u2019s Consort\u2014and husband\u2014walked in. A Summer-sky Prince, he\u2019d been with his Lady for ten years now and was the father of her two children.</p><p>\u201cIs the Queen upset about my decision?\u201d Lucivar asked as he closed the door.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the Prince replied. Then he smiled. \u201cAlthough she\u2019s had her share of visitors today. No, I\u2019m not here on my Queen\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar studied the man. He didn\u2019t know him well since he preferred a place like The Tavern to a dining house that catered to aristos, and the only time he\u2019d attended dinner parties was when Jaenelle had been invited as well and needed him to be her escort.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Roxie leaves Ebon Rih, she\u2019ll no longer be your problem\u2014or ours, for which I thank you. But a woman who would make false accusations about an Ebon-gray Warlord Prince is either stupid or trouble or both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe agree on that. I\u2019m sorry to make her someone else\u2019s problem, but I couldn\u2019t justify doing more than getting her out of Ebon Rih.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that. There are ways to handle such problems.\u201d The Prince looked uncomfortable. \u201cSometimes a person takes a wrong turn and needs a new place where a smear on his, or her, reputation isn\u2019t reflected back from every person he meets.\u201d</p><p>Bitterness filled the Prince\u2019s eyes for a moment before a different memory warmed them again, making Lucivar wonder what kind of smear had brought the man to Ebon Rih for a fresh start.</p><p>\u201cSometimes that\u2019s all a person needs to find everything he was looking for,\u201d the Prince continued softly. Then he stiffened, as if suddenly realizing he\u2019d said too much. \u201cAnd sometimes a person won\u2019t change. A Lady can sleep with a different man every day of the year, and no one will say a thing because that is a Lady\u2019s privilege. At least, no one will say anything publicly. But a woman who is a user gets a reputation among the men, and when she leaves one hunting ground for another, word is quietly sent to warn the men there that her . . . affection . . . may not be sincere.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar nodded. He would have preferred blunt words to this diplomatic hedging, but he was Eyrien. \u201cYou have a solution?\u201d</p><p>The Prince tipped his head in acknowledgment. \u201cMy brother serves as an escort in a Queen\u2019s court. She rules one of the larger cities on the coast of Askavi. A quiet word to him would spread to the other courts. If Roxie relocates to one of their cities, they\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar thought about the young man he\u2019d met on Roxie\u2019s street, a young man who would spend the next few years working hard to clean that smear off his reputation. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>Just then Marian rushed in from the kitchen, looking breathless and windblown\u2014and beautiful.</p><p>\u201cLucivar, I\u2014Oh. Good day, Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Marian,\u201d the Prince replied, offering her a slight bow.</p><p>\u201cWould you care for refreshments?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar almost grinned at the exasperated look she gave him, could almost hear her thoughts: Leave him alone for a few minutes, and he keeps an important visitor standing at the door. She\u2019d come a long way from the frightened hearth witch who had sat at his kitchen table last summer.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the offer, Lady, but I need to be getting back.\u201d</p><p>When the Prince left, Lucivar locked the front door and came back to the kitchen, rubbing his hands over his face. \u201cI don\u2019t care who comes knocking, for the next hour you and I are going to have some peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought back kegs of ale and some brandy,\u201d Marian said as she unbuckled the belt of her new cape.</p><p>\u201cGive me a hug. That will do more for me than ale and brandy put together.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, startled, then gave him an understanding smile as she walked into his open arms.</p><p>\u201cPoor Lucivar,\u201d she said as she slid her arms around him. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a beastly day, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his cheek against her hair. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not over yet.\u201d There was one visitor he was expecting who hadn\u2019t shown up yet. He was almost looking forward to that little discussion.</p><p>Marian heard the raised voices when she came out of the pantry with a jar of fruit to go with the steak pie. Feeling cowardly when she recognized Luthvian\u2019s voice, but not sufficiently ashamed of the feeling to enter the front room, she stayed at the edge of the kitchen where it was least likely she\u2019d be seen. She didn\u2019t want to get in the middle of this\u2014especially when she heard a viciousness in Lucivar\u2019s voice that made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use that tone with me,\u201d Luthvian said.</p><p>\u201cWhat tone?\u201d Lucivar snarled. \u201cI\u2019m not a boy you can slap down, and I\u2019m not a slave you can control. You don\u2019t like my tone, get out of my house.\u201d</p><p>Luthvian\u2019s voice gained a sharp, slicing edge. \u201cYou exiled an aristo witch simply because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a bitch, a liar, and a user. She got away with it because she never quite crossed the line of forcing a male into her bed. Well, planning to accuse me of attempted rape crossed that line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only have the word of a hearth witch that Roxie intended any such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA witch who was willing to open her mind to my Queen, knowing a lie would destroy her. Hell\u2019s fire, Luthvian! It doesn\u2019t matter if Roxie would have gone through with accusing me. Even if she\u2019d had second thoughts about taking me on, she wouldn\u2019t have had second thoughts about trying that game with a male who wouldn\u2019t have known what to do once she\u2019d gotten a Ring of Obedience on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRipped the bitch apart. She wouldn\u2019t have lived an hour after she put a Ring on me.\u201d</p><p>Marian clamped a hand over her mouth to muffle her gasp. As the tense silence continued, she peeked around the corner and caught a glimpse of Lucivar as he paced away from Luthvian and turned back, framed by the archway. The look on his face . . . Warrior. Predator. He looked magnificent. And terrifying.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d Luthvian said, her voice tight.</p><p>His laugh was sharp and bitter. \u201cI saw hundreds of Rox ies while I was a slave in Terreille. They didn\u2019t survive me. Do you know why they stopped trying to use me as a pleasure slave, Luthvian? Because I was so damned vicious, and every one of those bitches left the bed damaged in one way or another. The bedroom wasn\u2019t just a battleground for me; it was a killing field. I gloried in the spilled blood, the screams, the pain\u2014because those bitches gloried in inflicting pain, in spilling blood, in hearing men scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Luthvian said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Turning squeamish? I loathed everything Roxie was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a high-spirited aristo witch,\u201d Luthvian protested. \u201cMaybe she\u2019d become too obsessed with having you for a lover, but she\u2019s just\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnother Prythian.

I let her live. Let that be enough.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then the front door slammed.</p> <p>Knees shaking, Marian crept into the kitchen. Setting the jar of fruit on the counter, she glanced over and saw Lucivar in the archway, watching her.</p><p>\u201cYou have an opinion?\u201d he snarled. \u201cThen say it.\u201d</p><p>She said the only thing she could think of, the only thing that mattered. \u201cYou aren\u2019t vicious.\u201d</p><p>He just smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m a Warlord Prince, Lady. I was born vicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like that,\u201d she said, hating that her voice quivered. \u201cNot in bed.\u201d</p> <p>She held her ground as he moved toward her, came close enough to touch her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I was. That\u2019s the way I could be again.\u201d He shook his head as he raised his hand, his fingertips touching her hair. \u201cI want to be your lover. I chose to be your lover. That makes all the difference. Being in bed with you is like soaring on a sweet wind. I chose to be your lover, Marian . . . just as you chose to be mine.\u201d</p><p>She threw her arms around him and held on, warmed by his embrace when his arms circled her. She gave herself a few moments to enjoy being with him before she asked, \u201cIs this going to cause trouble between you and Luthvian?\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed her temple. \u201cThere\u2019s always trouble between me and Luthvian. This is just another piece.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not sure what to say to him. \u201cThere\u2019s steak pie for dinner. Merry brought it up a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t I open a bottle of wine and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He stiffened. When he stepped back from her, his eyes were hot with temper, on the borderline of wild. He bared his teeth and snarled softly.</p><p>Mother Night.</p><p>\u201cDid you think you could hide it from me? Did you think I would have let those men into our home, would have left you alone with them when you\u2019re vulnerable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t vulnerable,\u201d she protested. \u201cIt just started.\u201d And she hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d be able to catch the scent of moon\u2019s blood when there was barely a hint of it yet. Before he could start roaring, she spun around, opened a drawer, withdrew the six pieces of parchment she\u2019d prepared as a joke, and held them out. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>He took the pieces of parchment and looked at them, then frowned in puzzlement. \u201cA certificate for fussing? What\u2019s\u2014\u201d He read it through. His eyes still held the heat of temper when he looked at her, but his mouth was curving into that lazy, arrogant smile. \u201cThis entitles me to twenty minutes of fussing with no snarls or grumbles from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Marian said warily, wondering if she should mention it was intended as a joke. A fluttery feeling filled her stomach when his smile got lazier, more arrogant.</p><p>He handed back one piece of parchment and vanished the other five. \u201cI\u2019ll redeem this one now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? But\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-uh,\u201d he said, leading her over to a chair. \u201cNo snarls, no grumbles. Says so in your very own handwriting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth covered hers. When he finally stepped back, whatever she\u2019d been about to say didn\u2019t seem important anymore.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou should see your face. Such a grumpy little witch.\u201d</p><p>Well, she thought as she watched him put together their evening meal, at least she\u2019d given him something to laugh about.</p><p>Sitting alone at her kitchen table, Luthvian poured another glass of wine and continued brooding.</p><p>Roxie was a bitch and a thorn in everyone\u2019s side. She couldn\u2019t argue with Lucivar about that. But she was an educated bitch from a good family. An aristo family. Lucivar just refused to see that some leniency had to be given for the Blood who ruled society and, more often than not, made up the courts that ruled in every other way.</p><p>She\u2019d kept an eye on him since he\u2019d become the Warlord Prince of Ebon Rih. He was her son, after all. Just as she knew his father had been keeping a close eye on him. But his father . . .</p><p>Luthvian gulped wine. Poured more. Better not to think of his father.</p><p>The point was, Saetan wasn\u2019t doing a thing to encourage Lucivar to associate with Blood who were his social equals. He should have been escorting the daughter of another Warlord Prince to dinner or the theater, should have been attending dinner parties where the guests were among the elite. Instead, he was still stopping at a tavern for an ale or a meal. And who did he escort to the theater? His housekeeper.</p><p>He was becoming too attached to the hearth witch. Oh, Marian had been useful enough cooking his meals and washing his clothes. And there was no arguing that his temper had mellowed a little since she\u2019d started spreading her legs for him. But he wasn\u2019t treating her as a favorite servant or even a temporary lover. He was starting to treat her like a . . . wife.</p><p>And that wouldn\u2019t do. No matter what Saetan said, it simply would not do. She wasn\u2019t going to have some Purple Dusk witch from a nothing family dilute the SaDiablo-Yaslana bloodline. Marian didn\u2019t have the education, the culture, the background. She would never encourage Lucivar to move in the social circles he should simply because she would never be comfortable in those circles. He\u2019d never live up to his potential. His children would be less than they should be.</p><p>He needed exposure to women who wouldn\u2019t set his back up the way Roxie did. Oh, not that Roxie would have been acceptable. A Rihlander, a witch from one of the short-lived races, as Lucivar\u2019s wife? No. Not in a thousand lifetimes. But a dark-Jeweled Dhemlan witch from an aristo family? A woman like that would be perfect. Same coloring as an Eyrien but without those damned wings. The daughters from a union like that could become Priestesses, Healers, maybe even Black Widows. Maybe there would even be a Queen among them. And the sons would be something more than fighters, something more than arrogance and temper riding a cock.</p><p>Luthvian poured the last of the wine, studied the deep red color.</p><p>But Lucivar would never listen to her, would never yield to her wishes, would never even look at a different kind of woman while Marian was there making his favorite meals and keeping his cock sheathed.</p><p>Which meant she had to convince Marian it was in her own best interest to leave.</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re lovely.\u201d</p><p>Marian turned away from the bed of spring flowers, wary of the friendly tone in Luthvian\u2019s voice. \u201cLucivar isn\u2019t here right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Luthvian opened the gate and stepped into the garden, looking around as if she\u2019d never seen it before. \u201cI came to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Marian pressed her lips together, struggling for enough composure to offer hospitality. Luthvian\u2019s opinion of her, disapproval of her, always pulsed in the air. So this unexpected warmth in the Black Widow\u2019s demeanor made her uneasy.</p><p>\u201cYou do care about Lucivar, don\u2019t you?\u201d Luthvian asked, suddenly sounding anxious.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u201d\u2014love him\u2014\u201ccare for him very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do what\u2019s right for him, Marian. Do what\u2019s best for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Luthvian looked distraught. \u201cMay I have something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She led Luthvian to the side entrance and down the domestic corridor to the kitchen. She never thought twice about Jaenelle using this entrance, but as Luthvian\u2019s presence seemed to gain weight behind her, she wished she\u2019d gone around to the front door.</p><p>*Tassle?* Marian called. *Lady Luthvian is visiting.*</p><p>Sulkiness filled the link between them. *I will stay away.*</p><p>Luthvian wasn\u2019t fond of Tassle\u2014probably because he referred to her as \u201cYas\u2019s bitch.\u201d Which, from Tassle\u2019s point of view, was true. It still didn\u2019t make things easy when the two of them were in the same room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put a kettle on for tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Luthvian sank into a chair. She undid her cloak\u2019s fastenings but didn\u2019t take it off, a clear signal that she didn\u2019t intend to stay long.</p><p>Neither of them said anything until Marian brought the tea to the table. She watched Luthvian take a sip, then set the cup aside.</p><p>\u201cLucivar and I have our problems, but I only want what is best for my son,\u201d Luthvian said earnestly.</p><p>Marian nodded, not sure how to reply beyond that.</p><p>\u201cAnd even though I\u2019ve sometimes been harsh with you, I want what is best for you, too, Marian.\u201d Luthvian paused and pressed her lips together as if she were waging some deep internal battle. \u201cDon\u2019t you see what\u2019s happening? You\u2019ve made it too easy for him to play house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Marian\u2019s cup clattered in the saucer, slopping tea.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking care of all of his physical needs, so he\u2019s not making any effort to find a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think this is easy for me?\u201d Luthvian snapped. \u201cMother Night, woman, he comes from the SaDiablo family . They aren\u2019t going to accept anything less than an accomplished witch from an aristo family for Lucivar\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014They like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they like you! You cook his meals, clean his home, give him regular sex that makes him easier to deal with. Why shouldn\u2019t they like you? But like is a far cry from accepting you beyond your role as housekeeper and bedmate. They know you\u2019re only a temporary pleasure for him. So why shouldn\u2019t they be friendly? But that\u2019s all you are, Marian. That\u2019s all you can be. You don\u2019t have the education, the accomplishments, or the family connections that would make you an acceptable mate for a man who can trace his bloodlines to the High Lord and Andulvar Yaslana.\u201d</p><p>Luthvian raked a hand through her hair and looked at Marian sadly. \u201cEven if he asks you to marry him, you\u2019ll always be the outsider, never quite be one of them. You don\u2019t really comprehend the power that family wields. When they start discussing spells and magic that is so far beyond you they might as well be dancing on the moon, what are you going to offer? A new recipe for nutcakes? When they\u2019re entertaining Queens and their courts, are you going to sit in the corner with your knitting? Don\u2019t you want a home that\u2019s really your own? Children who won\u2019t be measured by their father\u2019s potential and be found wanting? And what about Lucivar? Are you going to use sex to chain him to a woman who is less than he deserves?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears thickened in Marian\u2019s throat. \u201cI\u2019m not chaining him with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let him go. Find a man who doesn\u2019t have obligations that you can never help him meet. Mother Night, Marian, I\u2019m begging you. Let my son go.\u201d Looking defeated, Luthvian fastened her cloak and pushed away from the table. \u201cIf you truly love him, do this for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think,\u201d Marian choked back the tears. \u201cI need to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen think,\u201d Luthvian said softly. \u201cBut if you wait too long, binding Lucivar to you will bring nothing but heartache.\u201d</p> <p>Marian couldn\u2019t move. Could barely breathe. When she heard Luthvian leave, she pushed the cups aside, pillowed her head in her arms, and wept.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>Standing on the mountain where he could look down at his home, Lucivar brushed a finger across the two marriage rings in the jeweler\u2019s box. Something was wrong with Marian, had been wrong since yesterday. But she wouldn\u2019t talk to him, was shutting him out. Even in bed last night, her response had been discouraging enough that he\u2019d given up after a few kisses.</p><p>A mood? The Darkness knew, females had them. But he felt her yearning toward him at the same time she tried to pull back. What did that mean?</p><p>Maybe that clash with Roxie had shaken her up more than he\u2019d thought. Or maybe, after such a public display of her commitment to him, she was wondering about the strength of his commitment to her.</p> <p>Only one way to find out.</p><p>Lucivar closed the ring box and vanished it. Then he spread his wings and glided down to the eyrie. As he went through the kitchen, he snatched a nutcake cooling on the metal racks, took a large bite, then paused and looked around. Were they having a party tonight that he\u2019d forgotten about? She seemed to be cooking enough to feed ten people to the stuffing point.</p><p>He winced. A husband should remember if that many people were coming to dinner. Then he cheered up. Maybe she\u2019d planned to invite some of the women from Riada to a female gathering\u2014a couple of hours to eat and chat about . . . whatever it was women talked about when they booted men out of the room. Since he was usually gone for at least part of the day, she wouldn\u2019t necessarily have mentioned it.</p><p>He winced again. He hoped she hadn\u2019t mentioned it. Even if it had nothing to do with him, he should have remembered.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why she was moody. Nerves, most likely, about hosting her first gathering\u2014which would make it clear to anyone who wasn\u2019t a fool that Marian was acknowledging her place as his Lady.</p><p>And what better way to celebrate a marriage announcement than with a party?</p> <p>Grinning, he stuffed the last of the nutcake into his mouth and went out to the garden.</p><p>The lift in his own mood suffered a blow when he saw her gently touch the petals of one of the spring flowers. She looked so sad, so lost.</p><p>\u201cMarian?\u201d</p><p>She jumped at the sound of his voice. \u201cOh. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>He watched her pale as he walked toward her. Something was wrong here, something that pricked at him in warning, but he couldn\u2019t sense the source.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her voice came out a tortured whisper.</p><p>He looked away for a moment. He\u2019d thought this would be easy, just a formal step to acknowledge what was already between them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you,\u201d he said, watching her eyes, trying to read what he saw in them. \u201cI want to make a life with you, have children with you if you want them, see the seasons turn with you. I want to marry you, want you to be my wife as well as my friend and lover. I want to be your husband.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and took a step back.</p><p>He felt the sharp edge of rejection slice his heart. \u201cWon\u2019t you at least consider it? We\u2019ve done well together these past months and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Marian turned away, her shoulders hunched as if he\u2019d delivered a hard, unexpected blow.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not what you need,\u201d she said, her voice filled with pain. \u201cI\u2019m just a Purple Dusk hearth witch with little formal education, no accomplishments that count for anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait just a damn minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I\u2019d just be an embarrassment to a man who is the High Lord\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>He took a step back, his head reeling. \u201cYou won\u2019t marry me because Saetan is my father? Hell\u2019s fire, woman. He adores you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head fiercely. \u201cI\u2019m not going to diminish the SaDiablo line. I care about you, Lucivar. I care so much. I\u2019ll be your lover as long as you want me, but I won\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p><p>He took another step back. Then he laughed bitterly. \u201cI\u2019m good enough to bed but not good enough to marry? I don\u2019t think so, witchling. Fine. You don\u2019t want to marry me, that\u2019s your choice. You want to stay and keep working as my housekeeper, that\u2019s fine, too. But you\u2019ll move your things back to your own room before I return. I\u2019m no one\u2019s toy, and without love, I\u2019m no one\u2019s bedwarmer.\u201d</p><p>He leaped over the flower beds, lightly touched down on the stone wall, then launched himself skyward toward clean air\u2014and away from a place that now filled him with pain.</p><p>\u201cLucivar,\u201d Marian whispered as she watched him slice the sky before he caught one of the Winds and disappeared.</p><p>What had she done? And why? She was doing it for him, wasn\u2019t she? Doing what was best. But . . . Her head felt stuffy, like it was full of cobwebs. So hard to think. But something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>He\u2019d been so hurt. He shouldn\u2019t have been hurt. Good enough to bed, but not good enough to marry? How could he think that? How terrible if he believed that. How could she leave while he was hurting so much?</p><p>She walked back into the eyrie and tried to settle herself with the familiar tasks of cooking and baking. She\u2019d wanted to be sure there was plenty for him to eat that he wouldn\u2019t have to fuss over while he was looking for a new housekeeper. Wanted to be sure he was cared for before she . . .</p><p>I love him. I don\u2019t want to go. Why do I have to go?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think properly. Something didn\u2019t feel right. But he hadn\u2019t demanded that she leave, so she had a little time to figure it out.</p><p>Luthvian stood on the edge of the flagstone courtyard, glad she\u2019d shrouded herself in a sight shield before climbing the steps from the landing place. Lucivar would have detected her if he hadn\u2019t been so off balance, but Marian never would.</p><p>The compulsion spell had worked, but not well enough. The little hearth bitch was fighting it. If she\u2019d been able to wrap the spell around Marian, everything would be done by now. But if Lucivar had sensed any kind of spell, he would have summoned his father to help him identify and break it, and Saetan . . . No, it wouldn\u2019t do to have Saetan become aware of that spell. So she\u2019d wrapped the compulsion spell around her own voice, and her words had stuck to Marian like warm tar.</p><p>But not enough. Caution had forced her to keep the spell light. Too light, it seemed. Because it was clear to her that Marian would try to remain as Lucivar\u2019s housekeeper, and if the hearth witch was still here when the spell wore off completely . . .</p><p>No. She wasn\u2019t going to have her son married to a hearth witch.</p><p>It might look suspicious to show up so soon after Lucivar\u2019s departure, so she\u2019d wait an hour and return to give the compulsion spell a little boost\u2014one that would get Marian out of the eyrie . . . and out of Lucivar\u2019s life.</p><p>Merry threw a shawl around her shoulders. \u201cBriggs, can you watch things for a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I can, but where are you going?\u201d</p><p>She saw the worry in her husband\u2019s eyes. He had reason to worry. They both did. Lucivar had never walked into their tavern at opening time to gulp down three double whiskeys before he stormed out again, his eyes full of fury and pain. The Prince of Ebon Rih needed help, and there were only two people she could think of who could give it to him right now.</p><p>\u201cI think Lady Angelline is staying at her cottage. I\u2019m going to try to find her.\u201d And if she couldn\u2019t find Jaenelle, she\u2019d go to the Keep. The Seneschal would know how to reach the Queen or the High Lord.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Merry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I will.\u201d But as she left the tavern, she glanced up at the mountain where Lucivar made his home\u2014and wondered what had happened there.</p><p>Lucivar strode into the room that had become Saetan\u2019s study at the Keep. Part of him wished he was still a child who could climb into his father\u2019s lap for comfort. He was too much of a warrior to ask for emotional comfort, so he settled for a fight that would let him vent the hurt inflicted by Marian\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI asked Marian to be my wife,\u201d Lucivar said. He saw Saetan tense and wondered if Marian had been right after all. Would his father have been opposed to the marriage?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem pleased about that,\u201d Saetan said in a neutral voice.</p><p>\u201cShe turned me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the High Lord\u2019s son.\u201d As soon as he said it, he realized he didn\u2019t want to fight after all\u2014at least, not with words. But as he turned away from the desk and headed for the door, his own pain pushed him into making one more reckless verbal jab. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have to worry about the SaDiablo bloodline being diminished by a witch who hasn\u2019t got the education or the accomplishments to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door slammed shut with a force that shook the room.</p><p>Lucivar spun around in time to see Saetan slowly rising from the chair behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cYou will not do this,\u201d Saetan snarled softly as he came around the desk. \u201cYou will not use me like this.\u201d</p><p>Wary now, his heart pounding because of what he saw in his father\u2019s eyes, Lucivar said, \u201cLike what? I\u2014\u201d</p><p>That deep voice became thunder. \u201cYou will not use me as a weapon against your own heart!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I didn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saetan slipped into the Hayllian language. Words poured out in a hot river. Lucivar didn\u2019t understand most of it, but he caught a few phrases here and there, as well as the name Peyton.</p><p>I lanced an old wound, Lucivar thought with regret as a rage and pain he couldn\u2019t begin to match flooded the room. I wouldn\u2019t have pushed at him if I\u2019d known I\u2019d open an old wound.</p><p>\u201cFather.\u201d No response. \u201cFather.\u201d</p><p>The words stopped, but the rage still vibrated through the room.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. I\u2019m sorry I said that.\u201d His own temper rose. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who used you as a weapon. And those excuses are nothing but shit.\u201d Since he couldn\u2019t get out of the room until Saetan let him go, he paced. \u201cJust shit. Like that \u2018I\u2019m just a hearth witch\u2019 crap she was spewing. I thought we\u2019d gotten past that. Guess I was wrong.\u201d Beaten, he stopped pacing. \u201cThe truth is, she doesn\u2019t want an Ebon-gray Warlord Prince as a husband. She\u2019s willing to bed one, but not marry one. That has nothing to do with me being your son . . . and everything to do with me, with who and what I am.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward the door. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Saetan asked too softly.</p><p>\u201cJust away from people. Out on the land.\u201d</p><p>The door opened. He fled the Keep\u2014and wondered what that blankness in Saetan\u2019s eyes meant.</p> <p>Marian scrambled out of the way as Luthvian pushed past her into the eyrie\u2019s front room.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t listen, would you?\u201d Luthvian growled. \u201cWouldn\u2019t heed the warning. Well, I hope you\u2019re satisfied, little witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what you asked,\u201d Marian cried. \u201cI told him I wouldn\u2019t marry him when he asked me this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you intend to stay here, don\u2019t you, pouring salt on the wound? Keeping just enough of a tie so there\u2019s no clean break that will heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She felt beaten, battered, unable to stand against the words.</p><p>\u201cYou stayed long enough for him to ask instead of resigning your position and getting out. So what happens to him now is on your head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone to fight the jhinkas. Gone alone to face a savage race that hates Eyriens. And he\u2019ll throw himself into that fight with your rejection ripping at him, keeping him unbalanced while he tries to survive odds that are against even someone with his unusual strength and skill. If he dies . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Marian cried. \u201cHe can\u2019t die. He can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything has a price,\u201d Luthvian said ruthlessly. \u201cIf he dies, that\u2019s the price for loving you!\u201d</p><p>Weeping, Marian sank to the floor.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Marian. Disappear. If he manages to survive, your presence will only be a torment to him.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar dying? Because of her? She should go to the Keep, find the High Lord. No. He\u2019d blame her for this. If Lucivar got hurt, he\u2019d blame her. And why shouldn\u2019t he? Who else was there to blame?</p><p>Luthvian was gone long before Marian was able to stagger to the kitchen and splash cold water on her face. She\u2019d pack. She\u2019d go away. She didn\u2019t want to be a torment to the man she loved.</p> <p>She looked around the kitchen.</p><p>But first she had to deal with all the food she\u2019d cooked. It would spoil if she left it out, and if he was wounded, he would need the meals she\u2019d\u2014</p><p>Tears spilled from her eyes, and her head ached from that cobwebby feeling that had almost gone away. Still, she went about the business of doing everything she could for him before she disappeared from his life.</p><p>As the afternoon waned, Saetan paced, trying to push the past out of his mind so that he could consider the present.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right here. Something didn\u2019t fit. And his son\u2019s heart was bleeding because of it.</p><p>He called in his cape. Whipped it around his shoulders as he strode out of the room.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right. And he was damn well going to find out what it was.</p><p>When the front door of the eyrie crashed open, Marian dropped the plate. There wasn\u2019t time to think of the mess or broken crockery before Saetan stormed into the kitchen. He came to an abrupt halt when he saw her, his eyes filled with brutal intensity.</p><p>\u201cTell me why,\u201d he said too softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d His power blazed in the room, making her feel cleaned out, hollow\u2014and, strangely, as if she was starting to regain her balance after an illness.</p><p>\u201cYou love him. He loves you. So tell me why you\u2019re turning away from that love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I love him!\u201d Marian cried. But the words didn\u2019t seem quite right anymore. \u201cI\u2019m not what he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what he needs,\u201d Saetan roared. \u201cA woman who loves him, who can accept him for who and what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good enough!\u201d</p><p>Saetan stared at her. \u201cThe only way you wouldn\u2019t be good enough is if you didn\u2019t love him enough. So maybe you\u2019re right after all, Marian. I thought you had more backbone and heart. My error.\u201d He took a step back. \u201cGood day, Lady.\u201d</p><p>It was the sneer in the way he said \u201cLady\u201d that snapped something inside her. And she heard Lucivar\u2019s words again: Don\u2019t let them win. ... If you give up your wings, what else will you give up because someone tells you you\u2019re just a hearth witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucivar,\u201d she whispered. Then, \u201cHigh Lord!\u201d She jumped over the broken plate and the spilled food and raced for the front door.</p><p>He paused on the threshold and turned to face her.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop him,\u201d Marian gasped. \u201cYou have to help him. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone to fight the jhinkas. He\u2019ll get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Saetan frowned, then turned away to look out the open door. \u201cIf he did, it didn\u2019t take him long. He\u2019s in Riada.\u201d He gave her a strange look, then held out his hand. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll take you to him.\u201d</p><p>She clasped his hand. It didn\u2019t matter what he thought of her. Nothing mattered as long as Lucivar was all right.</p><p>Lucivar strode down the main street of Riada, his temper on a choke chain, waiting to blaze. Being alone didn\u2019t comfort him, the land didn\u2019t comfort him. But being away had given him time to think.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right, and that \u201csomething\u201d was the battleground. He\u2019d almost missed that, had almost turned away. Not anymore. If Marian didn\u2019t want to marry him, he\u2019d have to accept it, but she\u2019d have to do better than spew those piss-ass excuses before he walked away.</p><p>But before he went back home to corner his hearth witch, he\u2019d coat his temper\u2014and his nerves\u2014with a couple more whiskeys.</p><p>As he approached The Tavern, Jaenelle and Merry burst out of the door. A moment later, Saetan dropped from the Winds and appeared in the street. With Marian.</p><p>She rushed toward him, then skidded to a stop. Her breathing hitched. Tears filled her eyes as she studied him from head to toe. Then her hands curled into fists, and when she opened her mouth . . .</p><p>\u201cYou stupid, idiotic . . . male.\u201d Marian blinked back the tears. He was all right. No wounds. Not even bruises. He was all right.</p><p>She was so glad to see him she wanted to wring his neck.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, sweetheart,\u201d Lucivar said in a very nasty tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cHow could you be so stupid?\u201d she yelled. \u201cHow could you go off and fight jhinkas by yourself? I don\u2019t want to be a widow before I have a chance to be a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a wife, remember?\u201d Lucivar snapped. \u201cYou made that quite clear this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was confused. My head was feeling all cobwebby, and I couldn\u2019t think.\u201d From the corner of her eye, she saw Jaenelle and Saetan snap to attention and study her with narrowed eyes. \u201cAnd before I could think straight, you were gone. How am I supposed to marry you if you go off and get yourself killed dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead is usually what happens when a person gets killed.\u201d Lucivar took a step toward her. \u201cAnd what do you care anyway? You don\u2019t want to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to marry you!\u201d She stamped her foot in frustration. \u201cIf there was a Priestess standing here, I\u2019d marry you right this minute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe offered to marry him,\u201d Merry said.</p><p>\u201cIn front of witnesses,\u201d Jaenelle added.</p><p>Lucivar pointed a finger at Marian and snarled, \u201cI accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he accepted,\u201d Merry said gleefully.</p><p>\u201cIn front of witnesses,\u201d Jaenelle added. \u201cHow soon can the Priestess get here?\u201d</p><p>A brief pause. \u201cShe says half an hour,\u201d Merry replied. \u201cShe needs to wash up a bit and change her clothes, then hitch up her pony cart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cart\u2019s already hitched,\u201d a man called out. \u201cI\u2019ll go and fetch her. That\u2019ll save some time.\u201d</p><p>Marian stared at Lucivar. Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. What had she just done? \u201cI should\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle grabbed one arm, and Merry grabbed the other.</p><p>\u201cNo time for that,\u201d Jaenelle said as they dragged Marian through the tavern to the back room.</p><p>\u201cYou can clean up in our place,\u201d Merry said, tugging Marian up the stairs to the suite of rooms she and Briggs called home. \u201cNo need to go back to the eyrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Marian stammered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll dash up to the eyrie,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cThat green dress will look lovely as a wedding dress. And I\u2019ll bring the amber necklace Lucivar gave you at Winsol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what we can do for a wedding supper,\u201d Merry said to Jaenelle. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have Briggs nip over to the baker\u2019s to see if there\u2019s a cake left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made lots of food today,\u201d Marian mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t that convenient?\u201d Jaenelle said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ll bring that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>A hand pressed against her cheek. She looked into Jaenelle\u2019s sapphire eyes. Dark, soft power rose up beneath her, flowed through her, washing away the last of that cobwebby feeling\u2014and the doubts along with it.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>She offered the Queen of Ebon Askavi the truth. \u201cWith everything I am.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle studied her for a moment. Then she smiled and said, \u201cWelcome to the family, little Sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome along now,\u201d Merry said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not ready by the time the Priestess arrives, your man will start chewing holes in my bar.\u201d</p><p>A tug from Merry and a push from Jaenelle got her headed toward the bedroom where she would prepare for her wedding. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucivar stood in the street, watching as people scurried in and out of shops, shouting suggestions to each other while they prepared a wedding feast.</p><p>Saetan strolled over to join him, a glint of amusement covering vicious anger. \u201cYou were right, boyo. She does get feisty when she\u2019s riled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to give her time to reconsider?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, no.\u201d Lucivar rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cBut where did she get the idea that I was going to go fight jhinkas?\u201d Cobwebby. She\u2019d said something about feeling cobwebby. He knew enough about the Black Widow\u2019s Craft\u2014sweet Darkness, he was related to enough of them\u2014that if she\u2019d said anything like that to him this morning, he would have rushed her to the Keep for help.</p><p>He looked into Saetan\u2019s eyes and knew what lay beneath the anger.</p><p>\u201cI told your mother that if she interfered again with what was between you and Marian, I would take her to the darkest corner of Hell and leave her there,\u201d Saetan said too softly.</p><p>For a moment, he couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t breathe. No idle threat. Saetan didn\u2019t make idle threats.</p><p>\u201cLet it go,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cI don\u2019t want blood spilled for my wedding.\u201d But I won\u2019t forget this, Luthvian. I will not forget.</p> <p>Saetan looked away and nodded. When he looked back, he smiled. \u201cAre you going to just stand there, or are you going to get dressed for your wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I going to have to wear that fancy outfit I acquired when Jaenelle established the Dark Court?\u201d Lucivar demanded.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThought so.\u201d</p><p>But he smiled as he raced through the sky toward home.</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p> <p>Saetan lingered by the open tavern door. The evening air was chilly this early in the spring, but it hadn\u2019t kept the party from spilling out into the street once the tavern\u2019s main room got too crowded. People danced in the tavern\u2014and they danced in the street. Ale and whiskey, brandy and wine flowed along with the laughter and high spirits.</p><p>He winked at Prothvar as the Eyrien Warlord slipped into the room. The sun hadn\u2019t set in time for Prothvar and Andulvar to make the wedding, and Mephis was still on his way here from the Hall, but the family would gather and celebrate tonight.</p><p>\u201cYou know, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jaenelle asked as she slipped her arm through his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it, witch-child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019m going to dance.\u201d</p><p>He watched her join the line of dancers, watched her say something to Merry that had them both laughing so hard they missed the first few steps of the dance. He hadn\u2019t been able to make those kinds of friendships, had stood too far apart from the people he ruled. Not by choice; simply because he was who and what he was. But Lucivar, with his hot temper and rough kindness, would have friends who cared about the man. And Marian, with that fire and strength of will beneath her quiet nature, would help him stay connected to the people he ruled.</p><p>\u201cHigh Lord?\u201d</p><p>He turned and found the Queen of Riada smiling hesitantly at him, her Consort beside her. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an invitation, but we\u2019d like to offer the Prince and his Lady our warmest regards.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled at them. \u201cIt\u2019s an open party. We\u2019d be pleased to have you join us.\u201d</p><p>He watched the Queen and her Consort thread their way through the crowd. He saw Jaenelle glance their way and smile. Aristo manners didn\u2019t stand a chance against his daughter. Before those two knew it, they\u2019d be dancing with shopkeepers and helping fill plates as if they did it every day.</p><p>Then he looked back at the door and saw her standing there, her eyes hot with suppressed anger. He\u2019d sent her a message as a courtesy because she was Lucivar\u2019s mother. He\u2019d deliberately sent it late as a kindness to his son\u2014and to Marian.</p><p>\u201cLuthvian.\u201d It was cold satisfaction to watch her anger change to fear as he walked up to her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Luthvian said. \u201cYou got your way after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a contest, Lady.\u201d At least, not for him. He stepped closer, lowered his voice until only she could hear. \u201cI warned you, Luthvian. The only reason you aren\u2019t on your way to Hell is because Lucivar asked me to let it go. I\u2019m going to honor that request\u2014as a wedding present. But if you ever use a spell on Marian again\u2014or try to cast one on Lucivar\u2014I\u2019ll break you. I\u2019ll strip you of your Jewels and your power, strip you down until you have nothing left but basic Craft. And it will be done so fast, no one will be able to stop me.\u201d</p><p>She paled but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Saetan said, fighting to keep his temper reined in. \u201cWill you join us in celebrating your son\u2019s wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to celebrate,\u201d she said roughly. Then she turned and walked away.</p><p>Lucivar shifted to block Marian\u2019s view. The dark ripples of anger from Saetan and Jaenelle were sufficient warning to tell him who had arrived. He turned slightly so he could watch the door. After what he suspected was a brief, and futile, pissing contest with Saetan, Luthvian walked away.</p><p>*She wouldn\u2019t stay?* he asked Saetan on an Ebon-gray spear thread.</p><p>*No, she wouldn\u2019t stay.*</p><p>*So be it.* It stung that she wouldn\u2019t make the effort to wish him happy, but he wasn\u2019t surprised. She\u2019d tried to drive Marian away, and she\u2019d failed. That would be a sharp little bone in her throat for a long time to come. And the sad truth was, although she was his mother, she wasn\u2019t family.</p><p>\u201cLucivar?\u201d</p><p>Before Marian had a chance to ask him what was wrong, a voice said, \u201cSo, Cousin. This is the Lady who captured your heart.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar grinned as Marian stared at the Red-Jeweled Eyrien Warlord standing before her. \u201cSweetheart, this is my cousin, Prothvar Yaslana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>Prothvar smiled. \u201cI\u2019m hoping my new cousin will honor me with a dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait your turn, puppy,\u201d another male voice said. \u201cThis dance is mine.\u201d</p><p>He felt her tense, saw her eyes go wide as she stared at the older Eyrien Warlord Prince. \u201cAnd this is my uncle Andulvar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Demon Prince,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her knees buckled. He grabbed her under the arms and hauled her back up. And he saw the hesitation, and a hint of sadness, in Andulvar\u2019s eyes as the older man started to step back.</p><p>\u201cThe Demon Prince asked me to dance,\u201d Marian said, still wobbling a little. She leaned against his chest and looked up at him. \u201cDo I look all right?\u201d</p><p>She looked beautiful. \u201cYou have a smudge on your nose.\u201d Adorable, as she scrubbed at the nonexistent smudge. She was still a little wobbly when she gave Andulvar a brilliant smile and held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s delightful, Cousin,\u201d Prothvar said as they watched Marian and Andulvar waltz.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d Lucivar replied. And she\u2019s mine.</p><p>Which is why he cut in on his uncle halfway through the dance. \u201cMine,\u201d he said, giving Andulvar a hard tap on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPossessive little puppy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Andulvar said, stepping aside.</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Lucivar replied as he swept his hearth witch into the dance.</p><p>\u201cThat was rude,\u201d Marian scolded.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>She huffed\u2014and struggled not to laugh.</p><p>He slowed the steps until they were doing little more than swaying in each other\u2019s arms. \u201cJaenelle suggested we spend a few days at her house in Scelt for a honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t want to inconven\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also said she would talk to the Queen of Sceval so that I could take you there to meet some of the unicorns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnicorns? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want. We can do anything you want. You can have anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Her words warmed every part of him. Warmed one part in particular.</p><p>He nibbled on her ear and whispered, \u201cAre you going to let me fuss over you tonight?\u201d</p><p>She pulled back. Her eyes danced with laughter as she bared her teeth and snarled at him.</p><p>His laughter filled the room. He scooped her up and spun her around. When he finally set her on her feet again, she clutched his jacket and swore at him.</p><p>He grinned at her as the people around them laughed and applauded. \u201cThat\u2019s my feisty hearth witch.\u201d</p><p>ZUULAMAN</p><p>A story from Saetan\u2019s past</p><p>1</p><p>Saetan set aside the latest letter from the Zuulaman ambassador, leaned back in the chair behind his blackwood desk, and rubbed his eyes. A half dozen meetings with the man and nothing had changed. The same complaints filled this letter as had filled the last three. He understood the concerns, even sympathized with them up to a point. But he wouldn\u2019t order Dhemlan merchants to buy coral and pearls exclusively from Zuulaman traders at a higher price than other Territories offered to sell sea gems of the same quality. He\u2019d already checked on the complaints that Dhemlan ships were encroaching on the fishing grounds that belonged to the Zuulaman Islands. Hayllian ships were certainly plying the same waters and competing for catches, but the Queens who ruled the fishing towns in Dhemlan were quick to penalize any boat that fished beyond the Territory\u2019s established waters\u2014just as they were quick to send the Warlord Princes who served them out to confiscate the catch of any boat that encroached on Dhemlan\u2019s fishing grounds.</p><p>Of course, he hadn\u2019t heard so much as a whisper of complaint about Hayll. Not yet, anyway. Sooner or later, the Zuulaman Queens would become less enamored with Hayll\u2019s Hundred Families\u2014the aristo families that heavily influenced the Hayllian courts if they didn\u2019t rule them outright. He might be Hayllian by birth, might have lived his early years in the slums of Draega, Hayll\u2019s capital, but, thank the Darkness, he\u2019d shed himself of that self-centered race centuries ago. For the most part. He had no interest in the Hundred Families, except to keep a watchful eye on their intrigues to be sure the people he ruled came to no harm because of them.</p><p>But that still left him with the problem of dealing with Zuulaman. He was certainly willing to sell them surplus grains, meat, and produce for a reasonable price that wouldn\u2019t beggar Zuulaman\u2019s people, but he wasn\u2019t willing to cut prices to the point that his own people suffered, especially when the islands still had enough arable land to feed their population, despite the fact that they made little effort to care for the land. Which was part of the problem. They overfished their waters, overplanted their farmland, pushed the islands\u2019 resources to the breaking point. Then the Zuulaman Queens complained that they couldn\u2019t sell their surplus, which rightly should have gone to feed their own people\u2014or they complained that they had no surplus, and the pottery and other art forms that were distinct to their people didn\u2019t sell at the prices they wanted. Which wasn\u2019t surprising. No one but aristos with surplus income, or debts enough to ruin their families, could afford the asking price for most of what Zuulaman tried to sell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still, as the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan, it was his responsibility to deal with the Queens who ruled the other Territories in Terreille, so he would meet with the Zuulaman ambassador once more and hope that, this time, there would be some glimmer of understanding in the man\u2019s eyes when he explained why the trade agreements the Zuulaman Queens wanted were not acceptable.</p><p>As he reached for the letter to review its contents again, the door of his study opened, and his wife, Hekatah, hurried into the room as quickly as a woman three weeks away from childbirth could move.</p><p>\u201cSaetan,\u201d Hekatah said as she lowered herself into the chair in front of his desk. \u201cI just had the most distressing news from home.\u201d</p><p>This is home. But he bit back the words since it was as useless to think them as it would be to say them. Hekatah was a Red-Jeweled Priestess from one of Hayll\u2019s Hundred Families, and she looked at the Territory of Dhemlan in much the same way that she looked at her family\u2019s country estates\u2014as something quaint and inferior . . . and valued only for what she could take from it.</p> <p>\u201cIs someone ill?\u201d he asked politely, although he knew the reason for her distress.</p><p>\u201cNo, but Mother says you refused to give my father and brothers a loan. I\u2019m sure she misunderstood something, because that accusation is utterly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Her gold eyes filled with tears, and her mouth moved into that sexy, sulky pout that had pulled at his loins when he\u2019d first met her and now always scraped against his temper.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hekatah, but I won\u2019t give your family another loan.\u201d He\u2019d informed her father of that fact a month ago. Since the bastard had delayed telling Hekatah, why couldn\u2019t he have waited a few more weeks until she had safely delivered the baby?</p><p>Her lips quivered. One tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cBut . . . why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they didn\u2019t honor the agreement they made with me when I gave them a loan last year.\u201d When her only response was a blank look, he swore silently and struggled to be patient. \u201cLast year, in order to save your family from financial and social ruin, I gave them almost two million gold marks to cover all of your father\u2019s and brothers\u2019 gambling debts. I paid close to a million gold marks to cover all the debts that were owed to all the merchants who would no longer allow anyone in your family to buy so much as a spool of thread or a handful of vegetables on account. And I also provided another million gold marks with the understanding that those funds would be put back into the estates so that the properties could be restored and once more provide an income. I made it clear that I required receipts to prove materials were being purchased for that purpose and that your father and brothers would receive no further financial help from me if they didn\u2019t fulfill their side of the bargain. I never received a receipt of any kind, and from what I can tell, absolutely nothing was done to benefit the estates and make them productive again. Since they squandered what they already received, that is the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they did do something foolish with the money,\u201d Hekatah conceded with real, or feigned, reluctance before adding quickly, \u201cbut I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t believe you really meant it about not giving them another loan.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince, the strongest male in the history of the Blood. I\u2019m the only male Black Widow in the history of the Blood. And I\u2019m the High Lord of Hell. Despite the fact that I still walk among the living, I rule the Realm of the Blood\u2019s dead. How could your family not believe I meant what I said?</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they believed me or not,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decision stands.\u201d</p> <p>She slapped the chair\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019re being unreasonable. The Dhemlan people didn\u2019t complain the last time you raised the tithes to cover the loans. They won\u2019t dare whine this time, either.\u201d</p><p>Speechless, he stared at her and wondered if there was any point in explaining how deeply she\u2019d just insulted him. Finally, he regained his balance sufficiently to reply. \u201cI didn\u2019t raise the tithes, Hekatah. That was a personal loan, from me to your family.\u201d</p><p>Now she stared at him. \u201cOur money? You used our money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why should the Dhemlan people have to pay for your family\u2019s financial imprudence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you took almost four million gold marks away from us?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI could afford it . . . once.\u201d And the timing for that last loan had pissed him off enough that he\u2019d played their manipulative game with so much finesse Hekatah\u2019s family had never realized he was playing. \u201cYou could always give them a portion of your quarterly income.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if that pittance would do much good,\u201d Hekatah replied, her eyes filled with resentment.</p><p>\u201cThirty thousand gold marks a quarter is hardly a pittance,\u201d Saetan said with cutting gentleness. \u201cEspecially when you don\u2019t have to maintain a household\u201d\u2014he saw the jolt of nerves, quickly suppressed, which confirmed what he\u2019d suspected\u2014\u201cand the only thing those funds have to cover are your personal expenses.\u201d He paused. \u201cOr, if you prefer, I can release the principal I put in trust for you as a wedding gift, from which you receive that quarterly income, and you can give your family as much of it as you choose.\u201d</p> <p>She said nothing. He hadn\u2019t expected her to.</p><p>She pushed herself out of the chair and stood before him, one hand resting on the large belly where his child moved inside her. It might have softened him enough to yield a little if he\u2019d truly believed that gesture was a protective one rather than a reminder that she had power over something he wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Hayll to offer my mother, and the rest of my family, whatever comfort I can,\u201d she said.</p><p>He choked back a protest, knowing she would use any concern he showed as a weapon against him. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s wise?\u201d he asked mildly. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be traveling so close to your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Hayll.\u201d</p><p>The challenge filled the space between them.</p><p>\u201cI would appreciate it if you would send a message back to let me know you arrived safely,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>Her shoulders slumped, her only acknowledgment that she had lost this battle of wills. Then she walked out of his study.</p><p>He waited there, his hands, tightly clasped, resting on the desk, while his mind, at times too facile for his own comfort, turned over nuggets of information and presented him with some unpalatable conclusions.</p><p>Last year, Hekatah\u2019s father had come to him for help in solving a \u201cminor financial difficulty\u201d shortly before Peyton\u2019s Birthright Ceremony, when the power a Blood child was born with was tested and confirmed, and the child received the Jewel that would be a visual warning of the depth of power that lived within that flesh as well as a reservoir for the power that wasn\u2019t used. It was also the time when paternity was formally acknowledged or denied. A man could sire a child, raise that child, love that child, but he had no rights to that child until the mother granted him paternal rights in a public ceremony that usually followed the Birthright Ceremony. It didn\u2019t matter if the child looked like the man in miniature, didn\u2019t matter if the woman had taken no lovers so there could be no question of who was the sire. If paternity was denied at that public ceremony, the man had no rights to the child. He could be cut out of the child\u2019s life in every possible way, becoming nothing more than the seed.</p><p>A public ceremony\u2014and a decision that was never overturned. In many ways, a man who wanted children was held hostage by his heart until that ceremony. After that, the child was his, no matter what happened between him and the mother.</p><p>He should have wondered why Hekatah had wanted to get pregnant so soon after they\u2019d married, should have wondered why she hadn\u2019t wanted a year or two just for the two of them to enjoy each other. But her true personality had already begun to crack the facade that had attracted him to her in the first place, so she couldn\u2019t afford to delay a pregnancy if she was going to keep the prize of a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince whose wealth rivaled any of Hayll\u2019s Hundred Families and who ruled a Territory without having to answer to any Queen. At least, not a flesh-and-blood Queen that she could see or understand. She hadn\u2019t recognized his deep commitment to Witch, to the living myth, dreams made flesh. He had served Cassandra, the last Witch to walk the Realms. He had made a promise to serve the next one, no matter how long he had to wait for her to appear. She was the Queen he served, and he ruled both Dhemlan Territories, the one in the Terreille and the one in Kaeleer, on her behalf.</p><p>Hekatah hadn\u2019t recognized his commitment, and he hadn\u2019t recognized that she\u2019d seen him as a way to fulfill her ambitions to become the most powerful Priestess in Terreille\u2014or, possibly, all the Realms.</p><p>How convenient that she\u2019d become pregnant with Peyton a few months before Mephis\u2019s Birthright Ceremony. How well-timed was her father\u2019s embarrassed admittance a year ago, when it was time for Peyton\u2019s Birthright Ceremony, that the family debts had become a difficulty. The bastard had mentioned too many times how distressed Hekatah was about the family\u2019s social status being tarnished by whining merchants who had so far forgotten their place that they\u2019d gone to the Queen of Draega to complain about a \u201cfew\u201d overdue bills.</p><p>He\u2019d made sympathetic murmurs, but he\u2019d understood the threat: If he didn\u2019t make some effort to reestablish her family financially, Hekatah might say something in haste when it came time to acknowledge Peyton as his son and grant him paternal rights to his child.</p><p>Hekatah\u2019s father and brothers were anxious to have their gambling debts paid off since those were to other aristos and the invitations to social engagements had declined as those debts had piled up. Instead, Saetan had paid up the accounts with all the merchants and presented her father with the receipts\u2014and had insisted that he was simply too caught up in the celebration of Peyton\u2019s Birthright Ceremony to deal with \u201cminor\u201d gambling debts. He\u2019d assured her father that those would be taken care of after the ceremonies.</p><p>While they realized he might refuse to pay the gambling debts if Hekatah said something in haste at the ceremony, it never occurred to anyone in her family that his timing in paying off the debts that concerned them the most was as manipulative as their timing in asking for financial help.</p><p>So his paternity of his younger son was granted, the debts were paid off . . . and he gave himself a few weeks to consider if, with his sons safely under his control, he wanted to remain married to a woman who expected absolute fidelity from her Warlord Prince husband while she indulged her taste for variety by having affairs with men from the minor branches of Hayll\u2019s aristo families.</p><p>He\u2019d almost accepted that his hopes for this marriage had been wishful thinking and the self-delusion of a lonely man who, while receiving plenty of bedroom invitations, had been craving love.</p><p>Then Hekatah had told him she was pregnant again. And, once again, a child\u2019s life held his heart hostage. He didn\u2019t blame her for the pregnancy. He wanted another child, had willingly stopped doing anything to prevent conception, and had let her decide when she was ready.</p><p>But the timing had just been a little too convenient to make him feel easy, just as this request for another loan coming so close to when Hekatah would be brought to childbed was a little too convenient.</p><p>He sighed. Hekatah would punish him for not agreeing to provide the loan by staying with her family instead of being with him right now, and Zuulaman . . .</p><p>He pushed away from the desk. Screw all of it. What was the point of being the most powerful male in Terreille and shouldering the responsibility for a land and its people if he couldn\u2019t indulge himself once in a while? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaving the study and moving through the massive structure he\u2019d built as a symbol of his power as well as a family home, he bounded up the stairs and headed for the family wing. He opened a door and his sons, Mephis and Peyton, the two joys of his marriage, rushed forward to greet him.</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d Peyton said. \u201cLook what we helped Daemon Carpenter make for us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou helped him, did you?\u201d Saetan said as he took a wooden ship from his younger son and gave it the careful inspection that was expected\u2014and wondered if he should offer Daemon Carpenter hazard pay for whatever \u201chelp\u201d had been given.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mephis said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t actually help him make the ships, but we did make the sails.\u201d</p> <p>Which explained the badly stitched canvas. But that was the difference between the two boys. Peyton tended to be fiery, dramatic, always leading with his heart, while Mephis thought things through as well as he could before acting, was a little less demonstrative, and more bitingly exact about details.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s helping,\u201d Peyton protested, scowling at his older brother. \u201cAre you going to read us a story?\u201d he asked, turning back to his father.</p><p>Saetan blew softly on the sail, using Craft to expand a puff of air into enough to fill the canvas. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he replied, handing the ship back to Peyton in order to inspect the one Mephis now held up for his approval.</p><p>Peyton\u2019s lower lip pushed out in a pout, but before he could start wheedling, Mephis gave him a hard elbow jab in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Saetan said slowly, \u201cas commander of the fleet\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow come you get to be commander?\u201d Peyton demanded. \u201cOw!\u201d That because Mephis\u2019s elbow caught him in the ribs again.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m bigger,\u201d Saetan replied. \u201cAs I was saying, as commander of the fleet, I think my stalwart captains should test their new ships on the Phantom Sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Peyton asked.</p><p>\u201cHe means the pond,\u201d Mephis said out of the corner of his mouth. \u201cNow, hush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous place, the Phantom Sea,\u201d Saetan said, his deep voice dropping into a croon while he continued to inspect Mephis\u2019s ship.</p><p>\u201cAre there whirlpools, Commander?\u201d Mephis asked.</p> <p>Peyton frowned at his brother, still young enough that he had to work to catch up.</p><p>\u201cYes, Captain Mephis,\u201d Saetan crooned. \u201cThere are the Wailing Whirlpools and the Murky Mists. Challenges for even the most courageous sailors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there sea dragons, too?\u201d Peyton asked, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cWhat would the Phantom Sea be without sea dragons?\u201d Saetan murmured.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d we get sea dragons in the pond?\u201d Peyton whispered to Mephis.</p><p>\u201cPapa\u2019s going to make them for us,\u201d Mephis whispered back.</p><p>\u201cOooh.\u201d Peyton looked up at Saetan, his gold eyes sparkling with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re ready, gentlemen,\u201d Saetan said, handing the ship back to Mephis.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I suppose you\u2019re going to end up muddy to the knees and smelling like pond water,\u201d a female voice said.</p><p>Saetan turned to face the woman now standing in the doorway. He had no complaints about Lady Broghann, the Purple Dusk-Jeweled witch who was the boys\u2019 governess and teacher, but he was feeling a little too raw to accept a challenge from anyone, especially a woman.</p><p>Then he saw the humor in her eyes that balanced the stern tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cI expect some mud will be inevitable,\u201d Saetan said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Peyton said, only to be elbowed again by Mephis.</p><p>Puppy is going to be black-and-blue before he figures out when to keep quiet, Saetan thought.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Lady Broghann said. \u201cDon\u2019t go drinking so much grog that you run aground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s grog?\u201d Peyton asked, starting to bounce with impatience.</p><p>\u201cYou would know if you had paid attention to the lesson about sailing,\u201d she replied.</p><p>While Peyton\u2019s face scrunched up in thought, Saetan turned away and coughed to clear the laughter from his throat.</p><p>Finally able to look suitably grim, he turned back to his captains. \u201cShall we go?\u201d Then he noticed the boys\u2019 appearance. The trousers were worn to the point of looking shabby, and there was a long tear on the left sleeve of Peyton\u2019s shirt\u2014neatly mended but still apparent. \u201cWhy are you wearing those clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the attire of adventurous sailors,\u201d Lady Broghann said.</p><p>Curious, Saetan studied her. \u201cAccording to . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother. I have three younger brothers.\u201d</p><p>And her younger brothers had a clever older sister.</p><p>\u201cAn unquestionable authority,\u201d Saetan said with a small bow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s grog taste like?\u201d Peyton asked, having circled back to something more interesting than clothes.</p><p>\u201cIt tastes like milk,\u201d Saetan replied.</p><p>\u201cSailors drink milk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort ones do.\u201d</p><p>While Peyton was working out why Mephis was snickering, Commander Saetan led captains Mephis and Peyton to the Phantom Sea, where they tested their ships against Murky Mists, Wailing Whirlpools . . . and sea dragons.</p><p>2</p><p>Hekatah stood at the window of her mother\u2019s private receiving room, rubbing her belly to soothe the whelp inside her while she stared at the back garden.</p><p>How much did Saetan know? Was the comment about not having to maintain a household simply a comment, or did he know about the little house she kept in Draega for the pretty toy-boys? It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t enjoy sex with Saetan. He was an exquisite lover. How could a man who had been Witch\u2019s Consort for years not be exquisite in bed? But he wasn\u2019t as much fun. She couldn\u2019t play with him the way she could the toy-boys. So why shouldn\u2019t she enjoy a romp with a male she could dominate? Besides, it wasn\u2019t like she was doing anything wrong. Fidelity and sexual exclusivity were required of the male in a marriage, not the female. Males served, after all.</p><p>But Warlord Princes were a law unto themselves, and a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince might not think the status of a wedding ring was sufficient reason to overlook his wife\u2019s lovers.</p><p>Her mother, Martella, entered the room, unhappiness and embarrassment rolling off her in waves.</p><p>\u201cWe had to go to a different butcher, so the Darkness only knows what the cook will set before us for the evening meal. And the bastard demanded payment before he\u2019d hand over the meat!\u201d Martella\u2019s mouth thinned to a petulant line. \u201cI had to return the pearl brooch I\u2019d bought last week in order to pay for the meat.\u201d She sighed as she joined Hekatah at the window. \u201cYour . . . husband . . . is being difficult about assisting the family, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he won\u2019t make another loan because the extra million gold marks he gave Father wasn\u2019t used for the estates as they\u2019d agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could it be?\u201d Martella cried. \u201cYour brothers wanted that new carriage and team of horses, and then there was that payment that the Queen demanded we make because that witch was broken when Caetor got a little too enthusiastic about enjoying himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she tell him she was virgin?\u201d Hekatah asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course she did. But she wasn\u2019t anyone important . Nothing would have come of it if her family hadn\u2019t gone to the Queen and made a formal accusation. And they said it was rape, insisting the girl hadn\u2019t agreed to have sex. The Queen gave your father and Caetor a choice: They could pay all the Healer\u2019s expenses and make a settlement as compensation for breaking the girl and stripping her of her Jeweled power, or Caetor could stand before a tribunal of Queens to determine if the accusation of rape was justified. The only reason she offered a choice was because the girl is a nobody and Caetor is from one of Hayll\u2019s Hundred Families.\u201d Bitterness filled Martella\u2019s voice. \u201cThe question wouldn\u2019t have come up at all if we still had the wealth we deserve. But I suppose we can\u2019t expect your husband to understand aristo concerns.\u201d</p><p>Hekatah felt the verbal slice. Her family\u2019s opinion of her marriage was divided. \u201cSaetan\u201d was a common name among the lower social classes. Hell\u2019s fire! Even one of the footmen who worked at the family\u2019s house here in Draega was named Saetan. And \u201cSaDiablo\u201d wasn\u2019t even a twig on a branch of any of the Hundred Families. She\u2019d searched when she\u2019d considered him as a mate. Her mother and aunts had searched. He seemed to have come out of nowhere when he built SaDiablo Hall in Dhemlan and made the bargain with the Dhemlan Queens in both Terreille and Kaeleer to protect their people and lands in exchange for being the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan\u2014the ruler of both Dhemlan Territories. Socially unacceptable, he was still a Black-Jeweled Hayllian Warlord Prince who had wealth and power\u2014two things she coveted. So she\u2019d studied him until she was certain how to approach her quarry. She\u2019d worked hard to dazzle him, to intrigue him, to convince him that the Jewels he wore and the power he wielded were insignificant compared to her feelings for the man.</p><p>But the wedding ring hadn\u2019t brought her what she\u2019d thought to get from the bargain. Despite what she\u2019d said, she\u2019d wanted to bend the strength of those Black Jewels to her will, had wanted him to wield all that dark power on her behalf. Instead, she\u2019d gotten the man. A man who followed the Blood\u2019s code of honor, even though he was powerful enough to do anything he wanted and no one could oppose him. Of course, no one really knew what he could do with the Black Jewels. Telling people he was the High Lord of Hell was a nice fillip for a reputation of temper that had never actually been seen. Not that she believed it for a moment. After all, she knew the man.</p><p>No, Saetan wasn\u2019t aristo. Would never be aristo. Would never appreciate the wants and needs of any of the Hundred Families.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still Zuulaman,\u201d Martella said. \u201cThe commission we\u2019ll receive from the new trade agreements with Dhemlan will help restore our status among the Hundred Families.\u201d</p><p>Hekatah rubbed her belly. She hadn\u2019t told her mother and aunts yet that Saetan was being stubborn about the new trade agreements. But Hayll was entitled to whatever Dhemlan could offer. After all, if Saetan hadn\u2019t made the bargain with the Dhemlan Queens, that Territory would have become the property of the Hundred Families. Since he had interfered, they would have to get what was owed them another way.</p><p>She smiled at her mother. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to give my husband more incentive to take the trade agreements with Zuulaman seriously.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>Saetan dropped the papers on his desk and stared at the Ambassador. \u201cIs this your Queen\u2019s idea of a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the trade agreement between Zuulaman and Dhemlan,\u201d the Ambassador replied calmly.</p><p>\u201cThis is shit, and you know it,\u201d Saetan snarled. \u201cZuulaman expects the Dhemlan Queens to hand over the surplus from all the harvests as well as a percentage of the livestock, pay a tithe on every product made by the Dhemlan people, and add a \u2018market\u2019 fee for anything that comes from other Territories that is not bought through a Zuulaman merchant. Have you all lost your minds? The Dhemlan Queens will never agree to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will if you insist upon it. You rule here. You are the law here. If you sign the agreement, they have to comply or suffer the consequences.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He felt himself sliding down into the abyss, sliding down to where his inner web rested at the depth of power signified by the Black Jewels\u2014the cold, glorious Black. At the same time, he knew he was rising to the killing edge, that state of mind that revealed a Warlord Prince for what he truly was\u2014a born killer, a natural predator. The effort to keep his temper leashed made his body quiver.</p><p>\u201cI made an agreement with the Queens of this Territory to protect their people and their land with everything that I am. Now you expect me to use that power as the whip that will force them to turn their people into chattel for Zuulaman\u2019s pleasure.\u201d Saetan shook his head. \u201cThere is nothing Zuulaman can offer that is worth this. You may tell your Queen, and the Queens who answer to her, that there will be no trade agreement with Dhemlan.\u201d</p><p>The Ambassador bowed his head. \u201cI will leave you to consider the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to consider.\u201d</p> <p>The Ambassador turned and walked to the study door. Then he paused. \u201cI should mention that your wife is now a guest of the Zuulaman Queens\u2014and will remain so until an agreement has been reached. The message I received also indicated that there was a miscalculation by the Dhemlan Healer as to Lady Hekatah\u2019s time. She may give birth any day now, if the birthing hasn\u2019t already begun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Saetan asked too softly.</p><p>The Ambassador smiled. \u201cYou are an honorable man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who . . . and what . . . I am?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>The Ambassador\u2019s smile faltered. \u201cHopefully, you are a man who realizes a small inconvenience to the Dhemlan people is worth less than the well-being of your wife and child.\u201d</p> <p>Saetan waited until the Zuulaman Ambassador had left the Hall before he sank into his chair behind the blackwood desk.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. What had possessed Hekatah to leave Hayll and go to Zuulaman? Why would she choose to travel so near her time? She\u2019d been aware of the difficulties he\u2019d been having with the Queens who ruled those islands. Had she gone thinking she\u2019d be an honored guest, that the Queens would try to sway her in the hopes that she, in turn, could sway him to agree to something that would be of no benefit to the people he ruled? Now she was a hostage\u2014and their unborn child with her.</p><p>So tempting to declare war on the Zuulaman Queens. He wouldn\u2019t need to gather the Dhemlan Warlord Princes to do it. He wouldn\u2019t need anyone or anything but himself to annihilate the Zuulaman courts. But Hekatah was so vulnerable right now, unable to use her own power until after the birthing. They would kill her the moment they felt his presence anywhere near their islands.</p><p>He had to find another way. There had to be another way.</p><p>They had issued the challenge, drawn the line. Did any of them realize that, by doing so, they had invited him to step onto a killing field?</p><p>Did any of them realize what would happen if he did?</p> <p>Andulvar Yaslana prowled the sitting room in Saetan\u2019s suite, too edgy and angry to remain still\u2014and a little uneasy about the way Saetan did remain quietly at the window, watching Mephis and Peyton play in the enclosed garden bounded by the walls of the family wing. Anger needed sound and motion, unless it ripened to the point where it had a killing edge and needed to be quenched on a killing field. That was his kind of anger. Eyrien anger. But Saetan\u2019s stillness had a different quality to it. Always had, even before he\u2019d made the Offering to the Darkness and came away from it wearing Black Jewels.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Andulvar asked.</p><p>\u201cWait to see what Zuulaman wants,\u201d Saetan replied quietly.</p><p>\u201cThey made it clear enough,\u201d Andulvar growled as he picked up the trade agreements and dropped them back down on the table.</p><p>Turning away from the window, Saetan walked over to the table and stared at the agreements. \u201cEither they really didn\u2019t think this through, or they intended something else all along and these agreements are just smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re holding your wife hostage,\u201d Andulvar pointed out. And as far as he was concerned, Zuulaman could keep Hekatah. Saetan was better off without the bitch.</p><p>\u201cMy wife is a Red-Jeweled Priestess from one of Hayll\u2019s Hundred Families,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cIf they lay a hand on her, they\u2019ll not only have me to deal with but Hayll as well. Zuulaman is enamored with Hayll, so they won\u2019t do anything that will make the Hayllian Queens turn on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still those agreements.\u201d</p> <p>Saetan reached out and pushed the papers with one finger. \u201cWhich aren\u2019t worth a damn thing. Say I sign them on the condition that the agreements are handed over to Zuulaman at the same time that the baby and Hekatah are returned to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Zuulaman gets what it wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a few hours. As soon as we were home, I\u2019d send a message to the Dhemlan Queens that I was stepping down as the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan, giving up my claim to this Territory.\u201d</p><p>The words hit Andulvar like a fist in the belly. \u201cYou\u2019d give up Dhemlan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything has a price. These agreements are only for Dhemlan Terreille. I\u2019d still have the Dhemlan Territory in Kaeleer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . this is what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>An odd look crept into Saetan\u2019s eyes, gone before Andulvar could put a name to it.</p><p>\u201cRuling this Territory was a price equal to the protection I offered,\u201d Saetan said softly. \u201cIt was a price worthy of what I am. But I don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>Andulvar rubbed the back of his neck. Damn politics. The Eyrien way was simpler\u2014a blade and a battlefield, not these sly games played with words.</p><p>\u201cSince the Dhemlan Queens didn\u2019t agree to this, the moment I step down, there are no trade agreements. Zuulaman gains nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t expect this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should. If they\u2019ve paid any attention to how I\u2019ve ruled this Territory since the Queens here made their bargain with me, they should. Which means they never expected me to sign the agreements, but the greed and audacity of asking for so much will make their real goal seem more reasonable.\u201d</p><p>Saetan smiled a gentle, brutal smile.</p><p>Andulvar suppressed a shudder.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m waiting for them to name the ransom that will buy back my wife and child,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cWill you pay it?\u201d</p><p>That odd look crept into Saetan\u2019s eyes again. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll pay it. And it will be the last thing Zuulaman ever gets from me that isn\u2019t paid for in blood.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>Hekatah watched the children on the beach, laughing and shouting as they played some incomprehensible game. Whelps from a pissant race that thought it was Hayll\u2019s equal, that it could ever be Hayll\u2019s equal. But Zuulaman had its uses. Through them, several of Hayll\u2019s Hundred Families, including her own, would have their wealth replenished as soon as . . .</p><p>The bastard hadn\u2019t signed the agreements yet. And he should have. He should have. As soon as he\u2019d been told she was being held, he should have abandoned the pretense of caring about the welfare of the Dhemlan people and signed the agreements. After all, she was his wife. She\u2019d given him children.</p><p>A door opened, and the wailing that had been muffled by stout wood stabbed at her.</p><p>\u201cThe baby is crying,\u201d her aunt said as she entered the room.</p><p>As if it was necessary to tell her that when she could hear him clearly enough. \u201cHe\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p><p>Hekatah turned to look at the woman. It had been sensible to bring another family member with her, but she regretted letting her mother talk her into bringing this one. Divorced because she was barren and her husband had wanted to sire children the Families would acknowledge socially, this aunt still craved having a child of her own and was always eager to help any woman in the family take care of a baby.</p><p>Weak fool. Children were a bargaining chip, tools to achieve a goal. But once you granted the sire paternal rights, you had to wait centuries before the child was old enough to be really useful again. Of course, the existence of Mephis and Peyton had held her marriage together, had continued to supply her with some kind of income because as long as she remained married to Saetan he would make financial provisions for her.</p><p>But not enough. She\u2019d expected to be the High Priestess of Dhemlan, with all the honor and rewards that came with being the leader of the Priestess caste. She should have been. If Saetan had balls for anything but the bed, he would have insisted that she be granted the title and the authority because she was his wife.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t anything in Dhemlan but his wife and a Red-Jeweled Priestess from Hayll, given the courtesy due her Jewels and caste but not accepted enough to hold some position of authority.</p><p>That would change. She\u2019d make sure of it.</p><p>\u201cThe baby is hungry,\u201d her aunt said again.</p><p>Who cared if the brat starved or not?</p><p>Saetan would. He\u2019d rather play with the boys than attend an important social function with her. Oh, he was always willing to escort her to functions, always presented her with the invitations that came from the Dhemlan courts and let her choose which ones she wanted to attend. But he preferred the boys\u2019 company to hers most of the time.</p><p>The bastard should have signed the agreements by now, but he valued his honor more than his wife.</p><p>He would have to be punished for that.</p><p>\u201cHekatah? Aren\u2019t you going to do something about the baby?\u201d</p><p>She stared at her aunt, but in her mind she pictured the man she had married.</p><p>The solution was so simple. The agreements would be signed in no time.</p><p>All she had to do was break Saetan\u2019s heart.</p><p>5</p><p>The Hall still trembled from the explosive slamming of the door. Still echoed with the sibilant whisper of Black shields locking into place around the massive structure. Usually, there was no sound made when a shield was formed or triggered. He\u2019d added that sibilance as a bit of flash and glitter, as a way to remind anyone who challenged him that he wasn\u2019t quite like them. Oh, he was Blood, yes, but not quite like them. Not since he\u2019d made the Offering to the Darkness and walked away wearing Jewels no man had ever worn in the history of the Blood. Or maybe he\u2019d never been quite like the rest of them, and that\u2019s why he wore the Black.</p><p>His hand wasn\u2019t steady as he held up the small, ornately carved box. He couldn\u2019t stop the tremors going through his body, a reaction to the shock. But his feelings were numbed by exquisitely brutal pain. He felt nothing except awareness that the pain had shoved him to the edge of a precipice. He knew the landscape beyond it. No trained Black Widow feared the misted, twisting roads so close to that edge. They learned how to stray over that border, walk those roads\u2014and come back. But he held on to the precipice and, by doing so, held on to the self-control that leashed everything he was.</p><p>\u201cDid they tell you what was in the box before they sent you here, Ambassador?\u201d Saetan asked. His voice, soft thunder, rolled through his study and over the man trying hard not to show fear.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the Ambassador said, licking dry lips. \u201cI was told to bring it to you immediately. That was all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you know what is in this box?\u201d</p><p>The Ambassador shook his head. \u201cI thought, judging from the size, it was a trinket of some kind, something your wife had worn to confirm she was a guest of the Zuulaman Queens. A ring, perhaps, or a pendant. Maybe a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinger,\u201d Saetan said too softly. \u201cA baby\u2019s finger.\u201d</p><p>The Ambassador stared at him, looking sick. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Saetan smiled\u2014and watched the Ambassador shudder. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to tell you the new agreement between Dhemlan and Zuulaman. My wife and child will be returned to me at once. If there is no further harm done to either of them, I will forget Zuulaman exists.\u201d</p><p>As the words sank in, the Ambassador shook off his fear. \u201cWhat kind of agreement is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA generous one,\u201d Saetan replied. \u201cHowever, if anything more is done to either of them, it will be considered a declaration of war.\u201d</p><p>The Ambassador gaped for a moment. \u201cYou think Dhemlan will go to war\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDhemlan will not go to war with Zuulaman.\u201d He paused. \u201cI will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand what I am. No one would do this who understood what I am.\u201d</p><p>The Ambassador closed his eyes. Once he\u2019d regained his composure, he looked at Saetan and shook his head. \u201cThe Queens will accept nothing less than the trade agreements. Your wife and child will remain on our islands until the agreements are signed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI serve, Prince SaDiablo. I can only give you the words that were given to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give my words back to them, Ambassador. And hope they appreciate what is at stake.\u201d</p> <p>As the Ambassador bowed and left the study, Saetan drew the shields back into the stones of the Hall and released the Black lock on the front door. He set the small box down on the blackwood desk and stared at his baby\u2019s finger. Blood sings to Blood. One touch was all he\u2019d needed to confirm that tiny finger was flesh of his flesh, blood of his blood.</p><p>The numbness that kept the pain at bay thinned, threatened to shatter. He held on to it, as he held on to the edge of sanity, ignoring the lure of the twisting, misted roads. It would be so easy to slip over the boundary into the madness the Blood called the Twisted Kingdom, especially when it beckoned to him, promising there would be no pain. Especially when he knew he wasn\u2019t able to step away from that edge right now and stand more firmly in the sane world.</p><p>With desperate care, he closed the lid on the box, poured himself a large brandy, and settled down to wait.</p><p>6</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be enough,\u201d Hekatah said to the Zuulaman Queens who had assembled in the sitting room she\u2019d been given. \u201cIt will upset him, shake him, but it won\u2019t be enough to make him yield and give us what we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been enough time for a message to come back from the Ambassador who\u2019s staying in that village near SaDiablo Hall,\u201d one of the Queens pointed out. \u201cWe can wait and see what\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe have to strike fast, have to strike hard before he has too much time to think. We have to\u2014\u201d Punish him for valuing his precious code of honor more than his wife. \u201c\u2014provide more incentive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest we do?\u201d another Queen asked.</p> <p>Hekatah smiled. \u201cSend the other box.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>Andulvar strode through the great hall to the door of Saetan\u2019s study. The whole damn place had a hushed quality of people having taken shelter in the hopes of surviving a violent storm.</p><p>And there was a storm coming. He could feel it building below the depth of his Ebon-gray Jewels. Hell\u2019s fire! He\u2019d been able to sense the edge of it from his eyrie in Askavi.</p><p>Which is why he\u2019d caught the Ebon-gray Wind and ridden to the Hall, arriving at the first breath of dawn. Something was pushing Saetan to the breaking point, and he didn\u2019t want to find out what might happen when a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince\u2019s control shattered.</p><p>Flinging open the study door, he walked into the room.</p><p>Saetan stood behind the blackwood desk, tears running down his face as he stared at an open box that sat in the center of the desk.</p><p>\u201cThey kept his head,\u201d Saetan whispered.</p><p>Andulvar moved forward. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was a warrior, bred and trained. An Eyrien Warlord Prince who had never hesitated to step onto a killing field. But he took one look at what was inside that box and stumbled back two steps. \u201cMother Night.\u201d</p><p>Saetan\u2019s hand shook as he reached into the box and gently brushed a finger over a little leg. \u201cWhat kind of people are they? What kind of people would do this to a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaetan ...\u201d Andulvar swallowed hard to keep his stomach down, then approached the desk.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think they were capable of this. Even after they sent one of his fingers, I didn\u2019t think they were capable of this.\u201d</p><p>They what?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Saetan whispered, brushing a finger over another piece. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they had no honor. I\u2019m sorry. So sorry.\u201d</p><p>When Saetan looked up, Andulvar saw a strong man about to break\u2014and wondered if Saetan was even aware of the rage growing beneath that grief.</p><p>\u201cAndulvar . . .\u201d Saetan\u2019s voice hitched. \u201cLook what they did to my baby. Look\u2014\u201d</p><p>Andulvar grabbed him, pulled him into arms that held on with the strength of a friend\u2019s love as Saetan shattered on the jagged stones of grief. \u201cHold on to me, Brother. Hold on.\u201d</p><p>As Saetan clung to him, sobbing harshly, Andulvar forced himself to look at the jumbled pieces that had been a baby.</p><p>You fools. The Darkness only knows what will come of what you\u2019ve done.</p><p>The sobbing finally stopped. Saetan stepped back, called in a handkerchief, wiped his face, and delicately blew his nose. His gold eyes were dulled by pain and grief.</p><p>Andulvar took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go up to your room to rest? I\u2019ll take care of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Saetan shook his head, vanished the handkerchief. \u201cHe\u2019s my son. I\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d After closing the lid on the box, he picked it up. \u201cWould you send a message to the Zuulaman Ambassador and tell him to meet me here in three hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Saetan swallowed hard. \u201cSign the damn agreements and get my wife back.\u201d</p><p>The world was full of soft shapes, gray shapes, meaningless shapes. He moved through it in silence as he walked out of the Hall and went to the tree. He often came to sit beneath it and read when he wanted some time alone. He often sat in its shade while keeping an eye on Mephis and Peyton when they played around the pond.</p><p>He sank to his knees, put the box down, and opened it.</p><p>No pain now. No feelings at all. Nothing but a terrible clarity. The mist had absorbed his grief, his rage. They were no longer inside him. Now, he was inside of them.</p><p>The baby was crying. Somewhere in the mist that turned the world into gray and ghostly shapes, the baby was crying.</p><p>He stripped off his shirt, laid it on the grass. Gently took the pieces out of the box and arranged them on the cloth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI tried to do what was right for the people I rule. Tried to keep the promises I made. I didn\u2019t know the price would be so high.\u201d Tears filled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know your brothers, you\u2019ll never sail a toy ship on the Ph-phantom Sea, but you won\u2019t be alone. You won\u2019t be forgotten. When I come here with them, I\u2019ll be here for you, too. That I promise you. For as long as I live, you will not be forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Carefully wrapping the shirt around the pieces, he used Craft to sink the bundle deep into the earth. When he was done, there was no mark on the ground to indicate the spot, no sign of a grave. It was as if his little son had never existed.</p><p>Except the baby kept crying.</p><p>He rose to his feet, vanished the box, and walked back to the Hall, empty of everything but a terrible clarity\u2014and a growing storm that was hidden in the mist.</p><p>8</p><p>Andulvar stood back from the desk where Saetan sat. There was nothing on the desk except the trade agreements, a quill, and a small bowl made of black marble.</p><p>The Zuulaman Ambassador stood in front of the desk, clearly unhappy about being in a room with Warlord Princes who wore the Ebon-gray and the Black.</p><p>Andulvar didn\u2019t give a damn if the Ambassador was happy or not. Saetan had asked him to stay for this meeting, so he would stay. Besides, the glazed, sleepy look in Saetan\u2019s eyes worried him.</p><p>\u201cYou won,\u201d Saetan said quietly. He pushed up his left shirt sleeve and nicked his wrist with a long, black-tinted nail. Blood spilled into the marble bowl.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d The Ambassador gave Andulvar a startled glance before focusing on Saetan. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Queens killed my son,\u201d Saetan said as he used Craft to heal the nick. \u201cThey butchered a baby barely out of the womb. These agreements were bought with blood, so they will be signed in blood.\u201d</p><p>In silence, Andulvar watched Saetan pick up the quill, dip it into the blood, and sign the agreements. When he set the quill down, the Ambassador stepped forward and reached for the parchments.</p><p>One black-tinted nail came down, pinning the sheets of parchment to the desk.</p><p>\u201cThe agreements have been signed,\u201d Saetan said too softly. \u201cYou\u2019re a witness to that fact. So is Prince Yaslana. When I receive a message from Lady Hekatah\u2019s father, and from the Lady herself, that she has been safely returned to her family\u2019s house in Draega, and is unharmed, I will bring these agreements to you. You\u2019re staying at the inn in Halaway, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the Ambassador said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think the Queens will agree . . .\u201d He looked into Saetan\u2019s eyes . . . and shivered. \u201cI will inform them that the agreements are signed. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear from Lady Hekatah very soon.\u201d</p><p>Saetan just smiled a gentle, terrible smile.</p><p>When the Ambassador left, Andulvar sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cBy nightfall, half the Queens in Dhemlan will hear about these agreements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Saetan\u2019s voice sounded queer and hollow, as if it were coming from far away. Then he roused, but the glazed, sleepy look was still in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like you to take Mephis and Peyton to Askavi. I need to know they\u2019re safe while I deal with Zuulaman.\u201d</p><p>Andulvar nodded, then studied the man who had been his closest friend for several centuries. \u201cWill you be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of things. I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d</p><p>As Andulvar went up to the family wing to collect the boys, he didn\u2019t know which worried him more\u2014the psychic storm he\u2019d felt growing when he\u2019d arrived that morning . . . or the fact that he couldn\u2019t sense any trace of it now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>9</p><p>Grief ripped into him, its jagged edges slicing his heart. He lost his precarious balance and tumbled through a landscape filled with knives and little arms that rose up from crevices in the stones like brown-skinned flowers. As he clung to a stone to keep from sliding further into the mist, the petals of one flower opened, became a tiny hand . . . with a missing finger.</p><p>A howl of rage and pain shook the landscape. Then silence.</p><p>Getting to his feet, he looked around. No landmarks he recognized, and he\u2019d set no markers as guides to take him back to the border of that place called sanity.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to find that place. It was quiet here, almost peaceful here, despite the flowers. But . . .</p><p>Mephis. Peyton.</p><p>He looked around again, saw two beacons shining above him. His markers. His anchors. Two reasons to go back.</p><p>But not yet. Here there was terrible clarity. Here there was quiet\u2014except for the sound of a baby crying.</p><p>Saetan read the two messages again, not sure what he was searching for but certain he hadn\u2019t found it.</p> <p>The message from Hekatah\u2019s father was a scrawled assurance that she\u2019d arrived in Draega, distressed but unharmed, and would remain there until everything was settled with Zuulaman\u2019s Queens.</p><p>A similar message from Hekatah, with additional reminders that he was responsible for her safety, that her continued safety, and the safety of their two sons, depended on his fulfilling the agreements he\u2019d made with Zuulaman.</p><p>As he read her message one last time, he knew what was missing. There was nothing about the baby. If she knew what had been done, there was no sign of grief. If she didn\u2019t know, there was no concern that she\u2019d been allowed to leave without the child. Not one word about the loss of their newborn son. Not. One. Word.</p><p>He dropped the messages back on the silver tray his butler had placed on his desk. Called in a long, soft black jacket, slipped it on, adjusted his shirt cuffs and collar. Then he picked up the agreements and left the Hall.</p><p>While the Ambassador carefully looked over the agreements, no doubt to confirm that nothing had been altered after they\u2019d been signed, Saetan looked around the room the man had called home for the past few weeks.</p><p>Two pieces of Zuulaman pottery were arranged on a table, along with a wooden flute and a book of the island\u2019s folk tales. He knew that\u2019s what the book contained because the Ambassador had given him a copy the first time the man had called to discuss the trade agreements. And on the wall was a framed, primitive sketch of a seashore.</p> <p>\u201cThis takes care of it,\u201d the Ambassador said. \u201cI believe this takes care of everything.\u201d</p><p>Not quite. The thought bloomed. Found the storm hidden in the mist. Echoed through that terrible clarity.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do to assist you in collecting the first shipment of goods . . .\u201d The Ambassador frowned. \u201cPrince SaDiablo?\u201d</p><p>No word of regret. No mention of the child whose blood had bought those sacks of grain, those casks of wine, whose death had sentenced the Dhemlan people to buying pottery and sketches they didn\u2019t want.</p><p>Rage flowed through him, a cold, sweet poison.</p><p>Saetan looked at the Ambassador and smiled. \u201cThere is one thing you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not available to anyone,\u201d Saetan said as he brushed past his butler.</p><p>\u201cWhat if the Dhemlan Queens\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Down, down, down until he came to the corridor deep beneath the Hall that led to his private study. Only Andulvar knew about this study, with the small bedroom and bathroom attached to it. A private place for the times when his Craft demanded such privacy.</p><p>He pressed a spot in the study wall. A piece swung back, revealing another short corridor. After stepping inside, he closed the hidden door, then created a ball of witchlight to provide illumination as he walked down the corridor and entered the workroom. Setting the witchlight in a bowl on the large wooden table, he stripped out of his jacket and tossed it aside.</p><p>The baby kept crying.</p><p>He opened Black-locked cupboards. Took out the tools no other man owned and placed them on the table. When everything was ready, he carefully unrolled a spindle of spider silk and attached the thread to the wooden frame he\u2019d placed in the center of the table.</p><p>The baby kept crying.</p><p>\u201cHush, little one,\u201d Saetan crooned. \u201cHush. Papa will take care of things. Papa will take care of everything.\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s not available?\u201d Andulvar growled.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen him since he returned from seeing the Ambassador yesterday,\u201d the butler replied.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think so.\u201d</p><p>Andulvar shifted his weight, opened his wings slightly.</p><p>The butler swallowed nervously. \u201cWe thought he\u2019d gone to the cellars to select a bottle of wine or some brandy, but when he didn\u2019t return, we looked for him.\u201d</p><p>And didn\u2019t find him. Which means I know where he\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cWhen he reappears, tell him I want to speak with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt once, Prince Yaslana.\u201d</p><p>Andulvar walked out of the Hall, cursing himself. He should have taken the boys to Askavi and come back here. Hell\u2019s fire, he should have taken them to Ebon Askavi and asked Draca and Geoffrey to look after them for a few days. They\u2019d be safe at the Keep. Nothing could touch them at the Keep.</p><p>He should have come back here. Saetan wasn\u2019t stable. Anyone looking at the man could tell he was too close to sliding into the Twisted Kingdom.</p><p>But only a fool would go down to that private study without some idea of what he might find there.</p><p>So I\u2019ll give him the day to lick his wounds in private. Then I\u2019ll be a fool.</p><p>He spread his wings and prepared to launch himself skyward and catch the Winds to go back to Askavi. Then he hesitated, looked at the drive that became the road into Halaway. He couldn\u2019t reach Saetan right now, but there was one other person who could tell him if anything else had happened yesterday.</p><p>He clenched his teeth as the Warlord who owned the inn hurried along the corridor ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen him since dinner yesterday,\u201d the Warlord said. \u201cSneers at every dish that\u2019s put before him, but he tucks into his food well enough. Here it is. This is his room.\u201d He rapped on the door, waited a moment, then called in a ring of keys, selected a key, and opened the door.</p><p>Andulvar went in first, all his senses alert to some sound, some motion, a psychic presence that would indicate someone was in the room.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d the Warlord said.</p><p>Bristling, Andulvar turned slowly, his hand itching to call in his Eyrien war blade. But the Warlord wasn\u2019t looking at him.</p><p>\u201cHe cleared out,\u201d the man said. \u201cThe bastard just cleared out without paying his bill.\u201d</p><p>Andulvar studied the room, noted the books on the bedside table, the clothes still hanging in the open wardrobe. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourse I\u2019m sure!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis things are still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the things he brought from Zuulaman.\u201d The Warlord picked up the books, then set them back down before going to the wardrobe and riffling through the clothes. \u201cHe bought these clothes here in Dhemlan. Those books, too. My brother was in the bookshop the same day and saw the Ambassador buy them. But all the things he brought with him from Zuulaman are gone. Those bits of pottery and a book. There was a sketch on the wall, too. And the clothes.\u201d</p><p>A chill went down Andulvar\u2019s spine. There was no reason for the Ambassador to remain in Halaway now that the agreements were signed. No reason at all. And yet . . .</p><p>\u201cGuess he didn\u2019t think the things that came from Dhemlan were worth enough to take back with him,\u201d the Warlord said with a trace of bitterness.</p><p>Andulvar left without saying another word to the innkeeper and flew back to the Hall. As he landed and started to walk toward the front door, three Warlord Princes dropped from the Winds and appeared on the landing web that was circled by the drive. Opal, Sapphire, Red. Even together, they couldn\u2019t challenge Ebon-gray and hope to survive, but it would be a vicious fight. He shifted, deliberately placing himself between them and the Hall\u2019s front door.</p><p>\u201cWe need to see Prince SaDiablo,\u201d the Red-Jeweled Warlord Prince said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not available,\u201d Andulvar replied.</p><p>The Sapphire swore quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe need to see him,\u201d the Red insisted. \u201cWe\u2019re here on our Queens\u2019 behalves to report some odd thefts that occurred last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of thefts?\u201d Andulvar asked, feeling icy claws wrap around his spine.</p><p>\u201cReports came in from several Provinces in Dhemlan as well as Amdarh,\u201d the Sapphire said. \u201cItems were stolen sometime during the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of items?\u201d</p><p>The Red\u2019s smile had a bite but no humor. \u201cIf it came from Zuulaman, it\u2019s gone. There\u2019s no sign that anyone broke in to those homes and nothing else was taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just people\u2019s homes,\u201d the Sapphire said. \u201cMerchants reported that anything they\u2019d acquired from Zuulaman to sell is gone. Books, pictures, pottery. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Queens are wondering if some kind of spell had been woven into the items so that they\u2019d vanish after a certain amount of time,\u201d the Red added. \u201cThey\u2019re wondering if we\u2019re going to end up buying the same books and bits of crockery over and over again.\u201d</p><p>Which confirmed that the Ambassador had made sure at least some of Dhemlan\u2019s Queens were aware of the trade agreements before he disappeared.</p><p>They waited now, watching him.</p><p>An ember of dread kindled in his belly, but he didn\u2019t let them see it. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him.\u201d</p><p>He watched them walk back to the landing web. Waited until they\u2019d caught the Winds to go back to their Queens. He looked up at the sky, judged the daylight. Still enough time before twilight, even though he\u2019d be heading east.</p><p>He strode to the landing web, caught the Ebon-gray Wind, and headed for Zuulaman.</p><p>11</p><p>The baby stopped crying.</p><p>Saetan took a deep breath. Let it out slowly. His body ached right down to the bone. As he raised his right hand to brush back his hair, he noticed the ring. The Black Jewel looked dull. When had he drained it? And why? He brushed fingers over the Black Jewel that hung from a gold chain around his neck. That one, too, was drained. Only a few drops of power remained, just enough to keep the Jewel from shattering. He must have drained it. He was the only one who could drain it. But . . . why? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His vision kept going in and out of focus. One moment he could see clearly, the next the room looked muzzy and gray.</p><p>Food. Water. Sleep. He needed all of those things.</p><p>Slipping off the stool, he moved stiffly through corridors, swore quietly as aching legs climbed stairs. Dimly he realized his body was moving through the Hall up to his suite. Dimly he heard his voice, hoarse and strained, give orders to have food, water, and wine brought to his room. Dimly he was aware of stripping out of his clothes and stepping into the shower\u2014a new variation of the Eyrien outdoor water tanks warriors used to clean themselves after a battle\u2014and letting hot water pound against his skin while he braced himself against a wall.</p><p>Still lost in the mental twilight, he was also aware that he had climbed twisted roads within his own mind and now stood on one side of a familiar border. Still on the misted side of that border, where it was quiet. He wasn\u2019t ready to cross that line back to sanity. Not yet.</p> <p>Food. Water. He consumed both, then realized he had no memory of getting out of the shower or putting on the long, warm robe that now wrapped his body. Didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>He held on long enough to climb into bed, even though the sun was still shining. He held on long enough to put a Red shield around the bed. Not as much protection as a Black shield, but it would do.</p><p>Then he surrendered to the sleep he needed before he could step across the border and leave the Twisted Kingdom.</p><p>12</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire! He should have reached the islands by now, should have sensed one of the landing beacons at the very least.</p> <p>Dropping from the Ebon-gray Wind, Andulvar spread his wings and glided over the ocean. After a minute, he flew higher, swearing silently. Even if he\u2019d misjudged and taken the wrong threads when he\u2019d switched from radial to tether lines and back again, he couldn\u2019t be that far off. He knew where the islands were.</p><p>He went higher, then flew in a wide circle, searching. Searching. Six large islands and twice that many smaller ones. He should be able to see something.</p><p>He spiraled toward the water, calling himself a fool even while he did it. What did he think he\u2019d see closer to the ocean that he wouldn\u2019t see higher up?</p><p>But he did see something. A bit of green floating on the swells. He glided toward it. Dipped down to snatch it.</p><p>The ember of dread that had settled in his belly kindled. His heart pounded as he exploded upward, away from the water, away from . . . What?</p><p>He circled back. Breathing hard and sweating, he hovered above the green.</p> <p>Just a piece of a palm tree. Nothing to fear.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t make himself get closer to it. Couldn\u2019t think about touching it.</p><p>He stared at it, floating on swells. He stared at the ocean. The big, empty ocean.</p><p>\u201cSaetan,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSaetan, what have you done?\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he\u2019s gone?\u201d Hekatah said, wincing a little as she surged to her feet. \u201cThere are still settlements to discuss, arrangements to be made for our share of the profit from the first Dhemlan shipment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d her mother snapped. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you the Zuulaman Ambassador is gone. The servants at the town house he keeps here don\u2019t know when he left or when he\u2019ll be back. But he took all his Zuulaman bric-a-brac with him.\u201d Her mouth thinned to a hostile line. \u201cAre you sure your husband signed the trade agreements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Hekatah\u2019s hands curled into fists. The Zuulaman Queens wouldn\u2019t dare try to cheat her and her family out of what was owed them. They wouldn\u2019t dare. \u201cSend someone to Zuulaman. Find out what the Queens know about the Ambassador\u2019s sudden departure.\u201d</p> <p>14</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I have to show you,\u201d Geoffrey said, turning toward one of the archways that led to the stacks of books that were kept separate from the rest of the Keep\u2019s huge library.</p><p>Andulvar growled. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake time.\u201d</p><p>He studied the man. Geoffrey had been the Keep\u2019s historian and librarian since long before Andulvar had been born. He was a Guardian, one of the living dead. He was also the last of his race\u2014a race he never mentioned by name, never talked about. There was nothing that could touch a man like Geoffrey when he was inside the Keep. Nothing a man like him should fear inside the walls of Ebon Askavi.</p><p>But it was fear Andulvar heard underneath the temper in Geoffrey\u2019s voice. So he followed the Guardian through the archway and between the shelves of books until Geoffrey finally stopped walking and pointed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>Andulvar shrugged. \u201cEmpty shelves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Geoffrey said. \u201cEmpty shelves. Yesterday, those shelves held examples of Zuulaman\u2019s literature. Stories, poems, novels. Those shelves also held examples of pottery, held copies of songs as well as a flute and drum. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to someone from Zuulaman,\u201d Andulvar said, deciding against telling Geoffrey about the other stolen items that had come from Zuulaman\u2014at least until his own business at the Keep was concluded. \u201cCan you check the Registers and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any Registers.\u201d</p><p>Andulvar swore. \u201cThere have to be. These people are Blood. Some of them have to be in the Registers. Even if they didn\u2019t officially register as they should, you would have made some notation about the Blood who wear darker Jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday, there were Registers for Zuulaman,\u201d Geoffrey said. \u201cNow they\u2019re gone. As if they had never existed.\u201d</p><p>Beads of sweat broke out on Andulvar\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to Draca.\u201d</p><p>Geoffrey nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Retracing his steps, Andulvar returned to the room that held a large blackwood table where scholars and other Blood could sit and read the books Geoffrey didn\u2019t permit to leave this part of the library.</p><p>The Keep\u2019s Seneschal was ancient . . . and didn\u2019t look quite human. She\u2019d unnerved him the first time he\u2019d met her when he came to the Keep as one of Cassandra\u2019s First Circle Escorts. She still unnerved him.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to one of the Zuulaman Blood,\u201d Andulvar said.</p><p>\u201cThey are gone,\u201d Draca replied.</p><p>\u201cFrom Terreille, yes. But there must be some who are demon-dead. You could arrange this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are gone,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThe Dark Realm wass purged of Zuulaman Blood.\u201d</p><p>Andulvar grabbed one of the chairs that surrounded the table to keep himself upright. \u201cYou purged Hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Prince of the Darknesss. The High Lord of Hell.\u201d Draca stared at him. \u201cGrief wass the hammer they ussed to break hiss control. Rage wass the forge in which he sshaped hiss power into a weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s no one left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one left,\u201d Geoffrey agreed. He looked at Draca. \u201cIf Saetan did what we think he did, there isn\u2019t a shard of pottery, a scrap of cloth, or a line from a poem, story, or song left that came from the Zuulaman people. There isn\u2019t any trace of them in any of the Realms.\u201d</p><p>Including the islands they came from, Andulvar thought, feeling sick.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if they never existed,\u201d Geoffrey said.</p><p>Draca took a step toward Andulvar. \u201cSsaetan iss the ssame man today ass he wass a year ago, the ssame ass he hass been ssince he made the Offering to the Darknesss and wass gifted with the Black Jewelss. He iss the ssame man who hass been your friend for many yearss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now I know what he\u2019s capable of doing if he\u2019s pushed too hard or too far,\u201d Andulvar said, shuddering.</p><p>\u201cYess,\u201d Draca replied gently. \u201cNow you know.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>The next morning, Andulvar walked into the informal receiving room at the same moment Saetan began descending the stairway that led to the family wing. They stopped at the same time and studied each other.</p><p>Andulvar felt a chill twist up his spine as he looked into Saetan\u2019s glazed, gold eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe boys?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine. I\u2019ll bring them back later today. I came now to see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d To see if you\u2019re sane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Frowning, Saetan descended the rest of the stairs. He wasn\u2019t moving with his usual grace, and the hand that clutched the banister trembled. \u201cHave I been ill?\u201d</p><p>The glazed look gave way to puzzlement.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Andulvar asked, not quite sure how to answer the question.</p><p>\u201cHollowed out,\u201d Saetan replied, rubbing his forehead. \u201cLike I\u2019ve had a fever. Thoughts keep swimming through my head, but I can\u2019t put them together in a way that makes sense. Andulvar . . .\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t see a Warlord Prince capable of destroying an entire race of people. He saw the man who had been his friend for centuries. He saw a man who was exhausted, a man so heartsick it was a kind of illness.</p><p>He held out his hand, certain that if Saetan accepted that hand, he would get his friend back. Saetan would regain his emotional balance, and the leash he used to protect the rest of the Blood from the full violence of what he was would be restored.</p><p>Then Hekatah burst into the room. The hand reaching for his fell away. The gold eyes glazed again, and in their depths swam something Andulvar had never seen before.</p><p>This is why the demon-dead call him the High Lord, Andulvar thought in despair. This is why they fear him enough that he can rule the Dark Realm even though he\u2019s still among the living. It\u2019s too late. There\u2019s no going back. For any of us.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Hekatah screamed as she rushed toward Saetan.</p><p>Andulvar grabbed her arm, hauling her back out of reach. Not because he cared about her, but because he was afraid of what would happen if Saetan responded now.</p><p>\u201cDarling Hekatah,\u201d Saetan crooned.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she screamed again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI took care of things,\u201d he replied too softly. \u201cI took care of everything.\u201d He turned and walked up the stairs. When he was halfway up, he stopped and looked back at her. \u201cIf you want other lovers, you don\u2019t want me as a husband. I\u2019ve tolerated that game for the last time, Priestess. If it happens again, we\u2019ll be divorced before you have time to leave your lover\u2019s bed. As for him . . .\u201d He smiled a brutal, gentle smile. \u201cI\u2019ll take him to Hell. Your name will be the last thing he screams while the Hounds tear him apart.\u201d</p><p>Hekatah stared up at him. Then she made a dismissive gesture. \u201cWhat did you do to Zuulaman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZuulaman? That\u2019s a word without meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a place, as you very well know.\u201d</p> <p>Saetan shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d He walked up the stairs and disappeared down the corridor toward his suite.</p><p>Since Saetan was no longer available, Hekatah rounded on Andulvar. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d she demanded. \u201cDid he put some kind of shield around the islands so no one can find them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone, Hekatah,\u201d Andulvar said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe sent messengers to find out why the Ambassador left so suddenly but they couldn\u2019t find\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe islands are gone.\u201d Hell\u2019s fire! How many times would he have to say it before the bitch finally heard him?</p> <p>Hekatah frowned at him. \u201cWhat do you mean they\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe islands don\u2019t exist anymore. The Zuulaman people don\u2019t exist anymore. Everything that ever came from them doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cNot possible. You can\u2019t destroy everything about a people that fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. But the Prince of the Darkness? The High Lord of Hell? He can. Oh, yes, Hekatah. He can.\u201d</p><p>She kept shaking her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe that story about him ruling the Dark Realm. A living man can\u2019t rule the demon-dead, can\u2019t control them.\u201d</p><p>Andulvar released her arm and stepped back. \u201cYou believe what you choose. But when they butchered his son and sent the pieces to him, Zuulaman broke the chain he\u2019d forged to keep the rest of us safe from what he is. I know what he is. So I know he\u2019s the High Lord of Hell.\u201d</p> <p>Fear slowly filled her eyes. She staggered back a step. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here. He\u2019s angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still riding the killing edge,\u201d Andulvar said. \u201cThere\u2019s no room in him yet for something as small as anger. Not when the rage only needs a spark to rekindle and look for another killing field.\u201d</p><p>She shrank away from him.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to Hayll and spend a few more days with your family? Right now, there\u2019s nothing you can do to help him.\u201d</p><p>As she glanced up the stairs, her face turned a sickly gray. \u201cYes. I need\u2014I don\u2019t feel well.\u201d</p><p>He watched her stumble out of the room. Then he went to the window and pulled back the curtains enough to watch her run to the Coach that was still waiting for her.</p><p>Stupid aristo bitch. He wondered if Saetan had sensed the Coach and realized Hekatah hadn\u2019t intended to stay. He wondered if Saetan cared. At least she was gone for a few more days and wouldn\u2019t stir things up.</p><p>I can\u2019t help you, SaDiablo, Andulvar thought as he let the curtain fall back into place. She shattered the moment when I might have made a difference. But I can give you two reasons to step away from the killing edge . . . and come all the way back from the Twisted Kingdom.</p> <p>16</p><p>As he stared at the charred, broken remains of a tangled web, Saetan felt Andulvar\u2019s wary presence as the Eyrien entered the short corridor that led to this hidden workroom.</p><p>\u201cThe boys?\u201d he asked when Andulvar stepped into the room.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs in their playroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby kept crying,\u201d Saetan said softly, keeping his eyes focused on the web. \u201cScreams of pain. Shrieks of terror. He kept crying. When I made the pain go away, the terror go away . . . When the reason for those things ceased to exist, he stopped crying.\u201d He closed his eyes. He still felt hollowed out, knew he was still too close to the border of the Twisted Kingdom. But he had to ask. \u201cThey don\u2019t exist, do they? Zuulaman doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Andulvar said. \u201cThey don\u2019t exist anymore. Everything they were is gone.\u201d</p><p>He felt the weight of what he had done settle on his shoulders and knew he would feel that burden for the rest of his life. He was a strong man. He would carry that weight. But nothing would be the same because of it. He would never be the same because of it.</p><p>He turned and looked at Andulvar, noting how the Eyrien tensed and had to fight to keep from taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of me, Andulvar?\u201d</p><p>A long pause. \u201cYes. I\u2019m afraid of you.\u201d Another pause. \u201cI\u2019m still your friend. We\u2019ve been friends too long for it to be otherwise. But what happened to Zuulaman has changed things. I need . . . some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Saetan forced his lips to curve into a smile. \u201cPrince Yaslana.\u201d</p><p>Andulvar didn\u2019t try to return the smile. \u201cHigh Lord.\u201d</p><p>Saetan listened to Andulvar\u2019s retreating footsteps before he turned back to study the web.</p><p>Yes, they\u2019d been friends too long to break completely. Centuries ago, they\u2019d first met in a court, two Red-Jeweled Warlord Princes who came from cultures that had nothing in common. Despite that, or because of it, they had become friends. It wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d parted on uneasy terms. It wouldn\u2019t be the last. But this time, it was different.</p><p>Are you afraid of me, Andulvar?</p><p>Yes. I\u2019m afraid of you.</p><p>\u201cSo am I, my friend,\u201d Saetan whispered. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, after cleaning the workroom, locking away the tools of the Black Widows\u2019 Craft, and scrubbing himself while he silently wept, he opened the door to the playroom.</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d</p><p>Mephis and Peyton rushed toward him, then skidded to a stop. His heart broke when they hesitated to come near him.</p><p>Then Mephis said, \u201cYou should sit down.\u201d</p><p>Since his legs were shaking, that sounded like a good idea. Moving carefully, he made his way to the large stuffed chair near the hearth. As soon as he was settled, Peyton climbed into his lap. Mephis, always more cautious, leaned against the side of the chair, then brushed a hand against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWere you sick?\u201d Mephis asked.</p><p>\u201cI . . . wasn\u2019t well,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cWas that why Uncle Andulvar took us to stay with him?\u201d Peyton asked.</p><p>Wondering how long it would be before he and Andulvar sat at a table together to talk and argue as they\u2019d done for so many years, he swallowed the lump in his throat and nodded. \u201cYes, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you better now?\u201d Mephis asked.</p><p>He reached up and curled his fingers around his son\u2019s hand. \u201cYes, I\u2019m better now.\u201d</p><p>Mephis\u2019s hand tightened to hold on to his, surprising him.</p><p>They had been the beacons he\u2019d followed to find his way out of the Twisted Kingdom. He hadn\u2019t wanted to leave. There had been peace there after the baby stopped crying. There had been an absence of pain he knew he wouldn\u2019t find in the sane world. But he\u2019d made the journey back because he needed to be with them, needed to be here for them.</p><p>His little Warlord Princes. The day would come when they realized who . . . and what . . . their father was. And things would change between them. But until that day came, they were his boys, his sons, his joy. He would protect them, no matter the price.</p><p>\u201cPapa?\u201d Peyton said. \u201cWould you read us a story?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to Peyton\u2019s forehead, savoring the contact, just as he savored the feel of Mephis\u2019s hand in his. \u201cYes, my darlings. I\u2019ll read you a story.\u201d</p><p>KAELEER\u2019S HEART</p><p>This story takes place after the events in Queen of the Darkness</p><p>ONE</p><p>1</p><p>Rage filled him. Love drove him. He and Witch hit the Green web. He rolled, but he didn\u2019t have Lucivar\u2019s skill. They broke through close to the middle of the web. He kept rolling so that when they hit the Sapphire, they were close to the edge. He rolled the other way, wrapping her in the web\u2019s power.</p><p>They broke through the Sapphire, but they weren\u2019t falling as fast now. He had a little more time to brace, to plan, to pour the strength of his Black Jewels into fighting the fall.</p><p>They hit the Red, rolled, clung for a second before falling to the Gray. Only half the Gray strands broke immediately. He strained back as hard as he could. When the other half broke, he rolled them upward while the web swung them down toward the Ebon-gray. He pulled against the swing, slowing it, slowing it.</p><p>When the other side of the Gray broke, they sailed down to the Ebon-gray. The web sagged when they landed, then stretched, then stretched a little more before the strands began to break.</p><p>His Black Jewels were almost drained, but he held on, held on, held on as they floated onto the Black web.</p><p>And nothing happened.</p><p>Shaking, shivering, he stared at the Black web, not quite daring to believe.</p><p>It took him a minute to get his hands to unlock from their grip around her ankles. When he was finally able to let go, he floated cautiously above the web. Near her shoulder, he noticed two small broken strands. Very carefully, he smoothed the Black strands over the other colors that cocooned her.</p><p>He could barely see her, only just enough to make out the tiny spiral horn. But that was enough.</p><p>*We did it,* he whispered. He looked up. He couldn\u2019t see his brother and father, but he knew they were still floating in the abyss, exhausted from their own part of this fight to save her. *Lucivar! Priest! We did it!*</p><p>Then he looked at Witch\u2014and horror filled him. In that moment of inattention, the Black web\u2019s strands had sagged, stretched, started to break. He lunged, trying to grab her. His fingertips brushed against her ankle, but no matter how hard he strained, he couldn\u2019t get any closer.</p><p>Her eyes opened. Even through the cocoon of webs, they glittered like fine sapphires.</p><p>\u201cDaemon.\u201d Little more than an exhalation of breath, a sigh. \u201cDaemon.\u201d</p><p>Then the strands of Black web broke, and she spiraled down into the Darkness and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Grief ensnared him, cocooned him in agony. \u201cNoooo!\u201d</p><p>Still trembling from the nightmare that had become a familiar companion over the past few months, Daemon Sadi braced his hands against the shower walls and let the hot water sluice over his bowed head.</p><p>He loved Jaenelle Angelline with everything in him, had waited all of his seventeen hundred years for the day when he would surrender to Witch and serve her, be her lover. He had dreamed of her, yearned for her, had endured the centuries of being used as a pleasure slave because he had to survive in order to find her. And now . . .</p><p>He was losing her. He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done, or hadn\u2019t done, to cause her feelings for him to change, but he was losing her. There was sadness lurking in the depths of her sapphire eyes whenever he was with her, and with each passing day, she seemed a little more distant, a little more out of reach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Daemon shook his head. He\u2019d let doubt become a living cry of pain while the kindred were fighting to hold on to Jaenelle and heal her body, and those doubts had cost her dearly. He couldn\u2019t afford to let doubt surface again.</p><p>Soaping up a washcloth, he scrubbed himself fiercely, as if washing the sweat off his skin could also scour the nightmare from his mind and heart. When he finally shut off the water and toweled himself dry, his body was clean\u2014and his heart still ached.</p><p>Going back into the bedroom of the master suite in his family\u2019s town house in Amdarh, Dhemlan\u2019s capital city, he looked at the bed and hesitated. No. He wouldn\u2019t take a chance of the nightmare coming back. Once in a night was more than enough. Besides, he could spend the hours before dawn going over the papers Marcus, his man of business, had delivered to the town house for his review.</p><p>During the years when he\u2019d been lost in the Twisted Kingdom and the years he\u2019d remained hidden while he regained his strength and patched together his sanity, Marcus had worked diligently on his behalf. Because of that, much of the wealth he\u2019d accumulated over the centuries had been quietly transferred to investments in various Territories in Kaeleer. That diligence had served Marcus as well, establishing him as a businessman and making it possible for him to bring his wife and young daughter to Kaeleer without having to serve in a Queen\u2019s court. Now Marcus and his family also lived in Amdarh, where it was safe for a child to play in the park with her friends, where a woman could walk down the street and not fear the men she passed, where a man wouldn\u2019t have to wonder if he would be snatched and maimed for the amusement of a bitch\u2019s court.</p> <p>Using Craft, Daemon turned on the candle-light near the chair and table where he\u2019d left the large stack of papers waiting for his perusal. Between his personal assets and controlling the vast wealth of the SaDiablo family, he had enough work to keep him busy, enough work to fill the hours when Jaenelle . . .</p><p>He reached for the robe at the foot of the bed, then turned away empty-handed to stand in front of the freestanding mirror.</p><p>He had the light-brown skin, black hair, and gold eyes that were common to the long-lived races. But his face was beautiful rather than handsome and left women breathless; his deep, cultured voice with its sexual edge could cause a pulse to race; and his body, trim, toned and full of feline grace, made women, and more than one man, crave him. He was seduction in motion, a promise of pleasure to the woman who held his affection and loyalty\u2014and a promise of pain to everyone else who thought to use him in a bed.</p><p>He was also a Black Widow, one of the Blood who could wield the Hourglass\u2019s Craft of dreams and visions . . . and poisons. His father had been the first male in the history of the Blood to become a Black Widow. He had been born one, and the venom held in the sac beneath the ring-finger nail of his right hand was deadly. Adding that to the fact that he wore Black Jewels made him the most powerful, and dangerous, male in the history of the Blood, second only to Saetan.</p><p>No. Not second. They had taken each other\u2019s measure, and they both knew the truth. He might be his father\u2019s mirror, but his power was a little stronger, a little darker. And whatever held his father in check from unleashing that power didn\u2019t hold him. With the right provocation, there was nothing he couldn\u2019t, and wouldn\u2019t, do.</p> <p>Especially when it came to Jaenelle Angelline, the living myth, dreams made flesh, the Queen who had sacrificed herself and the tremendous power she\u2019d wielded in order to cleanse the taint that Dorothea and Hekatah SaDiablo had smeared over the Blood in Terreille.</p><p>The Queen who was called Kaeleer\u2019s Heart.</p><p>She had stopped the war that would have devastated Kaeleer. The price had been vicious. Even though she had healed enough to come home, she had suffered so much during the first weeks when he\u2019d brought her back to SaDiablo Hall. True, the pain had lessened as autumn gave way to the first breath of winter, but even now, when the winter days would soon give way to the promise of spring, she was still so fragile, still an invalid who could barely walk from bed to chair. She never spoke about shattering her Ebony Jewels, never spoke of the new Jewel, Twilight\u2019s Dawn, that had taken the place of what she had lost.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say much of anything anymore. At least, not to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over,\u201d he told his reflection. \u201cYou\u2019ve kept your best weapons sheathed, old son. Maybe it\u2019s time to remind your Lady what you can offer a woman, remind her that you\u2019re hers for the taking. If you don\u2019t play this game out to the full and you lose because of it, you\u2019ll regret it for the rest of your life. It\u2019s not over until she asks you to leave, so give her a reason to want you to stay.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from the mirror, he slipped into the robe, poured a snifter of brandy, and settled in the chair to take care of the work that had brought him to Amdarh. If he could get through the business that required his immediate attention, he\u2019d have time to take care of some personal errands in the morning before meeting with Marcus\u2014and he\u2019d be home with Jaenelle by tonight.</p> <p>2</p><p>Daemon left the town house and strode down the sidewalk, his hands in the pockets of his wool coat, the collar flipped up to shield his neck from the bite of winter air. The walkways and streets were clear of snow, which made it easy to enjoy a brisk morning walk.</p><p>Personal errands first. As night gave way to dawn, he\u2019d realized the only way to battle doubt was by feeding hope. He knew what he wanted more than anything else, and this would be a small step in the right direction.</p><p>The bookseller he patronized was his first stop, and the man barely had time to open his store before Daemon arrived. Today, browsing wasn\u2019t a temptation, so he simply looked at the books the man had set aside for him. Reading was Jaenelle\u2019s main entertainment these days, so every time he came to Amdarh on business, he made a point of stopping at the store. He selected three of the six books that had been set aside, but asked the bookseller to hold the others until he returned to the city in a fortnight. Buying them but not giving her all of them seemed dishonest, as if he were withholding a treat. Delaying the purchase gave him the pleasure of bringing her something new each time he had to leave the Hall on family business, and he needed to give her anything he could.</p><p>By the time he left the bookstore, there were plenty of people out and about Amdarh\u2019s shopping district. As he walked to his next destination, he greeted the men and women he\u2019d met at aristo houses when he\u2019d been invited to dinner or to a party. He\u2019d made an effort to become acquainted with the Blood aristos in the city, especially the ones who served in Lady Zhara\u2019s court, since she ruled Dhemlan\u2019s capital. Except for Karla, the boyos and the coven who had made up Jaenelle\u2019s First Circle hadn\u2019t quite forgiven him for the games he\u2019d played to keep them away from her while she created the spells that would protect them and Kaeleer. And he and Lucivar still weren\u2019t quite easy with each other. What he\u2019d done in Dorothea\u2019s camp to protect his brother\u2019s wife and son was a still-healing wound between them.</p><p>He greeted two witches he\u2019d met at a party when he was in Amdarh a few weeks ago buying gifts for Winsol. Baffled by the wary stares they gave him before returning the greeting, he shrugged it off as unimportant, his mind already focused on the shop at the end of the block.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Prince Sadi,\u201d Banard said as soon as Daemon walked into the shop. \u201cI hadn\u2019t expected to see you here so soon after Winsol. Did the Lady like the pin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Daemon replied as he walked up to one of the glass displays that also served as a counter. \u201cYes, Lady Angelline was delighted with the unicorn pin.\u201d</p> <p>A gifted craftsman who worked with precious gems and metals, Banard, a Blood male who wore no Jewel himself, had been commissioned over the years to create a number of unique pieces for darker-Jeweled Blood\u2014including Jaenelle\u2019s scepter when she\u2019d established her Dark Court.</p><p>\u201cI have a commission for you,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cOne that requires your discretion for the time being.\u201d</p><p>Banard smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t they all require discretion, Prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they do,\u201d he replied, returning the smile to acknowledge the truth of Banard\u2019s statement. \u201cBut this one needs a little more than most.\u201d</p><p>Banard just continued to smile.</p><p>Daemon hesitated, wondering if he was being premature. Didn\u2019t matter. If he ended up being a fool over this, so be it. \u201cI want you to make two rings. One . . . I\u2019m not really sure how I want it to look.\u201d Despite the fact that they were alone in the shop, he lowered his voice. \u201cThe other is a plain gold band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know the ring size for this gold band?\u201d</p><p>In answer, Daemon held out his left hand.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Banard\u2019s smile widened. \u201cThen this other must be a special ring for a special Lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ring worthy of a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>Banard called in a velvet-lined ring case. Brass rings marched in neat rows from the largest, which would fit a man twice Daemon\u2019s size, to the smallest, which looked like it would fit only a small child.</p><p>\u201cI made the rings for the Lady\u2019s Court,\u201d Banard said, his fingers moving above the rows of brass rings. \u201cIf I remember correctly . . .\u201d He selected a ring and held it out.</p><p>Daemon slipped it on his finger. A perfect fit. Just as the Consort\u2019s Ring had been a perfect fit.</p><p>He removed the ring and gave it back to Banard, who returned the ring to its place and vanished the case.</p><p>\u201cAs for the other\u2014\u201d</p><p>Banard broke off as the shop\u2019s door opened and a woman stepped inside. She smiled at them, then moved to the display case that contained brooches.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give the matter some thought,\u201d Banard continued quietly. \u201cMake a few sketches for you to look at the next time you\u2019re in Amdarh. Would that be sufficient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine,\u201d Daemon replied, working to keep his voice from turning into a snarl. Something in the air. Something that honed his temper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned his head and studied the woman. A lighter-Jeweled witch. Who was cloaked in an illusion spell. The kind of spell that could only be made through the Hourglass\u2019s Craft. That\u2019s what he sensed. But there was nothing . . . enhanced . . . about her appearance. She was attractive but hardly stunning. Perhaps she was disfigured in some way, from accident or illness. There were some things even the best Healer couldn\u2019t fix completely, so an illusion spell was sometimes used to hide a disfigurement.</p><p>Wondering if she had come from Terreille, and knowing the cruel and terrible things Dorothea and her followers had done to people, he felt a moment\u2019s pity for her and was glad the illusion spell gave her the courage to go out in the world.</p><p>\u201cThere is one thing I can show you,\u201d Banard said. \u201cI just finished it yesterday.\u201d He retreated behind the curtain that shielded his workroom and the private showrooms, then returned quickly with a piece of folded black velvet. He set the cloth on the counter and revealed its contents.</p><p>Daemon picked up the bracelet. It was a double strand of white and yellow gold set with precious and semi-precious gems that matched the colors of the Jewels from the Rose to the Black.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Daemon said. And so appropriate since it reflected every color that made up Twilight\u2019s Dawn, the Jewel Jaenelle now wore. \u201cA special gift for a special Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would think so,\u201d Banard said.</p><p>Grinning, he set it back on the velvet. \u201cWrap it up, and I\u2019ll take it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. May I see it?\u201d</p><p>The woman was standing near him, focused on the bracelet. There was a greediness in her eyes that made him want to lash out, to sweep the bracelet out of sight. But he thought of the illusion spell and the reasons she might have paid a Black Widow to create one. Beauty of any kind might be a new discovery for her.</p> <p>He forced himself to step aside so she could get a better look at the bracelet, but he rested his hand on the counter close to the velvet, a subtle claim and a warning that she could look but not touch.</p><p>After a long study, she smiled and moved back to the counter with the brooches.</p><p>Wrapping the velvet around the bracelet, Daemon vanished it, promised to return in a fortnight, and turned to leave the shop. At the door, he looked back at the woman, but her attention was on the brooches, not on him. Shrugging off his uneasiness as a reaction to living in Terreille for most of his life, he headed back to the family town house, where he and Marcus would share a midday meal before getting down to business.</p><p>3</p><p>A few minutes later, Roxie left Banard\u2019s shop with a brooch safely tucked in her small carry bag. She strolled down the street, stopping to look into store windows, until she reached the horse-drawn cab waiting by the curb. As soon as she scrambled inside, the driver pulled into the stream of horse-drawn conveyances and Craft-powered coaches.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Lektra demanded, twisting a curl around her finger.</p> <p>\u201cI think he noticed the illusion spell,\u201d Roxie said, feeling a little breathless now that their plan was truly in motion.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Lektra replied. \u201cThere are plenty of reasons why people pay for illusion spells to change their looks. Besides, I was assured sensing an illusion spell isn\u2019t the same as seeing beneath it.\u201d</p><p>Lektra was the niece of a Queen who ruled a two-village District in Dhemlan, so she was known to many of the aristo Blood in Amdarh and couldn\u2019t afford to draw attention to herself right now\u2014not if their plan was going to work. That was why Roxie had volunteered to get the information they needed. But Lektra had come up with the idea of paying a Black Widow to create the illusion spell so Roxie, a Rihlander originally from Ebon Rih, would look like a Dhemlan witch.</p><p>\u201cI bought this,\u201d Roxie said, taking the brooch out of her carry bag.</p><p>\u201cThis will do nicely,\u201d Lektra said as she examined the brooch. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly pretty, and, most important, it has Banard\u2019s mark on the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were prettier ones,\u201d Roxie said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care? You\u2019re not going to wear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Even if it wasn\u2019t the one she would have chosen if she could have spent anything she wanted, she\u2019d still expected to keep it. After all, it was a brooch by Banard\u2014something she could never afford for herself.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was Daemon doing there? What was he buying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he commissioned Banard to make something special\u2014probably for that stupid cripple, Jaenelle. But he did buy a bracelet. \u2018A special gift for a special Lady.\u2019 \u201d As she described the bracelet, Lektra\u2019s gold eyes gleamed with delight.</p><p>\u201cWe can go to another jeweler and get a duplicate made,\u201d Lektra said excitedly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be exact, just have all the right elements, so when someone sees me wearing it, they\u2019ll think it\u2019s the one Banard made. And since Jaenelle Angelline isn\u2019t likely to be coming to Amdarh anytime soon, no one will know the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the brooch?\u201d Roxie asked.</p><p>\u201cWhile he was in Amdarh last time, Daemon attended several parties. There\u2019s always dozens of them just before the actual thirteen days of Winsol. Some of the theater folk attended one of them, and I heard Daemon spent some time with one of the actresses. Danced with her a couple of times. Even stood as her escort for dinner.\u201d Lektra pouted.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe he\u2019s not as chaste as everyone thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. Of course he\u2019s chaste. Hell\u2019s fire! Any hint that he\u2019s been unfaithful to precious Jaenelle would have everyone worth knowing shunning him\u2014which is the whole point, remember?\u201d Lektra smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s why using this actress is the perfect starting point to freeing Daemon from Jaenelle\u2019s control. People did notice the attention he paid the bitch. If she receives a gift from a secret admirer\u2014a \u2018special gift for a special Lady\u2019\u2014she\u2019s going to wear it, and she\u2019s going to tell people it\u2019s from a secret admirer. So all we have to do is mention that someone had seen Daemon in Banard\u2019s shop buying a \u2018special gift\u2019 and people will tie the knot between those two bits of information themselves.\u201d</p><p>Lektra tapped her lips with a fingertip and looked thoughtful. \u201cMaybe I won\u2019t have another bracelet made after all. It will be so much nicer when Daemon takes me to Banard\u2019s shop to buy one for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I get out of this?\u201d Roxie muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou get to share the prize, just as I promised,\u201d Lektra said coolly. \u201cAnd you get to pay the SaDiablo family back for the way Lucivar Yaslana treated you. And as my friend and guest, you get to attend parties and dances you\u2019d never be invited to on your own\u2014not to mention the lovers who come home with us.\u201d</p><p>Lektra\u2019s seconds, that\u2019s what she got. But what Lektra said was true: being exiled from Ebon Rih six years ago had cost her almost all her social status. It had gotten so bad in Askavi, no man wanted to dance with her, let alone do something more interesting. So she had moved to Dhemlan, but it wouldn\u2019t have been any better if Lektra hadn\u2019t befriended her.</p><p>So she put up with the reminders that she owed what social standing she had in Amdarh to Lektra\u2019s efforts on her behalf, and she put up with men who wanted Lektra but made do with her.</p><p>Now that Lektra\u2019s interest in Daemon Sadi had ripened into obsession, the Dhemlan witch needed her help, and that worked in her favor. Besides, if they won this prize, she wouldn\u2019t mind taking whatever crumbs were left over.</p><p>TWO</p><p>\u201cOh, Daemon. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The delight in Jaenelle\u2019s sapphire eyes as she picked up the bracelet warmed him and gave him hope. There was so little these days that delighted her.</p><p>\u201cTry it on.\u201d He took the bracelet and fastened it around her wrist, painfully careful not to touch the fragile skin\u2014skin he wanted to caress, kiss, lick. The memory of how even the gentlest touch had left hideous bruises whenever he\u2019d helped her move still made him ill. So he didn\u2019t let his fingers brush her skin as he fastened the bracelet, then eased back.</p><p>As she held out her arm to admire the bracelet, he no longer saw something beautiful. He saw the shadow the bracelet cast on her skin. Or was it something else?</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cIt\u2019s not too heavy, is it?\u201d Fool. Idiot. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him when he bought it that having the metal resting against her skin would bruise her. And it should have occurred to him. When he\u2019d brought her back to the Hall last autumn, she couldn\u2019t wear anything but the lightest-weight fabrics, couldn\u2019t have more than a sheet over her in bed. Anything more had left her covered in bruises\u2014and had left him terrified that the constant effort to keep healing the bleeding under the skin would interfere with her overall healing\u2014or even make it impossible for her to ever completely heal.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not too heavy,\u201d Jaenelle said as she lowered her arm.</p><p>Daemon winced. By reminding her of how frail she was, he\u2019d spoiled her pleasure in the gift.</p><p>When she looked at him, the delight that had been in her eyes was gone. She was gone. She still sat beside him on the couch, but there was a distance between them again that he didn\u2019t know how to bridge.</p><p>He looked at the table in front of him, and his heart sank a little more. The book he\u2019d given her at Winsol lay on the table, the bookmark indicating she\u2019d barely gotten halfway through it.</p><p>\u201cThe story doesn\u2019t appeal to you?\u201d he asked, wondering if any of the new books he\u2019d brought her would please her. Wondering if there was anything he could do anymore that would please her.</p><p>Jaenelle looked away, but not before he saw pain and sadness in her eyes. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve lost my taste for love stories,\u201d she said. Then she tried to smile. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little tired. I think I\u2019ll get some sleep now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He recognized a dismissal when he heard one. \u201cI\u2019ll help you to bed,\u201d he said as he rose.</p><p>He waited until she slowly, painfully got to her feet. Then he used Craft to float her from the sitting room to the bedroom. With exquisite care, he removed the soft wool robe Marian had made for her and tucked the sheet and blanket she could now tolerate around her once she was settled in bed.</p><p>\u201cGood night, sweetheart,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll come to bed in a little while.\u201d Unless you want me to stay. Please want me to stay.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Daemon.\u201d</p> <p>Idly swirling the brandy in the glass, Daemon stared out the window of the bedroom that adjoined Jaenelle\u2019s. The Consort\u2019s room. Since she no longer ruled a court, technically he was no longer her Consort. Since he couldn\u2019t touch her, he wasn\u2019t technically her lover either.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. He was still her lover. Would always be her lover. He suppressed that thought before his body responded to it. After he brought her home and realized how frail she was, how little it would take to overwhelm the healing taking place inside her and have it fail, which would leave her permanently imprisoned in a body that wouldn\u2019t allow her to do more than exist, his desire for sex had vanished. Not surprising. Despite the centuries of being a pleasure slave, he\u2019d been a virgin until he gave himself to Jaenelle. No other woman had aroused him, no other woman had filled him with hungry need.</p><p>That was still true. When he attended the dinners or parties in Amdarh, he danced with women because he enjoyed dancing. But none of them stirred any interest for her company beyond the dance. Only Jaenelle. Always Jaenelle.</p><p>He\u2019d been content to let his desire sleep. So he wasn\u2019t sure what to think about the fact that, lately, he would wake in the night hard, hot, and aching, troubled by dreams of spreading Jaenelle\u2019s legs, of kneeling before her while his tongue and fingers stroked her to a climax.</p><p>Lately, the sound of her voice was enough to stir his cock\u2014and her unhappiness was enough to wither desire. But not completely. Never completely. Between the erotic dreams and the nightmare of losing her, he hadn\u2019t had a decent night\u2019s sleep in weeks.</p> <p>*Prince?*</p><p>Daemon turned and studied the Red-Jeweled Sceltie Warlord. Ladvarian\u2019s determination had gathered the kindred who had pored their strength, love, and unshakable belief that they, along with the Arachnian Queen who had spun the powerful healing webs, could rebuild Jaenelle\u2019s devastated body, could hold dreams to flesh and keep Kaeleer\u2019s Heart among the living. He had brought the Jewel that became Twilight\u2019s Dawn to the island that was ruled by the golden spiders who were the Weavers of Dreams. And he was the one who had finally allowed Daemon to come to the other island where the kindred had hidden, and cared for, Jaenelle after she rose from the healing webs.</p><p>*You are unhappy,* Ladvarian said.</p><p>*Just tired,* Daemon lied. *I haven\u2019t been sleeping well.*</p><p>Ladvarian hesitated. *Should we take Jaenelle somewhere else?*</p><p>*No!* Daemon struggled to remain calm while temper and fear raged through him. That the small dog could, and would, remove Jaenelle from his care wasn\u2019t lost on either of them. His inability to believe she would come back, his grief and longing filling the abyss day after day, had been the reason she had risen from the healing webs too soon. He was to blame for the suffering she\u2019d endured when he\u2019d first brought her back to the Hall. The kindred had been willing to overlook his failure to love without doubt, but they wouldn\u2019t overlook anything else that might interfere with Jaenelle\u2019s well-being.</p> <p>*No,* he said again. *I\u2019m grateful to have her here. I\u2019m grateful to be with her.* And what he wouldn\u2019t admit to was the fear that if the kindred took her away, he might not be able to win her back enough for her to love him again.</p><p>*She is healing, Daemon,* Ladvarian said after another hesitation. *She is getting stronger.*</p><p>*I know.* But she would never be what she had been. It wasn\u2019t just her body that she\u2019d crippled when she\u2019d unleashed her power to save Kaeleer. She could no longer wear the Black or Ebony Jewels that had once signaled the enormity of her power, and no one really knew what to make of Twilight\u2019s Dawn since nothing like it had ever existed. Sometimes it felt similar to a lighter Jewel, sometimes he could feel a hint of Ebon-gray or Black when he was near her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give a damn what Jewel she wore, but he, like the coven and boyos who had been members of her First Circle, worried that the loss of that power would affect her mental and emotional health, which, in turn, might damage her physical health.</p><p>Don\u2019t borrow trouble, old son. You\u2019ve already got enough of it. Do everything you can to get her well again and deal with what her Jewels can\u2014and can\u2019t\u2014do another day.</p><p>*Are you sleeping here?* Ladvarian asked.</p><p>Here? Where he couldn\u2019t wake up and hear her breathing, where he couldn\u2019t have that immediate assurance that she was still with him? *No.*</p><p>As soon as Ladvarian trotted back to Jaenelle\u2019s room, Daemon stripped out of his clothes and shrugged into a robe that was a token gesture of modesty. He didn\u2019t need it for warmth. The warming spells he\u2019d put on Jaenelle\u2019s suite of rooms and this one guaranteed she wouldn\u2019t catch a chill.</p> <p>The fire burning low in the hearth was enough light to see by as he made his way to her bed, shrugged off the robe, and slipped under the covers. The bed, specially built and strengthened with Craft to accommodate Kaelas, the eight-hundred-pound Arcerian cat who had slept with Jaenelle since she brought him home as an orphaned kitten, meant he could sleep with her without fear of bumping her during the night and causing an injury.</p><p>As he pulled the covers up, he heard the change in her breathing, felt her roll onto her back.</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep, sweetheart,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaemon.\u201d She sank back into the deep sleep her body demanded.</p><p>Propped up on one elbow, Daemon watched her sleep for a long time. Had he heard longing in that one word?</p><p>He shifted closer to her. Then he reached out and touched the ends of her golden hair. The kindred had used Craft to crop her hair very short. A practical thing to do while they\u2019d tended her body when she was still connected to the healing webs. It had grown out enough to look shaggy. It was also the one thing he could touch without fear of hurting her.</p><p>So he brushed his fingertips over her hair, wishing she was healed enough that he could brush his lips over hers, could slip his tongue into her mouth and kiss her the way he wanted to kiss her.</p><p>Someday he would be able to kiss her that way again. Someday he would be able to do a lot more than just kiss her.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t allow himself to believe anything else.</p><p>THREE</p><p>Too restless to sleep, Lektra paced her bedroom. Roxie\u2019s scheme had to work. It had to. They would stir rumors and provide nuggets of information that, if strung the wrong way, would ruin a man\u2019s reputation. They would also be Daemon Sadi\u2019s most vocal defenders. In the end, when he was freed of his obligation to take care of that crippled invalid, he would feel grateful to the woman who had loved him enough to publicly defend him against the charges of infidelity.</p><p>And she did love him. She did. So why should that beautiful, virile man be trapped playing nursemaid to a woman who no longer had any use for him? Why should he spend the next few decades sitting by a sickbed, reading aloud to a lump of flesh? Or, worse, why should he have to hide his revulsion if Jaenelle Angelline still wanted something sexual from him?</p><p>She\u2019d fallen in love with Daemon the first time she\u2019d seen him over a year ago. He had come to Amdarh with Jaenelle to shop for Winsol gifts and attend a few parties before returning to SaDiablo Hall to celebrate Winsol with their family and Jaenelle\u2019s First Circle. It had made sense that he would have agreed to be Jaenelle\u2019s Consort. At the time, she\u2019d been the Queen of Ebon Askavi\u2014the most powerful Queen in Kaeleer. Every strong, ambitious male who had been trained for a consort\u2019s duties had wanted to wear the ring Daemon had worn on his left hand. But Daemon, beautiful Daemon, had won that coveted position.</p><p>And no wonder. He\u2019d looked at Jaenelle as if no other woman existed\u2014or would ever exist. And when they danced together, every move he made was a prelude to the bedroom dance, a promise of what he could offer in private. Even when it was a dance that required several couples, you could see him bank that sexual heat when he turned to another partner, could watch it flare as soon as his hand touched Jaenelle\u2019s.</p><p>An exquisite male. The kind of male that made all the others seem lacking in some essential.</p><p>She would have waited for him to be free of his contract. After all, the five years he was required to serve in Jaenelle\u2019s court was nothing to someone who came from one of the long-lived races. Once his contract was completed, he would have been free to look elsewhere for a lover. She\u2019d even tried to join the Dark Court so they could be together in some way. But the letter she\u2019d received from the Steward made it clear there were no plans to expand the Dark Court to accommodate all the Blood who were offering to serve.</p><p>Then there was all that talk of a war between Kaeleer and Terreille, and news of fighting in other Territories. And then there was that unleashing of power unlike anything the Blood had ever experienced. When that power faded, the war was over, the Blood who had threatened Kaeleer were destroyed\u2014and the Queen of Ebon Askavi was gone.</p><p>But not Jaenelle Angelline. Despite being hideously wounded, she\u2019d survived somehow. Instead of grieving a few weeks for the loss of a Queen before moving on, Daemon was chained to a cripple who was still adored by the Queens and Warlord Princes who controlled the other Territories in Kaeleer.</p><p>He would never shake free of Jaenelle Angelline. So she would help cut the ties between the former Queen of Ebon Askavi and the Warlord Prince who, otherwise, would remain trapped for years, possibly decades. Oh, the Queens would snub him for a while, but in a year or two, they would realize it was better to have a Warlord Prince attached to a woman who could be what he needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And while he would suffer a little because of the accusations of infidelity, she had no doubt, with the help of her family, she could restore his reputation.</p><p>And then he would look at her the way he had once looked at Jaenelle.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>1</p> <p>\u201cLet me see if I understand this,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>Surreal turned away from the window. The gray day and the sleet that would make a mess of all the roads matched her mood, but she did her best to bury wounded feelings as she approached the couch where Jaenelle sat bundled in a nightgown and robe, her legs stretched out under a quilt.</p><p>She looks better, Surreal thought. Oh, far from well and still so fragile, but better than she\u2019d looked a few weeks ago when Surreal had come back to the Hall to spend a few days with the family during Winsol.</p><p>\u201cYou and Falonar have decided to go your own ways,\u201d Jaenelle said with a patience that made Surreal wary.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt was a mutual decision.\u201d The bastard.</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh. So you packed your bags\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was his eyrie,\u201d Surreal cut in. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t want to live there.\u201d And I didn\u2019t want to watch him courting Nurian in ways he never thought to court me.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and left Ebon Rih without telling Lucivar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would have strung Falonar up by the heels\u201d\u2014or by the balls, which might have been interesting to watch\u2014 \u201cbefore having a little chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jaenelle said, \u201che would have waited for Chaosti to show up, and then he would have strung Falonar up by the heels.\u201d She paused. \u201cMaybe by the heels.\u201d</p><p>Which just confirmed why Surreal had slipped away from Ebon Rih before Lucivar had time to notice. As the Warlord Prince of Ebon Rih dealing with a Warlord Prince who was his second-in-command, Lucivar would have been nasty and explosive. Chaosti, the Warlord Prince of the Dea al Mon and a kinsman on her mother\u2019s side, would have approached Falonar with the protective viciousness that made Warlord Princes such a deadly facet of Blood society.</p> <p>Dealing with the male relatives she\u2019d acquired since coming to Kaeleer was so much fun.</p><p>\u201cAnd you entered the Hall through one of the side doors to avoid seeing Daemon, who\u2019s working in his study and would have met you before you got out of the great hall.\u201d</p><p>Feeling more wary by the minute, Surreal did her best to look indifferent. \u201cNo reason for him to get involved in this.\u201d Sweet Darkness, please don\u2019t let him think this is any business of his. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t need either of them getting all snarly and protective over something that was a mutual decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo instead of mentioning this to either of them, you went to the Keep and told Saetan.\u201d</p><p>Surreal winced. \u201cWell, I figured I should tell someone before leaving Ebon Rih.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. So you told the High Lord of Hell, the patriarch of this family, the man from whom Daemon and Lucivar inherited the temper you were trying to avoid.\u201d Jaenelle pushed the quilt aside and swung her legs over the side of the couch to sit up straight. \u201cDid I miss something?\u201d</p><p>Unable to stand still, Surreal started pacing in a circle in front of the table that held the pot of coffee, cups, and sandwiches Beale, the Hall\u2019s butler, had brought in a few minutes after she\u2019d knocked on Jaenelle\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cI thought he\u2019d be reasonable,\u201d she snarled. \u201cHe\u2019s older and less . . . excitable.\u201d And Saetan had sounded calm and reasonable while she explained that living in an eyrie with Falonar had lost its appeal and she intended to spend a few days at the Hall before staying at the family\u2019s town house in Amdarh for a while.</p> <p>\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d Saetan had asked too softly.</p><p>Surreal snorted. \u201cUncle Saetan, sugar, do I look hurt?\u201d</p><p>Watching his eyes glaze, she\u2019d realized she\u2019d made a serious tactical error. Which was why she\u2019d caught the Gray Wind and headed for the Hall as fast as she could, hoping Jaenelle would have some advice about dealing with the rest of the family.</p><p>Jaenelle sighed. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll deal with this.\u201d</p><p>Surreal watched Jaenelle\u2019s arm tremble as she lifted the coffeepot and poured two cups. When she reached for the cream and sugar, Surreal stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cWant some help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Wondering about the whiplash of anger under the word, Surreal hesitated.</p><p>\u201cTake your coffee and a sandwich,\u201d Jaenelle said, grabbing a sandwich off the plate and taking a bite.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Surreal asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cYou want Falonar to walk away from this intact?\u201d Jaenelle countered. \u201cThen take a sandwich. And hold on to that wall of sass and indifference you\u2019ve erected in front of what you\u2019re really feeling.\u201d</p><p>Before Surreal could ask what coffee and sandwiches had to do with what she was, or wasn\u2019t, feeling, she felt the wash of dark power roll through the Hall. Ebon-gray and Black\u2014immediately answered by another Black.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. All three of them\u2014and all of them pissed off.</p><p>Grabbing a sandwich, Surreal took a bite and hoped she wouldn\u2019t choke.</p><p>\u201cCome over here and sit down,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>Feeling the three-pronged storm moving through the Hall toward them, Surreal sat on the end of the couch farthest away from the door. She gulped coffee to wash down the sandwich, then refilled both their cups after Jaenelle drained hers.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>Shit shit shit. \u201cCan I go back to being an orphan?\u201d</p><p>Amusement lit Jaenelle\u2019s eyes. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p><p>The sitting room door swung open. Saetan walked in, flanked by Daemon and Lucivar. Lucivar\u2019s gold eyes were lit with hot temper. Daemon\u2019s and Saetan\u2019s eyes had that chilling glaze. But the three of them stopped abruptly when Jaenelle smiled at them as if there was nothing in the world they could possibly be upset about.</p><p>\u201cIf you want coffee, you\u2019ll have to ask Beale to send up another pot,\u201d Jaenelle said, \u201cbut there are plenty of sandwiches left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, witch-child,\u201d Saetan said, taking another step forward. He studied the woman who had been his Queen\u2014and was still, and always, the daughter of his soul\u2014before those glazed eyes focused on Surreal.</p><p>Looking past Saetan, Jaenelle focused her smile on Daemon. \u201cSurreal\u2019s going to stay with us a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always welcome,\u201d Daemon replied. \u201cThis is her home, too.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar stepped away from the other men, his dark wings flaring, making him look bigger\u2014and more formidable. \u201cYou left Ebon Rih in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>Surreal shrugged. \u201cJust wanted to get away for a while. And frankly, sugar, your mornings start with a lot more noise than I want to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoise?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>Surreal rolled her eyes. \u201cThe last time I was at Lucivar\u2019s eyrie around breakfast time, Daemonar was screaming because a wolf pup had chewed on his foot. Of course, the reason the pup had chewed on his foot was because he had been chewing on the puppy\u2019s tail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, it was a typical morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>They both looked at Lucivar, who swore under his breath. \u201cAll right. Fine. Anything you want to tell me about Falonar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Surreal replied.</p><p>Before Lucivar could argue, Saetan said, \u201cOur apologies for intruding, Ladies. We\u2019ll let you get back to your own discussion.\u201d</p><p>Surreal held her breath as she watched Saetan and Lucivar leave the room\u2014and noticed how Daemon lingered a moment, his eyes on Jaenelle, before he followed his father and brother. When the door closed behind him, she sighed with relief.</p><p>\u201cThink they bought it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jaenelle set her cup on the table. \u201cBut it\u2019s understood that they have no justification for going after Falonar, so they\u2019ll leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>She set her own cup aside. \u201cI owe you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d Jaenelle stared at the table. \u201cDo you want to tell me why you really left Falonar and Ebon Rih?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle nodded. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s no specific reason,\u201d she said softly. \u201cSometimes things just don\u2019t work out between two people.\u201d</p><p>Are we still talking about me and Falonar? Surreal wondered. Remembering the way Daemon had lingered for a moment, she had an uneasy feeling Jaenelle was thinking of two other people.</p><p>2</p><p>She waited until Saetan and Lucivar had left the Hall before tracking Daemon to his study. It felt strange walking into that room and seeing another man behind the desk where Saetan had ruled Dhemlan for so many centuries. Even stranger to feel as if nothing had really changed.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, settling into the chair in front of the desk. \u201cDo you ever see any rooms in the Hall besides this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally,\u201d Daemon replied with a dry smile. \u201cBrandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She watched him pour a snifter for her and top off his own before he used Craft to float hers over to her waiting hand. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Daemon leaned back in his chair, the snifter cradled in both hands. His Black-Jeweled ring glittered on his right hand. His left hand looked naked without the Consort\u2019s ring. Did he miss the feel of it on his finger? She\u2019d noticed that Saetan still wore the Steward\u2019s ring, which the loss of his little finger made more noticeable. But she could understand why Daemon had set the Consort\u2019s ring aside. Saetan had withdrawn to live at the Keep, leaving his sons\u2014Daemon, specifically\u2014to handle the property owned by the SaDiablo family as well as the wealth acquired over Saetan\u2019s long, long lifetime. Daemon, on the other hand, was still very much in sight. He was no longer the Consort, since Jaenelle, while still a Queen, no longer ruled a court.</p><p>Of course, only a fool wanting to commit suicide would in any way imply that the absence of a ring made him any less Jaenelle\u2019s Consort.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d Daemon asked quietly. \u201cOr haven\u2019t you thought that far ahead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow anyone who needs an assassin?\u201d</p><p>He choked back a laugh. \u201cIn Kaeleer? Hardly.\u201d</p><p>She saw the question in his eyes. \u201cIf I\u2019d wanted him dead, Sadi, Falonar wouldn\u2019t be breathing. You know that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His gold eyes stayed locked on hers as he took a sip of brandy. \u201cPoint made. Besides, I\u2019m surprised you put up with him this long.\u201d</p><p>That startled her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much of that Eyrien arrogance for you to swallow for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a brother who has even more of that Eyrien arrogance,\u201d she pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to sleep with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d eat worms first. Live.\u201d Since the image made her a little queasy, she took a healthy swallow of brandy. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t like him,\u201d she added. \u201cMaybe even love him a little in a sisterly way . . . when he\u2019s not being a stubborn prick about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, all of five minutes a month.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cIf you add it up.\u201d The grin faded. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>He rolled the snifter between his hands and studied the way the brandy followed the motion. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all right. He\u2019s . . . wary. Can\u2019t blame him for that. But he\u2019ll stand. If I need him, he\u2019ll stand.\u201d</p> <p>And you and Jaenelle?</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she said, \u201cI thought I\u2019d spend some time in Amdarh, if you have no objection to me using the town house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the family\u2019s town house. You\u2019re family.\u201d He hesitated for a moment. \u201cI have to go to Amdarh in a few days. If you\u2019re willing to wait, we can go at the same time. I have a box at two of the theaters, if you\u2019d like to see a play\u2014and wouldn\u2019t mind some company.\u201d</p><p>I think you\u2019re the one who needs some company. Shit, Sadi, what\u2019s going on here?</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d She set the snifter on the blackwood desk, stood up, and stretched. \u201cI\u2019d better see what Graysfang is up to. He\u2019s of the wolfie opinion that I enjoy drying him off and brushing him when he comes in wet and muddy. Don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s male. He\u2019s getting petted. This is hard to understand?\u201d</p> <p>The words were said lightly, but there was an undertone of anguished yearning.</p><p>Not knowing what to say, she left the study. But she thought about it on and off for the rest of the day. She watched the two of them throughout dinner. And when she was staring at the ceiling late that night, with Graysfang curled up beside her, snoring softly, she came to a decision.</p><p>All right, Sadi. I\u2019ll keep the peace while we\u2019re at the Hall. But once we get to Amdarh . . . The Blood in Terreille had good reason to call you the Sadist. If I have to dance with that side of your temper to find out what in the name of Hell is wrong between you and Jaenelle, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. But one way or another, you\u2019re going to talk to me.</p><p>And if she couldn\u2019t get anything out of him, informing the patriarch of the family that there was serious trouble between Daemon and Jaenelle would get some results. One way or another.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>1</p><p>Jealousy coiled around Lektra\u2019s heart as she watched Daemon settle the lovely woman in the seat beside him. He never invited anyone to sit with him when he came to the theater. Never.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Lektra asked, struggling to hide the feeling of betrayal that welled up at the sight of Daemon with another woman. He should be keeping other women at arm\u2019s length until he could be with her.</p> <p>Lord Braedon, the Warlord who had agreed to be her escort tonight with gratifying eagerness, looked across the theater to the box opposite theirs. \u201cWho? Oh. That\u2019s Sadi\u2019s \u2018cousin.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Tavey, Lektra\u2019s cousin on her father\u2019s side, snickered and leaned forward a little to see around Roxie, who was sitting on Lektra\u2019s right. \u201cConvenient, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d Lektra snapped.</p><p>\u201cI heard she used to be a whore,\u201d Roxie replied primly.</p><p>\u201cA high-priced one, from what I heard,\u201d Tavey said. \u201cWonder if she and Sadi had a standing arrangement when they both lived in Terreille.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt there was much standing,\u201d Braedon said blandly.</p><p>Shocked, Lektra stared at her escort. \u201cDo you mean Dae\u2014Prince Sadi and that woman used to . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Braedon shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s possible she\u2019s really related in some way to the SaDiablo family. But if a man needed to be very discreet about getting certain . . . needs . . . met, having a \u2018cousin\u2019 who could stay under the same roof without anyone thinking twice about it would make it much easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially an \u2018experienced\u2019 cousin,\u201d Tavey said, snickering again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both being ridiculous,\u201d Lektra said, remembering she was supposed to be Daemon\u2019s defender.</p><p>\u201cIs she wearing a bracelet?\u201d Roxie said, then hunched her shoulders as if she\u2019d said something she shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to notice a bracelet when you can notice other things?\u201d Tavey asked, cupping his hands close to his chest.</p><p>Lektra bit back a snappish remark about making such gestures in public. Tavey was a Yellow-Jeweled Warlord who was devotedly loyal to her, which made up for him not being very bright. He also had a thirst for gossip that accounted for his never having a contract renewed when the family managed to get him accepted in a court.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Roxie said, sounding reluctant, \u201cI\u2019d heard Prince Sadi had bought a bracelet from Banard. A \u2018special gift for a special Lady.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cThought it was a brooch,\u201d Tavey said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThere was an actress showing off a brooch that had been sent by a secret admirer,\u201d Braedon said. His eyes flicked from the stage to Sadi\u2019s box and back again. \u201cYou don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Lektra said firmly. \u201cEveryone knows Prince Sadi is devoted to Jaenelle Angelline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hasn\u2019t been seen in months,\u201d Braedon murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh, hush,\u201d Lektra said. \u201cThe play will start in a few minutes. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing it.\u201d Her eyes flicked to the box opposite hers as she added softly, \u201cI\u2019m definitely looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>Surreal watched Daemon remove two items from the wooden box he\u2019d called in as soon as they were settled in their seats, at first with idle curiosity, then with growing apprehension.</p><p>\u201cIs that a tangled web?\u201d she asked. She knew he was a Black Widow. Hell\u2019s fire, she\u2019d lived with him for several years while he was struggling to come back from the Twisted Kingdom and then rehone his Craft skills.</p><p>\u201cOf a kind,\u201d Daemon replied as he used Craft to set the frame holding the tangled web on air where it couldn\u2019t easily be seen by other people attending the play. Behind the tangled web, he set a faceted, oval crystal. \u201cI started with the kind of web the Hourglass uses to see dreams and visions and adapted it for a specific purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, but there was an acknowledgment in his eyes of why she was asking the question\u2014and why she was wary of the answer. Daemon rarely announced his intentions when he went hunting, and she\u2019d often wondered how many of the Blood he\u2019d destroyed in the Terreillean courts were aware of what had killed them until the last moment when that slash of Black power burned out their own power, finishing the kill.</p><p>\u201cBy using a spell I worked out and channeling through the web, I can retain the play in the crystal so that it can be played again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the spelled music crystals retain a musical performance?\u201d</p><p>Daemon nodded. \u201cBut this one holds what is seen as well as what is heard.\u201d</p><p>Surreal studied the web and crystal again, this time with keen interest. \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant! But . . . why?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cJaenelle is still too fragile to come to Amdarh to see a play . . . so I bring the plays to her.\u201d</p><p>Emotion that felt appallingly sentimental welled up in her. She punched it down. \u201cDoes she enjoy the plays?\u201d</p><p>Now he smiled ruefully. \u201cI hadn\u2019t quite worked out all the snags in the spell the last time I tried it. There was a . . . lag . . . between when the actor said his lines and the words were heard. She found it entertaining, but not in the way I\u2019d intended.\u201d</p><p>Surreal laughed. \u201cAnything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis spell doesn\u2019t work independently. At least not yet. So I need to stay focused on the play.\u201d</p><p>She heard the warning under the words. \u201cThat explains why you Black-locked the door.\u201d And why he\u2019d told her he preferred to attend the theater alone when she\u2019d asked him earlier if he ever invited anyone to join him as a guest. She\u2019d been thinking of Marian, Lucivar\u2019s wife, but the chill in the air when he\u2019d replied made her wonder how many offers he\u2019d had for company whenever he came to Amdarh.</p><p>It also told her how much of a concession he\u2019d made by inviting her to join him tonight. And how he trusted her to let him do what he\u2019d come here to do.</p><p>As the house lights went down, Daemon made himself comfortable and focused his eyes on the stage.</p><p>The play was entertaining, but Surreal found Daemon more interesting to watch, even though she, too, kept her eyes fixed on the stage. How much of the play did he actually notice since he kept looking at the center of the stage to see the whole of it instead of shifting his gaze to follow the action when it moved closer to one wing or the other? Or would he finally enjoy it when he replayed it for Jaenelle? Although she doubted his attention would be on the play at that point.</p><p>When the first act ended and she offered to fetch some refreshment, his quick agreement surprised her\u2014until she made her way through the crowd to the curved bar at one end of the theater\u2019s lobby and ordered two glasses of sparkling wine. The number of women who had given her a cool appraisal as she passed made her wonder how many of them were trying to find out how deep Daemon\u2019s attachment to Jaenelle still ran.</p><p>From their point of view, she understood the interest. Daemon was no longer officially Jaenelle\u2019s Consort. Few beyond the family and Jaenelle\u2019s former First Circle would know he\u2019d committed himself to Jaenelle years before he ever became her Consort. They wouldn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done\u2014and suffered\u2014to try to save an extraordinary child who became the most powerful Queen in the history of the Blood. What they saw was a beautiful, sensual male who came from one of the most powerful, and wealthiest, families in Kaeleer, and was a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince in the bargain.</p><p>He\u2019d be a prize for any woman who could win him.</p><p>She shuddered at the thought of any woman trying to win him away from Jaenelle.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely bracelet.\u201d</p><p>Surreal glanced over at the Warlord who had squeezed in beside her to wait for his order. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a design by Banard?\u201d</p><p>Something about his interest wasn\u2019t quite right, but she couldn\u2019t figure out what it was about him that made her want to spill his guts all over the floor. So she hooked her long black hair behind one delicately pointed ear\u2014and saw his eyes widen at the evidence that she wasn\u2019t solely from any of the long-lived races. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s Dea al Mon.\u201d</p><p>Nerves danced in his eyes at the mention of the Children of the Wood\u2014a race who fiercely protected their Territory and seldom let anyone who crossed their border walk out again\u2014but he worked to keep his smile easy.</p><p>\u201cThen you must be Lady Surreal,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t hear enough, sugar. If you\u2019d heard about more than my \u201cpublic\u201d profession, you wouldn\u2019t be crowding me.</p> <p>She smiled at him, called in a silver mark and put it on the bar when the server gave her the glasses of sparkling wine, and turned to leave. The woman directly in her path stared at her with hostile jealousy for a moment before moving aside.</p><p>She dismissed the look without a second thought as she worked her way back up to the box. She\u2019d seen enough of those looks when she\u2019d been a whore in Terreille.</p><p>Maybe that accounted for the odd feeling she got from the Warlord and his interest in the bracelet. Maybe he\u2019d just been trying to find out where he could buy something similar and was nervous about his Lady seeing him talking to another woman. Besides, there was something about the woman in the moment when their eyes met that practically shouted \u201cpossessive bitch\u201d to someone who\u2019d spent her life quickly sizing up rivals, enemies, and prey.</p><p>Not her problem, she thought as Daemon opened the door enough for her to slip back into the box. Noticing the unhappiness lurking in his eyes before he took the glass she offered, she almost said something, but the house lights began fading as a warning that the second act was about to begin.</p><p>No, the Warlord and the bitch weren\u2019t her problem\u2014not when she had a bigger, and more dangerous, one sitting beside her.</p> <p>3</p><p>Surreal waited until they\u2019d enjoyed the appetizers at the dining house Daemon had chosen for their after-theater meal.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cThe play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, about what\u2019s going on between you and Jaenelle that\u2019s making you so unhappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it alone, Surreal,\u201d he said, his voice turning icy and razor-edged.</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cCan\u2019t, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about Falonar?\u201d he countered.</p><p>She hissed.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Smiling, he raised his wineglass in a salute. Then he looked down at his plate\u2014and sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll talk if you will.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. The least said about Falonar to any male in her family the better. But . . . \u201cI have your word you won\u2019t do anything to him? Anything?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the fact that he thought about it for several seconds before inclining his head in agreement.</p><p>Pushing her plate aside, she folded her arms on the table. Not a ladylike posture, but it let her lean closer to him. It occurred to her that they could have this entire conversation on a psychic thread to keep it silent and private, but it felt necessary to give the words the weight of sound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not what he wanted,\u201d she said, feeling the sting of the truth.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a beautiful, intelligent, talented woman?\u201d</p><p>Realizing Daemon meant what he\u2019d said eased the sting a little. She tried to smile. \u201cHe wants a Marian. Not Marian, \u201d she added quickly, seeing the instant chill in Daemon\u2019s eyes. \u201cThe things that intrigued him enough initially for him to offer to share his eyrie with me were the same things that eventually stuck in his throat. Hell\u2019s fire, Sadi, I\u2019m not going to apologize for what I\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t get past the fact that you used to be paid for sex?\u201d Daemon asked too softly.</p><p>\u201cSince he wasn\u2019t offering to be anything more than my lover, that didn\u2019t bother him. Well, not much. And he certainly appreciated my . . . skills.\u201d She sighed. \u201cNo, what rubbed the wrong way was my skill with a knife\u2014and the fact that an assassin doesn\u2019t worry about sticky details like letting the prey know he\u2019s about to be turned into carrion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a competitor.\u201d</p><p>She sat back as the dishes vanished and the server brought the main course. She savored the taste of a perfectly cooked filet before going back to a subject that would ruin her appetite.</p><p>\u201cI was a competitor,\u201d she agreed. \u201cFalonar could be indulgent about the Eyrien witches learning to use weapons to defend themselves because none of them will ever have enough skill to be a rival to him. And they were only learning because Lucivar insisted on it, not because they wanted to. But I wanted to improve skills I already had\u2014and killing is what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since Falonar wears a Sapphire Jewel and you wear the Gray, he wasn\u2019t stronger than you in that arena,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cThere are plenty of men who have lovers who wear darker Jewels than they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalonar wants a woman who looks at him and sees a protector, a defender. He wants someone who needs his strength, someone whose talents are . . . gentler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Daemon asked as he dipped a piece of lobster into the bowl of clarified butter.</p><p>Surreal studied him warily. \u201cI didn\u2019t say there was someone in particular.\u201d</p><p>Daemon just smiled and continued eating.</p><p>She concentrated on her own meal for a few minutes. Then she sighed. \u201cNurian. She\u2019s a Healer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s Eyrien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how deep Falonar\u2019s feelings about her run, but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s in love with him. Over the winter, things changed between him and me. Lots of sex and not much else. Some snide comments about my snip-ping off balls because I wanted a pair of my own. And for the record, I\u2019d rather have the discomfort of moontimes than carry what you\u2019ve got between your legs.\u201d</p><p>He just raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cMoon\u2019s blood only throws me offstride three days out of a month. A cock makes a man potentially stupid at any hour of any day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have such faith in the male gender,\u201d he said blandly.</p><p>\u201cI made a good living because cocks make men stupid,\u201d she countered, picking up her glass to sip her wine.</p><p>\u201cAnd Falonar\u2019s cock kept pointing in Nurian\u2019s direction?\u201d</p><p>She clamped a hand over her mouth to keep from spraying wine all over the table. \u201cNow that\u2019s a picture,\u201d she said when she finally managed to swallow. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t that obvious. Mostly because I was in the way,\u201d she added softly.</p><p>Daemon nodded. \u201cA Gray-Jeweled witch who is skilled with a knife . . . and is also related to Lucivar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Falonar couldn\u2019t figure out how to step back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably afraid that if you didn\u2019t rip his balls off, Lucivar would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you told him things weren\u2019t working between you and packed your bags.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSeemed the only thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love him?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then shook her head. \u201cI felt . . . special . . . for a little while. I\u2019ve had sex with hundreds of men over the centuries, but I\u2019ve never had a lover. I\u2019m feeling bruised, but I\u2019m not heartbroken over it.\u201d</p><p>Dipping the last piece of lobster into the butter, Daemon held it out to her. \u201cSomeday you\u2019ll find a man worthy of you.\u201d</p><p>She looked into his eyes, scared that she\u2019d see some underlying message. What she saw was the warm affection of an older brother. She took the bite from his fork.</p><p>Easing back, she enjoyed the warmth for a moment before saying, \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>He set his fork on his plate with painful care. Then he picked up his wine and studied it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m losing her,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing wrong, but . . . I\u2019m losing her.\u201d</p><p>Surreal stiffened. \u201cWhat you are talking about?\u201d</p><p>His voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m no longer what Jaenelle wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she snapped. \u201cJust wait.\u201d She studied the misery in his eyes. \u201cYou really believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t comfortable being around me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Surreal shook her head. \u201cI agree something isn\u2019t right between you, but, Daemon, I\u2019m sure it isn\u2019t that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were only at the Hall a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was long enough to know you\u2019re going down the wrong path if you think Jaenelle doesn\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, shutting her out, but not before she saw the pain and desperation he was choking back.</p><p>She reached across the table and took his hand. Worry spiked through her when his fingers curled around hers in a fierce hold, a sure sign he was looking for reassurance.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t talk to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes, disbelief warring with hope.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to wager a year\u2019s income that her feelings haven\u2019t changed,\u201d Surreal said. \u201cAnd I know yours haven\u2019t changed. So maybe the reason she can\u2019t talk to you is because you have a cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had a cock,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cRight. And there are things you might admit to another man you\u2019d never admit to a woman. And there are things a woman might say to another woman that she would never say to a man\u2014especially a man she loves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be in Amdarh a few more days, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have some things to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You go tend to things, and I\u2019ll go back to the Hall and have a little chat with Jaenelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think she\u2019ll talk to you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to give her a choice. Which wasn\u2019t something she intended to ever tell Daemon, so she gave him a sassy smile. \u201cBecause I know the opening line to this little play.\u201d She eased her fingers out of his grip and patted his hand. \u201cTrust me. And signal the server to bring over the dessert tray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see the way he fed her that bite of lobster?\u201d Roxie said, sighing. \u201cThat\u2019s like something from a love story. He\u2019s sooo romantic.\u201d</p><p>Tavey frowned. \u201cIf you wanted to taste some of my dinner, why didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d</p><p>Watching Daemon, Lektra wanted to smash all the plates and glasses on the table. How could he betray her like that? How could he sit there, in public, and fawn over a whore. She was the one who was working to free him from that useless cripple, Jaenelle. He shouldn\u2019t be playing with another woman. He shouldn\u2019t even be thinking of another woman. It was so . . . sluttish. When he was hers, she\u2019d make sure he severed all association with that bitch, Surreal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hands curled into fists as she watched Surreal take his hand.</p><p>How could he be so lost to propriety that he\u2019d let a woman touch him like that? He might as well stand on the table and announce he was going to drop his pants for his \u201ccousin\u201d as soon as they got behind closed doors.</p><p>If they even waited that long.</p><p>Selfish bastard.</p> <p>Well, she\u2019d still have him because she loved him. Besides, he was beautiful and was, no doubt, magnificent in bed. But he was obviously more ripe to belong to another woman than she\u2019d realized, so she was going to have to fan the flames and ruin his reputation faster, and more thoroughly, than she\u2019d intended if she wanted to be sure he didn\u2019t accept another offer from a woman who just wanted to use him.</p><p>Yes, she had to save him before he tumbled into any other bed but hers.</p><p>SIX</p><p>The next morning, rumors seeped through Amdarh\u2019s marketplace as the servants who worked in aristo households gathered to take care of the day\u2019s shopping. Arguments broke out between those who declared they weren\u2019t surprised by the news that Daemon Sadi had abandoned the pose of still being the faithful, devoted lover of the former Queen of Ebon Askavi and those who hotly denied there could be any truth to Prince Sadi taking a lover, let alone escorting her to such a public place as a theater.</p><p>But they all took those rumors back to their respective houses to chew over with their fellow servants.</p> <p>By midday, the stories trickled through the shopping district. Some merchants worried that the aristo Blood, especially those who served in Lady Zhara\u2019s court, would take their business away from any shop that was patronized by Prince Sadi. Other merchants, who counted several members of the SaDiablo family as regular customers, paled at the news\u2014and wondered how much of Amdarh would be left if Lucivar Yaslana found out about his brother\u2019s supposed betrayal of the Queen they\u2019d both served.</p><p>By evening, the rumors had reached the ears of the aristo Blood and were the main topic during the evening meals. Some defended Prince Sadi, saying he would never insult Jaenelle Angelline by taking a lover while she was still living with him at the Hall. Some defended him by insisting he wasn\u2019t breaking any vows by taking a lover, that Jaenelle was now nothing more than a family member who required care, and no matter what their relationship had been, it was no longer of a nature that demanded celibacy from a Warlord Prince. Others argued that, even if taking a lover could be excused under the circumstances, holding hands with her in a dining house was hardly discreet.</p><p>No matter what anyone thought of Daemon Sadi\u2019s behavior, they all pitied Jaenelle Angelline, who had sacrificed her body and her Jewels in order to save Kaeleer and was now being abandoned by the only man she\u2019d ever cared for enough to take as a lover.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>1</p><p>Surreal walked into Jaenelle\u2019s sitting room and came to an abrupt stop when she saw the shoes scattered around the room. Jaenelle stood in the middle of the room, holding a pair of soft leather house shoes. Color brightened her face, and her eyes sparkled.</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jaenelle said excitedly. \u201cI can call in my shoes.\u201d</p><p>Pity squeezed Surreal\u2019s heart, but she smiled as she walked over to Jaenelle. \u201cWell, that\u2019s . . . wonderful.\u201d Or would be if Jaenelle was a child learning basic Craft.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Jaenelle dropped the shoes, then held out her hands. A moment later, a pair of boots hovered in the air. She took the boots and grinned. \u201cI decided it was time to find out what I can do with Twilight\u2019s Dawn.\u201d</p><p>A year ago you could do things the rest of the Blood couldn\u2019t even dream of doing, Surreal thought sadly as she looked at the shoes. And now you\u2019re excited about being able to do basic Craft. Ah, sugar.</p><p>Trying to think of something to say that would be encouraging, she looked into Jaenelle\u2019s eyes. It took everything in her not to stumble back a step or two.</p><p>No delight in those sapphire eyes now. There was strength there, power there. Those eyes were cold, feral, and filled with deadly anger.</p><p>Then Ladvarian trotted into the room, and Jaenelle looked away.</p><p>Witch, Surreal thought as she fought to hide a shiver of fear. She hadn\u2019t expected to see that look in Jaenelle\u2019s eyes ever again\u2014and wasn\u2019t sure what to think about seeing it now.</p> <p>Ladvarian sniffed the shoes on the floor, then looked at Jaenelle. *Why is Surreal calling in your shoes?*</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d Jaenelle said quietly, dropping the boots. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>*You called in your shoes?*</p><p>Jaenelle shrugged, a quiet sadness draining the color from her face, leaving her looking ill and frail.</p><p>*You called in your shoes!* Ladvarian\u2019s tail wagged madly while he danced in place. *You could never do that before!*</p><p>Jaenelle smiled reluctantly. \u201cNo, I never could.\u201d</p><p>That admission startled Surreal. Ladvarian was right. Jaenelle never could call in her own shoes. It was a standing joke in the family and the First Circle that Jaenelle could move an entire library of leather-bound books without any effort at all but couldn\u2019t call in something to put on her feet.</p><p>Ladvarian shot upward, hovering on air so that he was face-to-face with Jaenelle. *The kindred will still fetch your shoes during the moondays when you can\u2019t use Craft, but the rest of the days you can call in your own shoes,* he said happily.</p><p>Jaenelle smiled as her hands cupped the Sceltie\u2019s furry face. \u201cYes, I can.\u201d</p><p>*And you won\u2019t have to wear the wrong shoes because we didn\u2019t pick the right ones.*</p><p>Well, Surreal thought, that explained why Jaenelle\u2019s shoes hadn\u2019t always matched the rest of her outfit.</p><p>\u201cI never said you chose the wrong shoes,\u201d Jaenelle said softly.</p><p>*You didn\u2019t tell us because you love us.*</p><p>Jaenelle rested her forehead against the dog\u2019s. \u201cYes, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Surreal swallowed the lump that was suddenly lodged in her throat. Shit shit shit. Hadn\u2019t she learned anything from seeing the kindred\u2019s unshakable loyalty and belief in Jaenelle? She had felt pity and had spoiled Jaenelle\u2019s pleasure in successfully performing a bit of Craft. Ladvarian was simply delighted\u2014and had recognized that Jaenelle wasn\u2019t regaining a piece of skill that was lost, she was exploring new ground.</p><p>*I have to tell Kaelas!* Ladvarian bounded out of the room.</p><p>\u201cBy tonight, all the kindred who were part of the Dark Court will know you can call in your shoes,\u201d Surreal said dryly.</p><p>Jaenelle grinned. \u201cDo you think it will take that long?\u201d Then the grin faded. \u201cI thought you were going to stay in Amdarh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came back to talk to you.\u201d She took a deep breath and let it out slowly\u2014and hoped she wouldn\u2019t see that cold, feral anger leap into Jaenelle\u2019s eyes again. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong between you and Daemon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you can mend.\u201d</p><p>Surreal reached out, her fingertips just brushing the sleeve of Jaenelle\u2019s robe. \u201cTalk to me. Mother Night, Jaenelle, the man is eating his heart out because he doesn\u2019t know why you\u2019re pushing him out of your life.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle turned away. \u201cFor his sake.\u201d Her voice was a pained whisper. \u201cSo he isn\u2019t trapped into staying with a woman he no longer wants just because everyone else expects him to remain loyal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrapped, my ass,\u201d Surreal snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re who he wants. You\u2019re who he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted and needed what I was,\u201d Jaenelle snapped back. \u201cBut what I am now?\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDo you still love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it matters! You love him. He loves you. Why are you throwing him out of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me!\u201d Jaenelle shouted, jabbing a finger toward her chest. \u201cI\u2019m healed, Surreal. Completely healed. But he can\u2019t bring himself to touch me, can\u2019t even bear to hold my hand. Why should he be chained to someone who repulses him when he\u2019s s-so damn beautiful it hurts just to look at him and remember what it was like when he w-wanted . . .\u201d</p><p>Shocked, Surreal just stood and stared. Then she shook her head. She didn\u2019t doubt Jaenelle believed what she said, but that didn\u2019t tally up with what Daemon believed.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know you\u2019re completely healed?\u201d Surreal asked. \u201cAnd by completely, you do mean completely?\u201d</p><p>A gleam of anger flashed in Jaenelle\u2019s eyes again. \u201cI don\u2019t need his pity any more than I need yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you haven\u2019t told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have him feel obligated to service his former Queen?\u201d Jaenelle smiled bitterly. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Surreal raked her fingers through her hair. Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. If Daemon found out that this was why Jaenelle was pulling away from him, he\u2019d explode six times over. And that was only if he retained a measure of self-control.</p><p>Dropping her hands to her hips, she sighed. \u201cAll right, sugar. Strip. Let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got to work with.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle stared at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. Strip.\u201d</p><p>Doubt filled Jaenelle\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, since you\u2019re not thinking straight anyway. Come on. You don\u2019t have anything I don\u2019t see in the mirror every day.\u201d</p><p>More hesitation.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Surreal said, turning around. \u201cI won\u2019t watch.\u201d And it will give me time to brace myself in case there are any nasty surprises.</p><p>Silence. Then, finally, the sound of clothes being removed.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>Surreal turned around. Stared. Frowned. Circled slowly to study Jaenelle from the back before continuing the circle until they were facing each other again.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll play the game. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkinny. You were always slender, but now you\u2019re skinny.\u201d Surreal tipped her head to one side. \u201cDespite that, you\u2019ve got a decent pair of tits and a nice ass.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle just gaped at her.</p><p>She growled in frustration. Jaenelle had picked a lousy time to become sensitive about her appearance. \u201cYou need to eat more to fill out a bit, need to start working out to build up and shape your muscles again. Lucivar can help with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Jaenelle said, looking away. \u201cI asked him. He said no.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to help. Trust me.\u201d Surreal picked up the robe and handed it to Jaenelle. \u201cAs for the rest, we\u2019re going to Amdarh tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard of a new place that opened a few months ago. Pure female indulgence. Manicures, pedicures, massages, the works. We can even stay there, so we don\u2019t have to bundle all the appointments together. The place even has shops.\u201d She held up a hand before Jaenelle could grumble about shopping. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to get your hair trimmed so that it has some style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was growing it out,\u201d Jaenelle protested, one hand reaching up protectively.</p> <p>\u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean you have to look shaggy,\u201d Surreal countered. \u201cAnd, yes, some new clothes. Something that fits. Not a lot since you\u2019ll grow back into your former wardrobe, but enough to cover different activities until then.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd then, once you look like you again instead of a stray wearing hand-me-downs, you\u2019ll go to the town house and see Daemon. And you\u2019ll tell him in direct, simple words that you are completely healed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>If you can\u2019t guess how Daemon will react to that . . . She shrugged. \u201cThen you\u2019ll know the truth, one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle sighed. \u201cSo what do we do today?\u201d</p><p>Surreal gave her friend a knife-edged smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a chat with Lucivar.\u201d</p> <p>2</p><p>Smiling, Surreal waved Lucivar into Daemon\u2019s study. She put a Gray lock on the door as she closed it, and by the time he turned to face her, she\u2019d called in her crossbow and had it aimed below his belt.</p><p>He studied her for a moment, then growled, \u201cWhat\u2019s this all about? You asked me to come here, so I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Surreal replied, still smiling. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to talk, and you\u2019re going to listen. If you don\u2019t listen, I\u2019ll shoot you with this little crossbow arrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuarrel.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to quarrel. I\u2019m going to talk, and you\u2019re going to listen\u2014or I\u2019ll pin your balls to the wall.\u201d She didn\u2019t have any chance of actually hitting him. She wore Gray; he wore Ebon-gray. The moment he sensed the Gray lock on the door, he\u2019d put an Ebon-gray shield around himself. There was nothing she could do that would get an arrow through that shield, but the threat warned him that she wasn\u2019t going to let him dismiss what she had to say.</p> <p>Lucivar shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s called a \u2018quarrel\u2019 or a \u2018bolt,\u2019 not a \u2018little crossbow arrow.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Her face flushed. Falonar, you son of a whoring bitch.</p><p>\u201cI guess Falonar didn\u2019t mention that when he agreed to teach you how to use a crossbow,\u201d Lucivar said, giving her a thoughtful look, as if a few pieces of a puzzle had just fallen into place.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaenelle.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her, then stopped and looked at the crossbow. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to start training again to rebuild her strength. You\u2019re going to help her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Swearing viciously, he turned away and paced, giving her searing looks every time he turned in her direction.</p><p>\u201cLucivar?\u201d Surreal said quietly. \u201cHow long are you going to keep her an invalid? How long are you going to block her from being strong enough to stand on her own again?\u201d</p><p>He charged toward her, stopping before she was within reach. \u201cYou bitch! How dare you?\u201d</p><p>She lowered the crossbow. \u201cI dare because I love her too.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, fury in his eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s too frail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not as frail as you think.\u201d She saw hope, confusion, fear. \u201cI understand that you\u2019re afraid of doing anything that might hurt her. I really do. But she needs you, Lucivar. She needs your help to regain what she lost.\u201d</p><p>Pain now as he looked away. \u201cNot everything she lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not everything.\u201d She vanished the crossbow and took a step toward him. \u201cShe learned how to call in her shoes today.\u201d</p><p>He snapped to attention, surprising her. \u201cJaenelle called in her shoes? She could never do that before.\u201d He walked over to the desk and leaned back against it. After staring at the floor for a long moment, he sighed. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll take her through a warm-up. We\u2019ll see after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you gave in so easily,\u201d Surreal said, joining him at the desk.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMarian\u2019s been muttering similar things over the past few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou married a smart woman.\u201d</p><p>His only response was a grunt. Then he turned his head and studied her. \u201cAre you coming back to Ebon Rih, or do you want to stay here for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I had my eye on the town house in Amdarh. I\u2019ve missed city living.\u201d When she came to Kaeleer, she\u2019d ended up signing a contract to serve the Prince of Ebon Rih, so, technically, Lucivar could demand that she go back to Ebon Rih with him.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really want to watch Falonar make kissy faces at Nurian.\u201d</p><p>Temper flared in his eyes, confirming that Falonar hadn\u2019t wasted any time declaring his interest in the Eyrien Healer. \u201cI can take care of that.\u201d</p><p>Being related to Warlord Princes was such a joy. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the same thing I told Daemon. If I\u2019d wanted him dead, he wouldn\u2019t still be among the living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwisting his cock off wouldn\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>Surreal laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I like about you, Lucivar. You\u2019re so subtle.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a grudging smile before he pushed away from the desk. \u201cUnlock the damn door so I can see Jaenelle and decide if I should be pissed off with myself for being wrong or with you for being right.\u201d</p><p>She released the Gray lock on the door, watched him walk out\u2014and hoped.</p><p>Seeing Jaenelle\u2019s hesitant pleasure as he handed her the Eyrien sparring stick bruised Lucivar\u2019s heart.</p><p>Are you sure you\u2019re not clipping her wings instead of helping her learn how to fly again?</p><p>Had Marian been right about that? Had they placed Jaenelle in a cage because they were so afraid of letting her do anything that might harm that terrifyingly frail body? They\u2019d done it for the best of reasons, and certainly out of love, but a cage was still a cage.</p><p>\u201cPartnered warm-up,\u201d he said, taking his position in front of Jaenelle. \u201cGo easy. Don\u2019t push. When you feel tired, we\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>He mirrored her slow movements, always watching, always assessing. She remembered the moves, but couldn\u2019t complete any of them. Not fully. Choppy motion where there had once been fluid grace. She began panting by the time they\u2019d gone through the first third of the warm-up. By the halfway point, her arms and legs shook from the effort to shift from one move to the next.</p><p>Then one end of her stick hit the floor, and she used its support to stay on her feet. Refusing to look at him, she shuffled to the couch and sank down on the cushion at one end.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were right.\u201d</p><p>He took her stick, vanished it along with his, then crouched in front of her. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d He waited until she looked at him. \u201cDo you remember when you went into the Twisted Kingdom to mark a trail for Daemon to follow? Your body was already strained from healing the landens who had been trapped by a jhinka attack, and by the time you got back to the Keep after finding Daemon, you\u2019d made a mess of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d she whispered, staring at her hands.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as you were able to stand on your own, we started working to rebuild your muscles and your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d She looked weary, defeated.</p><p>He placed one hand lightly over hers. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get half as far that first time as you did today. So the point, Cat, is I\u2019m sorry. I wanted you to come back to us so much, it got in the way. I clipped your wings instead of helping you learn how to fly again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be my sparring partner again?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll get there. I\u2019ll come back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cCan\u2019t tomorrow. Surreal and I are going to Amdarh for what she calls a female indulgence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying at the town house?\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle shook her head. \u201cSurreal says it\u2019s easier to be pampered if we stay at that . . . whatever it is. Besides, Daemon\u2019s at the town house right now.\u201d</p><p>So? He didn\u2019t ask because there was something odd about her tone. Something . . . nervous. And Daemon had become edgy over the past few weeks\u2014and subtly territorial in a way that made all the male servants at the Hall wary of drawing his attention. \u201cThen let me know when you get back.\u201d</p><p>He stayed at the Hall long enough to assure Surreal he\u2019d start working with Jaenelle once the two women got back from their female indulgence, whatever that meant, then caught the Winds and headed for Ebon Rih. But before he went home, he stopped at the Keep to have a little chat with his father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>EIGHT</p><p>1</p><p>Baffled by the worried glances he\u2019d gotten from the servants and too restless to stay inside, Daemon left the town house shortly after breakfast, walking aimlessly until the shops opened. Then he headed for the bookshop where he could fill an hour or two browsing. Since love stories had lost their appeal, maybe he could find something else Jaenelle would find intriguing\u2014and find something for himself that would catch his interest enough to keep him occupied while he waited for some word from Surreal.</p><p>After she left for the Hall yesterday morning, he\u2019d summoned Marcus and had exhausted the energy and patience of his man of business by reviewing every possible business transaction that might come up in the next few weeks. If Surreal succeeded in finding out what was troubling Jaenelle, if she actually managed to fix the problem so that Jaenelle wanted his company again, he wasn\u2019t going to allow anything to intrude on his time with his Lady.</p> <p>But he needed to keep busy until he heard from her\u2014or from Jaenelle. Maybe he\u2019d contact Lucivar and invite him to dinner. Or go to the Keep and spend a few hours with his father. He\u2019d been choking on his fear of losing Jaenelle but had said nothing to anyone except Surreal. Now . . . Maybe he should get another male\u2019s opinion? But Lucivar would be too blunt and probably have the unfortunate effect of honing a temper that didn\u2019t need honing. Saetan, however, might be able to offer an insight into Jaenelle\u2019s emotional retreat . . . or even an assurance that it was a stage of healing and would pass. Maybe . . . Maybe even talking to Saetan about the nightmare that kept plaguing him might help, although lately, the erotic dreams were giving him more physical and emotional discomfort.</p><p>Shaking off those thoughts, he entered the bookshop and smiled at the owner\u2014and wondered why the man\u2019s eyes cooled at the sight of him and the usual smile of greeting looked forced.</p><p>\u201cPrince Sadi.\u201d The shopkeeper sounded like he\u2019d swallowed glass. \u201cYou\u2019ve come for the books I was holding for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014and a few others,\u201d Daemon replied, starting to turn away from the counter to browse the shelves. He\u2019d give the love stories to Marian. She and Jaenelle often exchanged books, so he knew she\u2019d enjoy them.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p> <p>The reluctance in the shopkeeper\u2019s voice stopped Daemon and had him turning back to study the man.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want me here, Daemon thought, stung by the unexpected reaction to his presence.</p><p>Feeling a hint of ice brush the edge of his temper, he walked to a part of the shop where the shelves hid the shopkeeper from view. For the sake of past, and possibly future, courtesy, it was better to keep his distance until the desire to shred the shopkeeper\u2019s skin passed. After all, the man could be upset about something that had nothing to do with him.</p><p>Dismissing the shopkeeper for the time being, he began perusing the shelves of fiction, skipping over the love stories and straightforward adventures, and finally stopping at a section that looked interesting.</p><p>Pulling a book from the shelf, he read the first page and choked back a laugh. By the time he got to the fourth page, he was leaning comfortably against the shelves and grinning. The heroine was a Blood female named Tracker, a musician by trade, whose companion was a Purple Dusk Sceltie Warlord named Shadow. The village they lived in was clearly modeled on the village of Maghre, and the Warlord who ruled the village and requested their assistance in solving a mystery . . .</p><p>Did Khardeen know about these stories? He\u2019d send Khary a brief note this evening. It would be a good way to respond to the note he\u2019d received from the Warlord of Maghre last week. Khary\u2019s note had been nothing more than a few sentences about horses, but he\u2019d understood the significance of the note coming to him rather than Jaenelle. His actions during the time Jaenelle needed to create her spells to save Kaeleer had broken the friendships that had developed between him and the other males in Jaenelle\u2019s First Circle. Since then, they\u2019d all been coldly civil with him. Khary\u2019s note was the first sign of any willingness to try to repair those friendships.</p> <p>Closing the book, Daemon checked the shelves and found two others by the same author that featured Tracker and Shadow. He took those, too. Even if the mystery part of the story didn\u2019t end up being sufficiently compelling, the author\u2019s understanding of human-kindred relationships was certainly entertaining.</p><p>As he crouched to look at another book, he heard two women, speaking in low, urgent tones, walk up to the other side of the shelves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, I tell you,\u201d one woman said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d the other replied, sounding oddly defiant. \u201cAnd accusing a man of infidelity without proof is irresponsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was seen, in public, with the bitch he\u2019s bedding. How much more proof do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d heard she was his cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer being one thing doesn\u2019t exclude her being the other.\u201d</p><p>A hesitation. \u201cNo. I\u2019m certain this is all a dreadful misunderstanding. You only had to look at him last winter to see he was in love with his Queen. He wouldn\u2019t betray her now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d the first woman said darkly.</p><p>Her companion sighed. \u201cDid you want a book from this section?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just wanted to get away from the shopkeeper to finish telling you what I\u2019d heard. The way he kept shushing us was most annoying\u2014and peculiar. I don\u2019t usually come to this shop, and I\u2019m not sure I will again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go. I already have my selections.\u201d</p><p>When he no longer sensed the women\u2019s presence in the shop, Daemon stood up and took his books to the counter. As he waited for the shopkeeper to return from another part of the shop, he thought about what he\u2019d overheard.</p><p>Poor bastard. An accusation of infidelity could rip a man\u2019s life apart. Marriage was the prized partnership\u2014a commitment of the heart rather than a contract for the body and sexual skills. Being branded unfaithful could not only cost a man his marriage, he could lose his children as well. A few hurtful words could destroy everything that mattered to him.</p><p>\u201cPrince.\u201d The shopkeeper approached the counter, gray-faced and trembling.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Daemon asked. \u201cAre you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The man swallowed hard. \u201cIs this everything?\u201d</p><p>Since the man didn\u2019t want any assistance, at least from him, Daemon waited until the price of the books was tallied and added to his account. Then he initialed the account, vanished the books, and left the shop.</p><p>As he walked to Banard\u2019s shop, bafflement shifted into irritation as male acquaintances he passed on the street avoided looking at him or responding to a greeting and the women gave him hostile stares before pointedly looking away, making it clear they didn\u2019t want any connection with him. When he walked into Banard\u2019s shop, the three people already there, including a Priestess who served in Lady Zhara\u2019s court, turned away from the display cases and walked out without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell is wrong with everyone today?\u201d Daemon snarled as he approached the glass display case that served as a counter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come for the rings?\u201d Banard asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve come for the rings.\u201d</p><p>Banard cupped his hands over the display case. When he lifted his hands, two velvet-lined ring boxes rested on the glass.</p><p>Everything else was forgotten as Daemon picked up what he hoped would be Jaenelle\u2019s wedding ring. Simple and fluid, it held a sapphire flanked by rubies.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d he murmured, setting it back in its box before examining the other ring. Just a plain gold band. No etching in the gold or fancy embellishments. He didn\u2019t need those things, didn\u2019t want those things. All he wanted, everything he wanted, was what that ring would stand for when Jaenelle put it on his finger.</p><p>Closing both boxes, he vanished them and smiled at Banard.</p><p>Banard didn\u2019t return the smile. \u201cSome distressing rumors have spread throughout Amdarh.\u201d</p><p>Hearing a warning under the words, Daemon inclined his head. \u201cI believe I heard a bit of it this morning. Do you think it\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Banard\u2019s certainty surprised Daemon, but before he could phrase a question, the jeweler added, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have asked me to make those rings if the rumors were true.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment, he just stared at Banard, unable to make sense of the words. Then cold rage flowed through him, sweet and deadly.</p><p>\u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d Daemon said too softly.</p><p>As he walked back to the town house, he took mental note of every person who shunned him and every person who made a point of acknowledging him. He saw everything . . . and he saw nothing because the city had faded behind a soft mist that held a terrible clarity.</p><p>2</p><p>Arms linked, Surreal and Jaenelle strolled to the registration desk at the far end of the two-story atrium that was decorated to feel tranquil and lush\u2014and was a clear signal that pampering Ladies was a serious business.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Jaenelle said, looking around with wide eyes. \u201cAre there really enough female indulgences to take up a place this size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d Surreal replied, biting back a smile when Jaenelle groaned. The place was built on a much grander scale, but it reminded her of Deje\u2019s Red Moon house in Chaillot, Terreille\u2014and made her wonder, since there were guest rooms, if there were a few accommodations that weren\u2019t advertised. Not that sex was on her list of indulgences right now. Not for herself, anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get settled in our suite, then I\u2019ll make the appointments for our pampering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love it.

There are other shops in Amdarh, and I\u2019m certain this establishment isn\u2019t the only place that has people skilled at trimming and styling hair.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure which was more fascinating\u2014the way Jaenelle bloodlessly gutted the little prick with a few words or the way the little prick scrambled to rectify his error when he recognized the golden-haired woman standing in front of him.</p> <p>A minute later, Surreal tucked the key into her pocket, linked arms with Jaenelle to provide support without being too obvious, and headed for their suite of rooms.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want us here,\u201d Jaenelle said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOh, he was thrilled to have you,\u201d Surreal replied. I\u2019m the one he looked at as if I was shit on his shoes. Now why is that, I wonder?</p><p>The ground-floor suite had its own small, heated pool off the sitting room as well as two bedrooms with private bathrooms. At least the little prick was smart enough to give them one of the best suites.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you rest for a bit while I go make the appointments?\u201d Surreal said as she walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to take care of things, Surreal?\u201d</p><p>Thinking Jaenelle hadn\u2019t heard her, she turned\u2014and saw the look in Witch\u2019s eyes. And understood Jaenelle wasn\u2019t talking about appointments.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou can count on it.\u201d</p> <p>She grabbed the first official-looking person she met, swung the other witch into a tiny alcove, and had the tip of her favorite stiletto tucked under the woman\u2019s chin before her prey had a chance to react.</p><p>\u201cListen up, sugar,\u201d Surreal said softly. \u201cMy cousin has spent months recovering from brutal injuries. Now that she\u2019s well enough, I brought her here for the kind of pampering I heard you specialize in. You understand me so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d the witch stammered.</p><p>\u201cWonderful. So here\u2019s the deal. Whatever problem you have with me, you bury it while she\u2019s here, and you give her the best you\u2019ve got. Because if you do anything to spoil this first outing, I\u2019m going to tell her father, her brother, and her lover that you made Jaenelle very, very unhappy. By the time those three are finished expressing their displeasure, I sincerely doubt there will be anything in this place big enough to qualify as a pebble. Is that clear enough?\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m going to set up some appointments and give you a little time to pass the word.\u201d Surreal vanished the stiletto and stepped back into the corridor. \u201cAnd, sugar? Jaenelle\u2019s male relatives aren\u2019t the only ones who are dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy toes will be rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love it. That polish will complement the sapphire jacket and trousers I saw in one of the shops we passed on the way to this room. We\u2019ll go there next so they\u2019ll have time to make any alterations by this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . rose toenails? Who\u2019s going to see them?\u201d</p><p>Daemon will when he\u2019s nibbling his way down your legs.</p><p>But there wasn\u2019t any reason to mention that right now.</p><p>\u201cMud? They\u2019re going to put mud on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever the kitties and I played stalk and pounce and we ended up muddy, everyone frowned about it.\u201d</p><p>Surreal grunted softly. Only Jaenelle referred to Jaal and Kaelas, a full-grown tiger and an eight-hundred-pound Arcerian cat, as \u201cthe kitties\u201d\u2014or voluntarily played games with them to keep their predatory skills honed.</p><p>\u201cSo why is this mud different?\u201d Jaenelle grumbled.</p><p>Stretched out on the other table, Surreal turned her head and opened one eye. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive.\u201d</p><p>Whispers rose and fell, an ebb and flow of sound as they went to their various appointments throughout the day. They pretended not to notice the way conversations stopped when they entered a room, pretended not to see the uneasy glances. It wasn\u2019t the fun, relaxing experience Surreal had wanted it to be, but it served its purpose. By late afternoon, Jaenelle\u2019s hair was trimmed and styled, her nails\u2014all of them\u2014were painted, and they\u2019d found enough clothing in the shops to suffice as a wardrobe for a few weeks.</p><p>Now, waiting for Jaenelle to return from the dressing room, Surreal studied a display of shawls. Two of them had the right colors to blend nicely with Jaenelle\u2019s new clothes and provide extra warmth if it was needed.</p><p>Her lips twitched. Well, extra warmth when Daemon wasn\u2019t wrapped around his Lady.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were here,\u201d a voice said.</p><p>Turning, Surreal studied Zhara, who was staring at her with an expression that was close to dislike but hadn\u2019t quite crossed that line. \u201cAnd you\u2019re here, too. Busy place.\u201d</p><p>Interesting, Surreal thought as Zhara moved closer. She doesn\u2019t want to talk to me, doesn\u2019t want to get close to me, but something is pushing her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard some disturbing rumors,\u201d Zhara said.</p><p>\u201cReally? Are you going to share them, or are you going to be another bitch whispering behind her hand?\u201d</p><p>Temper flared in Zhara\u2019s eyes. \u201cRemember who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Queen of Amdarh. And I\u2019m a witch who wears Gray Jewels. If push comes to shove, sugar, you\u2019re a corpse. So you want to tell me in plain words what\u2019s bothering you, or do you want to keep dancing around in the shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor that Daemon Sadi . . . that he . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Daemon?\u201d asked a midnight voice.</p><p>Reading the discomfort and embarrassment in Zhara\u2019s eyes before they both turned to face Jaenelle, Surreal suddenly had a good idea of what kind of rumors were going around. Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. There were better ways of committing suicide than starting a rumor like that about a man the Blood in Terreille had called the Sadist.</p><p>Of course, pissing off Witch wasn\u2019t a great idea either. Especially when that deadly anger was back in Jaenelle\u2019s sapphire eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Daemon?\u201d Jaenelle asked again, as if Zhara\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t told her plainly enough the reason for the whispers that had followed them all day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sure the rumors aren\u2019t true,\u201d Zhara said.</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s smile was razored ice. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Surreal asked as Jaenelle headed out of the shop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Daemon.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to stop Jaenelle, and she didn\u2019t offer to go with her. She didn\u2019t want to be around either one of them during that discussion.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was fun,\u201d she said, looking at Zhara. \u201cYou planning to do anything else today to create a firestorm in the city? I was thinking of doing something dull like reading or sleeping, but if you\u2019ve got your heart set on starting a gut-spilling slaughter, I\u2019m willing to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Zhara snapped.</p><p>You don\u2019t know who . . . and what . . . he is, Surreal thought. She shook her head. \u201cNever mind.\u201d It\u2019s too late anyway.</p><p>3</p><p>Daemon prowled the town house\u2019s sitting room. He would have preferred walking through the city to being caged in this room, but he couldn\u2019t tolerate one more cold look, one more silent condemnation.</p><p>The hurt went deep. The fear went deep. But the rage went much, much deeper.</p><p>Damn them all to the bowels of Hell. He\u2019d tried to fit in. Knowing the Queens in Dhemlan would be wary of a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince, he hadn\u2019t worn the Black when he came to Amdarh. At least, not in public. He\u2019d been courteous and civil, had done all the proper things a man was permitted to do when he was in an established relationship\u2014and only the things a man was permitted to do. What had that courtesy and civility gotten him? At the first slur to his reputation, they\u2019d condemned him of thinking more of his cock than the woman who had given everything she had to defend and protect all of them.</p><p>Jaenelle should have let them all die, should have let them all choke in the twisted, vicious cruelty Dorothea had spawned in Terreille before Witch had cleansed the taint of Dorothea and Hekatah out of the Blood. She should have\u2014</p><p>\u201cIs this the response of a Warlord Prince, to tuck his tail between his legs and hide in his lair instead of standing up for himself?\u201d</p><p>That wonderful, chilling midnight voice shivered over him. Despair clawed his heart, leaving it bleeding, as he turned around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mother Night. Jaenelle.</p><p>She was still painfully thin, but standing there, dressed in a rose silk shirt and soft sapphire jacket and trousers, she looked like the woman he\u2019d known and loved before she\u2019d torn both of their lives apart to save Kaeleer. She looked like the Queen of Ebon Askavi, strong and powerful, despite the fact that it was Twilight\u2019s Dawn and not a Black or Ebony Jewel hanging from the gold chain around her neck.</p><p>And her eyes . . . Feral. Angry.</p><p>Witch. The living myth. Dreams made flesh.</p> <p>He wanted to kneel before her, wanted to surrender everything he was and could ever be, wanted to offer his life in any way she would have him.</p><p>But she\u2019d obviously heard the rumors. She knew what was being said about him. That\u2019s what had brought her here. Someone\u2019s vicious lies had created a chasm between them, and if he didn\u2019t find a way to bridge that distance, if he lost her now . . .</p><p>Despair and fury twisted together, became a roar of pain. \u201cI have not been unfaithful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Jaenelle replied. \u201cI know you, Daemon. I know you. Even if there had been no hope of me healing, you would have stayed with me, celibate and faithful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I would have. I love you.\u201d The bitterness under her words frightened him, but the fury was turning cold and sharp.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jaenelle looked away, adding, \u201cMaybe it would have been better if that weren\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d he asked too softly, taking a step toward her.</p><p>\u201cIf you were capable of infidelity, it would be easier to believe you were staying with me because you wanted to stay and not because you felt you had to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about you . . . and me.\u201d Pain flickered in Jaenelle\u2019s eyes before she looked away. \u201cI know I don\u2019t look . . . that a man wouldn\u2019t be attracted . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d He didn\u2019t think about it. He grabbed the back of a stuffed chair and let his rage flow.</p> <p>The chair exploded. Startled, Jaenelle stumbled back a step.</p><p>Daemon smiled bitterly. He\u2019d instinctively created a bubble shield to contain the debris so that nothing sprayed over the room, so that not even the smallest sliver would strike Jaenelle and possibly harm her.</p><p>But that release was enough to shift ice to heat, so he snapped the leash that held his temper. \u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been pushing me away? Because of how you look?\u201d He moved away from her, needing whatever distance he could get within the confines of the room as the insult churned through him. \u201cI waited for you my whole life. Yearned for you my whole life. After Tersa told me you were coming, I spent seven hundred years searching for you in the court of every Queen who had bought my service as a pleasure slave. I searched in every Territory in Terreille that was within reach of wherever I\u2019d been sent. For you. For Witch. For dreams made flesh. I never gave a damn what you might look like\u2014tall, short, fat, thin, plain, beautiful, ugly. Why would I care what you looked like? The flesh was the shell that housed the glory. It was a way to connect with you, please you, be with you. Even if I couldn\u2019t be your physical lover, there are other ways to be a lover, and I know them all. So don\u2019t stand there and tell me what I feel for you depends on how you look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it?\u201d Jaenelle snapped, her voice shaking with anger and hurt. \u201cI\u2019m healed, but you still can\u2019t bring yourself to touch me, can\u2019t even hold my hand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to?\u201d Daemon roared. \u201cI can\u2019t touch you!\u201d His breathing hitched, surprising him, as the guilt he\u2019d tried to lock away broke through. \u201cIt made me sick when I realized that no matter how careful I was, I couldn\u2019t touch you without hurting you, that even the lightest brush of my fingers left bruises smeared on your arms and hands, that when I helped you sit up in bed, there would be dark bruises in the shape of my hands on your back and shoulders. Every time I touched you, I hurt you, drained more of your strength because there was something else you had to heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d Jaenelle paused. Then she sighed. \u201cIn the beginning, that was true. Everything was so . . . frail . . . it didn\u2019t take much to cause damage. But I did heal. It\u2019s been months since I\u2019ve been that fragile.\u201d</p><p>He heard the words, but pain drove him now, forcing him to say what he\u2019d hoped he\u2019d never have to admit. \u201cYou suffered. Every moment you were awake, every move you made . . . you suffered.\u201d He still couldn\u2019t bear thinking of how much worse it had been when she\u2019d first risen from the healing webs. How had Ladvarian, Kaelas, and the rest of the kindred who had cared for her endured watching her suffer?</p><p>Tears filled his eyes. \u201cI understand why you want me out of your life. Sweetheart, I do understand. But I\u2019d hoped you could forgive me.\u201d</p> <p>Jaenelle\u2019s anger faded, but the hurt was still there. \u201cForgive you for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suffered . . . because of me. You rose up from the healing webs too soon . . . because of me.\u201d</p><p>Horror began filling her eyes. \u201cDaemon . . .\u201d</p><p>The tears fell. He choked back a sob. \u201cThey told me you would come back, but I didn\u2019t believe them. Couldn\u2019t believe them. I wanted you so much, needed you so much . . . and you came back too soon. Because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t true. The healing webs had done all they could and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d He waited, but she didn\u2019t deny it. She couldn\u2019t\u2014and they both knew it. \u201cYou could have stayed longer in the healing webs, could have given your body more time to mend. But you never could withstand a plea for help from someone you cared about. And a cry of pain from me?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou would have answered that cry no matter what it cost you. You paid the price for my doubts, and there was nothing I could do to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaemon . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to try another lie and tell me you didn\u2019t hear me calling to you in the abyss?\u201d he asked bitterly.</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s hands curled into fists. \u201cYes, I heard you. How could I not hear you? Begging. Pleading. I could feel you breaking under the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you rose out of the healing webs too soon and then discovered the flesh was barely able to survive despite how much healing had already been done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I rose too soon\u2014and then there was no going back. After that, the healing had to be done from within\u2014and done in a way that only I had the skill to do. But it wasn\u2019t just you, Daemon. Did you think you were the only voice calling to me, pleading with me to come back? You were one voice among hundreds. All of them wanting me to return. I could feel Lucivar\u2019s and Saetan\u2019s yearning, the coven\u2019s grief, the boyos fear that, without me there as a connection for all of them, the Shadow Realm would splinter again, that most of the kindred would retreat from human contact again. And the kindred ... They didn\u2019t want to let go of the dream either, and they held on with everything in them. All of you calling, pleading, hoping that love could do what shouldn\u2019t have been possible. Hell\u2019s fire, Daemon. I\u2019m a Healer. I know better than you ever will what happened to this flesh when I got hit with the backlash of power still left in those webs I\u2019d created. I knew the healing would be hideous and painful, and that after everything was done that could be done, I might not have anything better than a shell that would exist but never really be able to live.\u201d Jaenelle\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cBut sometimes,\u201d she added, her voice breaking, \u201clove is worth whatever price must be paid.\u201d</p><p>Daemon turned away. He should have felt relieved that it wasn\u2019t his fault\u2014at least, not his alone. But her words had numbed him. No pain now, no anger. Nothing. \u201cSo you loved them enough to come back.\u201d</p><p>A long silence. Then Jaenelle said, \u201cNo. I came back for you.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, not quite trusting enough to hope . . . or believe. But the emotional pain in her eyes now was more devastating than any physical suffering he\u2019d seen.</p><p>\u201cI came back for you,\u201d Jaenelle said, tears streaming down her face. \u201cBecause you were worth the price.\u201d</p><p>His heart ached as emotions flooded him. Pain. Pleasure. And the love. Oh, yes, the love. \u201cJaenelle.\u201d His legs trembled as he took the few steps that separated them. He raised his hand, intending to brush away the tears, but he was still afraid to touch her.</p><p>Jaenelle closed her eyes and took a few breaths before she looked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will ever be better than this, but I\u2019m healed, Daemon. Completely healed.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, trying to decipher what she was telling him. His heart pounded hard enough for him to feel the beat against his chest as his fingertips touched her cheek. Fever raged through him, settling between his legs. His mouth watered as he brushed a finger over her lips. He wanted his tongue there, slicking her mouth until he slipped inside to stroke her tongue. And after that he wanted to stroke . . .</p><p>Healed. Completely healed.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jaenelle nodded. \u201cI\u2019m completely healed. I have been for weeks now.\u201d</p><p>And she hadn\u2019t told him? Or had she tried in some hesitant way and he hadn\u2019t heard because he\u2019d been caged by the memories of her being so frail?</p><p>Weeks. She\u2019d been healed for weeks\u2014which is when he\u2019d begun having the erotic dreams, when his hunger for sex had reawakened. His body had known she was ready for him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he whispered. Same words. Different question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>His lips brushed hers, softly, carefully. One hand cupped the back of her head while the other trailed down her spine, urging her to relax against him. As he deepened the kiss, he savored the feel of his tongue caressing hers.</p><p>The taste of her. The smell of her. The feel . . .</p><p>He eased back in order to brush his lips over her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing too many clothes,\u201d he whispered. The tip of his tongue traced the curve of her ear, making her shiver. \u201cThey\u2019re lovely clothes, but they are very much in the way right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need . . . to talk,\u201d Jaenelle gasped as he licked the pulse in her neck.</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d he promised, drifting back to her mouth to give her a long, sinking kiss. \u201cIn an hour . . .\u201d Even through layers of clothing, her nipple hardened as he rubbed his thumb over it. \u201c... or two.\u201d</p><p>Then she wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed against him, changing his desire into something close to desperation. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said, his voice part snarl, part groan. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about anything you want tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Not giving her time to disagree, he picked her up and headed out of the sitting room, maintaining enough control to use Craft to simply open the door rather than rip it off the hinges. As he walked into the entrance hall, he gave his startled butler, Helton, a searing look. \u201cThe Lady and I are not at home. To anyone. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is very clear, Prince,\u201d Helton replied. \u201cShall I inform the cook that you will be dining upstairs this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when to send up a tray,\u201d Daemon replied, taking the stairs two at a time.</p><p>\u201cSomeone might think you\u2019re in a hurry,\u201d Jaenelle murmured.</p><p>The bedroom door flew open as they reached it and slammed shut behind them, the locks clicking into place.</p><p>Private now, with the bed only a step away, the fury of lust eased back to the steady blaze of desire.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d he crooned, setting her on her feet so that he could unbutton the sapphire jacket. \u201cThis is going to be a long . . . slow . . . banquet.\u201d He slipped the jacket off her shoulders, slid it down her arms. \u201cAnd I\u2019m planning to enjoy every single morsel.\u201d</p><p>Since that seemed to stun her, he took advantage of her lost wits to unbutton the rose silk shirt and slide that off her. The camisole beneath it was a paler rose and sheer enough to veil her breasts without really hiding them. So he let her keep it on a little longer while he enjoyed the feel of stroking her through the material until her skin warmed under his hands. Then he vanished the camisole, and there was nothing between his hands and her skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDaemon.\u201d His name ended in a moan as he gave her breasts a fleeting caress before opening her trousers and sliding them, and the whisper of material beneath them, down her legs. After vanishing her shoes and thin socks, he coaxed her into bed.</p><p>Walking around to the other side of the bed, he shrugged out of his jacket, letting it slide to the floor. It had been awhile since he\u2019d stripped with the intention of having a woman hot and willing to let him do whatever he wanted by the time he slid between the sheets, but the look in Jaenelle\u2019s eyes told him plainly enough he hadn\u2019t lost his touch.</p><p>She reached for him as soon as he got into bed, but he had other plans.</p><p>\u201cRoll over,\u201d he said, a hand on her shoulder guiding her to stretch out on her belly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Confused, she obeyed.</p><p>He started with her neck and worked down. What his fingers didn\u2019t touch, his mouth tasted. By the time he\u2019d licked his way down her spine, she was moaning. By the time his teeth gently scraped her calves, her skin was so sensitized to his touch, he didn\u2019t need more than warm breath to excite her.</p><p>Turning her over, he stroked her inner thighs and smiled at the painted toenails. Next round, he was going to have to admire them more closely. But judging by her glazed eyes and flushed skin, she was reaching the point where much more would become too much.</p><p>\u201cCome here, sweetheart.\u201d Rolling on his back, he settled her over him, sheathing his cock between her legs before coaxing her to stretch out over him. He wrapped his arms around her to keep her still.</p><p>\u201cDaemon.\u201d</p> <p>Wildly aroused by the hint of snarl in her voice, he kept his kisses viciously soft.</p><p>\u201cLet me do this, sweetheart,\u201d he whispered as he licked her throat. \u201cIt would destroy me if I hurt you now, so let me do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d She sounded breathless, almost too aroused.</p><p>In answer, he used Craft to create a phantom touch, something he\u2019d never done with her before because he\u2019d wanted to give her his body\u2014and because he\u2019d never used that phantom touch except to hurt someone . . . especially when he pleasured her. Now he wanted to use everything he was and everything he knew to please Jaenelle, so his hands stroked her back and his tongue kept hers busy while phantom fingers caressed the sweetness between her legs until her body bucked within his gently restraining arms, milking him as he sent her on that last wave of pleasure.</p><p>Limp and quivering, she sprawled over him. \u201cMother Night,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Brushing his lips against her forehead, Daemon just smiled and used Craft to pull up the covers. It might be spring, but it was still cool during the day, and the nights got cold. He wanted her to stay warm\u2014in every way.</p> <p>He waited until her heartbeat and breathing quieted. Still inside her, he was already swelling to fill her again, so he slid his hands down to gently knead her ass while a featherlight phantom touch played with her.</p><p>She finally raised her head. \u201cWould you teach me how to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d he purred.</p><p>\u201cYou know perfectly well what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you mean this?\u201d He increased the phantom touch enough to have her gasping as pleasure pulsed through her.</p><p>\u201cOoooohhhh, yes, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. We\u2019ll save that for dessert. Right now, I don\u2019t want you thinking about anything except what I\u2019m doing between your legs.\u201d</p><p>He used phantom hands to restrain her movements, but he let her ride him until she took them both over the edge.</p> <p>She was sound asleep moments after she stretched out beside him.</p><p>Tucking her against his chest to keep her warm, he breathed out a sigh of pleasure\u2014and slipped into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p><p>4</p><p>Catching her lower lip between her teeth, Roxie shifted on the cab\u2019s seat to find a comfortable position while she continued to watch the town house across the street. A few minutes after she\u2019d arrived, another horse-drawn cab had pulled up to the town house, and a woman who looked somewhat like Jaenelle Angelline had gotten out of the cab and entered the SaDiablo residence.</p><p>But it couldn\u2019t have been Jaenelle. For one thing, she wasn\u2019t supposed to come to Amdarh. For another, she wasn\u2019t supposed to be that . . . healthy. She was supposed to hear the rumors from some well-meaning acquaintance who had scurried to SaDiablo Hall to convey the news, but she wasn\u2019t supposed to come here and confront Daemon. What if he managed to talk Jaenelle out of breaking whatever ties remained between the two of them? What if he was doing a lot more than talking to convince Jaenelle to keep him?</p><p>No. Even that beautiful body, hot and ready for sex, wouldn\u2019t be enough reason for a woman to forgive a man for breaking faith with her in that way.</p><p>Of course, that didn\u2019t mean a woman wouldn\u2019t enjoy him before tossing him out of the house.</p><p>Two hours. If it was Jaenelle who had arrived at the town house, she should have left long before now\u2014even if Daemon had tried sex as a distraction from the accusations of infidelity. After all, even a man who\u2019d spent centuries as a pleasure slave couldn\u2019t spin out sex for two hours.</p><p>Could he?</p><p>The cab door suddenly opened, tearing her from that intriguing thought. She gasped and pressed herself against the back of the seat before she realized it was the driver standing there and not a member of the SaDiablo family.</p><p>\u201cDay\u2019s ended,\u201d the driver said roughly, giving her a less-than-friendly look. \u201cIf you want me to drop you somewhere on my way home, I\u2019ll do that. Otherwise, you can pay me for the time my horse has been standing and step out of my cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to leave,\u201d Roxie said, putting the kind of aristo haughtiness in her voice that usually made merchants and other kinds of tradesmen back down.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d The driver held out his hand and stared her down. \u201cOf course, I could always go across the street and knock on the door of that town house you\u2019ve been watching. Someone there might be interested in knowing that a witch has been keeping watch of who comes and goes.\u201d</p><p>Before she could rail at him for threatening her, a horse-drawn cab pulled up in front of the town house. When it went on, Surreal SaDiablo stood on the sidewalk, looking at the cab Roxie occupied.</p><p>The whore didn\u2019t worry her, but it was more attention than she wanted today. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said as she called in her leather wallet and named a place that was close to the dining house where she was meeting Lektra.</p><p>She was outraged when the driver told her his fee, but that bitch Surreal was still watching them, and it would take so little effort for the driver to cause trouble. She handed over the marks.</p><p>The driver looked at the marks, then at her before he vanished his fee and climbed up to the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>Roxie breathed a sigh of relief as the cab headed for the theater district. Thank the Darkness she\u2019d used the illusion spell today and looked like a thousand other Dhemlan witches. While she wasn\u2019t the only fair-skinned witch in Amdarh, the driver had studied the illusion\u2019s face a little too long for comfort, so it was good he couldn\u2019t tell anyone who had really been watching the town house.</p><p>003</p><p>As she watched the cab drive away, Surreal rolled her shoulders to release the tension. She couldn\u2019t say why seeing the driver talking to his passenger had caught her attention\u2014or why it had made her uneasy.</p><p>Shaking her head, she climbed the steps to the front door and walked into the town house. She\u2019d barely gotten far enough into the entranceway to close the door before Helton rushed up, blocking her.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. If the servants had heard the rumors\u2014and believed them\u2014things were going to get nasty.</p><p>\u201cLady Surreal,\u201d Helton said. \u201cThe Prince and the Lady are not at home this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Since she could feel Daemon\u2019s presence, why the lie? Then she noticed the gleam in Helton\u2019s eyes. \u201cAh. Where did they dine while they weren\u2019t at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Prince has not yet requested that dinner be sent up, Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She looked at the staircase and grinned. Oh, she hoped it meant what she thought it meant.</p><p>She called in the small trunk she\u2019d brought from the Hall. \u201cWhen Lady Angelline is available, please see that she gets that trunk. It has the new clothes she purchased today. I think she\u2019ll need them.\u201d Her grin widened. \u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>Helton returned the grin before regaining his professional demeanor. \u201cI\u2019ll see to it personally.\u201d</p><p>Dancing down the steps, she stood on the sidewalk, not sure what to do with herself. Standing in the middle of the street dancing and whooping would be fun but would require an explanation she didn\u2019t want to give.</p><p>So she turned around with the intention of heading back to her rented suite for an indulgent dinner\u2014and stifled a shriek as a large shape moved toward her.</p><p>Lucivar studied her for a moment, then shook his head. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to pay attention to your surroundings to the point where you don\u2019t sense someone standing this close to you, you damn well better shield to protect yourself from an attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not likely to be attacked in Amdarh,\u201d Surreal snapped. But she glanced across the street to where that cab had stood. She shook off the hint of uneasiness and focused on the Warlord Prince in front of her. \u201cWhat brings you to Amdarh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured I\u2019d better talk to Daemon,\u201d Lucivar replied, moving toward the town house\u2019s steps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Surreal jumped in front of him. \u201cTrust me, sugar. You don\u2019t want to do that. Not tonight. Daemon isn\u2019t interested in talking to anyone tonight.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar studied the town house door. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jaenelle? Aren\u2019t you doing some female thing today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were. We did. Now . . .\u201d Surreal looked pointedly at the town house. \u201cJaenelle\u2019s not interested in talking to anyone either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me it\u2019ll be worth my balls if I walk in there and interrupt something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the very least.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar grinned. Then he looked at her. \u201cSo where are you staying tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaenelle and I had a suite at the female place, but it looks like I\u2019ll have it to myself tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have any rooms there where you can get something to eat?\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. \u201cThey do, but the place is really . . . female.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo males there at all?\u201d</p><p>Remembering all the looks and whispers she\u2019d endured that day, she gave in to the urge to be pure bitch. \u201cYeah, there are males. We can get dinner there if you want. And since Jaenelle won\u2019t be using it, you\u2019re welcome to the other bedroom.\u201d She paused. \u201cBesides, we need to talk. There\u2019s some trouble here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to walk to the corner to find a cab,\u201d Surreal said, walking past him.</p><p>His snort of laughter warned her, but before she could react, he clamped one arm around her waist and launched them skyward. Since her back was pressed to his chest, she didn\u2019t have many places to grab while he flew way too close to the treetops, so she settled for swearing as cre atively as possible.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Lucivar said, \u201cor you\u2019ll end up with bugs in your teeth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Roaring with laughter, he spun them a few times before gliding down to the sidewalk and backwinging to land lightly in front of the \u201cfemale place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou son of a whoring bitch,\u201d Surreal snarled. The sidewalk tilted, and she grabbed the arm he offered. \u201cJust for that, I hope being in this place a few hours makes your balls shrivel up.\u201d</p><p>He just snorted and escorted her to the registration desk.</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to sign in or something?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can do whatever you want.\u201d Surreal grabbed the desk. The atrium wasn\u2019t moving, but she still didn\u2019t quite trust her legs. The same little prick who had signed her and Jaenelle in that morning was still on duty\u2014and eyeing Lucivar.</p><p>\u201cWe do request that any . . . company . . . visiting with our guests sign in,\u201d he said, setting a leather-bound guest book on the desk and offering a pen.</p><p>Taking the pen, Lucivar dipped it in the inkwell and signed his name. \u201cI\u2019m not company, I\u2019m family.\u201d</p> <p>It was the man\u2019s sneer, there and gone in a moment, that pricked Surreal\u2019s temper.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if someone misinterpreted the reason for you being here?\u201d she asked Lucivar.</p><p>He studied her. \u201cI\u2019m here to have dinner with a member of my family, and since your suite has a spare bedroom and I need a place to sleep tonight, I\u2019m staying there. What\u2019s there to misinterpret? That\u2019s simple enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone sees what\u2019s obvious\u2014or true.\u201d</p><p>His gold eyes narrowed. Then he shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s easy enough to deal with. If people turn my spending an evening with my cousin into something it\u2019s not, I\u2019ll just rip out their lying tongues.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped, and she was very glad she was holding on to the desk. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean you\u2019d cut out their tongues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I said what I meant.\u201d</p><p>She thought about the difference\u2014and shuddered.</p><p>His hand closed over her arm. Then he led her toward one of the archways that provided access to the rest of the establishment.</p><p>\u201cSo where do we find dinner?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cThat way.\u201d She noticed her hand was trembling. Hell\u2019s fire. She was a Gray-Jeweled witch and an assassin. But he was . . . \u201cYou\u2019re family, and I love you, but I gotta tell you, Lucivar, sometimes you are a scary son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d He stopped at the doorway of one of the dining rooms. \u201cBut if what went on back there has anything to do with the trouble you want to tell me about, then there\u2019s something the Blood in Amdarh haven\u2019t learned yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar studied her long enough to make her stomach tighten. Then he said softly, \u201cThat I\u2019m not the Warlord Prince they should be afraid of.\u201d</p><p>NINE</p><p>1</p><p>Daemon woke slowly, gradually becoming aware that his hand rested on a soft, smooth thigh, and someone\u2019s fingers were gently combing through his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and smiled at Jaenelle, who was sitting up in bed, watching him. Feeling more content than he\u2019d felt in a long time, he caressed her thigh before lifting his hand to brush across her ribs and continue on to her back.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank my father for that. I didn\u2019t have anything to do with it,\u201d he replied.</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile, didn\u2019t respond. Just watched him.</p><p>Remembering what they still had to talk about, uneasiness began coiling around his contentment.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Daemon?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cYou. Just you.\u201d</p><p>Her sapphire eyes changed. Became haunted, ancient. He hadn\u2019t seen that look in almost a year\u2014since the day he\u2019d gone to Hayll to play out a vicious game to keep Dorothea and Hekatah distracted while Jaenelle prepared to unleash her immense power to cleanse the taint of those two bitches out of the Blood. His heart beat painfully as he looked into those haunted eyes, knowing it was no longer Jaenelle who watched him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Witch asked.</p><p>Daemon swallowed the lump in his throat. \u201cA wedding ring,\u201d he said, his voice roughened by longing\u2014and a fear that he might still lose the one person who meant everything to him. \u201cI want the wedding ring you promised I\u2019d wear after I got back from Hayll.\u201d</p><p>She went so still he wasn\u2019t sure she was still breathing. Then her eyes changed again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the same as I was when that promise was made,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop himself from looking at the Jewel she now wore. Twilight\u2019s Dawn was a Jewel unlike any other, which made it extraordinary. But it wasn\u2019t the Ebony Jewel she used to wear. It wasn\u2019t the Black that had been her Birthright. As unique and mysterious as Twilight\u2019s Dawn was, it still represented a loss of the power she once wielded. And that did make her different, but . . .</p><p>He sat up to face her. Brushed his fingertips over her face. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not the same\u2014except in the ways that truly matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe that, Daemon?\u201d</p><p>Can you accept the difference? That was the question under the question.</p><p>\u201cYes, I really believe that.\u201d And I can accept the difference.</p><p>A sheen of tears brightened her eyes as she smiled. \u201cThen let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s get married. Today.\u201d</p><p>Now! Excitement, fierce in its intensity, flooded through him before common sense intervened. He rested his forehead against hers and forced himself to consider the ramifications of following desire.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d He pulled back enough to see the uncertainty, and a hint of hurt, on her face. \u201cSweetheart, there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d like better than to marry you today, but we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cFor one thing, the coven and the boyos would never forgive me if they weren\u2019t invited to your wedding.\u201d Her wedding. Things were still too shaky between him and the rest of the humans who had made up her First Circle that they would give a damn whether or not they came to his wedding. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to avoid hurt feelings, we have to have a formal wedding. That means sending out invitations, talking to Mrs. Beale about preparing a wedding feast for the guests. It will take a few weeks.\u201d And the Darkness only knew what other rumors might be spread about him in that time.</p><p>Jaenelle echoed his sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re right. But . . .\u201d</p><p>The look on her face made him giddy ... and a bit terrified.</p><p>\u201cWe could have a private wedding today, just for us, and then have a formal wedding in a few weeks,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou mean a secret wedding?\u201d Yes! But common sense, which he was really beginning to resent, intruded once more. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a Priestess in Kaeleer who would be willing to marry us in secret and risk the wrath of the Queens who rule Kaeleer\u2014not to mention Lucivar and Saetan.\u201d</p><p>She took his face in her hands. \u201cDaemon,\u201d she said, her voice full of laughter, \u201cI\u2019ve just discovered something about you. As much as you know and as much as you\u2019ve experienced, you can still be naive about some things.\u201d</p><p>His mouth hung open, and no brilliantly phrased words came out.</p><p>After giving him a smacking kiss on the forehead, Jaenelle got out of bed and headed for the adjoining bathroom. \u201cIf we leave within the hour, we can get there by this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSince we\u2019ll have to rent a Coach here in Amdarh to ride the Winds to the Hall, contact Ladvarian and tell him to have one of our private Coaches ready so we aren\u2019t home long enough for anyone to ask questions. And tell him not to bring anyone except Kaelas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do we have to bring him?\u201d Daemon grumbled as he got out of bed and slipped on a robe.</p><p>Jaenelle paused at the bathroom door. \u201cDaemon? Where are you planning to sleep for the next decade?\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. \u201cFine. All right. I\u2019ll tell the Sceltie to bring the cat.\u201d</p> <p>She just smiled and closed the bathroom door.</p><p>Great. Wonderful, Daemon thought as he left their room to use the bathroom down the hall. She had a point about placating those two. If Ladvarian\u2019s feelings were hurt by being excluded, the Sceltie could make his life very difficult. And Kaelas had a few points of his own. They were called teeth and claws. Pissing off an Arcerian cat who was a Red-Jeweled Warlord Prince and who already resented that a human male was claiming a piece of Jaenelle\u2019s bed wasn\u2019t the best way to begin his new position as a husband.</p><p>As he adjusted the water in the shower, he contacted Ladvarian on a psychic spear thread and delivered Jaenelle\u2019s instructions\u2014and felt grateful the dog didn\u2019t ask any questions since he didn\u2019t have any answers.</p><p>That done, he stepped into the shower and quickly washed while he considered if he was amused or insulted by Jaenelle\u2019s \u201cdiscovery.\u201d</p><p>Growing up under Dorothea\u2019s control had stripped him of innocence at a very early age, and there was little, if anything, of a twisted, vile nature that he hadn\u2019t experienced. The Darkness only knew all that he\u2019d done, but one thing he knew with absolute certainty: He was not naive.</p> <p>2</p><p>Surreal stared at Helton. \u201cThey left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmediately after breakfast,\u201d Helton replied.</p><p>\u201cDid Prince Sadi say where he and Lady Angelline were going?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cHe did not, Prince Yaslana. Nor did he leave instructions on how to reach him. He did say he and the Lady would be returning, but he did not say when.\u201d</p><p>Surreal blew out a breath and looked at Lucivar, who shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like some breakfast?\u201d Helton asked. \u201cOr perhaps coffee served in the sitting room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoffee\u2019s fine,\u201d Surreal said. She walked into the sitting room and waited until Lucivar closed the door before she kicked a footstool.</p><p>\u201cYou pissed off about something, or are you reacting to this room?\u201d Lucivar asked, moving around the room as if he were looking for a trap he knew was there but couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the room?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cThe hot anger still lingering in it.\u201d Lucivar studied a spot on the carpet. \u201cThe cold rage underneath the anger.\u201d</p><p>Surreal stopped her own prowling to see what had caught his attention. \u201cWhere\u2019s the chair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a stuffed chair in that spot. At least, there was when I was here this winter to do some shopping for Winsol.\u201d</p> <p>Lucivar crouched, his hand moving slowly just above the carpet. Then he pulled a sliver of wood out of the carpet and held it up.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to say anything.</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cMother Night, Lucivar. Did I do something stupid by coaxing Jaenelle into coming to Amdarh?\u201d</p><p>Rising, he tossed the sliver into the fireplace. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know about the rumors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think they\u2019ve gone?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar turned slowly. His Ebon-gray Jewel glowed. He paused, then clearly broke whatever link he\u2019d been trying to make. \u201cDaemon\u2019s not responding, but he\u2019s west of here. Heading for the Hall, I think.\u201d</p><p>Daemon was the only person Surreal knew who could make Lucivar wary. That Sadi wouldn\u2019t respond to his brother made her nervous.</p><p>A light knock on the door preceded Helton, who brought in the tray that held a dish of pastries as well as the coffee. It would have been natural, even expected, for one of them to ask him about the chair\u2019s absence.</p><p>Neither of them asked. They kept silent until Helton left the room.</p><p>Then Lucivar sighed and raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d</p><p>Surreal poured coffee for both of them. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here for a few days, do some shopping, see if I hear anything interesting. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d better go to the Keep and inform the family patriarch about what\u2019s happening,\u201d Lucivar replied, taking his cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cWell, that should perk up Uncle Saetan\u2019s day.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYeah. He\u2019s going to be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you can do?\u201d Lucivar asked, finding no comfort in the way Saetan sat so silent and still.</p><p>Finally, Saetan sighed. \u201cI gave up my claim to Dhemlan last year when I decided to remain here at the Keep. The Queens there no longer have to answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they know you. They\u2019ll listen to you. Hell\u2019s fire, Father. Things are shaky enough between Jaenelle and Daemon. If these rumors\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>He felt that whiplash of icy temper and winced. \u201cYou\u2019ve visited them at the Hall often enough,\u201d he hedged. \u201cSurely, you\u2019ve noticed . . .\u201d Oh, shit.</p><p>Saetan shook his head. \u201cMy apologies, Lucivar. I have no right to lash out at you for saying something I don\u2019t want to hear. Daemon came too close to sliding back into the Twisted Kingdom when he thought Jaenelle died. If he loses her now . . . I\u2019m not sure what would happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what will happen,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cYou were in that camp in Hayll. You know what it\u2019s like to dance with the Sadist. He played out a game with illusions, but with the right provocation, he\u2019s capable of doing things like that. He\u2019s capable of doing anything. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know that,\u201d Saetan replied too softly. \u201cAfter all, he is his father\u2019s mirror.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Lucivar couldn\u2019t breathe. The deliberate reminder that a place called Zuulaman no longer existed was a caution about dealing with the man who sat on the other side of the desk\u2014and a warning about the other man who wore Black Jewels. After all, Daemon was the reason he didn\u2019t fear Saetan. When it came down to it, the Sadist could be a more elegantly vicious enemy than the High Lord of Hell would ever dream of being.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cWe wait.\u201d Saetan paused, then added, \u201cAnd we hope.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>He was naive. It was the only explanation for why he was standing in a meadow on a spring afternoon feeling overdressed and feet-deficient.</p><p>Of course, being flanked by a huge cat and a small dog while enclosed by a circle of unicorns could make any man feel . . . out of step.</p><p>Then the unicorns shifted, making an opening in the circle. Jaenelle stepped through the opening, flanked by Moonshadow, the Queen of Sceval, and her mate, Mistral, the Warlord Prince of the unicorns. Behind them came the Priestess, who had agreed to do her best to say words that would be meaningful to humans while she stood as witness to the \u201cmating\u201d of Kaeleer\u2019s Heart to Prince Daemon Sadi.</p><p>Thank the Darkness, none of them expected him to consummate the marriage in front of these witnesses.</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s eyes brimmed with amusement as she took her place beside him. On his left.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think about it. He simply stepped back and shifted until he stood on her left, the subordinate position. Her startled expression told him she didn\u2019t know what to think about that move, since he now outranked her and was entitled to stand on the right. But his choice had nothing to do with the Jewels she now wore and everything to do with who, and what, she still was. Her place wasn\u2019t at his side; his place was at her side. And always would be.</p><p>Before her uncertainty could be sensed by the unicorns around them, Mistral reared. Then, looking at Daemon, he flicked his tail and snorted before moving to one side.</p><p>Jaenelle pressed her lips together.</p><p>*You\u2019d have no use for me if I was hung like that,* Daemon told her on a psychic thread.</p><p>She changed her muffled laugh into a series of coughs, causing Ladvarian to declare it was still too cold for the Lady to be outside much longer.</p><p>So Moonshadow tossed her head, the sun gleaming on her spiral horn, and all the unicorns pricked their ears as the Priestess took her place in front of the two humans.</p><p>*Jaenelle,* the Priestess said, *this human stallion stands before you, wanting to be your mate. Will you accept him?* </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will accept him,\u201d Jaenelle said. She called in the gold band Banard had made. Even though he\u2019d given it to her for this ceremony, Daemon stared at it as if he\u2019d never seen it before.</p><p>His left hand trembled when she slipped the ring on his finger, adding, \u201cI offer this token to let everyone know Daemon is now my mate.\u201d</p><p>*Daemon,* the Priestess said, *the Lady is willing to have you as her mate. Do you promise to be her friend and . . .* She looked at Ladvarian, who, Daemon guessed, was helping the mare with human concepts. *. . . lover? Do you promise to protect her from enemies?*</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d Daemon replied. He called in the sapphire ring and slipped it on Jaenelle\u2019s finger. \u201cLet this token be a symbol of my commitment to honor, cherish, and protect, to be friend, lover, and husband.\u201d He lifted her left hand and brushed his lips across her knuckles. \u201cThis I promise . . . with everything I am.\u201d</p> <p>When he drew her into his arms and kissed her, he forgot about standing in a meadow, forgot about who was watching, forgot everything but her . . .</p><p>... until a young voice close to his hip said, *Are they going to mate now?*</p><p>Since his libido was rising a little too eagerly, he started to step back\u2014and got stabbed in the ass by a little unicorn\u2019s horn.</p><p>\u201cIt could have been worse,\u201d Jaenelle said as he led her back to the Coach and the picnic Ladvarian had procured from somewhere.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Daemon said, grateful he was just bruised, not punctured.</p> <p>\u201cYou could have been facing the other way.\u201d</p><p>Before he could decide if he wanted to be an intelligent husband or a snippy bastard, she kissed him, and when her tongue slipped into his mouth, he decided being an intelligent husband was the far better choice.</p><p>Wrapping his arms around her, he sank into the kiss, soaring on the feel of her body brushing against his.</p><p>She scraped her teeth over his chin. \u201cDid you notice that Ladvarian chose the Coach that has a bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>She licked his throat. \u201cDo you think you can perform your duties as a husband, or are you too wounded?\u201d</p> <p>Since she was pressed against him, the answer was rather evident, but he said, \u201cOh, I think I can manage.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your having us to stay tonight,\u201d Daemon said as Khary refilled the brandy snifters. In Scelt, the Blood still held with that quaint custom of the men and women separating after dinner for a while so that each group could chat with their own gender. So he and Khary had remained in the dining room while Jaenelle and Morghann had gone to the sitting room.</p><p>\u201cWell, you could say we were expecting company,\u201d Khary replied, a twinkle in his blue eyes. \u201cEspecially since Ladvarian came pelting up to the house earlier today, saying he needed a picnic in a hurry and could we have you and Jaenelle to dinner and put you up for the night.\u201d</p><p>Daemon tried not to wince. \u201cWe could have stayed at Jaenelle\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, that you couldn\u2019t. The staff put most of the furniture under dustcovers after Wilhelmina moved to her own cottage. This way, the house can be put to rights before your next visit.\u201d Khary gave Daemon an expectant look.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI have some business in Amdarh that requires my immediate attention, so we\u2019ll be going back to Dhemlan in the morning, but we\u2019re planning to come back here after the wedding for at least part of the honeymoon. And now that Jaenelle is completely healed, I expect we\u2019ll be dividing our time between here and the Hall.\u201d</p><p>Khary rolled his snifter between his hands. \u201cWilhelmina said you settled a generous income on her.\u201d</p> <p>Daemon shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s Jaenelle\u2019s sister. The family could afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>As they drank their brandy, the silence took on the weight of anticipation. Of course, there had been a feeling of anticipation since he and Jaenelle arrived at the home of the Queen of Scelt and the Warlord of Maghre. Morghann and Khary had greeted the news of their intended marriage with enthusiasm and hearty well-wishing, but as the evening wore on, Daemon couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that Khary especially was waiting for something.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should join the Ladies for coffee,\u201d Daemon said, pushing away from the table.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to keep it a secret, you should stop playing with the ring,\u201d Khary said quietly.</p><p>He\u2019d intended to pretend ignorance, which would have been a lie, but he looked into Khary\u2019s eyes and realized they stood on a point of no return. Whatever conclusions Lord Khardeen had reached about what had happened last spring, and why, had been reason enough for him to offer a hand in friendship again. But if that offer of friendship was repaid with a lie, it would never be offered again\u2014and Khardeen had enough weight with the rest of the boyos to bring him back into that circle of friendships . . . or leave him outside of it forever.</p><p>Daemon held out his left hand and dropped the sight shield he\u2019d placed on the gold band to keep it hidden. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>Khary leaned forward to admire the ring. Then he grinned. \u201cDid the same thing with mine when I first got it. Couldn\u2019t quite believe it was really there.\u201d He rose and gave Daemon\u2019s shoulder a friendly squeeze. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you were doing in Sceval this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Feeling awkward, and not liking it, he shrugged. \u201cWe wanted to get married. But we are going to have the formal wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right you are.\u201d Khary studied him. \u201cIs there a reason for keeping this secret?\u201d</p><p>Daemon felt himself going cold and fought against it. This wasn\u2019t the time or place for that sweet, deadly rage. But soon. Soon. \u201cThere\u2019s some . . . trouble . . . in Amdarh. It could shift to Jaenelle if our marriage became public knowledge.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure when that realization had bloomed, but he trusted his instincts. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need help, you\u2019ll let me know?\u201d Khary asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Khary rubbed his hands together. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we join the Ladies?\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s amused, guilty look when he and Khary entered the sitting room told him she\u2019d had no better luck keeping their secret from Morghann than he\u2019d had keeping it from Khardeen.</p><p>Khary looked at the two women and grinned. \u201cSo. Are we going to talk about the wedding that will take place or the one that did take place?\u201d His eyes shifted to Daemon. \u201cBecause we were wondering why you were having so much trouble sitting through dinner.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle snorted.</p><p>Daemon sighed, and muttered, \u201cI backed into a unicorn.\u201d</p><p>Morghann burst out laughing. \u201cOh, we\u2019ve got to hear the details.\u201d</p><p>So Khary and Morghann heard the details, and the evening ended with laughter\u2014and the warm sense that he was back among friends.</p><p>TEN</p><p>1</p><p>Daemon drove the Coach back to Dhemlan. He didn\u2019t have much choice, since Ladvarian, who had driven the Coach to Sceval, had announced that he and Kaelas would meet them at the Hall. He usually didn\u2019t mind driving, but he\u2019d anticipated talking Jaenelle into tucking into bed for the journey. And they would have gotten some sleep.</p><p>Still, it was pleasant to have her with him in the driver\u2019s compartment. Except for the time they spent in bed, it was rare for them to be together without the presence of kindred, court, or family.</p><p>But looking at her, he noticed the dark smudges beneath her eyes . . . and the way she shivered despite being wrapped up in her winter cape.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stretch out on the bed and get some sleep?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She might be completely healed, but she hadn\u2019t regained her physical stamina. He could see the toll the past two days had taken on her.</p><p>Scooping her out of the other chair, he returned to his chair and settled her on his lap.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cYou have to pay attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay attention,\u201d he promised, wrapping his arms around her. She was right. The psychic pathways through the Darkness made it possible for the Blood to travel faster than they could otherwise, but inattention while riding the Winds could be fatal, and guiding even a small Coach demanded extra care. \u201cJust rest. We\u2019ll be back at the Hall a little after midday.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle rested her head against his shoulder. \u201cI thought we were going to Amdarh.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated a little too long.</p><p>She raised her head and looked at him, too much knowledge in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of things in Amdarh,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been born a Queen. Even though she no longer ruled a court, she was still a Queen\u2014and she was still his Queen. He couldn\u2019t prevent the instinctive desire to yield when Jaenelle gave him a direct command, but living in Kaeleer for the past year had shown him that males could, and did, dig their heels in and oppose the Queen they served when a command might put her at risk.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t come to harm,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already been harmed,\u201d she snarled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His temper strained at the leash. \u201cSo far, whoever is playing this game has used nothing but words. Once the announcement of our intended marriage is made\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe game may turn physical. I\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t think I can. Not having my full strength physically doesn\u2019t make me weak.\u201d</p> <p>But you\u2019re not as strong as you used to be\u2014and we don\u2019t really know how strong you are. \u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>When she squirmed, he tightened his hold, thinking she was trying to move away from him. But she only freed her left hand from the folds of the cape and held it up.</p><p>\u201cWhat does this ring mean, Daemon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy promise to honor, cherish, and protect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides that.\u201d</p> <p>He studied her face, trying to discern what she wanted him to say.</p><p>\u201cPartnership,\u201d Jaenelle said quietly. \u201cYou went to Hayll and played out a vicious game to distract Dorothea and Hekatah because that\u2019s what I needed you to do. And it cost you. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m not aware of how much it cost you, Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different.\u201d Remembering the emotional cruelty he\u2019d inflicted on his family in order to keep them from physical harm made his chest tighten, made it hard to breathe.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was different,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about serving in a court. This isn\u2019t about saving a Realm from being shattered by war. This is personal. Someone is going after you. And whether you like it or not, you are not going to play out this game alone.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle would protect anyone she loved, no matter the price. If he refused to let her help, she would go off on her own to find whoever was playing games with his life. At least if they stayed together, he could protect her while she was trying to protect him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, partner,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p> <p>She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. But we\u2019ll think of some way to find the source of the rumors being spread about you.\u201d Then she looked at him through her lashes. \u201cSo, who\u2019s going to tell Mrs. Beale she\u2019s got a month to plan a wedding feast?\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. Mrs. Beale was a marvelous cook. She also had what he considered an unnatural relationship with her meat cleaver. Since he\u2019d inherited SaDiablo Hall, he had gained a finer appreciation of why his father had stayed away from anything to do with the kitchen unless cornered. The woman was downright scary at times.</p><p>The fact that she and Beale, the Hall\u2019s butler, were happily married was something he tried not to think about because it made him wonder things about Beale he\u2019d rather not wonder.</p><p>\u201cIf we both went to Amdarh, we could just write her a note,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>He looked at Jaenelle. She looked at him.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d he said.</p><p>That settled, she snuggled against him and slept for the rest of the journey.</p><p>2</p> <p>*High Lord?*</p><p>Ladvarian\u2019s suppressed excitement made Saetan\u2019s nerves twang, but he continued warming a glass of yarbarah as if he had no concerns. \u201cLord Ladvarian. What brings you to the Keep?\u201d</p><p>*There\u2019s something you should know. But it\u2019s a secret.*</p><p>Comfortably settled in a window seat, Saetan watched as twilight faded the colors in the small garden beyond the room Draca had given him to use as a study.</p><p>The daughter of his soul and the son of his blood had married yesterday. He\u2019d told Ladvarian he was delighted, and he was. But in the privacy of his own heart, he could acknowledge a nip of hurt that he hadn\u2019t been asked to witness that bond. A father\u2019s wish to share the important moments in his children\u2019s lives.</p><p>And yet, he understood the reason behind this secret wedding. It didn\u2019t matter that Jaenelle was no longer the Queen of Ebon Askavi. Her decision to take a husband would create ripples throughout Kaeleer. Even if the guest list was contained to the Blood who had made up the First and Second Circles of the Dark Court, it would take weeks to plan the celebration that would follow the simple ceremony. For two people who wanted, or needed, to make a formal commitment to each other now, waiting in order to plan a party would have been intolerable.</p><p>Especially for Daemon. Because Daemon Sadi\u2019s loyalty began and ended with Jaenelle Angelline. The fact that someone was trying to give Jaenelle a reason to break all ties with him indicated the Blood in Dhemlan still didn\u2019t realize the kind of man they were dealing with. And that frightened him. The only thing restraining the power and temper of a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince was a woman whose own power was, as yet, undetermined. If the rumors spreading through Amdarh and, by now, through the other courts in Dhemlan, provoked Daemon into striking out indiscriminately, there was no one, including himself, strong enough to stop him.</p><p>The bloodbath could be horrific.</p><p>So it was prudent of Jaenelle to marry Daemon in a way that required little fuss to give him the assurance that he wouldn\u2019t lose her.</p><p>Saetan scrubbed his hands over his face and sighed. With things balanced so precariously right now and so dependent on Daemon\u2019s state of mind, he just wished he had the answer to the question the coven, the boyos, and even Lucivar had been asking over the past few months.</p><p>If the kindred had truly succeeded in holding onto Jaenelle so that she would heal and come back to all of them, why had she come back different?</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>1</p><p>Lektra dropped her cup, oblivious of the tea seeping into the white tablecloth as she twisted around to stare at the two women seated at the next table in the dining house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I beg your pardon,\u201d Lektra stammered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to overhear your conversation, but . . . Daemon Sadi is getting married?\u201d</p><p>The woman Lektra recognized as the Priestess in Zhara\u2019s First Circle nodded. \u201cLady Angelline and Prince Sadi came to Lady Zhara\u2019s court this morning and announced they were going to marry in a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I . . . I thought Lady Angelline was an invalid.\u201d Lektra gripped the back of her chair so the other women wouldn\u2019t see her hands shaking.</p><p>Looking puzzled, the Priestess shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you heard that, but she\u2019s not an invalid, although she looks like she\u2019s still recovering from her injuries.\u201d She paused. \u201cThere were some disturbing rumors about Prince Sadi\u2019s fidelity, but he was very solicitous with his Lady, doing and saying everything one would expect of an ardent lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps doing and saying it too well?\u201d the Priestess\u2019s companion asked.</p><p>The Priestess gave her friend a sharp look. \u201cHe was concerned for her well-being\u2014as he should be.\u201d</p><p>Lektra forced herself to smile and turn away just as a waiter hurried to her table to vanish the soiled tablecloth, replace it with a clean one, and bring her another cup of tea. As much as she wanted to hear about her unfaithful lover\u2019s performance while he\u2019d been visiting Zhara\u2019s court, it wouldn\u2019t do to make anyone wonder about her interest.</p><p>She picked at the meal she\u2019d ordered, no longer taking pleasure in the food, too aware of the women at the other table. Finally, feeling too ill to continue pretending, she paid for her meal and hurried out of the dining house, wanting nothing more than the sanctuary of her own home.</p><p>2</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that bitch?\u201d Lektra snarled as she paced her sitting room. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she have any pride? She must have heard that he\u2019s been unfaithful to her. She should have severed whatever ties still hold him to her.\u201d</p><p>Roxie, curled in one corner of the sofa, selected another chocolate from the large box on the table. \u201cHave you seen her?\u201d She made a disgusted sound. \u201cEven if he was unfaithful and having sex with six other women every day, she wouldn\u2019t let Daemon go if he\u2019s still willing to service her. What other man would want her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s going to marry her!\u201d Lektra\u2019s hands clenched. \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to want me. He\u2019s supposed to love me.\u201d How dare he disappoint her when she was counting on having the strongest, most beautiful man in the Realm as her lover? How could he even think of staying with Jaenelle when she loved him so desperately?</p><p>Roxie frowned. \u201cMaybe we can give him a reason to walk away from her.\u201d</p><p>Or maybe it\u2019s time to take a more direct approach to the problem. \u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d Lektra said, hurrying toward the door. Her Summer-sky Jewels were strong enough for what she had in mind. And with luck, there would be some tragic news for people to discuss over dinner tonight.</p><p>3</p><p>Wrapping one arm around Jaenelle, Daemon tucked her closer to his right side as the horse-drawn cab headed out of the shopping district.</p><p>Jaenelle said, \u201cWe could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She studied him with narrowed eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that bossy I\u2019m-a-Warlord-Prince-so-I\u2019m-right tone in your voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got that I\u2019m-a-Warlord-Prince-who-is-your-adoring-loving-husband tone in my voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like bossy from where I\u2019m sitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be the acoustics in the cab.\u201d He smiled as he kissed her frown-wrinkled forehead. \u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re exhausted. We\u2019ve paid a courtesy call to Zhara and been seen in several shops today. That\u2019s enough. You need to rest.\u201d He paused. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, I need to rest.\u201d</p> <p>She considered that for a moment. \u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Several things, but he\u2019d take them in order. \u201cTucking into the sitting room for the rest of the afternoon. If you\u2019re a good little witch and nibble on some food to make up for what you didn\u2019t eat at midday, I\u2019ll read to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bribery,\u201d Jaenelle grumbled.</p><p>\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good bribe.\u201d</p> <p>Daemon grinned, then looked out the window when the cab stopped. \u201cStreets are crowded today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else is on your mind?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Of course she\u2019d noticed his preoccupation at the last two shops they\u2019d visited. Taking her left hand in his, he dropped the sight shield on his wedding ring for a moment. The brief sight of it warmed him, soothed him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should let this go,\u201d he said quietly, rubbing his thumb over the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cSomeone tried to ruin your reputation and isolate you socially from the rest of the Blood,\u201d Jaenelle pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSomeone wanted you to turn away from me. You didn\u2019t. Nothing else matters.\u201d The cab started forward. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if the Blood in Amdarh accept me or not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf someone wants you enough to hurt you\u2014\u201d</p><p>The driver cried out. The horse screamed and bolted.</p><p>Daemon had enough time to throw a Black shield around both of them before the horse veered sharply. The sound of wood snapping . . .</p><p>\u201cAir!\u201d Jaenelle shouted.</p><p>... then the cab tipped, crashing on its side before continuing a sickening flip with unnatural speed until it smashed against walls of power.</p><p>The inside of the cab was a dazzle of colors\u2014Green, Rose, Summer-sky, Purple Dusk, Red, Sapphire.</p><p>As the cab came to rest, Daemon blinked to clear his vision. The colors danced around them a moment longer before they faded\u2014and he realized they were floating in the middle of the cab. He had automatically created a tight, defensive shield that would have protected them from invasive harm, but they would have been thrown around the inside of the cab. Jaenelle\u2019s bubble shield had provided a better cushion.</p><p>Shattered glass and thrusting spikes of broken wood littered the cab\u2019s roof, which was now beneath them.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t aware he\u2019d risen to the killing edge, wasn\u2019t aware of the freezing rage flooding him until Jaenelle said quietly, \u201cLeash it, Prince. They just want to help.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, working through what she was telling him, what she was demanding from him. He wanted to rip flesh from bone, wanted to crush the minds surrounding the cab. He wanted to wash Amdarh\u2019s streets in a river of blood.</p><p>\u201cDaemon,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he crooned. \u201cOnly for you.\u201d</p><p>With effort, he chained the desire to strike out with lethal intent as the cab door opened, revealing worried male faces. The air bubble shrank around them. In the space of a heartbeat, he dropped the Black shield around them and re-formed tight shields around each of them. Then he shifted until he could crouch among the shattered glass and shards of wood and help the Warlords reaching into the cab to guide Jaenelle, still floating on air, through the door.</p><p>As Daemon emerged from the cab, he noticed how the males had formed a protective circle around Jaenelle, noted the distress and anger in all of their faces.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the driver?\u201d he asked too softly.</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d a Warlord said, pointing to another cluster of males.</p><p>The males near the driver backed away as he approached. He looked down at the man sprawled in the street, testing with a delicate psychic probe.</p><p>Physically dead but not burned out.</p><p>He put a Black shield around the driver and vanished the body, ignoring the startled exclamations of the other men. The Warlords surrounding Jaenelle watched him with fear in their eyes.</p><p>Jaenelle just watched him.</p><p>Her presence was the tiny spark of warmth in a world that had gone sweetly, deadly cold. So he held on to that spark while he led his Lady to one of the carriages offered for their use\u2014and he held himself in the eye of a storm that he would either dissipate . . . or unleash on Amdarh.</p><p>Keeping her inner barriers tightly shut to prevent anyone picking up on her frustration and fury, Lektra, along with several other women, stood on a street corner and watched the Warlords ease Jaenelle Angelline from the broken cab. She walked away, knowing she\u2019d be sickened by the sight of Daemon fawning over that pale bitch.</p><p>It should have worked. It should have. Even if Jaenelle wasn\u2019t as much of an invalid as she\u2019d thought, being tossed around in a tumbling cab should have injured something. But the bitch didn\u2019t even have a scratch.</p><p>Of course, she hadn\u2019t seen Daemon emerge from the cab.</p><p>She turned back, barely able to stop herself from running. It hadn\u2019t occurred to her that Daemon might get hurt. She\u2019d expected him to shield himself and be safe. But what if he\u2019d shielded Jaenelle instead? What if he was still in the cab with a broken leg or a broken back or . . .</p><p>She reached the corner in time to glimpse Daemon helping Jaenelle into another carriage. Staggering back a few steps, she braced a hand against the nearest building. He wasn\u2019t hurt. Her beautiful love wasn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>But he still wasn\u2019t free to be her beautiful love, and if she couldn\u2019t find some way of preventing him from marrying that used-up bitch, it could be decades before he could be with his real love.</p><p>Maybe Roxie was right. Maybe she\u2019d gone about this from the wrong direction. No woman would give up Daemon Sadi. But since Jaenelle Angelline didn\u2019t have any status anymore to attract a strong male, maybe the thing to do was give Daemon a reason to walk away from Jaenelle.</p><p>4</p><p>Feeling the cold rage wash over the town house, Lucivar stepped into the small entrance hall and shivered. A moment later, Surreal rushed down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWe\u2019re going to dance with the Sadist, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it looks like we are.\u201d What had provoked Daemon into cold rage? Lucivar looked at Surreal. \u201cMaybe you should get out of here.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cTwo people distracting him are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice as many targets for him to splatter over the walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t splatter,\u201d she snapped. \u201cHe\u2019s not that merciful when he\u2019s this pissed off.\u201d</p><p>She was right. Unfortunately.</p><p>A minute later, they heard a carriage pull up in front of the town house.</p><p>Taking a deep breath and blowing it out, Surreal opened the front door. Her shock hit Lucivar with the force of a fist. He gave himself a moment to acknowledge his stomach-churning fear before he locked it away. He couldn\u2019t afford to show even a hint of fear. Not if he had to deal with the Sadist.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire!\u201d Surreal flung the door wide open and stepped back. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA carriage accident,\u201d Daemon replied as he carried Jaenelle into the house.</p><p>\u201cCat!\u201d Lucivar leaped forward, but Daemon\u2019s glazed, sleepy eyes stopped him from actually touching Jaenelle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll settle the Lady upstairs,\u201d Daemon snarled. \u201cThen we\u2019ll talk. In the meantime, contact Gabrielle and ask her to come as quickly as possible. We need a Healer.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar stepped aside to give Daemon a clear path to the stairs. \u201cThere are Healers in Amdarh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone that I trust,\u201d Daemon replied. He climbed the stairs and disappeared down the hallway that led to the suite he shared with Jaenelle.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Surreal said as she shut the door. \u201cIf he considers all the Blood in Amdarh as an enemy, someone is going to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try not to be among the corpses,\u201d Lucivar growled. \u201cYou stay here. I\u2019ll contact Chaosti.\u201d He walked into the sitting room and closed the door. Ebon-gray to Gray, he could make the psychic reach to the Warlord Prince of the Dea al Mon.</p><p>*Chaosti.* He waited a few moments, then called again.</p><p>*Lucivar?*</p><p>*We need Gabrielle here in her capacity as a Healer.*</p><p>Hesitation. *How much do you need her?*</p><p>*What?*</p><p>Another hesitation. *We confirmed yesterday that Gabrielle is pregnant.

Then Chaosti said, *Take care of yourself, Lucivar.*</p><p>*I\u2019ll try to stay off the killing field.*</p><p>He broke the link and walked out of the sitting room just as Daemon came down the stairs and Surreal opened the front door to admit Zhara and another witch.</p><p>\u201cI heard about the accident,\u201d Zhara said. \u201cI brought my Healer to offer what help we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Daemon said too softly.</p><p>*Daemon, Gabrielle is pregnant,* Lucivar said on a spear thread.</p> <p>Those glazed eyes stared at him for too long before Daemon focused his attention on the two witches.</p><p>The Healer tried to smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just have a look at Lady Angelline and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Daemon\u2019s snarl filled the small entrance hall.</p><p>\u201cWe do have a qualified Healer in residence,\u201d Surreal said. \u201cI\u2019ll go up and ask Jaenelle if she needs another Healer. You just stand there and . . . breathe . . . until I get back.\u201d She eased around Daemon and bolted up the stairs.</p><p>Don\u2019t do anything to provoke him, Lucivar thought, watching ice coat the windows on either side of the door. The entrance hall was so cold he could see his breath, and Zhara and her Healer were shivering.</p><p>Daemon just stood there, his hands in his trouser pockets, staring at Zhara and the Healer.</p><p>Surreal raced down the stairs. \u201cJaenelle says she has a few sore muscles. Nothing worse than that. Not even a bruise. She\u2019s fine, Daemon. She really is. I\u2019m going to help her into a hot bath to soak a bit while you cool off.\u201d She looked around the entrance hall. \u201cOr warm up.\u201d She started back up the stairs, then turned. \u201cOh. Jaenelle also said you promised to read to her. She told me to remind you.\u201d</p><p>Saying nothing, Daemon walked into the sitting room.</p> <p>Surreal dashed up the stairs, leaving Lucivar with Zhara and the Healer.</p><p>Zhara\u2019s eyes glittered with anger. \u201cIf Prince Sadi thinks the respect the Dhemlan Queens have for his father means he can act any way he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and get out,\u201d Lucivar snarled, keeping his voice low enough not to carry to the sitting room. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t trust you, and right now, he\u2019ll kill anyone he doesn\u2019t trust.\u201d Even me.</p><p>\u201cI am Amdarh\u2019s Queen, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know who you\u2019re dealing with. You. Don\u2019t. Know. But I\u2019m very much afraid you\u2019re going to find out. So get out while you can\u2014and hope you\u2019re still among the living when this is done.\u201d</p><p>Zhara\u2019s light-brown skin turned gray. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar swore. \u201cHe\u2019s a Warlord Prince. Someone tried to hurt his Queen. What do you think is going to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe that if you want to. You seem willing to believe a lot of things lately.\u201d</p><p>Before Zhara could reply, they all heard the quiet clink of glass against glass. She glanced toward the sitting room\u2014and the two women left with more speed than dignity.</p><p>Lucivar closed the front door, then leaned against it for a moment. He didn\u2019t want to walk into that sitting room, but someone had to dance with the Sadist, and it looked like it was going to be him.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, and hoping he wasn\u2019t about to make Marian a widow, he walked into the sitting room and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cBrandy?\u201d Daemon asked as he filled a snifter halfway.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Lucivar walked toward his brother, watching for any sign that things would turn lethal. Daemon sounded calm, but that didn\u2019t mean a damn thing.</p><p>Daemon poured brandy into another snifter and handed it to Lucivar.</p><p>\u201cI was willing to let it go,\u201d Daemon said softly. \u201cI told myself it was just words. Some petty bitch sees a male she wants and goes after him in one way or another. How many times had we watched that game played out in Terreillean courts over the centuries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many,\u201d Lucivar said, wishing he could test the brandy for poison\u2014and knowing the insult would probably get him killed. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, when that little Rihlander was planning to trap me a few years ago, I exiled the bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust exile? Did you have a weak moment, Prick?\u201d Daemon\u2019s smile was still on the chilling side, but not quite on the killing edge anymore.</p><p>Lucivar shrugged. \u201cAt the time, killing her would have caused more problems.\u201d</p><p>Daemon nodded and took a large swallow of brandy. \u201cIf this game had stayed focused on me, I would have let it go. Jaenelle didn\u2019t believe the rumors, and I don\u2019t give a damn what anyone else thinks.\u201d He looked away. \u201cAnd I thought, if it got physical, I would be the target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in that carriage, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not the one who was supposed to get hurt. It happened fast, Lucivar. We\u2019d been using that same cab all afternoon. Anyone following us would have had time to put a spell on it\u2014or at least prepare the spell for a fast strike. The way the cab rolled . . . It was too fast, too violent. Had to be Craft-enhanced. Which means someone hoped Jaenelle would be hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn order to have you.\u201d He could see it too clearly. A shield would have protected her from broken glass or wood, but being thrown around in a rolling cab could have resulted in a damaged neck or spine. Jaenelle could have been crippled, perhaps forever, just when she was starting to reclaim her life.</p><p>\u201cIn order to have me,\u201d Daemon agreed.</p><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever caused the accident killed the driver but didn\u2019t finish the kill. I have him. After he makes the transition to demon-dead, he may be able to tell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have plenty of experience in finishing the kill and none when it comes to dealing with someone newly demon-dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not take the cab driver to the one person who does know how to deal with the demon-dead?\u201d Lucivar took a swallow of brandy. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell Father about what happened today, he\u2019s going to kick your ass. You know that.\u201d</p><p>The room went cold. \u201cDo you think he can?\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. No. \u201cJaenelle is his Queen, too, Bastard. If she\u2019s in danger, he needs to be told.\u201d</p><p>The temperature in the room eased closer to normal.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave Jaenelle,\u201d Daemon finally said.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take the driver to the Keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after we find out whatever the driver knows?\u201d</p><p>Daemon watched the brandy as he gently swirled the snifter. \u201cJaenelle wants to help me find whoever is behind the rumors. I\u2019m not happy about that, but I understand the need. If I try to keep her away from everything that might hurt her, I\u2019ll smother her\u2014and I\u2019ll lose her. She won\u2019t stay if she\u2019s thought of as less than what she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is less than what she was.\u201d Lucivar shrugged, ignoring the skitter of nerves down his spine at the way Daemon looked at him. \u201cBut she\u2019ll never discover what she can do if we keep standing in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Daemon sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s a party in three days. One of those mind-numbing affairs. So Jaenelle and I will play out a little game at the party. Maybe we\u2019ll even find out something. Either way, I think I can convince her that she played out her part and should go back to the Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mind-numbing party,\u201d Lucivar muttered. \u201cSounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>Daemon\u2019s eyes and smile finally warmed. \u201cI\u2019m delighted you think so, since you\u2019ll be there, too.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar swore. \u201cWhy do I have to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if someone there goes after Jaenelle and somehow manages to get past me, I want to know they\u2019ll have to go through you in order to hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d He set the snifter on the table. \u201cYou\u2019d better include Surreal in this party. If you piss her off, she\u2019ll threaten to pin your balls to the wall.\u201d</p><p>Daemon grinned. \u201cShe does have a way of expressing her opinions, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she does. So what happens after the party?\u201d</p><p>The grin changed into a viciously gentle smile. Daemon set the snifter down and turned his right hand palm up so Lucivar could see the snake tooth slide out of its channel beneath the ring-finger nail.</p><p>\u201cAfter that,\u201d Daemon said, \u201cI\u2019m going hunting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>TWELVE</p><p>1</p><p>Daemon shrugged into his black jacket and adjusted the cuffs of his white silk shirt. He didn\u2019t want to go to this party, didn\u2019t want Jaenelle anywhere near the aristo Blood who would be crowding the rooms. But her plan to try to draw out whoever was behind the rumors sounded safe enough, especially with Lucivar and Surreal in attendance.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he liked it. And he wasn\u2019t sure he could do it.</p> <p>To distract himself, he silently rehearsed the phrase in the Old Tongue that he\u2019d painstakingly pieced together over the past few weeks. He\u2019d learned a few phrases of the Blood\u2019s ancient language over the centuries from scholars who still had some knowledge of those fluid words, but nothing he\u2019d known had come close to what he wanted to say. Something private. Something erotic. Something he could whisper to Jaenelle to tell her what she meant to him.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were only two people in all of Kaeleer who were fluent in the Old Tongue. He couldn\u2019t ask Jaenelle to help him translate the phrase since he wanted to surprise her, and Saetan ... Well, no matter how sophisticated the relationship, no matter how adult the people involved, there were some things a son just couldn\u2019t ask his father.</p><p>So he\u2019d struggled with the books he\u2019d found in Saetan\u2019s private study deep beneath the Hall, books that were filled with the grammar and vocabulary of that old language. What they didn\u2019t tell him was how to pronounce those words.</p><p>Maybe he could talk Jaenelle into giving him a few lessons while they were on their honeymoon. After all, he was going to offer to teach her a few things, too.</p><p>A quiet click. The bathroom door opened.</p> <p>He turned to face her as she entered the bedroom. He\u2019d seen desire mingled with the heat of lust in other women\u2019s eyes, and had hated them for it because they saw only the body, wanted only the bedroom skills he\u2019d had no choice in learning. But seeing those feelings in her . . .</p><p>A different kind of heat flowed through him, and all those bedroom skills finally had a purpose.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he said as he crossed the room and held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d She blushed.</p><p>Watching the color wash over her cheeks made him hungry.</p><p>Drawing her into his arms, he nuzzled her temple. \u201cWhat would you like to do on our honeymoon?\u201d The look she gave him made him grin. \u201cBesides that.\u201d</p> <p>Her blush deepened.</p><p>He eased back enough to trace a finger over the gold chain that held Twilight\u2019s Dawn. \u201cI was thinking we could see what skills you might have now with a different Jewel.\u201d</p><p>A touch of wariness filled her eyes. \u201cCraft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking more along the lines of cooking.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cCooking? But I can\u2019t cook.\u201d</p><p>His fingers followed the chain back up to her neck. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t before. But you couldn\u2019t call in your shoes before, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Daemon.\u201d</p><p>The words were doubtful, but her expression was eager.</p> <p>His hands caressed her back. His lips brushed her cheek. \u201cWe could start with something simple. A roast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA roast,\u201d she repeated, as solemn as any student learning her first difficult spell.</p><p>\u201cWe start with a choice cut of meat.\u201d His hands caressed her hips, her ribs, gave her breasts a teasing brush before circling back up to her shoulders. \u201cRub it gently with herbs to season it and bring out the flavor.\u201d Since her head had tipped back, exposing her throat, he took the invitation and left a trail of delicate kisses from her throat to her ear. \u201cThen we give it heat, but carefully, slowly, so the juices rise and tremble on the surface to be savored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we\u2019re talking about cooking?\u201d</p><p>He licked her ear, enjoying the little tremors going through her.</p><p>\u201cMy legs are weak,\u201d she said, sounding breathless.</p><p>He froze, fighting against the panic that the strain of the past few days had been too much for her. But before he could think of a careful way to ask, she added, \u201cWhen your voice gets that purr in it and you kiss me like that, my legs get weak.\u201d</p><p>His body relaxed in one way, tightened in another. He brushed his lips over hers. \u201cWe could skip the party, stay home, and\u201d\u2014the tip of his tongue touched her bottom lip\u2014\u201cdiscuss the merits of basting.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be annoyed with you. How am I going to be annoyed with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy remembering the second part of the evening\u2019s entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kiss-and-make-up part.\u201d He smiled as phantom tongues delicately licked her nipples.</p><p>She wobbled, then held on to him to stay upright. \u201cMother Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he purred.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>She sounded nervous. He never wanted her to fear him, but nervous ... Oh, he knew exactly how to play with a light case of nerves.</p><p>Since he could think of a dozen answers to her question\u2014 and only one of them would get them out of the bedroom\u2014he stepped back enough to guide her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cFor the party, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe party. I remember.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. Strange to feel savagely volatile and light-hearted at the same time. \u201cLet\u2019s collect Surreal and Lucivar and go play party games.\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>Surreal scanned another room full of milling people. It felt like every aristo in Amdarh was stuffed into this house. \u201cParties like this were more fun to attend when I was a whore.\u201d</p><p>Standing beside her, Lucivar also scanned the room. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching all the prissy bitches trying not to act scandalized that I was there was almost as entertaining as watching the men I\u2019d slept with sweat over what I might say to the prissy bitches. Now that I\u2019m considered part of an aristo family, these little evenings aren\u2019t as interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not \u2018considered\u2019 part of an aristo family,\u201d Lucivar growled. \u201cYou are part of an aristo family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been here an hour. You don\u2019t have to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here for the food or the entertainment. Thank the Darkness.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t catch most of the low, snarling response except for the words \u201cmoon\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the fourth day,\u201d she said with insulting precision. \u201cI can wear my Jewels again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe males here don\u2019t know that,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThey\u2019ll just pick up the scent. You might as well hang a sign around your neck that says, \u2018I\u2019m vulnerable. Hurt me.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She gave him a razor smile. \u201cExactly. Any male who looks at me and sees \u2018prey\u2019 is a man I want to have a private chat with.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a long, assessing stare. She knew that look. This was Lucivar assessing a warrior\u2019s potential to step onto a killing field and be able to walk away from it once the fight was done.</p><p>\u201cYou have your knives with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI used to be an assassin as well as a whore, remember? Yes, I have my knives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they honed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019re honed. Would you like me to test one on you to prove it?\u201d</p><p>He just stared.</p><p>Surreal sighed. Since he was Eyrien, a Warlord Prince, and a relative, getting pissy with Lucivar about weapons was pointless. She decided to change the subject. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Daemon and Jaenelle? They were snuggly in the carriage on the way to this party, and now . . .\u201d She frowned. \u201cNow Daemon has this look on his face\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis court mask.\u201d</p><p>The sudden tension in Lucivar\u2019s body and the wariness in his voice made her uneasy. \u201cHis what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way he always looked in the Terreillean courts when he was a pleasure slave. Cold. Bored. His face was a mask that revealed nothing of what he was really thinking. It was a look that said, \u2018You can touch my body, but you\u2019ll never touch me.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>That distracted her. \u201cHe actually let the bitches touch him\u2014and they lived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say they lived,\u201d Lucivar replied grimly.</p><p>Surreal shivered and went on to the second part. \u201cThen there\u2019s Jaenelle. One moment everything is fine, and the next it\u2019s like she almost believes the rumors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cThis is the game. Daemon told me they were going to try to flush out whoever was behind the rumors. This is how they\u2019re doing it.\u201d</p><p>She thought it over, and her stomach churned at the possibility. The last time she\u2019d been involved in one of Daemon\u2019s \u201cgames,\u201d the Sadist had scared the shit out of everyone in that Hayllian camp.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a game,\u201d Lucivar repeated. \u201cHe knows his role\u2014 Mother Night, he\u2019s played it enough times over the centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jaenelle is pretending to waver between refusing to believe the rumors and wondering if there\u2019s some truth to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my guess.\u201d He sighed. \u201cCome on. We\u2019d better find them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer watching the Sadist\u2019s games from a distance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But when Lucivar threaded his way through the crowd to reach the ballroom, she swore under her breath and followed him.</p><p>Lektra pulled her cousin Tavey into a small alcove where she could keep an eye on the ballroom and still talk with relative privacy. Watching Daemon fawn over Jaenelle was beyond intolerable, and if he continued playing the ardent lover so publicly, all her efforts to free him would be ruined. So she had to do something now. It was unfortunate that she didn\u2019t have time to find a male who could make the lie believable, but she had to hope that the shock of the claim would make Daemon react without thinking.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I want you to do,\u201d she said. Tavey\u2019s eyes widened as she told him.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s a Warlord Prince,\u201d Tavey said, his voice rising until she shushed him.</p> <p>\u201cExactly. By Protocol, if he\u2019s told to walk away, he has to walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut doesn\u2019t she have to tell him to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll never tell him. So you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t even know her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush!\u201d Lektra looked around to assure herself no one was paying attention to them. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. He won\u2019t know that.\u201d She paused and made her lips quiver. \u201cTavey, if you don\u2019t do this for me, my love will never be free, and if he ends up having to marry her, I\u2019ll be so miserable I\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to stand living anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Lektra. Don\u2019t.\u201d Tavey squeezed her hands. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled and gave him a brave smile. \u201cI won\u2019t forget this. And once Daemon and I are married, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll use his family\u2019s influence to get you a position in whatever court you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t mind having a month or so with Sadi\u2019s \u2018cousin.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want the whore? You can have her. I\u2019ve already made plans for getting her out of the way for a while to insure she\u2019s not a distraction. There\u2019s no reason why she can\u2019t provide you with some company while she\u2019s staying in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Daemon asked as he escorted Jaenelle around the edge of the ballroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to look petulant,\u201d she replied. \u201cDon\u2019t I look petulant?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou look like you have gas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaemon.\u201d She choked back a laugh.</p><p>His lips twitched. This party was turning out to be more fun than he\u2019d anticipated. Oh, not the party itself, but playing out this game with Jaenelle was definitely entertaining. It had been easy enough to slip behind that cold, bored expression that had served him so well in the Terreillean courts. Problem was, the mask kept slipping. They kept slipping, forgetting their roles of suspicious woman and discontented man. Dancing with her for the first time in months was too delicious a feeling to spoil with a game.</p><p>But he\u2019d agreed to play this out, so that\u2019s what he would do.</p><p>\u201cAre we still scheduled to have a public quarrel?\u201d he asked, slipping an arm around her waist once they found an open space where they could watch the dancers.</p><p>\u201cYes, we are, because I\u2019m upset with you.\u201d Jaenelle frowned as she looked at him. \u201cWhy am I upset with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that we can spend hours tonight doing the kiss-and-make-up part of this pretend quarrel,\u201d he purred, using Craft to change the sexual heat that, even leashed, poured out of him into psychic seduction tendrils that gently coiled around her while phantom hands stroked the inside of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d she gasped.</p> <p>Suddenly she was leaning hard against him, letting him support her.</p><p>\u201cFeeling a bit weak in the legs?\u201d he asked too innocently.</p><p>Her laughing snarl turned into a warm smile when she noticed the man swiftly approaching them.</p><p>Handsome, graceful and lean, with a mane of brown hair artfully disheveled, the man had fair skin, which meant he wasn\u2019t native to Dhemlan, and green eyes that were focused on Jaenelle. An Opal-Jeweled Warlord Prince. A rival.</p><p>Daemon hated him on sight.</p><p>\u201cMy darling,\u201d the man said, pressing his lips to the back of the hand Jaenelle held out to him.</p><p>\u201cPrince Rainier,\u201d Jaenelle replied, still smiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wounded,\u201d Rainier said.</p><p>Not yet, but you will be, Daemon thought.</p><p>\u201cMy favorite Lady finally makes an appearance at a party and hasn\u2019t asked me to dance,\u201d Rainier continued. \u201cBut that\u2019s all right. I\u2019m content just to flirt with you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll see you in Hell first.</p><p>Rainier gave him an amused glance before focusing on Jaenelle again. \u201cWould you mind telling your lover that I\u2019m allowed to flirt with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re allowed to flirt with me,\u201d Jaenelle said, her voice filled with laughter. \u201cAfter all, you never mean it.\u201d She paused. \u201cOn the other hand, if you were flirting with Daemon . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPointless,\u201d Rainier said, grinning, \u201csince it\u2019s so obvious that he\u2019s taken. But . . .\u201d Releasing Jaenelle\u2019s hand, he smiled at Daemon. \u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>Hot fury. Cold rage. Suddenly it was easy to slip into the game. He\u2019d assumed the person behind the rumors was female\u2014an assumption he shouldn\u2019t have made.</p><p>\u201cIf my Lady has no objections,\u201d Daemon crooned. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Lucivar and Surreal entering the ballroom. As soon as he moved away, they\u2019d stay close to Jaenelle.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d Rainier asked, glancing at Jaenelle.</p><p>She looked baffled. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Smiling, Rainier offered an arm.</p><p>Daemon didn\u2019t take the arm\u2014too much temptation to rip it off\u2014but he turned and matched his stride to the Warlord Prince beside him until they reached the dance floor.</p><p>The music started. A waltz. He wondered if Rainier had arranged that.</p><p>\u201cWho leads?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI asked, so I lead.\u201d</p><p>The man could dance. Daemon heard startled gasps, noticed other couples stumble to a halt and move out of the way. But those were distant things. His focus\u2014and his temper\u2014were fixed on Rainier.</p><p>\u201cBefore you decide in favor of killing me, I should mention that I\u2019m Second Circle,\u201d Rainier said.</p><p>That statement almost threw him off balance. It was possible. Jaenelle\u2019s court had been so informal, he\u2019d never met anyone beyond her First Circle. \u201cYou mean you were Second Circle. The Dark Court no longer exists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Yes. I\u2019m no longer Second Circle just like you\u2019re no longer the Consort.\u201d</p><p>They whirled around the dance floor, perfectly matched, studying each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think you\u2019ll find, Prince Sadi, that those who serve Jaenelle don\u2019t give a damn that there\u2019s no longer formally a court. The Dark Court still exists because she still exists. We still serve\u2014and you\u2019re still the Consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your game, Rainier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured I\u2019d better help you two by providing a distraction. You\u2019re doing a lousy imitation of a quarreling couple. You\u2019re having too much fun. I\u2019m thinking you\u2019re trying to draw out whoever started those rumors. So this should catch someone\u2019s interest.\u201d</p><p>The man had a point. They certainly had the attention of everyone in the room. \u201cHow did you end up in the Second Circle?\u201d</p><p>Rainier grinned. \u201cI was the coven\u2019s dance instructor. The fifth or sixth one the High Lord hired. I wasn\u2019t much older than the girls and had no credentials except a knowledge of, and love for, dancing, but he told me if I could last the hour with them I had the position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you lasted the hour.\u201d</p><p>Rainier nodded. \u201cThe Heart of the Realm was in that room. If the personalities and power of the coven didn\u2019t scare the shit out of a man, there was no better place to be. There\u2019s still no better place to be.\u201d</p><p>He had a feeling Rainier was more than a dance instructor, but the man wasn\u2019t a rival, and a skilled ally could prove useful right now. \u201cDo you know court dances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore court dances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lead.\u201d Daemon sent a psychic command to the head musician.</p><p>When the music changed, he and Rainier broke the steps of one dance and flowed into the other as smoothly as if they\u2019d been partners for years.</p><p>Hand to hand. Turning. Circling. Gliding. Watching each other. Restrained sensuality swelling to the point of bursting. He saw the hint of fear in Rainier\u2019s green eyes as the web of desire he was spinning through the dance became a snare for the unwary.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Rainier whispered hoarsely. \u201cYou must be a mean bastard when you want to hurt someone.\u201d</p><p>Daemon smiled a cruel, knowing smile, and crooned, \u201cBut you\u2019d let me hurt you, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The sudden tremble in Rainier\u2019s hand was answer enough.</p><p>As the dance ended, Daemon leaned in, trapping their hands between their bodies, bringing lips close to lips. \u201cThat\u2019s why they called me the Sadist.\u201d</p><p>Something was scraping his temper, some feeling in the room that reminded him too much of the Terreillean courts, something that had him teetering a heartbeat away from the killing edge.</p><p>But that something wasn\u2019t the man staring into his glazed eyes. This male belonged to his Queen and shouldn\u2019t be harmed.</p><p>With effort, he pulled back the seduction tendrils, eased back physically. \u201cThank you for the dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Rainier cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s been an education.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They walked back to where Jaenelle and Surreal stood. No one in the ballroom spoke, no one moved. Even the musicians were silent for a long moment before the music began for the next dance, and the room was once more filled with movement and murmurs.</p><p>Jaenelle watched him approach, her face flushed, her eyes wide.</p><p>Was she repulsed by seeing him dance with another man? What was she thinking? He wanted to reach out, mind to mind, but he didn\u2019t dare. Not when his temper was being held back by a frayed thread.</p><p>As he stopped in front of her, Rainier still beside him, he saw her throat muscles working to swallow.</p> <p>Looking dazed, Jaenelle said, \u201cIt\u2019s awfully warm in here. Is it warm in here?\u201d</p><p>Surreal snorted as she studied him and Rainier. \u201cSugar, we passed warm and leaped straight to blazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good. It\u2019s not just me.\u201d</p><p>Surreal gave him a wary look and linked her arm through Jaenelle\u2019s. \u201cI imagine everyone is feeling a bit warm right now. Let\u2019s go out on the terrace and get some air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAir is good,\u201d Jaenelle said, wobbling a little. \u201cAir is . . . good.\u201d</p> <p>He said nothing as the two women made their way to the glass doors that led out to the terrace.</p><p>Rainier cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s been . . . um . . .\u201d He shook his head and walked away.</p><p>Daemon stayed where he was, watching Lucivar approach, seeing wariness in his brother\u2019s gold eyes. Rainier had been given the lightest taste of what it was like to dance with the Sadist, but Lucivar knew. And Lucivar was afraid.</p><p>But being afraid never stopped him from issuing a challenge with all the Eyrien arrogance in him.</p><p>\u201cQuite a dance,\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>\u201cIt had its moments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRainier is a good Warlord Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dance instructor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p><p>Which confirmed his sense of the man. \u201cWho trained him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI helped him hone what he\u2019d already learned.\u201d</p><p>Which meant Rainier wasn\u2019t just a natural predator, he was also a well-trained killer.</p><p>\u201cDaemon . . . Jaenelle and Rainier are just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It isn\u2019t him. But there\u2019s something in this room . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m going to find someplace to be alone for a few minutes. I need a few minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Lucivar stepped aside, letting him pass. With a bit of hunting, he found a small, secondary parlor near the ballroom. By the look of it, this was where visitors who weren\u2019t \u201cimportant company\u201d were entertained. Which meant right now it was quiet and empty, and that was what he needed to bring himself back from the point of going cold.</p><p>Lektra grabbed Tavey\u2019s arm. \u201cDo it now. He\u2019s by himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to talk to him alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t do it when she\u2019s nearby, and she\u2019s been clinging to him all night. This may be your only chance.\u201d And after watching him dance with that other Warlord Prince, she\u2019d go mad if she couldn\u2019t have Daemon soon.</p><p>Tavey looked scared, but he never could refuse her for very long. So he left the ballroom to deliver his little speech.</p><p>By the end of the evening, her beautiful love would be free to be with the one woman in the whole Realm who truly deserved to have him.</p><p>Hearing the parlor door open, Daemon slipped his hands into his trouser pockets to hide his wedding ring. He\u2019d spent the past few minutes just staring at it, taking comfort in its presence. He\u2019d almost regained his balance, but he wasn\u2019t quite far enough away from the killing edge yet. He needed to find Jaenelle and tell her he couldn\u2019t go through with their public quarrel. He couldn\u2019t afford to have anything prick his temper right now.</p><p>As he turned toward the door, he caught sight of himself in the mirror above the fireplace. His gold eyes were still glazed\u2014the prelude to cold rage.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d he snarled softly as the Yellow-Jeweled Warlord slipped into the room and closed the door. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d The Warlord swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is the right thing?\u201d He glided toward the door, forcing the Warlord to sidle farther into the room to avoid getting close to him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014We\u2019re in love. We want to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is \u2018we\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaenelle. Me. We\u2019re in love. But she hasn\u2019t wanted to say anything because . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d Daemon asked too softly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s afraid of you.\u201d The Warlord blurted out the words. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to be with someone like you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like me.\u201d The words sliced his heart, inserted a tiny sliver of doubt. Then he rubbed his left thumb against his wedding ring.</p><p>If Jaenelle had fallen in love with someone else, she might not have told him until she felt capable of dealing with him. But she never would have married him, because she understood the nature of Warlord Princes better than anyone else could.</p><p>\u201cYou may be in love,\u201d Daemon said, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re lovers.\u201d</p><p>His brain shut off, snuffing out control, shattering the illusion of civilized behavior. As he descended to the level of the Black, the cold, glorious Black, every thought, every feeling funneled through the lethal rage of a Warlord Prince.</p><p>Ice glazed the mirror over the fireplace, formed a crust over the carpet. In the moments when he and the Warlord stared at each other, he created a bubble shield and an aural shield, both ready to snap into place in a heartbeat. Then he rose from the abyss, his Black power delicately surrounding that weaker mind, preventing the Warlord from reaching anyone through a psychic thread.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Daemon crooned as he drew his left hand out of his pocket and rubbed a finger over his chin, \u201cjust when did you sleep with my wife?\u201d</p><p>Horror filled the Warlord\u2019s eyes as he stared at the plain gold band.</p><p>The aural and bubble shield snapped up around the Warlord at the same moment Daemon\u2019s Black power smashed through all of the man\u2019s inner barriers.</p><p>The Warlord\u2019s mouth opened in a scream of terror and pain, but no sound filled the room. He tried to run\u2014and crashed against the shield that contained him.</p><p>Daemon gave his prey a few moments to stare at death before he ripped into the Warlord\u2019s mind\u2014and found all the answers he needed.</p><p>One flash of the Black. The Warlord\u2019s torso burst open, his guts spilling out. Ribs snapped as they were ruthlessly spread open. The heart burst out of the body to hang, impaled, on a shattered rib.</p><p>Another flash of the Black. Witchfire filled the Warlord\u2019s skull\u2014and it burned. As the Warlord hit the floor, the skull broke open. Hot ash spilled out on the ice-covered carpet. Steam rose as the ice melted, soaking the carpet enough to keep it from catching fire.</p><p>One last flash of the Black drained the Warlord\u2019s Jewels and burned out all of the man\u2019s psychic power, finishing the kill.</p><p>Daemon studied his work with a critical eye\u2014and smiled a cold, cruel smile.</p><p>Lucivar flung the parlor door open and rushed into the room, pulling up fast when he saw the body on the floor. His gorge rose, but he braced himself for whatever would come. He knew what that glazed, sleepy look in Daemon\u2019s eyes meant, what that smile meant. The Sadist had gone cold, and there was no one strong enough to control him.</p><p>Daemon glided up to him\u2014and waited.</p><p>\u201cAnnoyed about something?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d Stepping around him, Daemon walked to the door and stopped. \u201cShall we go? I have an appointment to quarrel with my Lady.\u201d</p><p>No. Sweet Darkness, no. Lucivar moved to the door. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to quarrel with Jaenelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat my Queen wants, my Queen will have.\u201d</p><p>Knowing better than to argue, Lucivar walked out of the parlor. Daemon followed him. The door closed behind them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Prick,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be much of a quarrel.\u201d</p><p>Daemon walked away. Lucivar hesitated, then turned back to the parlor. Better to get rid of the corpse before someone else found it.</p><p>But when he reached for the doorknob, a feeling of revulsion swept through him, making his skin crawl. Stepping back, he studied the door. Stepping forward, the feeling swept over him again.</p><p>Craft. Daemon had done something in the moment when he walked out the door that guaranteed no one would willingly open that door until the spell wore off. Which meant Daemon wanted the body to be found\u2014but not until he was ready to have it found.</p><p>\u201cWell, bitch . . . or whoever you are,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou wanted to play with the Sadist? Looks like you\u2019ll get your chance.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from the parlor, Lucivar hurried back to the ballroom. He couldn\u2019t stop what would happen, but he\u2019d do whatever he could to protect Jaenelle and Surreal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Daemon glided back to the ballroom. He had to find Jaenelle and get them both out of this house. He was a danger to everyone around him right now. The kill had cleared his mind enough to give him back a fragment of control, but not enough for him to be sure he wouldn\u2019t leave these rooms strewn with corpses.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jaenelle was waiting near the door, waiting for her cue to begin the quarrel.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she asked, handing her glass of sparkling wine to Surreal.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. It stabbed at him that her power was so much less that she hadn\u2019t been able to tell that he\u2019d descended to the Black, that he was struggling not to go cold again.</p> <p>He walked past her, not quite knowing what to do. He didn\u2019t want to quarrel with her. Couldn\u2019t quarrel with her. If he said anything that hurt her . . . Mother Night, he\u2019d destroyed entire courts in Terreille when his temper had been riding this edge. If he hurt her, his control would snap completely, and the killing wouldn\u2019t stop until he\u2019d exhausted his body and his power.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Jaenelle raised her voice enough to have conversations throughout the ballroom stutter to a halt.</p><p>He pivoted to face her, enough space between them to explain the raised voices. As he looked into her eyes, relief swept through him so fiercely he felt light-headed. She knew. Whatever her reasons for going through with this \u201cquarrel,\u201d she knew he was too close to the killing edge and would take care not to push him back into a lethal rage.</p><p>He saw Lucivar walk into the ballroom, saw Surreal hand over Jaenelle\u2019s glass of sparkling wine. Hoping those two would have the good sense to stay out of this, he focused on Jaenelle, who, along with everyone else in the room, was waiting for his answer.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t with another woman, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking,\u201d he snarled.</p> <p>He felt a flash of frustration from her as she tried to find some way to respond to his words that wouldn\u2019t hurt either of them.</p><p>Balling her hands into fists, she shouted something at him. The fact that Lucivar choked on the wine confirmed the words were Eyrien, but he didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d said. Which gave him a clue how to provide the tone of a quarrel without wounding.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was only one phrase he could think of that no one else would understand. So he bared his teeth and said the words he\u2019d intended to say out of love, in the heat of passion. Words in the Old Tongue.</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock. She clamped a hand over her mouth to muffle the mewling noises. Then she whirled and rushed out of the ballroom.</p><p>Startled by her response, he hesitated. Play out the game, old son. Struggling to look irritated and slightly disgusted, he shook his head and left the ballroom to find Jaenelle.</p><p>She\u2019d made it as far as the conservatory, where large ferns shielded her, giving her some privacy. He approached quietly, pained to see her shoulders hunched and her hands over her face. She gasped for air between sobs.</p> <p>\u201cJaenelle,\u201d he said, brushing a hand over her shoulder\u2014and bracing himself for her rejection of his touch. Mother Night, she sounded close to hysterical.</p><p>She lowered her hands and looked at him.</p><p>She was close to hysterical . . . because she was laughing so hard she could barely stay on her feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I eat cow brains?\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Shocked, his mouth fell open. \u201cWhat? You do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-n-no. You do.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her upper arms to keep her upright. \u201cWhat? No, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s what you said. \u2018I eat cow brains.\u2019 \u201d She collapsed against him, howling with laughter.</p> <p>That was so far removed from what he\u2019d intended to say it was embarrassing\u2014and he could imagine how much worse it would have been if he\u2019d whispered those words in the middle of hot lovemaking. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t\u2014It wasn\u2019t what I thought I said.\u201d Feeling his face heat, he wrapped his arms around her and pressed her face against his chest to muffle her laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, g-good.\u201d She gulped air and made an effort to regain some control. \u201cWhat did you mean to say?\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. He wasn\u2019t about to embarrass himself that much. \u201cNever mind.\u201d He paused. \u201cSo what did you say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, fair is fair.\u201d He tugged on her hair. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you had the feet of a pig and smelled like a goat.\u201d She burst into laughter again.</p><p>Daemon sighed. \u201cWell, we certainly descended fast enough to barnyard mudslinging, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did. Oh, we did.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter broke his temper better than anything else could have. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>She gulped and wiped the tears from her face. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can.\u201d</p><p>He picked her up. \u201cJust keep your face turned away. I\u2019ll get us to the carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to look all snarly and fierce?\u201d she asked, fighting against another burst of laughter.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d And if he didn\u2019t get them away from here in a hurry, they were both going to be rolling on the floor, laughing like fools.</p><p>After contacting the carriage driver they\u2019d hired for the evening, he strode out of the conservatory\u2014and almost ran into Surreal. The look in her eyes told him she was primed for a fight. She couldn\u2019t take him, but he respected her as an adversary\u2014and she\u2019d fight him until he killed her if she thought Jaenelle needed the protection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her home,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cShe\u2019s hysterical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Jaenelle bubbled. \u201cI really am.\u201d She turned her head to look at Surreal.</p><p>\u201cYeeesss, I can see that,\u201d Surreal said, narrowing her gold-green eyes.</p><p>Because he didn\u2019t want Surreal to worry about Jaenelle, he shifted his bundle of witch, drawing her attention to his hands. Then he dropped the sight shield around his wedding ring for a moment.</p><p>Brushing past Surreal, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll send the carriage back for you and Lucivar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d Surreal muttered.</p><p>No one else tried to stop him, no one else even dared speak to him as he walked out of the house and settled his Lady in the carriage. Jaenelle might find his fierce and snarly look amusing, but the rest of the Blood at the party finally began to realize he was a male they should fear. And very soon, they would understand why.</p><p>Surreal stood just inside the conservatory, wanting a few moments alone to ponder.</p><p>Had she really seen what she thought she\u2019d seen? Sadi . . . wearing a wedding ring? He and Jaenelle. Married?</p><p>\u201cSurreal?\u201d Lucivar stepped into the conservatory.</p><p>\u201cHe took her home. She was hysterical.\u201d</p><p>Grim worry filled Lucivar\u2019s eyes. \u201cHysterical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was laughing so hard, I don\u2019t know what else to call it.\u201d</p><p>The grimness faded but the worry remained.</p><p>Wanting to ease the worry, she said, \u201cSo what did Jaenelle say that made you snort wine out your nose?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I should repeat it.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head to one side. \u201cYou tell me what she said, and I\u2019ll tell you what I just found out.\u201d</p><p>So he told her, and when she managed to stop laughing, he growled, \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d</p><p>She took his left hand and tapped a finger against the gold band. \u201cDaemon\u2019s wearing one of these.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure how she expected Lucivar to respond, but she hadn\u2019t expected his concern to increase. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He stared over her shoulder. \u201cDo you know the only thing more dangerous than a Warlord Prince? A married Warlord Prince who has someone playing games with his life that could threaten his marriage.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly nothing was amusing. Provoked, Daemon was dangerous enough. Pushed to defend something, or someone, who truly mattered to him . . .</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s split up. Maybe we can learn something that will help end this.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar shook his head. \u201cDaemon may already have all the information he needs.\u201d</p><p>Shit. She had a good idea what that meant. \u201cI\u2019m going to the ladies\u2019 lounge and freshen up. I\u2019ll meet you at the front door. I think I\u2019d rather wait for the carriage outside.\u201d</p><p>He headed back to the ballroom to talk to Rainier, and she headed for the lounge. It had struck her as odd that a private home would have a \u201clounge\u201d until she discovered the owners often \u201cloaned\u201d out the downstairs rooms for a \u201cmonetary gift.\u201d She didn\u2019t know why they couldn\u2019t just say they rented out their ballroom, but the lounge made sense, and right now, she was glad to have the privacy.</p><p>After taking care of personal needs, she sat down on a padded bench and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d</p><p>Damn. She must be more tired than she thought. She hadn\u2019t even heard the woman enter.</p><p>She opened her eyes and studied the woman who stood nearby, looking concerned. The face looked vaguely familiar, but she was certain she\u2019d never met the other witch. She was also certain there was something about the woman that wasn\u2019t quite . . . right. Something that put her on edge. Something that made her want to call in a knife.</p><p>She smiled and wrinkled her nose. \u201cJust cramps,\u201d she lied. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re wicked mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling. Let me get you something to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s all right.\u201d She shifted on the bench, prepared to get up and leave.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble. Really.\u201d</p><p>Suppressed excitement in the voice. A feverish glint in the eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The witch opened the lounge door and whispered something to someone outside. Then she closed the door and leaned against it.</p><p>Bitch. Surreal felt fairly certain she\u2019d just met the source of Daemon\u2019s problems, but considering Daemon\u2019s mood and Lucivar\u2019s worry about Daemon\u2019s mood, she\u2019d prefer being absolutely certain before she said anything to either of them. And there was still the question of why anyone would be foolish enough to play with a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before someone knocked on the door. The witch opened it, and another Dhemlan witch Surreal didn\u2019t recognize slipped into the room, carrying a glass.</p><p>Same suppressed excitement. Same feverish glint in the eyes.</p> <p>The first witch took the glass from her companion, then handed it to Surreal. \u201cDrink this. You\u2019ll feel better in no time.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Cramps aren\u2019t a problem when you\u2019re dead, Surreal thought. As soon as the other woman let go of the glass, she used Craft to probe the liquid and the glass itself. No poisons. But there was something in the sparkling wine. She didn\u2019t recognize the drug, but she could sense its presence. Probably meant to knock her out for a while. But why knock her out?</p><p>Obvious. They wanted her out of the way for some reason. Of course, if she was unconscious, she wouldn\u2019t be hard to kill.</p><p>Refuse the drink and put these two bitches on alert\u2014maybe make them nervous enough to bolt\u2014or drink it and hope she wasn\u2019t doing something stupid? Because if they did end up killing her, Lucivar would help her make the transition to demon-dead just so he could spend a decade or two yelling at her, and the High Lord . . . Uncle Saetan would be sooo pissed.</p><p>She studied the two women and saw a kernel of suspicion in the eyes of the witch who had first approached her. So she took a sip, figuring she could get enough of a sense of what the drug was without it disabling her.</p> <p>She figured wrong. That one sip made the room lift and drop with stomach-churning speed. Her fingers went numb. The glass dropped to the floor. Her vision faded.</p><p>She made one attempt to contact Lucivar on a psychic thread, but even that was already beyond her ability.</p><p>\u201cAh, shit,\u201d she muttered before she tumbled off the bench.</p><p>004</p><p>Lektra suppressed the urge to give her rival a hard kick in the ribs. Or in the face. After all, she\u2019d promised Tavey he could have the whore for a while, so it wasn\u2019t fair to damage the bitch beforehand. And it was possible that the SaDiablo family would be upset if anything . . . permanent . . . happened to Surreal. But they could hardly complain about a whore spreading her legs for one more man. Besides, it wasn\u2019t like Tavey would be paying for the sex.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get her out of here,\u201d Lektra said.</p> <p>Roxie opened the lounge door, peeked out, then signaled. A moment later, a Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord slipped into the room.</p><p>Lektra didn\u2019t like the man. Rough manners, rough temper. Roxie had found him somewhere, and the payment that had been promised had been enough to make him put aside any qualms about being an \u201cescort\u201d for an unwilling witch.</p><p>\u201cTake her to the country house as arranged, and keep her there until I say otherwise,\u201d Lektra said.</p><p>\u201cGets boring in the country,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find something to do,\u201d she replied, glancing pointedly at Surreal.</p><p>He smiled\u2014and she sincerely hoped she\u2019d never see him again. Of course, once she and Daemon were married, she\u2019d never have to worry about men like him.</p><p>She watched him pull Surreal up off the floor. A moment later, he left the lounge, wrapped in a sight shield to avoid anyone inquiring about his presence at an aristo party\u2014or about the woman slung over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better leave,\u201d Lektra said. \u201cHave you seen Tavey?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot since earlier this evening, when he left the ballroom,\u201d Roxie replied.</p><p>Tavey should have come back to report Daemon\u2019s reaction to their conversation. She\u2019d seen her beautiful love carry that pale bitch out of the party. She hadn\u2019t liked that. He should have asked his brother to take her home. No matter. He wouldn\u2019t have to cater to Jaenelle Angelline much longer.</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t meet up with him on our way out, Tavey will have to make his own way home,\u201d Lektra said.</p><p>With Roxie discreetly staying in the background, Lektra made her way to the front door, slipping into the ballroom and making a point of being seen talking to Lady Zhara, who had arrived late\u2014and also giving herself and Roxie a reason to avoid walking past Lucivar Yaslana on the chance that he might recognize Roxie by her psychic scent, despite the illusion spell.</p><p>As soon as he strode away from the front door, they hurried out and went home.</p><p>Swearing under his breath, Lucivar headed for the ladies\u2019 lounge. Hell\u2019s fire! How long did it take a woman to piss anyway?</p><p>He flung the door open and walked in, not caring if he walked in on a woman pulling down her pants or pulling them up. But the lounge area was empty, and the toilet wasn\u2019t occupied.</p><p>Damn her. Where did she\u2014</p><p>Turning to leave, he spotted the glass on the floor near a padded bench. Crouching, he studied it. Most of the liquid had seeped into the carpet, but the few drops left in the glass were enough.</p><p>*Surreal!* His temper flared. *Surreal!*</p><p>No answer. Not even an irritable flicker that would have helped him pinpoint a direction.</p><p>*Rainier.*</p><p>*Yaslana?*</p><p>*Have you seen Surreal?*</p><p>*Not since I danced with her earlier. Is there a problem?*</p><p>*I\u2019m not sure yet. See if you can find her. I\u2019m going out to widen the search.*</p><p>Rainier hesitated. *Are you going to contact Prince Sadi?*</p><p>Now Lucivar hesitated. *No. Not yet.*</p><p>He left the party and spent hours soaring over Amdarh, searching, hunting, calling.</p><p>No answer. No way to find her.</p><p>As night gave way to the first hint of dawn, he flew back to the family town house. Daemon knew Surreal better than the rest of them. It was time to call him into the hunt.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>1</p><p>A roar of fury and frustration that sounded like Lucivar in a mood rattled Surreal\u2019s mind, jolting her awake. Her head pounded, and her stomach felt queasy. And that pissed her off.</p><p>Moving slowly, she rolled to her side and opened her eyes. The soft predawn light revealed enough to confirm she was in an unfamiliar room. A pillow under her head and a sheet beneath her hand told her she was in a bed. And her psychic senses told her she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Pushing herself upright, she swung her legs over the side of the bed\u2014and swore silently as the bed seemed to lift and dip under her. Apparently, her body hadn\u2019t worked through all the effects of the drug, which was still playing nasty games with her sense of balance.</p><p>A chair creaked. A large body moved to a lamp on the table near the window. The sudden flare of light as he used Craft to engage the candle-lights made her squint.</p><p>\u201cThey said you wouldn\u2019t wake up until sometime this afternoon,\u201d he said, giving her a mean smile. \u201cGlad that\u2019s not the case. It was getting boring, just watching you sleep.\u201d</p><p>Since the skirt of her gown was shoved up to the tops of her thighs, she figured his self-restraint had more to do with not wanting to soil his cock with moon\u2019s blood than using an unconscious woman for sex.</p><p>She knew his type, had seen enough men like him when she was a child living in the meanest streets of a city in Terreille, whoring to earn enough to buy a day\u2019s food and, maybe, some shelter for the night.</p><p>\u201cJust so you don\u2019t go getting any ideas, Greenie, there\u2019s a Sapphire shield around this room and a Sapphire lock on the door. So you don\u2019t go anywhere unless I say you can.\u201d</p><p>Greenie? She\u2019d never advertised she wore the Gray when she\u2019d worked in the Red Moon houses in Terreille, and while she hadn\u2019t made it a secret since coming to Kaeleer, there weren\u2019t many of the Blood beyond those who had been in Jaenelle\u2019s First Circle and the ones who lived in Ebon Rih who knew she wore a Jewel darker than her Birthright Green.</p><p>Which meant there might be a few other things the bitch who arranged this didn\u2019t know about her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014What do you know about me?\u201d she asked. The shakiness in her voice was due to the drug her body was still shaking off, but it made her sound afraid and, right now, that suited her just fine.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re a Green-Jeweled witch who\u2019s caused some trouble for a fine aristo Lady, who paid me a generous sum to make sure you don\u2019t cause her any more trouble. And I\u2019ve heard you were an expensive whore who only worked out of the best Red Moon houses until you came to Kaeleer and managed to talk yourself into an influential family.\u201d He stared at her mouth and leered. \u201cOr maybe you did something besides talk to convince them you\u2019d be handy to have around.\u201d</p><p>Bastard. Her legs wobbled when she stood up, but she steadied quickly as the last of the drug, meant to subdue a Green-Jeweled witch, was burned off by a body that was a vessel for the Gray.</p><p>She walked up to him, keeping her gait unsteady. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>His big hands clamped on her shoulders, pulling her against him. \u201cYou be good to me, and I\u2019ll be good to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be good.\u201d Her right hand curled in preparation for calling in her stiletto. \u201cSugar? There\u2019s one thing your Lady forgot to mention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked as one hand groped her breast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The stiletto was in her hand and through his ribs before he realized she\u2019d moved. His eyes widened.</p><p>Surreal bared her teeth in a smile. \u201cI earned more as an assassin than I ever made as a whore.\u201d She rammed the stiletto into him up to the hilt, piercing his heart.</p><p>He hit the floor with a hard thud.</p><p>Surreal yanked the blade out of him, cleaned it on his shirt, then vanished it. Her \u201chousekeeping\u201d completed, she studied him.</p> <p>\u201cI think it takes a few hours to make the transition to demon-dead, but it would be best to make sure you don\u2019t wander off before we have a little chat,\u201d she told him.

Wake up.*</p><p>Lucivar. Hell\u2019s fire. Just because the man was usually up before the sun didn\u2019t mean everyone wanted to be.</p><p>But he got out of bed, pulled on a robe, and slipped into the hallway. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, his voice rough from sleep. Then he noticed that Lucivar looked furious and exhausted. That woke up all his fighting instincts. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cSurreal is missing.\u201d</p><p>The three of them sat at one end of the dining table, the remains of a small, hastily made breakfast in front of them.</p><p>\u201cIf she was drugged, we\u2019ll find her as soon as she wakes,\u201d Jaenelle said after Lucivar related his search\u2014and his failure to find Surreal.</p> <p>\u201cIf they didn\u2019t kill her,\u201d Lucivar snarled.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d better start looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Daemon said. He poured them all more coffee. \u201cI want you to go back to the Hall.\u201d</p><p>A feral anger that excited and chilled him came into Jaenelle\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my family, too,\u201d Jaenelle said in a voice that warned him he was close to crossing a line he might never be able to cross back over.</p><p>He laid a hand over hers, needing her to understand. \u201cI know she is, but they\u2019ve already tried to hurt you, and if they\u2019re confident they\u2019re strong enough to take on a Gray-Jeweled witch, they aren\u2019t going to hesitate to go after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey?\u201d Jaenelle asked too softly.</p><p>\u201cI know who\u2019s behind this. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Alone. This began with an obsession with me, so it\u2019s mine to deal with. But I need to know you\u2019re safe. I need that, Jaenelle. Please.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a long time. Then she drew her hand away from his and pushed her chair back. \u201cVery well, Prince. I\u2019ll go back to the Hall, and you do what you have to do. But once that\u2019s done, you and I will talk.\u201d She walked away from the table.</p><p>\u201cJaenelle.\u201d He waited until she turned to face him. \u201cThis has nothing to do with the Jewels you wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I still wore Ebony, would you ask me to go back to the Hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Because this is mine to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk, Prince,\u201d she said after giving him a long, thoughtful look. Then she left the dining room.</p><p>Lucivar winced. \u201cShe\u2019s never cheerful in the morning. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He also knew that this \u201ctalk\u201d would determine whether or not he still wore a wedding ring.</p><p>Lucivar cleared his throat. \u201cSo. When were you going to tell me that you and Jaenelle were already married?\u201d</p><p>He suddenly felt awkward, and that surprised him. So he kept his eyes on his cup. \u201cWe just wanted to get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that. The celebration coming is more for everyone else than the two of you.\u201d Lucivar paused. \u201cBut if you\u2019d asked, I would have been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Jaenelle,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cFor Jaenelle,\u201d Lucivar agreed. \u201cAnd for you.\u201d</p><p>Daemon looked up and met Lucivar\u2019s eyes\u2014and saw things he hadn\u2019t been sure he\u2019d ever see again. Love. Understanding. Acceptance.</p><p>And for you. Those three words healed the last of the rift between them.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Daemon said, his voice husky.</p><p>Lucivar reached across the table. Daemon locked hands with his brother. They didn\u2019t say anything. They didn\u2019t need to.</p><p>Finally, reluctantly, Daemon eased back. \u201cI\u2019d like you to take Jaenelle to the Hall. I\u2019ll ask Father to come to the Hall to free you up in case there\u2019s more than one battlefield. I don\u2019t think it will come to that, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucivar nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll contact Marian and ask her to come to the Hall to keep Jaenelle company.\u201d He waited a beat. \u201cWhat about Surreal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find Surreal.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar pushed away from the table. \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s get this done.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>Daemon waited until Lucivar and Jaenelle were on their way to the Hall before trying to contact Surreal. The staff had cleaned off the dining room table and brought him a fresh cup and another pot of coffee.</p><p>Pouring a cup, he sent a call on a Gray psychic thread, aimed toward a mind he knew well. *Surreal?*</p><p>*What?*</p><p>The surly tone relieved him enough to make him smile. *Are you all right?*</p><p>*I\u2019m . . . fine.*</p><p>*Where are you?*</p><p>*Country house. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s that far away from Amdarh. *</p><p>*Are you sure you\u2019re all right? You sound breathless.*</p><p>*Damn . . . ax . . . is dull.*</p><p>Daemon raised an eyebrow. *Do I want to know what you\u2019re doing with an ax?*</p><p>*Have you had breakfast?*</p><p>*I\u2019ve eaten.*</p><p>*Then you don\u2019t want to know.*</p><p>He sipped his coffee while he considered how to respond to that.</p><p>*In a few hours, I might have some information for you,* Surreal said.</p><p>*I know who\u2019s behind the rumors.*</p><p>*Well . . . shit.* A pause. *Guess I\u2019ll finish this anyway.*</p><p>*Do you need help?*</p><p>*Do you?*</p><p>*No.*</p><p>*Then I\u2019ll take care of my business, and you take care of yours. I\u2019ll be back in Amdarh late tonight.*</p><p>Taking a last sip of coffee, Daemon left the dining room. Since Surreal didn\u2019t need his help, he\u2019d take care of the next errand.</p><p>4</p><p>After he and Saetan had settled in comfortable chairs in one of the Keep\u2019s smaller sitting rooms, Daemon got to the point.</p><p>\u201cI have business to take care of in Amdarh. Until it\u2019s done, I would appreciate it if you would stay at the Hall\u2014at least for part of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo protect Jaenelle?\u201d Saetan asked softly.</p><p>Daemon nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lucivar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be there. So will Kaelas and Ladvarian. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>Daemon looked into his father\u2019s golden eyes. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Saetan inclined his head. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>No questions about his business, no comment about why an Arcerian cat and an Eyrien Warlord Prince wouldn\u2019t be sufficient protection. There was no need. He was, after all, his father\u2019s mirror.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Daemon hesitated. Who else could he ask? \u201cI\u2014There was something I wanted to say to Jaenelle . . . in the Old Tongue. But it didn\u2019t come out as I intended.\u201d</p><p>Saetan raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Daemon hesitated, then said the words.</p><p>\u201c \u2018I eat cow brains\u2019?\u201d Saetan burst out laughing.</p><p>Since there was nothing else he could do, he sat back to wait out his father\u2019s amusement. So he waited. And waited. And waited. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, he sighed. It could have been worse. There could have been witnesses. No matter what else was said about him, he did not want to be known as the man who had reduced the High Lord of Hell to giggles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Saetan gasped. Calling in a handkerchief, he wiped his eyes. \u201cI can imagine the response to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can,\u201d Daemon said dryly.</p><p>With effort, Saetan regained his composure. \u201cSo, what were you trying to say?\u201d</p> <p>Daemon took a deep breath, let it out slowly\u2014and told him.</p><p>Great. Wonderful. He\u2019d not only made the High Lord giggle, he\u2019d made the man blush.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Saetan cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m . . . not sure that can be said in the Old Tongue. Let me think about it and see if I can come up with something that would let Jaenelle know she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything,\u201d Daemon finished quietly. \u201cShe is everything.\u201d</p><p>Saetan smiled. \u201cYes. She is everything.\u201d</p> <p>FOURTEEN</p><p>1</p><p>Shivering, Lektra called in a shawl and wrapped it around herself. So cold. So terribly cold. But no one else seemed to notice except Roxie, who had retreated to her room.</p><p>Tavey was dead. Viciously murdered. Lady Zhara\u2019s Master of the Guard had come earlier that morning to tell her the body had been found\u2014and to ask questions. Even through her shock and dismay, she\u2019d realized the Master didn\u2019t care who had killed Tavey. After all, there was no law against murder among the Blood. No, he\u2019d come to the town house as a courtesy\u2014and to find out if Tavey\u2019s death foreshadowed a danger to his Queen.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell him what he wanted to know, and she wasn\u2019t about to tell him anything else. What could she say? She didn\u2019t actually know Tavey had talked to Daemon. And why would her beautiful love kill a man who was offering him a way out of an unwanted marriage? Besides, Daemon had been trained to be a lover, not a warrior.</p><p>So it had to have been someone else, someone who didn\u2019t want Daemon free of his ties to Jaenelle Angelline.</p> <p>A warrior. Like Lucivar Yaslana. Maybe Daemon had already left the parlor by the time Tavey got there. Maybe Tavey had found Lucivar in the parlor and had blurted out his little speech, thinking that telling Daemon\u2019s brother was easier than telling Daemon himself. But Lucivar was an Eyrien warrior. Brutal. Savage. Roxie had told her over and over how mean Lucivar had been to her, threatening to kill her once he got tired of bedding her, forcing her to flee her home and family in Ebon Rih so that he could marry some hearth witch nobody.</p><p>Yes, Lucivar Yaslana wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about killing Tavey. After all, killing was what he did. Why not force Daemon into continuing to play nursemaid so that he wouldn\u2019t have to take care of Jaenelle?</p><p>She walked over to the window, intending to look out, but something shuddered through her, making her back away.</p><p>There was something outside, waiting for her. Something dangerous. Something deadly. Something cold.</p><p>Shivering violently, Lektra hurried to the other side of the room, away from the windows, away from whatever was out there.</p><p>As long as she stayed inside, she was safe. Whatever it was couldn\u2019t get in, couldn\u2019t harm her. As long as she stayed inside.</p><p>Wrapped in Black shields that prevented the rest of the Blood from detecting his presence, Daemon watched the town house across the street. Lady Lektra\u2019s town house. Easy enough to find the root of all the rumors once he\u2019d known where to look\u2014and if it hadn\u2019t been for the Warlord at the party last night, he never would have looked in her direction. He\u2019d probably seen her at a party or some other public gathering, maybe had even danced with her, a transient partner in one of those country dances. But he didn\u2019t remember her. The face he\u2019d pulled from the Warlord\u2019s mind meant nothing to him.</p><p>Lektra\u2019s friend, however, did have a connection to him. Or, at least, to his brother. How unfortunate for her.</p> <p>Smiling, Daemon walked away. His prey wouldn\u2019t go anywhere. The spells he\u2019d wrapped around the town house would make sure of that. Whenever Lektra or Roxie got near a window or door leading outside, they would feel certain something deadly waited for them beyond those doors and windows . . .</p><p>Which was true.</p><p>... and they were safe as long as they remained inside.</p><p>Which was not true.</p><p>But he would let them have the illusion of safety for a few more hours. Because some games were best played in the dark.</p><p>2</p><p>Saetan knocked on the workroom door, then opened it enough to poke his head into the room. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a witchling. Seen any about?\u201d</p><p>Turning away from the worktable, Jaenelle gave him a dazzling smile. \u201cPapa! What brings you to the Hall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in particular,\u201d he replied, walking toward the worktable. \u201cI just wanted to see . . . how . . . you were . . . doing.\u201d He stared at the rosebush rising up from a bowl on the table. \u201cMother Night, witch-child. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle looked at the rosebush and grinned. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with it.\u201d</p><p>Saetan circled the table to get a better look at the illusion she\u2019d created. But he tried to touch one of the roses just to be sure it was an illusion. She\u2019d always been able to create illusion spells that could fool the eye, and it seemed she hadn\u2019t lost that ability. But something felt different about this spell.</p><p>\u201cCan you show me how you did this?\u201d</p><p>She looked at the various jars and small bowls on the table and nodded. \u201cI have enough ingredients to make several more.\u201d</p><p>So she showed him how to build a rosebush out of powders made from pastel chalks, dried rose petals, thorns, and a few other things. He mentally noted what she did and how much of each ingredient she used, but most of his attention was on Twilight\u2019s Dawn.</p><p>Whenever he\u2019d seen it before, the Jewel she now wore looked like a Purple Dusk accented by other colors. Now, as she worked through the illusion spell, he watched it change. When she began working on the leaves, the center of the Jewel became dominantly Green, then shifted to Rose with a strong touch of Red while she created the flowers.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why it was changing like that, didn\u2019t know how it could change like that.</p><p>It played havoc with his ability to measure her strength against his own because hers kept sliding. One moment he would have sworn the woman beside him was a Rose-Jeweled witch. The next moment, her power resonated with his Birthright Red. It was as if she were dancing on webs of power, and the threads she plucked shone the brightest.</p><p>Webs of power. Lorn had created webs of power to help prevent Witch, the living myth, from plunging back into the Darkness after Jaenelle unleashed her Ebony power to save Kaeleer. And Lorn had given Ladvarian the Jewel that was called Twilight\u2019s Dawn.</p><p>Fingers snapping in front of his face startled a snarl out of him.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, witch-child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you haven\u2019t heard anything I\u2019ve said for the past minute or so,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to come back from wherever your mind had wandered and find me gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d His heart leaped as memories of webs of power shattering in the abyss filled his mind. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>We can\u2019t lose her now. We can\u2019t. She is everything. She is still everything.</p><p>Jaenelle studied him for a long moment, her sapphire eyes seeing too much. But she gave him a daughter\u2019s tolerant smile. \u201cFirst I\u2019m going to wash up. Then I\u2019m going to join the others for the midday meal. Which I already told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, witch-child. You\u2019re right. My mind was elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed. Are you going to join us? Khary and Morghann are here, as well as Lucivar and Marian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d like to stay here and play around with your powders if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle kissed his cheek. \u201cPlease yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, witch-child?\u201d He looked into her eyes. Still beautiful, still ancient. But he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he had disappointed her in some way. \u201cAre you pleased?\u201d She knew him well enough to know he wasn\u2019t asking about the illusion spell.</p><p>\u201cI lost nothing I regret losing,\u201d Witch said softly. \u201cI am what I want to be.\u201d</p><p>He watched her walk out of the room. There was a message under her words, something she wanted him to understand but didn\u2019t want to tell him outright.</p><p>Turning back to the worktable, he set her rosebushes to one side. Maybe figuring out one puzzle would help him figure out the other.</p><p>\u201cAm I interrupting? I could come back later.\u201d</p><p>An hour of frustration hadn\u2019t made him cheerful, but he forced himself to smile at Marian, who hesitated in the workroom\u2019s doorway. \u201cYes, you\u2019re interrupting, and I\u2019m grateful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marian walked over to the worktable. \u201cOh, dear. Is it that bad?\u201d She looked at the dark, twisted, misshapen lump that rose out of the bowl and winced. \u201cI guess it is that bad.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cJaenelle did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jaenelle created those.\u201d Saetan pointed at the rosebushes.</p><p>Marian\u2019s mouth fell open. She hurried around the table to get a better look. \u201cOh, these are lovely. If you rubbed some rose oil on the rim of the bowl for scent, you wouldn\u2019t know for sure these aren\u2019t real until you tried to touch them.\u201d She studied the rosebushes. \u201cI wonder how long the spells last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, if the spells lasted a while, people could decorate a room with one of these illusions and have a potted rosebush in a room that wouldn\u2019t support a real plant\u2014or even have roses in a climate that wouldn\u2019t be suitable for real ones.\u201d</p><p>He smiled with real warmth and fatherly affection. Jaenelle, the living myth, could create such an illusion, but Marian, the practical hearth witch, could think of a way to use it.</p><p>Marian walked around the table to stand beside him. \u201cSo what is that?\u201d</p><p>They looked at the misshapen lump in the bowl.</p><p>Saetan sighed. \u201cMy attempt to reproduce the illusion.\u201d Then he studied Marian, an idea springing up. \u201cIs there something you need to do right now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said cautiously.</p><p>\u201cWould you be willing to help with an experiment? We\u2019ll need Morghann, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll call her.\u201d</p><p>He set aside his failed spell, called in another bowl, then made sure the two witches would have everything they needed. By the time Morghann hurried into the workroom, he was ready.</p><p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t know how Jaenelle created that illusion spell,\u201d Morghann said after he\u2019d explained what he wanted them to do.</p><p>\u201cI know how she did it,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk you through the steps, but I want the two of you to do the actual spell.\u201d</p> <p>They didn\u2019t understand, but Morghann and Marian followed his instructions, Morghann using her Green Jewel and Marian alternating between her Birthright Rose and her Purple Dusk Jewels.</p><p>When the last ingredient was added and the last part of the spell invoked, the two women laughed in delight as the rosebush rose out of the bowl. The illusion wasn\u2019t as big as the ones Jaenelle created, and it didn\u2019t fool the eye quite as well, but the spell had worked.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if that pleased him or chilled him.</p><p>\u201cSo just what was it you were trying to find out, Uncle Saetan?\u201d Morghann asked.</p><p>\u201cThe two of you can reproduce the illusion spell Jaenelle created,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Marian frowned. \u201cBut . . . you\u2019re stronger than either of us. Why can\u2019t you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wear the Black, and the Red is my Birthright Jewel.\u201d He studied their illusion. \u201cPower can\u2019t be diluted. It\u2019s not just that I have a deeper well of power than someone who wears a Jewel lighter than mine, my power is also more potent.\u201d</p><p>Morghann nodded. \u201cSomething you could do with one drop of Red power I could do with three or four drops of Green\u2014and Marian could do using more of her Purple Dusk strength. But that\u2019s how it is. Three people doing the same spell will create the same thing, but how much power they have to use and the potency of the spell will depend on their Jewel strength.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut not in this case.\u201d Saetan tipped his head to indicate the rosebush. \u201cI couldn\u2019t reproduce the spell using an equivalent amount of power that should have matched the Rose, Purple Dusk, and Green that Jaenelle used. You two could reproduce it because your power has the right potency.\u201d</p><p>Marian frowned. \u201cThen . . . how did Jaenelle create the illusion spell in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d But I\u2019m going to find out. \u201cTell Lucivar I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d He headed for the door, his mind already focusing on how to ask the questions that would provide some answers.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Marian asked.</p><p>Saetan paused in the doorway and looked back at the two witches. \u201cI\u2019m going to visit an old friend.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>Saetan descended the stone stairs. He\u2019d gone down this staircase many times during the years when Jaenelle had been the Queen of Ebon Askavi. Since returning to the Keep to live, he made this descent at least twice a month because he understood loneliness, and an hour\u2019s company now and then was all he could offer this ancient being.</p><p>The double doors at the bottom of the stairs swung open. Torches set in the walls flared to life as he walked to the other end of the huge chamber where the dragon\u2019s head came through an opening in the wall.</p><p>Unable to stop himself, he looked at the simple throne and the shattered scepter that lay on the seat exactly where Draca had set it after telling the First Circle that the Queen of Ebon Askavi was gone and the Dark Court no longer existed. Did seeing those reminders of what was lost ever bother Draca or her mate, the legendary Prince of the Dragons? Or did they think of it as a memorial for a Queen who had been the most powerful witch in the history of the Blood?</p><p>He looked away\u2014and saw the dragon\u2019s large golden eyes were now open and watching him.</p><p>\u201cLorn,\u201d he said.</p><p>*Ssaetan.*</p><p>\u201cI need answers.\u201d</p><p>*You have assked no quesstionss,* Lorn replied, sounding amused.</p><p>Saetan didn\u2019t feel amused. \u201cWhat is Twilight\u2019s Dawn?\u201d</p><p>*It iss the Jewel for Kaeleer\u2019ss Heart.*</p><p>Frustration welled up inside him. \u201cBut what is it? How can one Jewel act like it\u2019s many Jewels? How did you create it?\u201d</p><p>*I didn\u2019t. You did.*</p><p>Saetan stared at Lorn.</p><p>*Father. Brother. Lover. You created Twilight\u2019ss Dawn.*</p><p>Webs of power stretching across a chasm somewhere in the abyss. Him, racing up to intercept Witch as she plummeted toward those webs, Lorn\u2019s warning that if she smashed through all the webs they would lose her ringing in his head. Catching her, smashing through the White, the Yellow, the Tiger Eye webs while he fought to slow her descent. Lucivar, taking his place, rolling Witch in the Rose web as they smashed through it. Rolling her in the other webs, beginning to slow the descent while wrapping her in a cocoon of power. Daemon, taking over at the Green web, fighting to stop the fall, fighting to hold on to the person who held his heart. Finally coming to rest on the Black web.</p><p>A Jewel formed by layers of power? A Jewel that had, somehow, retained those distinct layers? Extraordinary, to be sure . . . but still less than her Birthright.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know,\u201d Saetan said quietly, deep sorrow weighing on his heart. \u201cIf we\u2019d realized, maybe there was something we could have done differently.\u201d</p><p>*Your tassk wass to hold the dream to the flessh. You did what needed to be done,* Lorn said.</p><p>\u201cBut we changed her.\u201d</p><p>*You changed nothing, Ssaetan. Sshe iss who sshe hass alwayss been.*</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf that were true, Jaenelle would still wear the Black. She lost that.\u201d</p><p>*Sshe losst nothing.*</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? It is a loss!\u201d Saetan raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cIf I broke my Black Jewel, broke my power back to the Red, I would adjust. I would have to relearn some things, but I would adjust, like a person who loses a limb adjusts to the loss. But I would always remember what I had.\u201d</p><p>*That iss you. That iss not Jaenelle.*</p><p>\u201cWho had even more to lose!\u201d</p><p>*Who grievess the losss, High Lord?* Lorn snapped. *You or Jaenelle?*</p><p>Stung, Saetan took a step back, straining to hold his temper. \u201cAre you saying I\u2019m selfish because I want her to be everything she was? That Daemon and Lucivar and the coven and the boyos are selfish because we regret what she lost in order to save us and Kaeleer?\u201d</p><p>The chamber grew cold. *The kindred undersstand. But they ssee ssome thingss more clearly than humanss do.*</p><p>They stared at each other, anger and frustration swelling on both sides.</p><p>Then Lorn sighed. *Look up, Ssaetan.*</p><p>Reluctantly, he obeyed.</p><p>The torches lit the lower part of the chamber, but where the light began to fade, he saw the colors of twilight\u2014rose and bright blue deepening to sapphire and red and dark lavender, which gave way to night black.</p><p>*Twilight\u2019ss Dawn,* Lorn said softly. He closed his eyes, a clear sign of dismissal.</p><p>More frustrated and uncertain than when he entered the chamber, Saetan walked back to the double doors. As he reached them, Lorn said, *Look with your heart, Ssaetan. You already know the ansswerss.*</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t. And it was clear Lorn wouldn\u2019t tell him anything more.</p><p>The kindred understood? Maybe it was because they had seen something he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>It was dangerous, but there was one other place he could look for answers, one other . . . person . . . he could ask.</p><p>Not giving himself time to consider what might happen if things went wrong, he left the Keep, caught the Black Wind, and headed for the island ruled by the Weavers of Dreams.</p><p>4</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Surreal said cheerfully, \u201clook who\u2019s back among the living. Not that you actually are among the living anymore, but why quibble?\u201d Looking down at the Warlord on the floor, she bared her teeth in an insincere smile. \u201cAt any rate, your brain is working again\u2014at least as much as it ever did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBitch,\u201d the Warlord snarled.</p><p>\u201cRight on the first guess.\u201d</p><p>Struggling to sit up, the Warlord got a good look at his naked torso. \u201cYou filthy bitch! You cut off my cock!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your balls. Not to mention your arms and legs. So relax, sugar. You\u2019re not going anywhere just yet.\u201d</p> <p>Using Craft, Surreal lifted a chair and settled it near the Warlord.</p><p>\u201cAnd just so there\u2019s no further misunderstandings, the Green are my Birthright.\u201d She tapped the Jewel hanging from a gold chain around her neck. \u201cI wear the Gray.\u201d</p><p>His Sapphire Jewel glowed as he tried to strike her with a bolt of power. She slapped the power back at him with interest\u2014and heard his rib cage snap in several places.</p><p>He lay still, taking shallow breaths. Being demon-dead, he didn\u2019t actually need to breathe, but she imagined it took a little while for the brain to stop trying to do what it had once needed to do.</p><p>Sitting in the chair, she leaned forward, resting her arms on her thighs. \u201cHere are your choices. You can tell me everything you know about why I ended up here, and in return, I\u2019ll finish the kill, freeing you from what\u2019s left of a dead body.\u201d</p> <p>He started swearing.</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d she continued, raising her voice to compete with his, \u201cI can haul your sorry carcass up to the Keep, dump you on the High Lord\u2019s desk, and tell him you not only abducted his niece, you also worked for the bitch who tried to physically harm his daughter and ruin his son\u2019s reputation. You can imagine how well Uncle Saetan is going to respond to that.\u201d</p><p>He probably would have paled if he was still capable of doing that.</p><p>\u201cUn\u2014Uncle Saetan?\u201d</p><p>You really weren\u2019t paying attention to much beyond your fee, were you? \u201cPrince of the Darkness. High Lord of Hell. Patriarch of the SaDiablo family. Since he has over fifty thousand years of experience in ruling the Dark Realm, your being demon-dead isn\u2019t going to get in his way when it comes to hurting you. So who are you going to talk to, sugar? Me or Uncle Saetan?\u201d</p><p>I wanted information about the bitch who hired him, not his life story, Surreal thought an hour later. Still, given his choices, she appreciated why the Warlord had wanted to be thorough.</p> <p>She\u2019d finished the kill as she\u2019d promised, burning out what was left of his power and freeing his spirit to return to the Darkness. And thinking about the pack of Hell Hounds that had obeyed her mother and were now left without a mistress to look after them\u2014assuming those animals actually needed someone to look after them\u2014she wrapped cold spells around the torso and the other pieces, caught the Winds, and rode to the Keep.</p><p>Draca, the Keep\u2019s Seneschal, accepted her offering without comment, and offered, in return, a guest room where she could clean up and have a meal. She accepted both, glad of the opportunity to wash thoroughly and change into fresh clothes, and pleased when Draca sent along a selection of books with the meal. Choosing one, she decided to settle in for a few hours. Maybe Uncle Saetan would be back by then and she\u2019d have a chance to talk to him before she headed back to Amdarh.</p><p>5</p><p>There was no official landing place on the island, since visitors were seldom welcome\u2014and anyone unwelcome usually didn\u2019t survive. But he did sense a residual power he could home in on. Hoping he would land in a safe place, Saetan dropped from the Black Wind, wrapped himself in Black shields, and closed his inner barriers as tightly as possible.</p><p>A moment later, he appeared in the center of a small clearing. The trees and bushes around the clearing were veiled with webs, some old and tattered, others looking freshly spun.</p><p>As powerful as he was, he felt the whispery tugs from those tangled webs, luring him to open his mind, just a little, and slip into a dream from which he might never return.</p><p>He closed his eyes and fought against the lure\u2014and wondered how the kindred Ladvarian had gathered here to help heal Jaenelle had managed to keep their minds intact. Or had the golden spiders refrained from spinning those tangled webs during those weeks?</p><p>*I am the High Lord.* He sent the thought rolling over the land. *I need to talk to the Weaver of Dreams. It concerns Jaenelle.*</p> <p>He waited, slowly becoming aware that all the whispery tugs had faded until only one remained. Strong. Powerful. But not threatening. Just a thread to follow.</p><p>He followed a path out of the clearing. More of a game trail, actually. The kindred must have used the clearing as their landing place, must have created this trail as they traveled from one part of the island to another.</p><p>He moved carefully since he wasn\u2019t sure what would happen if he stumbled and brushed against one of the tangled webs close to the trail. He couldn\u2019t judge how far he\u2019d walked, but his bad leg ached by the time he reached the caves and the thread of power drew him inside.</p><p>Witchlight glowed in niches in the cave walls. Was it for his benefit or did the spiders need the light as well? As he passed from one chamber to the next, the floor rocked beneath him, and the air became golden and veiled. No longer sure if he was still in the real world or caught in a dream, he stopped moving.</p><p>*Here,* a soft voice called. *Here.*</p><p>Light filled another chamber. Since he was watching where he set his feet, the dark stain that covered most of the chamber floor was the first thing he saw when he reached the entrance.</p><p>And the Blood shall sing to the Blood. And through the blood.</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s power, and her pain, rose up from the blood that had seeped into the stones, choking him. He sank to his knees. His hand touched the stain.</p><p>Feelings flooded him, but, thankfully, no images. Still, he recognized the feel of Ladvarian, the Sceltie\u2019s feet planted on the blood-washed stone as the dog braced for the battle of helping to heal a body devastated by a backlash of power.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how long he knelt there while feelings of love, courage, and stubborn determination washed through him. No human could have done what the kindred had done. No human could have believed as they had believed. Had he ever thanked Ladvarian, Kaelas, and the other kindred for their gift of courage and love? He couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>Pulling his hand away from the stain, he regained enough self-control to wipe the tears from his face and look around the chamber.</p><p>The tangled web that covered one part of the chamber left him breathless. The large golden spider clinging to the wall near one end of the web scared him to the bone.</p><p>*This is Kaeleer\u2019s Heart,* the Arachnian Queen said.</p><p>Gathering his courage, he stood and moved closer to the web.</p><p>Living myth. Dreams made flesh. Witch.</p><p>Hundreds of threads made up this web. The wishes and longings of all those dreamers. Lifetimes of longings. Generations of wishes. All woven together to create one extraordinary woman capable of touching all the races in Kaeleer, human and kindred, giving them a way and a reason to connect with each other.</p><p>*You ask about Jaenelle,* the spider said.</p><p>He kept his voice quiet, barely above a whisper. \u201cWhy is she different? I mean no disrespect, but if you truly were able to re-create the web that formed that dream and made it flesh, why did she come back to us different?\u201d</p><p>*She is not different,* the spider replied. *She is still Kaeleer\u2019s Heart.*</p><p>\u201cBut not the same. If she were truly the same, she would be able to wear a Black Jewel.\u201d</p><p>*Kaeleer does not need the Queen. Her task is done. But Kaeleer still needs the Heart.*</p><p>Saetan closed his eyes, not even sure why he couldn\u2019t let this go. Jaenelle was alive, and she seemed happy. Why couldn\u2019t he let this one difference go?</p><p>\u201cAnswer this one question, and I\u2019ll never ask again. Is this the same web? Can you tell me, with no doubt, that this is the same web that originally shaped that dream?\u201d</p><p>The spider didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Saetan opened his eyes and stared at the Arachnian Queen. \u201cIs it the same web?\u201d</p><p>*It is not quite the same web,* the spider admitted reluctantly. Walking on air, she moved above the web until she reached a place where three thick strands formed a triangle. *Because of that.*</p><p>He stared at that triangle, his heart pounding. He was one of those strands, one of those dreamers. Father. Brother. And the Lover, who was the father\u2019s mirror. Within that triangle, one delicate thread ran from the apex to the center of the base. One fragile strand with a tiny bead of blood attached to it.</p><p>If he broke that thread, would Jaenelle be everything she had been?</p><p>He took a step forward, lifted his right hand . . . and felt a thrum of power far, far, far below him.</p><p>The light in the chamber changed, refocused on that triangle and the single strand. The tiny bead glittered in a way a drop of blood never would.</p><p>And suddenly he knew what he was looking at\u2014a tiny chip of an Ebony Jewel.</p><p>The Weaver of Dreams said, *There was another dreamer.*</p><p>6</p><p>Saetan sat on the window seat in his study at the Keep, staring at the evening sky, a glass of yarbarah dangling from his fingers. As much as he adored her, he was glad Surreal had left the Keep before he returned. Right now, he needed some time to himself before he returned to the Hall.</p><p>There was another dreamer.</p><p>What is Twilight\u2019s Dawn? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It iss the Jewel for Kaeleer\u2019ss Heart.</p><p>There was another dreamer.</p><p>Sshe iss who sshe hass alwayss been.</p><p>I lost nothing I regret losing.

If he had, he would have realized there was one person who had no regrets, who felt no grief about the power that had been lost. Was, in fact, enjoying her \u201cdiminished\u201d strength.</p><p>There was another dreamer.</p><p>One tear spilled over, not from sorrow this time but from joy.</p><p>He raised the glass of yarbarah in a salute. \u201cTo you, witch-child.\u201d</p><p>FIFTEEN</p> <p>1</p><p>No one saw him, heard him, felt him as he entered Lektra\u2019s town house and climbed the stairs. He paused on the landing. He\u2019d spent the day learning about his prey, so it was simple enough to sense which woman huddled in which bedroom.</p><p>Turning away from Lektra\u2019s room, Daemon walked down the corridor. As he passed through the door of Roxie\u2019s bedroom, he placed aural and psychic shields around the room that would keep this conversation private.</p><p>She was curled up in a chair, reading a book\u2014something he doubted she usually did for entertainment. She wasn\u2019t aware of him as he watched her, as he breathed in her scent.</p><p>An illusion spell could hide what a person looked like, but it didn\u2019t change her psychic scent. When he\u2019d seen her in Banard\u2019s shop the day he bought the bracelet for Jaenelle, he\u2019d felt pity for the witch who needed an illusion spell to hide a disfigurement.</p><p>Tonight, pity\u2014and mercy\u2014were words that had no meaning for him.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said pleasantly as he dropped the Black shields that had kept him hidden from her, \u201csince you couldn\u2019t have my brother, you decided to play games with me.\u201d</p><p>Roxie sprang out of the chair, dropping the book. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoxie, darling, of course you do. Lucivar exiled you from Ebon Rih when you tried to force him into your bed. I know all about you. Or enough about you. I made it my business to find out. But I really don\u2019t care what games you played with Lucivar. I want to know why you decided to play games with me.\u201d</p><p>Roxie pouted. \u201cLektra wants you. I just helped her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy spreading lies about me, by watching me when I was in Amdarh so you could build those lies on a foundation of truth?\u201d Smiling, he crooned, \u201cDid you also help Lektra with the carriage accident that could have injured Jaenelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Panic laced her voice, filling him with pleasure. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about that! Not until she got back to the town house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Daemon sent wisps of a seduction spell into the room\u2014just enough to dull the sharpest edges of her fear. \u201cEverything has a price, darling. It\u2019s time to pay the debt for your part in these games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to tell Zhara to exile me from Amdarh.\u201d</p> <p>Smiling, he glided across the room until he stood in front of her. \u201cExile? Oh, no. That was Lucivar\u2019s choice.\u201d He held out his right hand.</p><p>As the seduction spells coiled around her, her eyes gleamed with speculation. She slipped her hand into his, then sighed with pleasure when he raised her hand and brushed his lips across her knuckles.</p><p>Roxie licked her lips. \u201cSo you\u2019re not going to exile me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Because there is one small detail you didn\u2019t take into account.\u201d He licked the back of her hand as his fingers shifted to her wrist.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked, sounding breathless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not my brother.\u201d</p><p>His nails stabbed her. His snake tooth pricked her wrist, and he pumped half of his venom into her before he released her and stepped back.</p><p>She stared at the wounds on her wrist, then looked at him, stunned.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, darling, everything has a price.\u201d</p><p>He watched her die\u2014and it was a hard death.</p><p>Hearing the click of a lock, Lektra spun around and stared at Daemon Sadi, who was leaning against her bedroom door. She pressed a hand against her chest, as if that would control the sudden pounding of her heart. \u201cHow did you get in? My butler didn\u2019t announce you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be announced,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cYou came for me.\u201d She breathed out the words, hardly daring to believe. Her beautiful love was here. He had realized who really loved him and had broken his ties with Jaenelle in order to be with her.</p><p>He walked toward her. \u201cYes, I came for you.\u201d</p><p>There was something cold about his smile, something mocking in his deep voice, but she didn\u2019t care about that because his gold eyes were already glazed with passion.</p><p>She flung herself at him, intending to throw her arms around him, but he stepped aside at the last moment. She staggered, off balance, and almost fell.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he snarled softly.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Confused, she pushed her hair away from her face. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to give you what you want from me. I came to give you what you deserve from me.\u201d</p><p>A low-backed stuffed chair drifted across the floor, then turned until it faced her freestanding mirror.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>She could almost feel his voice on her skin, as if it were some intoxicating lotion he was pouring over her. She couldn\u2019t defy it, couldn\u2019t disobey that voice. It scared her a little that she couldn\u2019t rouse herself enough to make her own demands. Not demands. Requests. She would never make demands. Not with him.</p><p>As she moved to obey, he said, \u201cNot in the seat. On the back of the chair.\u201d</p><p>Being low enough and wide enough, she often perched on the back of that chair, but now she felt self-conscious as she climbed into position and saw her reflection in the mirror.</p><p>Daemon stepped up behind her. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a coy smile. \u201cI see my lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I see a woman so obessed with a man she tried to harm a Queen.\u201d</p><p>Her pleasure at having him in her bedroom vanished. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here? Because of stupid Jaenelle?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, his face became a cold mask carved out of fine wood. Then he smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re right, darling. Jaenelle has no place in this room. This is between you and me.\u201d</p><p>His hands caressed her arms beneath her nightgown. He wasn\u2019t actually touching her\u2014he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the woman in the mirror any more than she could stop watching him\u2014but she felt his hands caressing her arms. Then another pair of hands caressed her breasts\u2014and another pair lightly stroked the insides of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014\u201d she gasped. But she couldn\u2019t form the question because a pair of lips brushed over hers. Two mouths closed over her nipples, licking and suckling. And another mouth . . .</p><p>Moaning, she arched her back and rested her head on his shoulder. This was so delicious, she never wanted it to stop, never wanted it to end.</p><p>Gently, relentlessly, those hands caressed her, those mouths licked and suckled . . . until the pleasure became an unbearable craving for his real hands, his real mouth.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d she gasped, ripping open the nightgown to reveal her breasts. \u201cI need you to touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t stop, didn\u2019t end. The pleasure went on and on until she began weeping from the need for release.</p><p>\u201cDaemon . . . please.\u201d</p><p>His right hand curled around her neck, and the warmth of that hand was ten times better than the feel of those phantom hands and mouths.</p><p>Feeling intensified until the pleasure became excruciating. As she finally crested, she felt a sharp prick in her neck, which somehow only added to her climax. The fierce release gradually eased to warm waves of pleasure, and finally faded to a delicious glow.</p><p>Still watching her, Daemon stepped away from the chair.</p><p>Gasping, Lektra stared at the flushed, wild-eyed woman in the mirror. A woman thoroughly satisfied by her lover. Brutally satisfied. And now . . .</p><p>Feeling strangely heavy and numb, she twisted on her perch to face him. \u201cNow you\u2014\u201d It took her a moment to understand what she was seeing\u2014and what she wasn\u2019t seeing. \u201cYou\u2014You\u2019re not aroused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be?\u201d he replied, sounding bored and cold. So terribly cold.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t excite you to make love to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI serviced you like I serviced the bitches in Terreille who tried to play games with me. Love had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>She slid down into the seat. Her legs didn\u2019t feel right. Neither did her arms. And she couldn\u2019t quite draw a full breath.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d she panted. \u201cYou love me, and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you\u2014and you don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d She pushed herself out of the chair and tried to walk over to him, but her legs wouldn\u2019t hold her. She collapsed on the floor. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything has a price.\u201d Holding out his right hand, he flexed his ring finger. \u201cThe price for playing with the Sadist is pain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She watched the snake tooth slide out beneath the long, black-tinted nail. \u201cYou\u2014you poisoned me?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her and smiled a cold, cruel smile. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Remembering the prick she felt, she tried to reach up and touch her neck. \u201cYou poisoned me . . . while . . . I . . . was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing. Yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of your obsession with me, you tried to hurt Jaenelle. So you will be the lesson for any other bitch who thinks she can have me if she eliminates the competition. Just between you and me, darling, if I have to kill every witch in Amdarh to assure no one tries to hurt Jaenelle again, I\u2019ll do it and have no regrets. You\u2019re all expendable, and she is . . . everything.\u201d</p><p>Lektra stared at him, fighting for each small gasp of air. Pain danced through her limbs, setting her nerves on fire. She would have screamed if she could have drawn enough breath.</p><p>\u201cDaemon . . . help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised. \u201cBefore you draw your last breath, I\u2019ll finish the kill. At least you won\u2019t have to face the High Lord and endure this kind of pain a second time.\u201d</p> <p>As her lungs failed and her vision faded, she tried to see her beautiful love one last time. And even though he stood in front of her, the only thing she saw as the cold Black rage ripped through her was those glazed, sleepy eyes and that cold, cruel smile.</p><p>After he finished the kill, Daemon studied the room. The Blood had a saying: The walls remember. Wood and stone could hold strong emotions, and a skilled Black Widow could draw out those feelings and replay a ghostly image of what happened in a room.</p><p>At another time in his life, he would have walked away from this room, would have, most likely, added a few seduction spells that would have been triggered by drawing the memories out of wood and stone. Whoever had come to watch the events leading up to Lektra\u2019s death would have felt those phantom hands, those phantom mouths. They would have stood there, helpless to escape, knowing how the previous seduction ended.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t have killed them, but the message would have been clear: anyone who tried to play games with his life or someone he loved would die.</p><p>But there was Jaenelle to consider, and he didn\u2019t want this game paraded before the rest of the Blood. He felt soiled enough being near Lektra and Roxie. So he would leave enough of a warning for the witches in Amdarh. As for the rest . . .</p><p>He could deal with that easily enough.</p> <p>2</p><p>Surreal stood across the street and watched the town house burn. She\u2019d spent the evening wandering the nearby streets, passing by the town house often enough to keep an eye on things. Because Sadi had said Lektra was his business, not hers, she\u2019d kept her participation to a passive watch.</p><p>So she\u2019d been nearby when witchfire suddenly filled two of the upstairs rooms. She didn\u2019t run to the town house to pound on the door and alert the servants. There was no need. The Sadist had his own kind of justice, and the fire remained in those two rooms until the last servant had fled. Then the witchfire took the town house, roaring up to twice the structure\u2019s height, a beacon for the rest of the Blood in Amdarh.</p><p>They\u2019d come running, but witchfire was fed by power, and there was nothing they could do to extinguish a fire fed by the Black. The water wagons were brought out, and the roofs of the neighboring town houses were doused, but the fire remained confined. He would have made sure of that before he walked away.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Lucivar said, joining her. He handed her a steaming mug of coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s damn cold to be standing around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it this cold a couple of blocks away?\u201d she asked, taking a sip of coffee.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d arrived in Amdarh just as the rest of the town house went up, so they\u2019d found each other easily enough. He, too, would have recognized the fire as a signal\u2014and a warning.</p> <p>After taking a sip from his own mug, he called in a bundled napkin, used Craft to balance it on air, then flipped open a corner.</p><p>Surreal grabbed one of the rolls filled with meat and cheese. She took a big bite, washed it down with coffee, then asked, \u201cWhere did you get these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDining house down the street a little ways. They were still open when the fire started, so they stayed open to keep serving food and drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least someone will profit from the evening.\u201d Finishing the first roll, she checked the napkin bundle, pleased to see two more stuffed rolls. Lucivar was going to share fairly\u2014and just in case that wasn\u2019t what he had in mind, she took another roll and bit into it.</p><p>\u201cAnd let\u2019s hope this is the only thing in Amdarh that burns tonight,\u201d Lucivar growled, using the mug to point to the carriage and riders slowly moving up the street.</p><p>The carriage stopped. Zhara stepped out and was immediately surrounded by her guards.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any reason to go after her, does he?\u201d Surreal asked.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of,\u201d Lucivar replied.</p><p>Someone pointed them out. Zhara and her circle of guards pushed their way through the crowd. On Zhara\u2019s command, the guards stepped aside so the Queen of Amdarh could face Surreal and Lucivar without looking over a wall of male bodies.</p><p>\u201cIs Daemon Sadi responsible for this?\u201d Zhara demanded.</p><p>Lucivar took a long swallow of coffee before answering. \u201cYeah, he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he also kill Lord Tavey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadi killed a Warlord?\u201d Surreal asked.</p><p>\u201cAt the party the other night,\u201d Lucivar replied. \u201cHe was fairly neat about it\u2014in a messy sort of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, both of you,\u201d Zhara snapped. \u201cYou find this all amusing? It\u2019s likely Lady Lektra and her friend were caught in that fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have been alive when the fire started.\u201d Surreal shrugged. \u201cWhat do you want us to say, sugar? The little bitch played a game with the Sadist\u2014and she lost.\u201d</p><p>Zhara went very still. \u201cWhat did you call him?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar vanished his mug. \u201cIn Terreille, they called him the Sadist\u2014with good reason. If you want to push at him for going after a witch who spread those rumors about him and tried to hurt Jaenelle, you go right ahead. You\u2019ll live just long enough to regret it.\u201d</p><p>The fire went out. One moment it was still blazing, the next it was gone.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Surreal said softly.</p><p>There was plenty of light from the houses on this side of the street to see him coming. That gliding walk, that feline grace. The waves of cold that had the rest of the Blood scrambling to get out of his way.</p><p>\u201cZhara,\u201d Lucivar said very quietly, \u201cdon\u2019t be a fool.\u201d</p><p>Daemon got close enough that Surreal could see his eyes were still glazed, and his lips were curved in that brutal, chilling smile. He was still in a cold rage, still riding the killing edge. If anyone pushed him now . . .</p><p>Lucivar shifted, drawing Daemon\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cStill pissed off?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Daemon replied. \u201cAt least, for now.\u201d Those glazed eyes fixed on Zhara. \u201cBut if anyone from Dhemlan ever tries to hurt my Queen again, I\u2019ll kill you all.\u201d</p><p>As Daemon turned and walked away, Zhara slowly sank to the ground.</p><p>Not hurt, Surreal decided, just . . . shocked. Seeing Daemon as the Sadist for the first time had that effect on most people.</p><p>Lucivar wrapped a hand around her arm and pulled her away. \u201cHe\u2019ll head back to the family town house now to have the quiet he needs to step back from the killing edge. We should be there.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be anywhere near Daemon right now, but Lucivar was right. Even if there was nothing they could do for Sadi, they could stand as a buffer between him and the rest of the Blood until the cold rage passed.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he could do that?\u201d Surreal asked. \u201cDo you think something could provoke him enough that he\u2019d really kill everyone in Dhemlan?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar muttered, \u201cHe\u2019s his father\u2019s mirror.\u201d Then he added, \u201cLet\u2019s hope we never have a reason to find out.\u201d</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>Daemon waited until the following evening before he returned to the Hall. After a long night\u2019s sleep, the cold rage had thawed, but he hadn\u2019t been able to sheath his temper quite enough to face the \u201ctalk\u201d with Jaenelle. So he\u2019d stayed in his room most of the day, letting Surreal and Lucivar deal with the visitors who timidly knocked on the town house door.</p><p>He\u2019d known the moment Zhara had stepped into the town house. Even Lucivar\u2019s efforts to shield him from the other visitors\u2019 shrill emotions hadn\u2019t been enough to keep him from sensing Zhara\u2019s spikes of fear. His warning had been found: two bodies, completely untouched by the witchfire that had consumed everything else in Lektra\u2019s house. As powerful as he was, his venom didn\u2019t offer a kind death, and the fact that he\u2019d made sure there was no way to mistake how they\u2019d died had chilled the aristo Blood in the city. So now the Queen of Amdarh knew what so many witches in Terreille had learned, although usually too late: The Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince who was called the Sadist had no mercy for anyone he considered an enemy. They wouldn\u2019t forget the warning because he wouldn\u2019t let them forget. The Black Jewels would be in evidence whenever he walked through the streets of Amdarh, and the Blood would understand that their continued survival depended on Jaenelle\u2019s compassion, not his. As long as she held the leash, the Sadist would yield to his Queen. If anyone tried to break that leash . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But there was someone who might break that leash\u2014and she was waiting for him on the other side of the sitting room door.</p><p>When he walked into the room, he saw her standing at the window. It was too dark to see the garden, so he wondered what held her attention.</p><p>\u201cIs it done?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe debt is paid to your satisfaction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s paid.\u201d He couldn\u2019t sense her mood, and that frightened him. \u201cJaenelle\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up her left hand, commanding silence. He felt sick relief when he saw she still wore her wedding ring.</p><p>\u201cI am what I am,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nodding, she turned to face him. \u201cA Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince who grew up in a brutal training ground. That shaped what you are when you become a weapon. But that\u2019s only one side of you. The other side is a warm, caring man with a sharp sense of humor and more tolerance for the foolishness of others than you\u2019ll ever admit to having. I can accept the Sadist as well as Daemon Sadi. The question is, can you accept me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d He took a step toward her. \u201cI always have.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m no longer stronger than you. I no longer wear a Jewel that eclipses your power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d He raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cYou lost\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Until you can accept that, you\u2019ll keep stumbling over this.\u201d She tapped a finger against Twilight\u2019s Dawn. Then she held out her hand. \u201cThere\u2019s something you need to see.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his hand into hers. One moment they were standing in their sitting room. The next moment, he was standing in a mist-filled place in the abyss. He\u2019d been in the Misty Place twice before\u2014and he wondered why Jaenelle had brought him here now.</p><p>The mist retreated, forming a circular boundary. Almost circular. Straight ahead of him there was clear ground.</p> <p>*Jaenelle?*</p><p>No answer. Since there was something she wanted him to see, he moved forward cautiously until he came to the edge and could look down into a vast chasm.</p><p>But it was the huge, spiraling web filling the chasm that took his breath away. Anchored to the Misty Place, it curved until it touched the other side of the chasm, then curved again, gently spiraling, going so deep into the abyss he couldn\u2019t see the end of it.</p><p>As he studied it, trying to understand, he felt a shiver of power far, far, far below him at the same moment he heard the quiet click of hoof on stone. Turning, he saw her step out of the mist. Here, her true nature wasn\u2019t hidden beneath human flesh. Here, she looked like what she was\u2014a living myth, dreams made flesh. The same face and a mostly human body, but a tiny spiral horn rose from her forehead, her fingers had retractable claws, and she stood on delicate hooves instead of human feet. Witch.</p><p>She watched him with those ancient sapphire eyes. And waited.</p><p>Turning back to study the web, he suddenly understood what he was looking at\u2014a web made out of power. Somehow, the Ebony-Jeweled power she used to wield was being transformed into this web instead of filling a vessel of human flesh. Since it was tied to the Misty Place, surely there was a way for her to regain that power if she\u2014</p><p>He remembered Jaenelle as a child\u2014a girl who felt the distance between herself and other people because of the Black power that was her Birthright, a girl whose family had never accepted her because she was different. He thought about the Queen who could have destroyed them all if that had been in her nature, a Queen so strong her power was a deep chasm that separated her from the rest of the Blood\u2014even someone as strong as a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince.</p><p>*You didn\u2019t want it,* he said, staggered by the strength of that conviction.</p> <p>*No,* Witch said, *I didn\u2019t want it. Why would I want power so great I could destroy the Realms but couldn\u2019t do what almost every Blood child can do because I was so powerful? * She looked away, and added softly, *I never wanted a formal court, never wanted to rule, never wanted more power than I already had with the Black. But I made the Offering to the Darkness and formed my court to prevent the Dark Council from destroying the kindred and taking their lands. I needed that power to defend Kaeleer and be a weapon to stop a war, but I never wanted it for myself.*</p><p>He moved closer to her, wanting to hold her, wanting to offer comfort, but he wasn\u2019t sure she would accept it yet.</p><p>*How did you do it?* he asked. *How did you separate the power that was part of the dreams that made you without destroying who you are?*</p><p>She let out a pained little laugh. *I dreamed I wasn\u2019t so different from the rest of the Blood\u2014a dream I\u2019ve had all of my life. That desire was strong enough that the Weaver of Dreams added it to the web . . . and this is the result.*</p><p>Daemon studied Witch, who looked sad and vulnerable. People had turned away from her before because she was so powerful. Now she wondered if the friends she loved might always feel uncomfortable with the fact that she wasn\u2019t so powerful. He didn\u2019t think the coven and the boyos would turn away from her, and once they realized she still was who and what she had always been, and was truly happy, they wouldn\u2019t care what Jewel she wore.</p><p>Wrapping his arms around her, he fit his body to hers. *This is really what you want for yourself, isn\u2019t it? An extraordinary ordinary life.*</p><p>*Yes, it is.*</p><p>*Then that\u2019s what I want for you.* He kissed her softly. *For both of us.* Closing his eyes, he kissed her again.</p><p>When he shifted to nuzzle her neck, she said, \u201cAre you sure, Daemon?\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and raised his head. They were back in the sitting room.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you for as many years as life grants us,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be the warm, caring man you see in me and let the Sadist sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle brushed his hair back. \u201cHe\u2019ll never really sleep. The Sadist is a part of who you are, and he\u2019ll always be there, just under the surface\u2014and that\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d</p><p>He never loved her more than he did at that moment when her acceptance quieted the volatile nature of a Warlord Prince.</p><p>Scooping her up, he held her close to his chest. \u201cWhat do you say to locking the doors, going to bed, and making love for the rest of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that going to be the extraordinary or ordinary part of our life?\u201d she asked, laughter and love dancing in her sapphire eyes.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>Too edgy to stay still, Daemon prowled the room that opened onto the flagstone terrace at the back of the Hall. It wasn\u2019t unusual for a man to have pre-wedding jitters, even if he was already married to the woman he loved. Besides, how many men had their marriage vows witnessed by fire-breathing dragons and man-eating cats?</p><p>Although, he probably shouldn\u2019t have snarled at Jaenelle when she suggested that he take off his wedding ring so that she could give it back to him. Guests be damned, he wasn\u2019t giving up his ring.</p><p>\u201cWould you like some brandy?\u201d Saetan asked, his bland tone accenting his amusement.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Daemon snarled.</p><p>\u201cA sedative?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whack upside the head?\u201d</p><p>Daemon glared at his father. \u201cYou\u2019re finding this too amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think I\u2019m entitled,\u201d Saetan replied dryly.</p><p>Suddenly feeling as if the ground was about to get yanked out from under him, Daemon stopped moving.</p><p>\u201cAnything you want to tell me?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, feeling wary.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, since the guests are all assembled and Jaenelle will be down at any moment, let\u2019s go out and get you married. Again.\u201d</p><p>Daemon winced. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t\u2014I mean, I meant to tell you before\u2014Ah, Hell\u2019s fire.\u201d</p><p>Saetan laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s just as well you are married already. If your nerves don\u2019t settle, you\u2019re going to be useless tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I so appreciate your confidence in me.\u201d</p><p>Saetan\u2019s amusement faded. \u201cI do have confidence in you, Prince. More than you realize.\u201d He walked over to the glass doors.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He crossed the room to stand next to his father. \u201cThere are a couple of things I wanted to tell you.\u201d He hesitated, not sure how to begin. \u201cLady Zhara came to see me last week, on behalf of all the Queens in Dhemlan. They asked me to rule as the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan.\u201d He snorted softly. \u201cI suspect they\u2019re asking out of fear rather than any real desire to have me rule . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>Daemon looked out the door. The Queens who ruled the other Territories were out there, laughing and talking. The strongest Warlord Princes in the Realm were out there. All of them were connected to each other by the woman who was Kaeleer\u2019s Heart. Just as he was connected to all of them because of her.</p><p>\u201cBut that was your place,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat is correct. It was my place.\u201d Saetan paused. \u201cIs it going to be yours? Are you going to accept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Zhara I would consider it, but I wouldn\u2019t make any decision until after Jaenelle and I returned from our honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to accept?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to accept. It . . . feels right.\u201d</p> <p>Saetan rested a hand on Daemon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI think it is the right choice. For you\u2014and for Dhemlan. Just don\u2019t expect Jaenelle to be cheerful whenever she has to dress up for a formal occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already explained that.\u201d</p><p>After giving Daemon a sympathetic pat, Saetan stepped back. \u201cWhat\u2019s the second thing?\u201d</p><p>This was harder. If Jaenelle had wanted everyone to know why she no longer wore Ebony Jewels, she would have told her friends and family. Maybe it was fear on her part that if they knew it was possible for her to be exactly like she\u2019d been, they\u2019d want it so much, she\u2019d give in to their desire instead of holding on to her own. But Saetan needed to know. At least, enough to let go of any regrets.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Twilight\u2019s Dawn,\u201d Daemon said carefully.</p> <p>\u201cA Jewel for Kaeleer\u2019s Heart,\u201d Saetan replied just as carefully.</p><p>\u201cShe is what she wants to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd has lost nothing she regrets losing?\u201d</p><p>Daemon nodded. A cautious dance of words, so that neither of them would break faith with their Queen. \u201cShe\u2019s dreamed of having an extraordinary, ordinary life. Wearing Ebony Jewels, she could only have half of that. With Twilight\u2019s Dawn, she\u2019ll have all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know that for certain, Prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, High Lord. I know that for certain.\u201d</p> <p>They smiled at each other.</p><p>\u201cThere is one more thing,\u201d Saetan said, calling in a folded piece of parchment and handing it to Daemon. \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you had originally intended, but I think it will do.\u201d</p><p>Daemon unfolded the parchment and studied the words in the Old Tongue.</p><p>A light brush against his inner barriers. He opened the first barrier, and his father\u2019s deep voice rolled through his mind as Saetan spoke those fluid words.</p><p>Suddenly he was a child again, listening to that voice teaching him phrases in the Old Tongue in exactly the same way. He thought he\u2019d learned the language from the scholars, but they\u2019d only awakened the memories of what he\u2019d learned from the man standing before him.</p><p>He said the words over and over, until he wasn\u2019t sure if he was hearing his father\u2019s voice or his own.</p><p>Another light brush against his mind, and Saetan withdrew.</p><p>Folding the parchment, Daemon tucked it in his jacket pocket. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c \u2018You are my breath, my life, my heart.\u2019 \u201d Saetan smiled. \u201cDoes that say enough?\u201d</p><p>Tears stung his eyes. \u201cThat says everything.\u201d</p><p>Saetan kissed him. \u201cYour Lady is waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>They opened the glass doors and walked across the terrace, side by side. Then Saetan stepped back and he was alone, walking the rest of the way across the grass to where his finest dreams waited for him to begin the next season of their lives.</p><p>Present</p><p>Standing at the kitchen counter, Sebastian closed his eyes and inhaled slowly and deeply to savor the smell of freshly ground koffea beans. Better than a woman. At least, a more sensual experience than the last two he\u2019d been with</p><p>When an incubus found sex boring, it was time to take a break\u2014or think about another line of work.</p><p>Pushing that thought into the mental trunk where he\u2019d shoved so many unpleasant memories, he followed the rest of the instructions for brewing the koffea beans.</p><p>What would it be like to rise in the first wisps of dawn and come out to the kitchen to grind the beans while someone who truly mattered was snuggled in his bed, waiting to be awakened with a nuzzle and a kiss\u2014and a cup of freshly brewed koffee? What would it be like to stand outside, cup in hand, and watch the day come alive?</p><p>Sebastian shook his head. Why was he rubbing salt into emotional wounds, thinking about things that couldn\u2019t be? He lived in the Den of Iniquity, which consisted of a few blocks of crowded buildings and cobblestone streets\u2014a place that, most likely, had been an unsavory part of some large city, nothing but a dark smudge in a daylight landscape. Then a Landscaper had altered the world, turning those streets into a separate landscape, and that had changed the feel of living on those streets, had changed the taverns, gambling houses, and brothels into a carnal carnival.</p><p>But it was more than a place where human vices were openly enjoyed, more than a place where humans who didn\u2019t fit into the daylight landscapes and demons like the incubi and succubi could live. The Den was at the center of a cluster of dark landscapes some of Ephemera\u2019s demon races claimed as their own. It was a place where those demons could purchase supplies or buy a drink in a tavern without being hated or driven away because they weren\u2019t human.</p><p>It was also a place that had its roots in the darker side of the human heart, a place where the sun never rose.</p><p>He\u2019d been a bitter fifteen-year-old boy when he\u2019d stumbled into the Den. Having escaped his father\u2019s control two years before, he\u2019d disappeared into the landscapes and struggled to survive. The dark human landscapes were too desperate and frightening even for a boy whose demon nature eclipsed whatever human blood might flow through his veins, but the people in the daylight landscapes didn\u2019t want something like him living among them, and he\u2019d been driven out of village after village as soon as the people realized he was an incubus\u2014and that hunger for the emotions that were produced by sex was something that couldn\u2019t be hidden or denied for long.</p><p>So when he found the Den and felt the dark, edgy, carnival tone of the place, he\u2019d embraced it with all his heart because he\u2019d finally found a place where being an incubus didn\u2019t make him an outcast, a place where the never-ending night suited who and what he was\u2014a place where he could belong.</p><p>And he still belonged here. The Den was his home. But now, as a man who had recently turned thirty . . .</p><p>I\u2019m so tired of the night.</p><p>A sudden yearning for something washed through him, making his heart ache, filling him with a need and a longing so powerful it staggered him. He braced his hands on the counter and waited for the feeling to pass. It always did.</p><p>But the yearning had never been this powerful before, had never swept through him like this. Didn\u2019t matter. Those feelings came and went\u2014and nothing changed.</p><p>Disgusted with himself for not being content with what he had, he plucked a mug off the wooden stand\u2014and almost dropped it when someone knocked on the cottage\u2019s front door. He never brought anyone to his home, never invited anyone to visit. The only two people who ignored that demand for privacy were his human cousins, Glorianna and Lee, and neither of them would sound so hesitant about applying knuckles to wood.</p><p>He\u2019d just ignore it; that\u2019s what he\u2019d do. He\u2019d ignore it, and whoever\u2014whatever\u2014was on the other side of the door would go away.</p><p>The door creaked open. Sebastian\u2019s heart pumped against his chest as he set the mug on the counter, careful to make no sound. Just as silently, he eased the biggest knife he had out of the wood block. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t win, but he\u2019d go down fighting.</p><p>\u201cSebastian?\u201d a voice called. \u201cSebastian? You here?\u201d</p><p>He knew that voice, but he still hesitated. Then he swore silently and slipped the knife back into its slot. There were very few things in the Den that couldn\u2019t be bought, but trust was one of them.</p><p>Moving to the doorway that separated the kitchen from the main living area, he peered into the room and studied his visitor.</p><p>The other incubus stood on the threshold, almost bouncing with nerves. Yet his eyes were bright with curiosity as he looked at the simple furniture and the framed sketches on the walls.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Teaser?\u201d Sebastian asked.</p><p>If Teaser noticed the harsh note in Sebastian\u2019s voice, he ignored it and bounded into the main room. Then he stopped, spun around, and closed the outer door before moving toward Sebastian with the cocky swagger that was at odds with his blond hair, blue eyes, and boyish good looks. Women were often deceived into believing he acted the way he looked.</p><p>With Teaser, sometimes that was a serious mistake.</p><p>As youths, they had trolled the Den\u2019s streets together\u2014blond-haired, blue-eyed Teaser projecting an image of a boy out for a bit of naughty fun, while Sebastian was the handsome piece of danger with his sable hair and sharp green eyes. They\u2019d played their games of seduction, providing physical sex to women who crossed over to the Den from the daylight landscapes or using the power of the incubi to connect with another mind through the twilight of waking dreams, feeding on the emotions they created by being fantasy lovers. Unhappy wives. Foolish girls who wanted the romance of a mysterious admirer. Lonely women who craved the warmth of a lover, even if that lover came to them only in dreams. They were all prey to the incubi.</p><p>For five years, he and Teaser had rented adjoining rooms at an expensive bordello and trolled the Den. Then, when he turned twenty, Sebastian could no longer ignore a growing need for something beyond the Den and the sexual games, so he walked away from the colored lights and the dark buildings. He found a dirt lane that began a few steps away from where the Den\u2019s main street ended\u2014a lane he was certain hadn\u2019t been there before. He followed it, not sure if he was just taking a walk or really leaving the one place he\u2019d felt at home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was how he found the two-story cottage. It didn\u2019t look like it belonged in a landscape like the Den, but it wouldn\u2019t have been there if it hadn\u2019t belonged. That was the way things worked in Ephemera.</p><p>He went inside, wary of being caught by whoever laid claim to the place. But it wasn\u2019t inhabited. Half the rooms were empty, but there was enough furniture left haphazardly in the other rooms to set up a comfortable bedroom, living area, and kitchen. He found linens and towels, as well as everything he needed in the kitchen to prepare and eat a simple meal. He prowled the rooms for an hour\u2014and realized something inside him had relaxed, as if he\u2019d taken his first full breath in months.</p><p>Finding cleaning supplies in a cupboard in the kitchen, he dusted, polished, swept, and scrubbed until the cottage was clean and the furniture arranged to his liking. Then he went back to the Den, removed most of his possessions from the room he rented in the bordello, and moved into the cottage. A week later, when he returned from trolling the Den\u2019s streets, he discovered someone had planted a moonflower beside the cottage\u2019s back door.</p><p>That was when he realized this place had been waiting for him to find it, to want it. She would have known the moment something in him had changed enough to match the cottage, and the moonflower was her way of saying, \u201cWelcome.\u201d</p> <p>In Ephemera, there were few secrets of the heart. And nothing could be hidden from Glorianna Belladonna.</p><p>He had lived in the cottage for the past ten years, still a part of the Den and yet apart from it.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t see you around yesterday,\u201d Teaser said, pulling Sebastian back to the present. \u201cJust thought I\u2019d stop by and . . . see.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d spent yesterday sketching\u2014and had burned all the sketches when he realized he\u2019d been trying to capture daylight memories of Aurora, his aunt Nadia\u2019s home village. Things he\u2019d seen as a child during the times he lived with her. Then his father, Koltak, would show up again and take him away, dumping him on some woman in the poor section of the city where Koltak lived\u2014a woman who was paid to tolerate his presence and provide him with food and a place to sleep. Half the time he lived on the streets, running wild with other abandoned children and remembering all over again how barren and miserable his life was supposed to be. Then Nadia would arrive and take him back to her home.</p><p>Nadia\u2019s and Koltak\u2019s battle of wills, and the cycle of loving acceptance and coldhearted misery, finally ended when he\u2019d gotten away from his father the last time Koltak arrived at Nadia\u2019s house to take him back to the hated city.</p> <p>\u201cI was occupied,\u201d Sebastian said, pushing aside the memories.</p><p>Teaser grinned wickedly. \u201cStill offering comfort to aging spinsters and lonely widows? You need to look for something a bit more lively. Someone with a bit more kick. Can\u2019t imagine any of them are much fun when you cross over to give them a ride in the flesh instead of just romantic dreams.\u201d Then he sniffed the air. His eyes widened. \u201cIs that koffee?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian sighed. He\u2019d ground enough beans for two cups. Looked like he was going to share. \u201cCome on, then.\u201d</p><p>When he walked back to the counter, Teaser was right behind him.</p><p>After eyeing the bag of koffea beans, the grinder, and the perk-pot, Teaser whistled. \u201cGot the whole setup. Maybe giving spinsters and widows sweet dreams and hot nights is more lucrative than I thought.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut you don\u2019t usually buy from the black market.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian took another mug from the wooden stand and filled it with koffee. \u201cI didn\u2019t get this from the black market. This was a gift from my cousins.\u201d As he turned to hand the mug to Teaser, he caught the flash of fear in the other incubus\u2019s eyes, noted the slight tremble in the hands that accepted the mug.</p> <p>The prissy prig humans in other landscapes called the incubi and succubi vile demons, although enough of those humans craved the kind of sex that could be had only with an incubus or succubus partner to provide the Den\u2019s residents with a good living. But there were more dangerous demons that roamed their world, and the incubi and succubi could end up being prey as easily as any human. It had taken him a few years to realize the reason other demons who came to the Den were wary of him wasn\u2019t because he was a badass demon; it was because of his human connection. They didn\u2019t fear Lee, who was a Bridge with a rare ability to impose one landscape over another, but Glorianna . . .</p><p>No demon wanted to incur her wrath\u2014because Glorianna Belladonna was the Landscaper who had created the Den of Iniquity.</p><p>Filling his own mug, Sebastian leaned against the counter, sipped his koffee, and said nothing.</p><p>After a few minutes, Teaser said, \u201cThis place. It\u2019s . . . nice.\u201d He looked at the small table tucked against the wall, where Sebastian ate his meals, then at the larger table in the dining area. \u201cIt looks . . . nice.\u201d</p><p>It looks human, Sebastian thought, feeling as if he\u2019d been caught doing something lewd. In public. In a human landscape, since doing something lewd in the Den was commonplace. Embarrassed that anyone had seen evidence of his need to stay connected with whatever humanity might be inside him, he felt the old bitterness well up inside him.</p><p>Nadia wasn\u2019t blood kin. She\u2019d been married to his father\u2019s brother and had no reason to fight with Koltak over the well-being of a half-demon boy. But she had fought\u2014and had won often enough that there were islands of time throughout his childhood when he\u2019d known what it was like to be loved and accepted. Everything good that he had experienced in the human landscapes had come to him because of her.</p><p>That was why the cottage had tugged at him. That was why it looked like a human home instead of an incubus\u2019s lair. He had the room at the bordello for seduction. This place reminded him of how he had felt when he lived with Nadia and Glorianna and Lee. When he\u2019d still had some connection with the Light.</p><p>But if the other incubi and succubi found out he lived like a human, the malicious teasing would never end\u2014and he\u2019d end up being an outcast again.</p> <p>He swallowed the last of his koffee to choke the bitterness back down. \u201cWhy are you here, Teaser?\u201d he asked roughly.</p><p>Teaser drained his own mug, started to set it aside, then hesitated, crossed the kitchen, and carefully placed the mug in the sink, as if keeping the cottage tidy were of the utmost importance. When he turned back to face Sebastian, his expression was bleak. \u201cWe found another one.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
