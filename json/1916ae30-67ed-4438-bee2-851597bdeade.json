It seems like just yesterday I was sitting in my empty house, worried I\u2019d never have grandkids. Now, not only do I have a brood of them climbing the walls, but also several great-nieces and nephews. I can\u2019t imagine life getting much better than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t hear any arguments from me. Before I decided to move the family back home, we were falling apart. Look at me now. I\u2019m a grandfather, and our life is how it should be. I\u2019ll miss my Amelia until the day I die, but I finally feel like it\u2019s okay to let go of the sorrow that\u2019s been present since her death. What helps the most is having my children close to home, and those grandkids of mine have brought joy to my life I never thought possible again,\u201d George replied to his twin brother, Joseph.</p><p>The two men flew down the interstate, driving with the top down, enjoying a rare warm evening in the normally cool city of Seattle. They acted more like teenage boys, than men in their sixties, as their laughter was quickly carried away on the wind, deep into the sparkling sky.</p> <p>\u201cI thought Katherine told you to get rid of this deathtrap several months ago,\u201d George remarked.</p><p>\u201cShe did, so you\u2019d better not tell her what we\u2019ve been up to. A little wind in our hair and bugs in our teeth rejuvenate these old bodies far more than those stinking spas she drags me to. What she doesn\u2019t know can\u2019t hurt her \u2013 or me.\u201d Joseph laughed at his own joke. It didn\u2019t take long for George to join him.</p><p>Knowing he was doing something a little dangerous felt good. His doctor told him he had to cut back on salt. His wife said he needed to get more exercise. He was tired of doing everything that was healthy and good for him. He didn\u2019t see anything wrong in seeking adventure once in a while. When he felt a craving for an adrenaline rush, it was either stay home and go crazy, or pull the convertible out of the garage.</p><p>\u201cOnly one more kid to marry off. What are we going to do once we take care of Austin?\u201d George asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re looking at getting married, yourself,\u201d Joseph quickly replied.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you even try your matchmaking on me, Joseph Anderson. We\u2019re a team. We don\u2019t plot against each other,\u201d George said in a huff. Joseph laughed at the sour expression on his brother\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry about it, George. I wouldn\u2019t think of doing that,\u201d he finally said, though he made sure to cross his toes. He knew something was going on between George and Esther, but he hadn\u2019t been able to catch the two of them yet \u2013 just give him time...</p><p>\u201cI know we don\u2019t talk about it, George, but since your heart attack, I\u2019ve felt my mortality a little more with each passing day,\u201d Joseph said, his voice growing quiet, barely audible above the screaming wind whipping through the car.</p><p>\u201cI was scared, Joseph. More scared than I let anyone know. I wasn\u2019t worried about dying. I\u2019ve lived a good life. I was worried about my family. They\u2019ve had enough loss with losing their mother. They don\u2019t need to go through it again,\u201d George said, his own voice low.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should sell this car, though I love it. I don\u2019t want to admit we\u2019re aging, but growing old does have its advantages. I get to be a grandfather, which is better than I ever imagined it being, plus I get to watch my wife grow more beautiful with each passing day. I have too much to be grateful for to risk throwing it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, brother, I\u2019m sure glad we\u2019ve gotten one last ride in,\u201d George said with laughter.</p> <p>As they approached their exit, Joseph reluctantly slowed down and departed the freeway. The wind from their hundred-mile-an-hour ride decreased as they slowed to thirty and turned a corner. Neither of them was ready for the night to end, but Katherine would be home soon, and they had to get the car parked and hurry inside, or they\u2019d be busted.</p><p>\u201cThere was definitely something going on between Austin and Kinsey last year, but nothing came from it. I\u2019ve watched them since then, and there are certainly sparks flying. He\u2019s been chasing her, though trying to be cool about it, and she\u2019s running as if the hounds of hell are nipping at her heels. I\u2019ve also noticed some simmering looks she\u2019s shot his way when she thinks no one is paying attention. I think it\u2019s time to push the two of them together. I know it\u2019s only a matter of time before they can\u2019t resist the temptation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d George eagerly asked.</p><p>\u201cWell-\u201d Joseph began.</p><p>\u201cWhat the-\u201d George cried out.</p><p>Joseph turned his head in George\u2019s direction, just in time for his heart to jump into his throat as bright lights bore down on them. He didn\u2019t even have time to blink before a full-size truck crashed into the side of their vehicle, sending the car flying through the air.</p><p>Joseph looked at his brother for one endless, terrifying second, time standing still as they floated high above the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry...\u201d Joseph whispered, not knowing if the words left his throat, let alone registered to George.</p> <p>Their car came hurtling to the ground with a sickening crunch. Glass shattered as metal twisted in on itself, making the convertible unrecognizable. The only movement was one wheel as it spun in circles on the mangled wreck of a car.</p><p>For a brief second silence reigned in the busy city of Seattle.</p><p>House lights began flickering on as people rushed from their homes to investigate the noise. Several brave citizens rushed forward to see if there was any hope for the people in the car.</p><p>Neither Joseph, nor George, stirred as sirens broke the eerie silence of the dark night. Still no movement when the ambulance arrived, paramedics struggling through the twisted remains of the vehicle as they attempted to get to the two men. They were shaking their heads as they began mouth-to-mouth and chest compressions. It didn\u2019t look good...</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>One Year Ago</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re radiant. I\u2019m incredibly grateful for persistent reporting, an especially for snow storms in Alaska because right now I\u2019m the luckiest man in this room,\u201d Max told Cassie as he suddenly dipped her low to the ground, before lifting her back up, bringing her body close to his.</p><p>\u201cYou make me tremble,\u201d Cassie sighed, her eyes devouring him.</p><p>\u201cI want to drag you out of here right now,\u201d he growled while his hand drifted down her satin wedding gown and gripped her hip, pulling her tight against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stopping you,\u201d she purred, a seductive smile on her face.</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes rounded as her words sunk in and he realized she was giving him permission to haul her away. He stopped dancing and grabbed her hand, prepared to cart her to the nearest room.</p><p>\u201cYou may not be stopping him, but I am. Do you know how many hours I\u2019ve spent planning the perfect wedding for you? Joseph and I have worked night and day, and there\u2019s no flippin\u2019 way you\u2019re sneaking off,\u201d Kinsey said in a stern voice. The smile she was trying to hide was showing though, taking any bite out of the words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you, Kins,\u201d Cassie pleaded with her.</p><p>\u201cNo way. Don\u2019t you dare give me those doe in the headlight eyes. I\u2019ve known you too many years for that to work. We have a cake to cut, toasts to make, and a bouquet to throw,\u201d Kinsey insisted.</p><p>\u201cFine, but when you\u2019re trying to sneak off with some hunk of a man, I promise you that I\u2019ll be there to run interference,\u201d Cassie threatened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can\u2019t see that happening in the near future. I think I\u2019m safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you never know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, trust me. I really want a niece, but you have plenty of baby-making time on your month long honeymoon. I can\u2019t believe how spoiled you are. I really can\u2019t believe your job is willing to wait that long for you,\u201d Kinsey pouted.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m just worth the wait,\u201d Cassie said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYou are, Cass. You really are,\u201d Kinsey said, all joking aside.</p><p>\u201cThanks for making this day perfect, Kins. You know I love you to death,\u201d Cass said, no longer pouting about not getting to run off with her husband.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. Let\u2019s go cut the cake before you make me cry and ruin this expertly applied makeup,\u201d Kinsey said.</p><p>\u201cFine, but you owe me. You owe me big time,\u201d Cassie pouted as she followed her best friend.</p><p>The night flew by in a whirl of dancing, laughing, eating, and visiting. The Anderson family certainly knew how to throw a huge event. Yes, Kinsey had spent hours with Joseph planning, but she knew he was really the one in control.</p><p>She\u2019d insisted on certain things for the wedding, those special little touches she knew would matter to Cassie, but for the most part, she\u2019d tried to just stay out of Joseph\u2019s way. The man was a force to be reckoned with. She found it quite funny that the giant of a man liked planning weddings so much. Maybe he\u2019d gone into the wrong business.</p><p>\u201cMy feet are killing me. I\u2019m thinking right now I should\u2019ve opted for the flats instead of the three inch heels. I just like to pretend I\u2019m taller than I really am, but that always ends up biting me in the butt,\u201d Kinsey said to another bridesmaid as they stood on the edge of the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. I refuse to take them off because, well, look at them. They\u2019re stunning, but I won\u2019t be able to walk for a week. It\u2019s worth it though, or at least that\u2019s what I keep telling myself,\u201d Shelby said.</p><p>\u201cHow many times have you been hit on tonight?\u201d Kinsey asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cAbout seven. I think Cassie picked out the, um, how do I say it nicely? Ah, most revealing dresses she could, for her bridesmaids. I keep double checking to make sure everything\u2019s still covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t remember the dresses being this short or low cut when we tried them on. I think she had them modified,\u201d Kinsey said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cHow about you? Any offers to see the historic hotel? Come on, does a pickup line get any cheesier than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, yes it does. One guy came up and asked me if I was going to be in line to catch the wedding bouquet? I thought he was doing a count or something, so I told him I would. You know Cassie would kill me if I wasn\u2019t there. Worse than that, she\u2019d stop the proceedings and have me paged over the loudspeaker. So then he says, Is it just me, or are we destined to be married, as he holds up a garter belt. I don\u2019t know where he got it because Max hasn\u2019t even thrown Kinsey\u2019s yet. I just walked away. Really! What else was I supposed to do?\u201d Kinsey said as she started laughing.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh. Okay, you win. That\u2019s freaking fantastic,\u201d Shelby said between fits of laughter.</p><p>They shared more lines they\u2019d received at various weddings through the years. Kinsey didn\u2019t understand how men ever got dates with some of the things they said.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but I noticed you looked thirsty,\u201d a man said, interrupting the two women.</p><p>Kinsey looked up, her body vibrating as she recognized Austin Anderson. He was gorgeous, melt-in-your-mouth good looking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he knew it.</p><p>She also knew from Cassie that he liked to date \u2013 a lot. There was no way Kinsey was getting involved with a guy like him.</p><p>She shared a knowing look with Shelby before giving him a cool glance.</p><p>\u201cHow nice of you, but no thanks,\u201d she said, then turned and walked away. She was grateful she didn\u2019t fall on her face as weak as her knees were feeling.</p> <p>She made it across the dance floor in one piece, then quickly downed the first drink handed to her. She had a few hours to go and a bit of liquid courage wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>The rest of the men she\u2019d turned down that night had been quite easy to walk away from. For some reason, Austin Anderson was like a magnet, trying to pull her in.</p><p>Kinsey realized her stomach was growling. She\u2019d been so busy trying to ensure the day was perfect in every single way for Cassie that she\u2019d forgotten to eat.</p><p>She found an empty table, suddenly too tired to visit with strangers, and sat down.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing tonight?\u201d one of the waiters asked as he showed up almost instantly. Kinsey smiled at the young boy, thinking again about how Joseph went over the top.</p> <p>She\u2019d been to some spectacular weddings, but none of them compared to her best friend\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and look at the menu in front of you to make your selection. While you\u2019re doing that, I can get your drink and appetizers,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cThat would be wonderful. I\u2019ll have a Manhattan, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She looked at her choices, smiling at the five-star menu. She knew most of the people attending wouldn\u2019t bother to eat, not when there was an open bar.</p> <p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d the waiter said, quickly returning. He placed her drink and a plate with a variety of appetizers, the smells causing her mouth to water. There was no way she was passing up such a delicious meal. She wanted to try something she\u2019d never had before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the Shorthorn Beef Carpaccio with crispy fried quail\u2019s egg for my dinner and the caramelized bread pudding with amaretto poached pear, vanilla clotted cream and spiced almonds for desert,\u201d she said after narrowing down her options. She wanted to try a little of it all, just because some of the names were so unique.</p><p>\u201cVery good choices. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add?\u201d</p><p>Kinsey didn\u2019t want to order items she knew she couldn\u2019t eat, so she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the yellow fin tuna with vierge sauce and vegetables. Also, we\u2019ll have the Karat Pure Gold Ossetra Caviar and a plate of oysters on the half shell to share,\u201d Austin said as he took the seat next to her.</p><p>Kinsey looked at him, at a loss for words. She knew he was overconfident, but she hadn\u2019t expected him to be rude. She hadn\u2019t invited him to sit.</p><p>\u201cGreat choices, Mr. Anderson,\u201d the young waiter said, his face beaming to be serving one of the family members. Geese, Kinsey thought, people acted like the Anderson\u2019s were royalty.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tommy. Are you enjoying yourself tonight?\u201d Austin asked, surprising Kinsey. He knows the kid?</p> <p>\u201cYes, Mr. Anderson. I really appreciate the job. The guests have all been so nice,\u201d he quickly responded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. How are your studies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I got an A on my science project because of you,\u201d he answered. Kinsey looked back and forth between them. The kid obviously idolized Austin, but she couldn\u2019t figure out the connection.</p><p>\u201cYou did it all on your own, Tommy. Be proud of that. Once you understood the basic concept, there was no holding you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess. I better go turn this in. I don\u2019t want to make you wait,\u201d he said before turning.</p><p>\u201cOh, Tommy, can you also bring out the bottle of 1978 Montrachet white wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem, Mr. Anderson,\u201d he said before practically running inside the food area.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Kinsey asked, momentarily distracted from her irritation of him joining her without permission.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Austin asked, looking perplexed.</p><p>\u201cAh, the whole science thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s nothing,\u201d Austin said, brushing it off.</p><p>\u201cConsidering you joined my table without asking, it\u2019s my right to have you either provide a decent conversation, or remove yourself,\u201d Kinsey said, looking him in the eye.</p><p>She was surprised when he laughed, a deep-in-your-gut-make-your-stomach-hurt laugh. When he finally came up for air, Tommy was back and silently setting his requested appetizers on the table, along with the bottle of wine.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to open it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Thanks,\u201d Austin replied, and Tommy disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Kinsey pushed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I get it. I tutor some kids at one of the high schools nearby. It\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d he said, shifting in his seat, looking uncomfortable.</p><p>Kinsey was shocked. She knew the Anderson\u2019s donated a lot of money, but she didn\u2019t know any of them did actual volunteer work. She didn\u2019t want to learn this about Austin, didn\u2019t want to see him as a caring guy instead of the playboy he was.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she finally responded, at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cYou have to try this,\u201d Austin said, quickly changing the subject as he held up a light cracker with caviar on it. Kinsey looked at it with suspicion, but she\u2019d wanted to try new things so she reached her hand out.</p><p>He pulled back so she couldn\u2019t take it, then lifted it to her lips. Automatically, her mouth opened to take the delicate morsel, a flare of heat flashing inside her as his thumb brushed her bottom lip. She didn\u2019t even taste the food as she swallowed, hoping she wouldn\u2019t choke.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she murmured as she picked up her glass, only to realize her drink was empty. When had she finished that?</p><p>\u201cTry this,\u201d Austin said as he opened the bottle of wine and filled a glass before handing it to her.</p><p>She accepted it from him and took a sip, the delicate flavor drifting across her tongue and down her throat.</p><p>\u201cDo I get to know your name?\u201d</p><p>Kinsey looked at him, debating whether or not she wanted to give it to him. She knew he\u2019d find out anyway, as she and Cassie were best friends. She didn\u2019t know how they hadn\u2019t run into each other before this night.</p><p>\u201cKinsey Shelton,\u201d she finally answered.</p><p>\u201cMmm, Kinsey. Beautiful name for a stunning woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Mr. Lady Killer can certainly come up with a better line than that,\u201d she mocked, relieved to gain a bit of her wits back.</p><p>He once again laughed. She frowned at him, wondering what she could possibly do to annoy him enough to find other prey to hunt.</p><p>\u201cKinsey, you\u2019re quickly becoming unforgettable,\u201d he said, his face growing serious as his blue eyes locked in on her brown ones.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no good as I have no interest in being remembered,\u201d she answered, her breath coming out raspy instead of forceful as she wanted.</p><p>Tommy arrived with their food, and they continued bantering back and forth as they consumed the exquisite cuisine. By the time Kinsey was staring at her empty dessert plate, she was regretting the amount she\u2019d consumed. It was fantastic, but she\u2019d have to work out for a week straight to burn off all the calories.</p><p>\u201cDance with me,\u201d Austin commanded as he rose from the table.</p><p>\u201cYou must really enjoy being told no,\u201d Kinsey said, surprised as she wobbled a bit when she got to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI enjoy each sound that escapes from your delectable mouth,\u201d he countered as he stepped closer and placed his hand on her waist to steady her.</p><p>She knew she\u2019d kick herself later, but she was tired of fighting her attraction to him. One dance couldn\u2019t hurt. They were surrounded by people.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, enjoying the momentary surprise in his eyes.</p><p>He quickly recovered and grabbed her hand, leading her to a dark corner of the dance floor. He immediately pulled her into his arms, pressing her body close to his as the music played a romantic ballad.</p><p>One song led into the next, and time slipped away as she melted into him while he whispered in her ear, his lips trailing along her neck, his breath sending heat straight to her core. He moved his hands down the small of her back, then lower, his fingers caressing the rounded top of her backside, pulling her close, leaving no doubt he was aroused by their foreplay.</p><p>The music stopped as someone announced it was time for the bouquet to be thrown. Kinsey found it hard to process the words as she pulled away and found herself looking into his turbulent blue eyes, capturing her own and refusing to let go.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve bewitched me,\u201d Austin murmured before his mouth descended and he captured her lips for the first time. She knew kissing him would be good, she just hadn\u2019t known it would short circuit her brain.</p><p>His tongue caressed her mouth, leaving her no choice but to open for him. She knew in that moment she couldn\u2019t fight him or the surreal vortex that had been pulling them together all night. She gave herself over to him.</p><p>Slowly, he moved his head back, just enough to look into her eyes. His own filled with a sea of raging passion. Then, without saying another word, he let go of her, only long enough to take her hand as he led her to the hotel.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Present Time</p><p>\u201cLucas Anderson, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is him,\u201d Lucas said while glancing at his clock. It was two in the morning. At the professional tone of the person on the other end of the line, Lucas became fully alert. No call at this hour was a good thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but there\u2019s been an accident. We\u2019ve admitted Joseph and George Anderson here at Harbor View Medical Center. We have you listed as an emergency contact in Mr. Joseph Anderson\u2019s belongings. The only information I have at this time is that they were in an auto accident. The sooner you arrive, the better.\u201d</p><p>It took several moments for the woman\u2019s words to sink in.</p><p>Accident.</p><p>Joseph.</p><p>George.</p><p>Arrive quickly.</p><p>Lucas said nothing further as he dropped the phone into the receiver and jumped from his bed.</p><p>\u201cLucas, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Amy asked as she woke up.</p><p>\u201cMy father and Uncle George. That was the hospital. They\u2019ve been in a wreck and the person who called said we needed to come quickly,\u201d he croaked. All traces of sleep were wiped from Amy\u2019s expression as she quickly sat up, fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Marcia know,\u201d Amy replied as she quickly climbed from the bed, threw on her robe, and left to alert the nanny they were leaving.</p><p>Lucas turned off all emotion \u2013 not allowing the panic inside him to rise. He was the eldest son and it was his responsibility to notify the rest of his family. He had to maintain a calm he didn\u2019t come close to feeling.</p><p>Information. He needed more information. He couldn\u2019t make a proper assessment until he knew all the facts. Were they alive? How bad were the injuries? What could he do?</p><p>Lucas knew he couldn\u2019t get answers until he reached the hospital, so he started moving.</p><p>First, he dialed his cousin. It would go much faster if two of them split up the calls. Fear tried finding its way into Lucas\u2019s heart, making it constrict as he waited for Austin to answer. With great effort, he pushed the fear down, knowing the emotion was useless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis better be damn good,\u201d Austin snapped.</p><p>\u201cOur fathers are at Harbor View Medical Center.\u201d Lucas didn\u2019t waste time on greetings.</p><p>\u201cWho else needs to be notified?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first one I dialed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call my siblings, you call yours.

He quickly called the rest of his siblings, then breathed a sigh of relief as Amy rushed back into the room. She immediately went to their closet and grabbed him a change of clothes, dropping them on the bed in front of him before going in and grabbing her own items.</p><p>They changed quickly, neither of them talking as they rushed to get ready. As the seconds ticked by, Lucas found himself fighting harder not to let the panic rise.</p><p>His father was invincible, he told himself.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine, Lucas. Joseph is too stubborn to let anything happen to him,\u201d Amy reassured him as her arms wrapped around him in a comforting embrace. Pulling her in closer, Lucas ran his hand down the familiar softness of her hair, and gently kissed the top of her head, the feel of her, calming him, giving him the needed strength to press forward.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d he admitted, finally allowing a trace of his fear to show.</p><p>Amy shook in his arms as she tried to control her own emotions from spilling out. She and Joseph had a special bond.</p><p>A father had been one of the many things Amy had been deprived of as a child. Joseph had immediately opened his arms to her and she rushed right in. She was the daughter he always wanted, but was never blessed with, and he was the father she\u2019d always dreamed of. It would hurt her as much as Lucas if Joseph were to leave the world early.</p><p>Amy pulled back and looked in Lucas\u2019s eyes. Her own were red and glassy and he could see she was fighting the tears from falling, trying to be strong for him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered. She looked at him with confusion. \u201cThank you for giving me the strength to get through this. You humble me with nothing other than your presence. Thank you, Amy. You\u2019re right. He will be okay. He\u2019s far too stubborn to let go at such a young age. I\u2019m ready now. We need to be there for Mom. I don\u2019t want her alone.\u201d</p><p>Amy didn\u2019t reply as her built up tears finally fell, silently running down her cheeks. He wrapped his arm around her as they rushed from the room.</p> <p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cOver here, Mark,\u201d Lucas called as his brother and Emily stepped into the emergency room. The couple changed direction and quickly approached their group.</p><p>\u201cHow are they? Why aren\u2019t you with them? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Mark fired questions at the growing mass of people, containing his mom, brothers, cousins and many spouses.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything, yet. It seems the only thing anyone in this freaking hospital knows how to say is, The doctor will be with you shortly,\u201d Alex snapped.</p><p>\u201cAlex, anger won\u2019t help your father or uncle. Please be patient,\u201d Katherine said, her voice strong, though her face was pale with worry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom. I just...\u201d Alex trailed off, anxiety written on his face.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, Mom. Can I do anything?\u201d Emily asked as she pushed past the circle surrounding Katherine and gave her a comforting hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging in there, darling. Joseph isn\u2019t ready to leave me just yet. I know that and so does he,\u201d Katherine said, though a tremor ran through her voice.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d just feel better if they\u2019d let me see him,\u201d Lucas thundered, his temper obviously close to the breaking point.</p><p>\u201cSoon, Lucas. It will be soon,\u201d Amy said, gently rubbing her hand along his arm, immediately calming him.</p><p>\u201cKatherine, I got here as soon as I could,\u201d Esther panted as she rushed into the room. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Have you heard anything, yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re still waiting. Thank you for coming. I know it\u2019s late,\u201d Katherine said as Esther wrapped her in a consoling embrace.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. I\u2019d be terribly upset if no one had notified me. I have to be here. Let\u2019s look at the positive. No news is good news, right? That means they\u2019re fighting. Those men certainly know how to fight,\u201d Esther said through her tears.</p><p>\u201cYes they do, Esther, yes they do,\u201d Katherine said with a watery laugh. She was obviously glad to have her friend there.</p><p>\u201cI remember times when you would\u2019ve gladly run over Joseph. He\u2019s got some thick skin and there\u2019s no way one little accident will keep him down. Same goes for George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right again, Esther. That man... Well, let\u2019s just say he has a way of keeping my heart accelerated. They were out driving that blasted car I told him to sell months ago. I truly despise those tiny things,\u201d Katherine said.</p><p>The kids looked at her, all of them relieved to see her fear dim as anger took its place. At least the anger brought a bit of color to her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cGrown men trying to act like teenagers. What were they thinking? We\u2019ll just have to talk to them,\u201d Esther threatened.</p><p>The two women continued to rant until they were interrupted by an approaching doctor.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you want him released? Are you kidding me!\u201d Kinsey snapped at the young doctor who didn\u2019t even bother looking up from the notes he was writing in Joseph\u2019s file.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, nurse. Why don\u2019t you do your job and let me do mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to do my job. I\u2019m trying not to let you kill my patient!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Either stop now or you can look for another job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the power to fire me. I\u2019m not backing down. I know this man and there is no way I\u2019m going to let anything happen to him,\u201d Kinsey snapped. She was losing her patience with the arrogant new doctor who was barely out of medical school. She hated dealing with baby doctors, as the nursing staff called them. Some of them were just too damn arrogant to ask for help, even when they knew they were screwing up.</p><p>Maybe in the hospital where he\u2019d done his residency, they didn\u2019t do more thorough checks on patients, but here, the doctors had confidence in the nursing staff and didn\u2019t usually fight them when they knew there was a problem. He\u2019s new, she reminded herself, trying to keep calm. She knew Joseph wasn\u2019t even close to being ready to be released.</p><p>\u201cHe sustained a head injury, doctor. He needs a CT scan and a Neuro consult,\u201d Kinsey insisted.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve lost patience now. I\u2019ve done a thorough evaluation on him and he\u2019s fine. His eyes are responsive. His vitals are good. I\u2019m releasing him.\u201d The doctor walked away and Kinsey wanted to throw her pen at his back. She felt like a child on the verge of a major tantrum. How hard was it to order a CT scan? Joseph had been experiencing headaches since he\u2019d arrived. It was common practice to order the scan.</p><p>She always fought hard for her patients, but this was Joseph, and she\u2019d fight to the point of losing her job for him.</p><p>\u201cYou can quit fighting for me now, Kinsey. I feel fine. What I need to do is check on my brother,\u201d Joseph whispered.</p><p>\u201cNow, Joseph,\u201d she gently admonished as she turned around. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any way ready to make that call. You were in a terrible wreck and have been fading in and out of consciousness.\u201d Kinsey rushed back over to his side and immediately picked up his hand and began checking his pulse. He was still hooked up to the monitors, but she felt better double checking the equipment with the good-old-fashioned, hands-on approach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tougher than I look. Right now the only thing I want is to see George,\u201d Joseph repeated.</p><p>Kinsey looked into his pain filled eyes and felt her own tear up. She knew how much he was blaming himself for the accident. She also knew that family was more important to him than anything else. His family couldn\u2019t afford to lose him, though, and she needed to get that through his head.</p><p>\u201cJoseph, I understand that you\u2019re tougher than a freight liner, but I think you\u2019re in shock. I\u2019ve seen this before. I\u2019m very concerned about the headache you\u2019ve had since arriving. I want you to have a CT scan and a consult with a Neuro Surgeon,\u201d Kinsey argued. Now she was fighting with the doctor and her patient. Her job was rarely easy.</p><p>\u201cKinsey, dear, I\u2019ve been through worse than a little car accident. I\u2019m okay. Now, listen to your doctor, and help me get out of here. I need to check on my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just indulge me for another hour? That\u2019s not asking much. I\u2019ll personally go and check on George and come right back with an update,\u201d Kinsey pleaded.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Lucas rushed into the room. \u201cHow are you feeling? What has the doctor said? Where\u2019s Uncle George? I can\u2019t seem to get answers from anyone,\u201d Lucas fired, not giving Joseph enough time to answer before he fired off another question. Alex and Mark came in right behind him, along with Amy, Jessica and Emily.</p><p>Kinsey smiled at the look of love and worry on their faces. Her best friend was indeed lucky to have married into such a beautiful family. They were good people, inside and out. She quietly slipped from the room so they could visit privately.</p><p>\u201cDid you start the discharge process?\u201d</p><p>Kinsey took a fortifying breath before turning. The same doctor was back, breathing down her neck. She knew now it was just a power-of-wills. He didn\u2019t care about the patient \u2013 he cared about his orders being followed.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see, Mr. Anderson\u2019s family just arrived. He\u2019ll be busy for a while answering their questions. When he\u2019s finished, I\u2019ll start the discharge process,\u201d Kinsey stalled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. I will be reporting you to your supervisor. Get him discharged, now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pompous, son-of-a-b...\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there. I don\u2019t care what it takes. You\u2019ll be escorted out of here within the next hour. It\u2019s either you, or me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you just admit to the fact that you may be wrong? It doesn\u2019t hurt you, in the least, to order a CT scan and have a neurosurgeon do a consult.\u201d Kinsey was done dealing with the doctor. She\u2019d go to her supervisor \u2013 but she wasn\u2019t backing down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finished here,\u201d he snarled before walking off.</p><p>Yes, I most likely am finished, she thought as she walked over to the nurses\u2019 station and picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dr. Mason has ordered a Neuro consult on a patient, Joseph Anderson, and it needs to be soon. Also, he\u2019s ordered a CT scan,\u201d Kinsey said.</p><p>Not knowing the difference, they sent out the page, and Kinsey turned toward the room Joseph was in. She felt it in her gut that something was wrong. The doctor would be furious with her, but she didn\u2019t care. If Joseph turned out to be okay, it was worth the doctor\u2019s wrath. She\u2019d already made the decision to sacrifice her job. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKinsey!\u201d</p><p>Kinsey turned just in time to catch Cassie as she threw herself at her. She had to fight her frustrated tears from falling as Cassie broke down in her arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here, Kins. They won\u2019t tell us anything. We finally got to come see Uncle Joseph, but we still know nothing about my Dad. Do you know anything?\u201d Cassie asked as she leaned back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cass. I\u2019ve been with Joseph the whole time but I\u2019ll make some calls and see what I can find out about George,\u201d Kinsey quickly assured her friend.</p> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand how something so awful happens to two of the most wonderful men I know,\u201d Cassie said, still holding onto Kinsey.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Cass. I see it every single day, and I still don\u2019t get it. So many tragedies, so senseless. But, they\u2019re both alive, Cass. Don\u2019t give up on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m just... my hormones... I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cass shook as her tears fell freely.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t mentioned depression,\u201d Kinsey said with concern.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just a bit of the post baby blues. I\u2019m okay, and Ariel is amazing, the best three-month-old baby in the world. It\u2019s just that something like this happens and my hormone ridden brain goes a little haywire,\u201d Cassie said.</p> <p>\u201cI understand, Cass. If George has to be here a few days, you need to bring Ariel in to visit him. You know that seeing her will heal him faster than any medicine this hospital can provide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019ll talk to Max about it. I don\u2019t like being away from her very long anyway. She\u2019s still so tiny, plus I\u2019m nursing. I just didn\u2019t want to bring her down here in the middle of the night, especially with not knowing anything,\u201d Cassie explained.</p><p>\u201cThat was smart. She can\u2019t be in the emergency room, anyway. Wait until he\u2019s moved to a private room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much longer are you on shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a few hours to go. I can come with you to check on Joseph, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Cassie said as she took Kinsey\u2019s arm and started leading her toward the room.</p> <p>\u201cNurse Stellar, a word.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey turned to see the young doctor again. It really was going to be a long night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute, Cass. Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should stay with you, Kins. That doctor seems unstable,\u201d Cassie whispered.</p><p>Kinsey knew it was the stress of the situation, but she suddenly had to fight off a burst of laughter wanting to escape. The look on the doctor\u2019s face, all red with small bubbles of spit in the corner of his far too thin lips, combined with the uncertain look Cassie was sending his way was too much.</p><p>Kinsey turned to reassure her friend that she was okay, when alarms started ringing. Any thoughts of laughter were immediately cut off.</p><p>\u201cSomeone help!\u201d</p><p>Kinsey and the doctor ended their standoff and faced the room. Kinsey immediately responded.</p> <p>\u201cCode Blue!\u201d Kinsey yelled as she rushed into the room.</p><p>Her fear had just become realized. Joseph had tried to stand up, stubborn man that he was, and instantly collapsed into Lucas\u2019s arms.</p><p>The nurses rushed forward as they took his vitals.</p><p>\u201cHis eyes aren\u2019t responding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood pressure\u2019s rapidly dropping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re losing his pulse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart CPR, Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart compression.\u201d</p><p>Words. Rapidly fired. A jumble of words, one sentence rushing over the top of the next. Kinsey knew his family was terrified, knew they would only catch pieces, the worst pieces, in the conversation. It almost sounds like a different language to someone not working in the medical industry, but it translated effortlessly to Kinsey\u2019s ears. She knew those words, knew them in her sleep. She moved on autopilot, just as the team around her did the same. They weren\u2019t only trained, but trained well. They\u2019d make sure he survived.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a good radial pulse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got an airway established.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood pressure\u2019s still too low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a CT scan, stat, and call Neuro.\u201d The doctor didn\u2019t even look at her as he yelled his command to be overheard in the chaotic room.</p><p>\u201cYes, Doctor,\u201d a nurse replied as she rushed out.</p><p>Just then the Neuro Surgeon, who Kinsey had called for earlier, stepped into the room. The doctor she\u2019d been fighting with sent a glare her way. She knew their argument was far from over. He wasn\u2019t happy about her being right. She didn\u2019t care about his ego. She would\u2019ve much rather been wrong. However, it looked like her insight might save Joseph\u2019s life. That was all that mattered to her.</p><p>The staff quickly prepared Joseph for transport, and then rushed him out the door. Kinsey walked from the room, down the hall, and then slipped inside a broom closet. She sank down the wall and gripped her head in her hands. It was never easy dealing with a patient you cared about. She knew there were no guarantee\u2019s when a surgeon cut into a patient's brain. She was scared for this family she\u2019d come to know and respect.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell can\u2019t I get any answers!\u201d Austin roared at the receptionist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. If you\u2019ll please just have a seat, the doctor should be out shortly.\u201d The woman had nerves of steel. He wanted to jump across the desk and strangle her, which was new for him. Normally, he never had an ill thought about a woman \u2013 ever.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Austin. You\u2019re not going to get anywhere terrorizing the staff,\u201d Max said as he wrapped his arm around his brother and tugged him away from the desk.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t anyone give us information? It\u2019s been hours. Dad\u2019s still in surgery and Uncle Joseph\u2019s currently getting his head sliced open. You\u2019d think they\u2019d tell us something at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But you have to remain calm. Bree\u2019s falling apart and she needs us to be confident. We have to have faith in the doctors here. Besides, you know how strong our father and uncle are. They will pull through this.\u201d</p><p>Austin grumbled as he started pacing the room. He needed something, anything to get his mind off what was going on. He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if something happened to either of the men.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stand being in the hospital. He hated everything about the place, the smell, look, feel. He\u2019d spent too many hours in one when his mother had been fighting for her life. A fight she\u2019d lost.</p><p>He ran his hand through his hair as anger, fatigue, confusion and grief poured through him. He needed to get out of there, but he couldn\u2019t leave. He didn\u2019t want to even think about what it would do to his family if they lost their dad. They couldn\u2019t lose both parents.</p><p>No. Just, no. He wouldn\u2019t go there. It wouldn\u2019t happen \u2013 it couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He paced the room to the point he was sure his footprints would be permanently stamped into the floor. After about the hundredth time across, he turned, then froze in place.</p><p>\u201cKinsey,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Austin closed his eyes as he allowed himself a moment to remember his night with Kinsey a year ago at Cassie\u2019s wedding. Thinking of her always sent fire through his veins, and he was grateful to have the distraction. Anything was better than the suffering he was going through while waiting to hear about his father. He shut out the noise around him as he thought back...</p><p>He\u2019d spotted Kinsey on the dance floor, her shiny lips open as laughter spilled freely from her. He\u2019d been instantly intrigued, deciding he had to meet the incredibly lovely bridesmaid. It was a wedding, after-all. The groomsmen and bridesmaids were expected to hook up.</p><p>He grabbed a couple flutes of champagne from a passing waiter, then approached her, dripping with confidence. He had no reason to feel anything other than on top of the world. Women adored him.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, but I noticed you looked thirsty,\u201d he said, giving her his sexiest smile. She was worth his full bag of charm, after-all. He needed to thank his new sister-in-law because the dresses she\u2019d picked were stunning, showcasing the woman\u2019s assets to perfection.</p><p>His groin tightened as he pictured peeling the satin fabric off her.</p><p>\u201cHow nice of you, but no thanks.\u201d Austin stood there as she turned and walked away. He knew his mouth was hanging open, but he was at a loss for words. His eyes were glued to the sensual movement of her hips as she crossed the floor, before a flood of bodies swallowed her up.</p><p>He drained his glass, then smiled from ear to ear.</p><p>A challenge!</p><p>He spent the next two hours trying to convince her to dance. When she finally agreed, he felt like he won the lottery.</p><p>Pulling her onto the dance floor, her curves melted against him, sending his body into permanent meltdown. His hand slid low as he pulled her close so she\u2019d have no doubt of his desire. Her eyes widened as he pushed against her, a groan rumbling from his chest.</p><p>He knew they\u2019d both had too much to drink. He knew something was off, but he didn\u2019t listen to his conscious. After dancing for hours, laughing, talking, flirting, he carried her up the stairs to his guest room.</p><p>He\u2019d never forget how it felt having their bodies entwined. Kinsey\u2019s curves pressed against his own. The sound of his name gasped from her lips as he sank deep within her.</p><p>\u201cAustin? Hey, earth to Austin.\u201d</p><p>Austin opened his eyes to find his brother standing next to him, but he couldn\u2019t quite focus on what he was saying, his mind foggy as he tried to push the memories back where they came from. With Kinsey being so close, it wasn\u2019t easy. Just seeing her made him ache.</p><p>Their night together had been the most passion filled and satisfying night he could ever remember.</p><p>The next morning he\u2019d woken to find her gone.</p><p>Not able to get her out of his mind, he\u2019d called her, stopped by her house, even begged Cassie for information \u2013 all of it was to no avail. She avoided him like he was contagious \u2013 he didn\u2019t get it. Normally, women were slipping keys into his pockets, phone numbers in his fingers, making it more than clear they were available for his pleasure, day or night.</p><p>The one woman he wanted a second date with couldn\u2019t seem to get far enough away from him. He finally found her at one of his family holiday parties. She\u2019d told him she\u2019d made a mistake, and she\u2019d rather forget about the entire night.</p><p>He\u2019d managed to change her mind, though, once again getting her to dance with him, until they\u2019d ended up sneaking off for a little privacy. He\u2019d nearly taken her again on one of the private balconies. Someone had interrupted them, and the next thing he knew, she was gone again.</p><p>The next time he\u2019d seen her had been at Bree\u2019s wedding, only a few months ago. She\u2019d once again tried to ignore him, but then, their eyes met across the room, hers unguarded for just a moment, and the need he saw in her stormy brown depths nearly dropped him to his knees. He wanted to throw her over his shoulder, and find somewhere they could be alone, so he could love her until they were both fully sated. He\u2019d managed to stop himself \u2013 just barely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat stopped you in your tracks so suddenly? I thought you might be on a mission to carve a path in the floor. I\u2019ve been trying to get your attention for like five minutes as you stare into space,\u201d Trenton went on, his face looked worried. He probably thought his brother had finally snapped. Maybe he had.</p><p>\u201cKinsey.\u201d He didn\u2019t need to say any more. His brothers had ribbed him endlessly after the wedding, then later, when he\u2019d chased her at the Christmas party. They knew she\u2019d made an impact on him, but since he hadn\u2019t said anything about her in months, they\u2019d laid off. From the look on his brother\u2019s face, he was about to get another dose of brotherly goading.</p><p>Trenton whistled as his head turned and he took in Kinsey\u2019s petite frame. Scrubs normally weren\u2019t known for their sex appeal, but she looked damn good in her light green cotton pair.</p><p>With her hair pulled back in a sloppy bun and devoid of makeup, she looked like a teenager, instead of a woman, though he knew first hand she was no school girl. His groin tightened even more.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe there isn\u2019t a ring on her finger. What\u2019s the hold-up, anyway? You obviously want her, so why don\u2019t you do something about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d Austin lied.</p><p>\u201cYou going to ever tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to tell. I thought about it, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t mind if I told my friend, Mick about her...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not available,\u201d Austin quickly interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYou sound awfully possessive for nothing going on,\u201d Trenton accused. Austin decided the comment didn\u2019t warrant a response. He knew his brothers well and if he gave them even an inch, they\u2019d have him by the scruff of his neck.</p><p>For a few simple moments, the two brothers had something other than stress to focus on. Their father and uncle weren\u2019t forgotten about, but the distraction was welcomed. It certainly saved the nursing staff from at least two of the Anderson men harassing them for an update every two minutes.</p><p>Austin\u2019s eyes shifted back to where Kinsey was in the middle of a heated debate about something. His curiosity was peaked.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go on over and play the knight in shining armor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of minding your own business?\u201d Austin finally said.</p> <p>\u201cHard to ignore a sexy brunette,\u201d Trenton quickly replied.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go ahead and tell Jennifer you\u2019re ogling other women,\u201d Austin threatened.</p><p>Trenton held his hands up in surrender. He knew when he was beaten.</p><p>\u201cI can appreciate an attractive woman because no one comes even close to comparing to Jennifer. She\u2019s beautiful, incredibly sexy and makes my head spin. I can\u2019t imagine not having her in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone soft,\u201d Austin mocked, but there was no heat behind his words. He loved his sister-in-law and was glad his brother had been lucky enough to find someone so special. She was a true gem. Surprisingly, all his family members had been lucky in marriage. He was the only holdout at this point. It was starting to feel a bit lonely at family gatherings as he watched his brothers and cousins finding corners to neck in. They all seemed so much happier than when they were single...</p><p>\u201cWhen was your last serious relationship? You seem more of a bear than usual. Maybe if you got a girlfriend, you wouldn\u2019t wake up all hot and bothered, taking your bad mood out on the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering that\u2019s none of your business, I\u2019ll just choose to ignore your asinine comments,\u201d Austin replied. He felt like taking Trenton\u2019s head off, but that would only prove the man right.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d been grumpy. Maybe he did need to find a woman for a night of no-holds-bar-pleasure. The thought turned his stomach, though. His eyes automatically went back to Kinsey. It seemed she was the only one who was causing a stir in his incredibly tense body.</p> <p>\u201cWow, that long, huh?\u201d Trenton said with a whistle. Austin glared at him while Trenton continued. \u201cTruth hurts, brother.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey shifted and Austin\u2019s stomach clenched. She ran her slender fingers across her cheek, capturing a few tendrils of escaped hair, before tucking them behind her ear. He could see her dark brown eyes glittering with agitation as she gestured to the doctor. He could just make out the sprinkling of freckles across her pale nose, the combination all adding to her unique beauty. She was stunning, which helped his desire, but certainly didn\u2019t define it.</p><p>His eyes ran down the column of her neck, to the slight \u2018V\u2019 of her scrubs. His fingers itched as he imagined holding the weight of her perfect breasts in his hands. He knew her nipples hardened at the slightest touch.</p><p>She was so incredibly responsive.</p><p>\u201cI need a drink,\u201d Austin said too loudly.</p><p>Trenton looked at him, then at Kinsey, then back to him again with a knowing expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they serve what you need, here. I\u2019ll take you to the bar as soon as we get information,\u201d Trenton promised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. This has just been a stressful night,\u201d Austin said, making himself calm down.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going to talk to her, or are you going to torture yourself more?\u201d Trenton asked as the two men watched the doctor walk away. Kinsey\u2019s head was bent down, either in frustration or defeat. Austin was surprised by the surge of overprotectiveness coursing through him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to find out what\u2019s going on, not that it\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go harass some of our other family members?\u201d Austin snapped. He knew Trenton was trying to push his buttons. Well, congrats, he\u2019d done it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I get it. I\u2019ll mind my own business. Just remember the saying about honey, vinegar and insects. Whatever mom used to say, though I still haven\u2019t figured out why anyone would want to catch flies.\u201d</p><p>Austin ignored him as he moved forward. It was time to talk to Kinsey. His heart rate picked up as he stepped closer. She hadn\u2019t noticed him yet. He liked having the element of surprise on his side. She\u2019d managed to avoid him for months. Well, she was at work now, and couldn\u2019t run away.</p><p>How he wanted to play games with her. Very, very adult games, where they both walked away fully satisfied winners.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>Kinsey allowed herself to sag next to the wall for just a moment. The idiot doctor wasn\u2019t going to rest until he had her head on a platter. She\u2019d been right, him wrong, and his huge ego couldn\u2019t deal with the fact.</p><p>He was heading to her supervisor with a list of grievances against her. She may not have a job by the end of the day. She didn\u2019t care. It would be worth it if Joseph pulled through.</p><p>After a few seconds, she lifted her head, squared her shoulders and decided she wasn\u2019t going to be a victim. The new doctor could try and get her fired, but she wasn\u2019t going down without a fight. If he wanted to throw out accusations, then she\u2019d be there to defend herself.</p><p>With fire burning in her eyes, she took a step toward the corridor. Before she could get far, a man\u2019s voice stopped her in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re having problems.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey stopped with her foot still in the air. She slowly turned her head and came face to face with Austin. She knew he\u2019d be at the hospital. After all, his father and uncle were both here, but she\u2019d really hoped to avoid him. She desperately worked to compose her features, not wanting him to know how his presence affected her.</p><p>She never had one night stands.</p><p>Never!</p><p>For some reason, though, she hadn\u2019t been able to resist him at her best friend's wedding. He\u2019d been suave, romantic, and funny - the perfect guy. Knowing she\u2019d made a mistake the second she awoke the next morning, she\u2019d slipped from his bed and ran as fast as she could. Regret nipping at her toes the entire way.</p><p>Each time she\u2019d seen him since, her stomach fluttered and her body heated. She\u2019d ended up coming close to a repeat performance of what had happened at Cassie\u2019s wedding. She\u2019d come to the family Christmas party at Cassie\u2019s insistence, then practically made love to him on the Andersons balcony. After that incident, she knew she couldn\u2019t trust herself to be alone with him without somehow losing articles of her clothes. He was no good for her, she knew that, but convincing her body was a whole other matter.</p><p>Leaning against the wall, looking as striking as ever, even in the blaring florescent lights of the hospital, he had her speechless. Her eyes traveled down his fitted shirt to the worn jeans covering his impressive build. A shudder traveled down her spine and her mouth filled with moisture.</p><p>She stiffened her knees to keep from sinking into a puddle at his feet and braced herself as she looked into his wintry blue eyes, where a sensual storm was brewing behind their gleaming surface.</p><p>\u201cHello, Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen a while.\u201d The way he said the words was an accusation, not a statement.</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve been longer,\u201d she quickly replied. He raised his brows and the corner of his lip quivered.</p><p>Kinsey immediately felt terrible that she was snapping at him, considering his family was admitted in the hospital. What kind of person acts that way?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your family, Austin. Our staff is doing a wonderful job with them,\u201d she said, making sure her tone stayed professional.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he murmured, worry infusing his eyes until she saw him visibly push it back. It seemed he was refusing to focus on what he couldn\u2019t control. She\u2019d seen the same thing with many of her patients\u2019 families.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been, Kinsey?\u201d</p><p>There was no way she was going there with him.</p><p>\u201cI have work to do,\u201d she said, turning to leave. His hand snaked out and gripped her arm. He applied just enough pressure to let her know he wasn\u2019t planning on letting go anytime soon, but not so much that it hurt.</p><p>Kinsey had to fight her body\u2019s desire to lean into his touch as her memory played full color in her head of that same hand sliding across her skin, making her moan in pleasure. She could tell by the way he was gazing at her that he wanted to cart her to the nearest room, giving her a repeat performance of their night together. How she\u2019d love to accept his unspoken offer. Let him take away her stress, causing the awful day to fade away while she lost herself in his embrace.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>Because you aren\u2019t this girl he thinks you are! You don\u2019t do one night stands, well, you don\u2019t do them twice, she assured herself.</p><p>\u201cSurely you have time for an old lover.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey gasped at his boldness. She looked around, hoping no one was listening. Luckily, they were semi-alone at the moment.</p><p>\u201cA one night stand doesn\u2019t make us old lovers, Austin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be so much more than one night. You look stressed. I can help with that,\u201d he offered as his eyes darkened. Her nipples hardened to the point of pain, and her stomach began doing flips. Luckily her knees were still locked.</p><p>She knew he wasn\u2019t a commitment kind of guy, though. He\u2019d made that abundantly clear at the wedding. She\u2019d known then that he only wanted a romp in the sheets. She\u2019d been proud of the fact that she\u2019d been able to resist him. Well, she had until about the fourth, or maybe sixth, Manhattan drink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All her life, men had assumed that because she was well-endowed, she was a tramp. She\u2019d learned the hard way how far they\u2019d go to sleep with her.</p><p>Flowers.</p><p>Jewelry.</p><p>Expensive dinners.</p> <p>Flattery.</p><p>The list went on and on.</p><p>That was their idea of foreplay. Austin was a known playboy and his looks and money had gotten him just about any woman he\u2019d ever wanted. She knew he only pursued her because she was most likely the first to tell him, no. Well, he\u2019d just have to learn when no meant exactly that.</p><p>The aching in her body contradicted her self-pep-talk. She wanted him \u2013 without a doubt.</p><p>So what, she thought. She was strong. She wouldn\u2019t cave. She\u2019d done a lot of self-sacrifice in her life. She could certainly handle a few minutes in Austin\u2019s presence without jumping him, or letting him ravish her.</p> <p>\u201cI like your scrubs. Are those little bears?\u201d he asked as his finger ran down the side of her top, coming increasingly close to the edge of her breasts. Her air lodged in her lungs. She didn\u2019t know whether she should pull away or lean into the touch.</p><p>Maybe it was time to accept one of the other dates she\u2019d been offered lately. She shook off the shudder and stiffened her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Austin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seemed upset. I thought I could help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what was the argument with the doctor about?\u201d</p> <p>Kinsey blew out her held breath and started silently counting. She needed to get away from him, from whatever game he was playing, but he wasn\u2019t leaving until she gave him something.</p><p>\u201cWe had a difference of opinion. It\u2019s no big deal,\u201d she lied. In reality she knew she might very well be jobless in just a few hours.</p><p>\u201cYou seem pretty upset for it not to be that big of a deal,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to be polite. Let me put it another way. It\u2019s none of your business,\u201d she finally snapped.</p><p>Her words didn\u2019t have the slightest impact on him. Instead of being offended, he gave her his most seductive smile that instantly made her throat close.</p><p>Screw it, just five minutes, she offered herself before sanity came back and she resisted reaching for him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, be stubborn, but you know I\u2019ll find out anyway,\u201d he said.</p><p>Kinsey was happy to feel her temper rising. Anger, at least, pushed down her unwanted lust.</p> <p>\u201cHave fun with that,\u201d Kinsey snapped as she finally wrenched her arm from his grasp. She turned and quickly walked down the hallway, refusing to allow herself to turn back and look at him.</p><p>She gritted her teeth when she heard his chuckle following her.</p><p>Arrogant, self-serving, pompous man!</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cKatherine Anderson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m here.\u201d Katherine rose from her seat with grace, though an obvious tremble was evident. A doctor approached, his eyes focused on the large family gathered around Katherine.</p><p>Austin stood back from the crowd, his emotions too volatile for him to speak with anyone. Fear and anger struggled for a stronghold inside him. The news had to be good. Their family couldn\u2019t handle the tragedy of losing either his father or uncle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Weston. I operated on your husband.\u201d Total silence greeted his words. The family waited, afraid to even breathe.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I want to let you know Joseph is alive,\u201d he said. A single tear slipped down Katherine\u2019s cheek. As if in slow motion, Austin focused on it as it held on for an endless moment, before dripping from her chin, slowly falling to the floor. The rest of the family members released a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in critical condition and we\u2019re monitoring him in the I.C.U. I don\u2019t want to give you false hope. It doesn\u2019t look good right now. If it weren\u2019t for Nurse Shelton, I wouldn\u2019t be delivering good news at the moment.\u201d The doctor let his words settle in. Austin tensed, finally putting together what was going on with her and the angry doctor. She must\u2019ve defied his orders. \u201cYour husband had an Epidural Hematoma. In short form, there was swelling outside the brain tissue, and hemorrhages occurred within. Usually in these cases the patient has a lucid period, which Joseph had. Symptoms don\u2019t always present themselves, making it hard for an admitting doctor to know there\u2019s an emergency. In your husband\u2019s case, had he went home before collapsing, the injury would have most likely been fatal. We were able to get inside his head before it caused severe damage to the brain. However, once we were in, we found another problem.\u201d</p><p>Everyone waited, not wanting to interrupt. Dr. Weston paused before continuing. Austin knew the situation wasn\u2019t good. He also knew he needed to thank Kinsey.</p><p>\u201cOnce we got inside, we found a small mass. Your husband was in the first stages of brain cancer. We were able to remove it, getting it all out. Luckily, it was small, and there didn\u2019t seem to be any damage from surgery. Because of the severe trauma Joseph has suffered, though, he\u2019s in a coma now. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t tell you anything else at this point. The next seventy-two hours are critical. I do want to warn you that in cases like this, sometimes the patient never does wake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I please see my husband?\u201d Katherine asked. Her voice quiet, but Austin noted the strength underlying the pain she was feeling. He was once again impressed with his aunt.</p><p>\u201cYes, but only for a short visit. No more than two people can be in his room at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you, Mom,\u201d Lucas said, his arm locked around her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be here waiting,\u201d Amy said as she gave her mother-in-law a quick hug.</p><p>\u201cThank you, dear,\u201d Katherine replied before following a nurse through the double doors leading to the intensive care unit.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any information on my father, George Anderson?\u201d Austin asked as soon as Katherine was out of the room. He didn\u2019t want to add to her stress, but he hadn\u2019t heard anything yet.</p><p>\u201cYour father should be out of surgery soon and his doctor will be out to speak with you. I knew you\u2019d have questions, but I didn\u2019t want to interrupt the procedure. He was still holding on and from what the doctor\u2019s assistant said, his vitals were good. Once again, I don\u2019t want to give false hope or speak out of turn, but he was still alive when I came out,\u201d Dr. Weston answered.</p><p>Austin nearly sagged with relief. Bree\u2019s tears flowed as she heard the first news of her father since learning of the accident. Chad lifted her in his arms and carried her back to one of the chairs, sitting down to comfort her. Austin was grateful she wasn\u2019t alone. Chad would be a rock for her to lean on through all of this.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Trenton spoke up. They stood there silently for a moment, no one seeming to know what to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go for coffee,\u201d Cassie volunteered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help. I can\u2019t keep sitting here, feeling helpless,\u201d Jessica said. The two women walked from the room.</p><p>Austin waited for what seemed like hours before the doors opened again and another doctor looked around the room. When he spotted them, he made his way over.</p><p>\u201cTrenton Anderson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Trenton quickly stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cYour father, George, is out of surgery. He hit his head on the side of the door, causing minor swelling in the brain. It doesn\u2019t appear to be threatening at this time, but we always carefully monitor head injuries. He also sustained a broken leg, two broken ribs, and his lung was punctured. We\u2019ve been able to operate successfully, but we\u2019ve had to place him in a medically induced coma because the pain would be excruciating if he were awake. We\u2019ve been extra cautious, too, because of his recent heart attack. I understand that both your father and uncle are in here, and I wish I could give you more information, but the only thing I can tell you at this time is that he\u2019s stable. Of course the next twenty-four hours are critical. We\u2019ll monitor him closely to make sure he doesn\u2019t have any negative reactions from the surgery, or any further symptoms from the collision. As of now, his chances are better than fifty percent at this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we see him?\u201d Bree asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but he\u2019s in the I.C.U for the next twenty-four to forty-eight hours, so only two at a time. Please be quiet in the room, and only stay for fifteen minutes at a time. He needs to rest right now. That\u2019s the best medicine for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, doctor,\u201d Austin said as he stepped forward and shook the man\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Bree back first, then you and Max can go,\u201d Trenton said to Austin.</p><p>Austin and Max paced, neither of them saying a word as they waited their turn to see their father. The seconds ticked by, each one dragging. Finally, the door opened and a sniffling Bree ran into the arms of Chad. Trenton looked like he wasn\u2019t holding himself together well, either, but Austin gave him space, knowing his brother needed a few minutes to compose his expression.</p><p>He and Max quickly walked through the doors together. They didn\u2019t know what to expect, but when they entered their father\u2019s room and saw George lying in the bed with wires running from his body to different machines, Austin had to swallow the bile in his throat.</p><p>Austin knew accidents happened every day. He knew tragedy struck families, but losing his mother had been the hardest event of his life, and he just didn\u2019t know how they\u2019d get through the loss of another parent.</p><p>The two men made their way to the bed and Austin slumped in a chair and gently took his father\u2019s hand. He rested his forehead on their joined hands, and for the first time he could remember, offered a silent prayer.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s strong, brother. He\u2019ll make it through. So will Uncle Joseph,\u201d Max uttered in a whisper. That was what Austin needed to hear \u2013 what he had to believe.</p><p>\u201cYou have to wake up, Dad. We need you,\u201d Austin pled, feeling like a teenager again, needing his father\u2019s reassurance that everything would be okay.</p><p>They sat silently for the rest of their allotted time. When the nurse came to let them know their time was up, they slowly made their way back to the lobby.</p><p>Upon returning, Katherine was back, tears silently streaming down her cheeks. The next few days would be a test of their endurance, that was for sure.</p><p>\u201cMom, let\u2019s get you something to eat,\u201d Lucas said, but she only shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHe will recover and when he does, he\u2019s going to need us to be strong. They both will. It won\u2019t do dad or Uncle George any good for us to mourn them as if they aren\u2019t coming back. Please, let\u2019s have breakfast, then I\u2019m sure we can find out more information,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>Emily sat next to Katherine, offering a shoulder, doing her best to appear positive.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Katherine finally agreed. They made their way slowly down the maze of halls until they reached the cafeteria. Most of the food went untouched, but they were doing the best they could.</p><p>The day stretched without any changes on Joseph and George. All of them tried to agree that was a good thing, but still, the waiting... it was excruciating.</p><p>\u201cYou saved Joseph Anderson\u2019s life. This hospital is very grateful that you refused to back down, even though most people would have. I want to reassure you that the matter has been investigated and you weren\u2019t in the wrong. Normally, you never go over one of the doctors\u2019 heads, but this was an extreme case. Had you not had the Neuro Surgeon called, Joseph most likely wouldn\u2019t have made it through the night, let alone the past four,\u201d Kinsey\u2019s supervisor said as they sat in her office. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joseph and George had been at the hospital for a total of four days. She checked on them every chance she got, but she\u2019d been careful to avoid Austin. It hadn\u2019t been easy, but so far, so good. She\u2019d also been able to see Cassie often, and lend a shoulder for her grief filled friend.</p><p>With each passing day, the stress lifted a bit, though. Every time the men made it through another night, they each got stronger.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Kinsey mumbled.</p><p>\u201cGeorge Anderson is showing signs of improvement. At the family\u2019s request we\u2019ve moved him to a room where his brother can be placed with him. We\u2019re going to bring George out of his coma tonight. Joseph is stable now, enough to be moved. The family believes it will help the twin brothers heal faster, if they are next to each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d Kinsey replied. She didn\u2019t know why her supervisor was telling her this, though. She knew some of the news already, because Cassie had told her, but there was no need for her to tell her supervisor that.</p><p>\u201cYou look confused. I understand. We don\u2019t normally share this information with the staff, but the family has insisted on you being the charge nurse for Joseph and George, since you have experience in both the ED and ICU, and of course, since you saved Joseph\u2019s life. With the amount of money they\u2019ve provided this hospital, they can make a request for the moon and we\u2019re going to try our best to get it for them. Asking for you to be their charge nurse is an easy request to fill.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey felt both honored and yet terrified at the same time. What if something happened to either of the men while on her watch? She was confident in herself, knowing she was great at her job, but these weren\u2019t regular patients. Both men were loved by so many people. It was a huge weight on her chest to be the primary nurse in charge of their care.</p><p>Then, there was Austin. How could she possibly avoid him if she was caring for his father and uncle each day? She had no choice but to accept the offer, though.</p><p>\u201cJoseph and George will be your main priority during this time. You\u2019ll work twelve hour shifts, six days a week. I know you\u2019ve been asking for all the overtime you can get. Well, you\u2019ve now gotten it. The family knows you need to sleep, but they\u2019ve requested for you to stay nearby so if anything goes wrong, you can be on-call. They\u2019ve been very generous with supporting the extra funding to pay for the added expense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m honored,\u201d Kinsey finally replied.</p><p>\u201cYour shift starts tomorrow at seven. Go home, get some rest, and pack what you need. It\u2019s going to be a long week. I have a feeling this assignment won\u2019t be a short one. Although George is recovering well, Joseph...\u201d she trailed off. No one on staff liked to jinx a patient, even if the situation looked hopeless.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Kinsey said before she made her way from the room. She\u2019d just have to do the best she could for both of her patients and herself. Austin was just a guy, right? He didn\u2019t hold control over her. She could handle being around him in a professional environment. She wouldn\u2019t be affected by him. She didn\u2019t even like him.</p><p>As she gave herself a little pep talk, her stomach clenched. She knew she was lying to herself. She wanted to see him, to be near him. She just didn\u2019t want to want that.</p><p>A few hours later, Kinsey stood by as the doctors carefully removed his breathing tube, then weaned off the medicine to bring George out of his coma. As he slowly came to, his family crowded the room, worried looks on each of their faces.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Bree questioned as his eyes fluttered open.</p> <p>\u201cBree?\u201d he muttered, his voice raspy.</p><p>\u201cDad! Thank goodness,\u201d Bree cried as she pushed past a nurse and knelt beside her father\u2019s bed. The largest tears of gratitude, relief and thanks fell from her rounded doe eyes as a delighted smile turned up the corners of her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve been so worried. You have got to quit scaring me like that,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cJoseph?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right next to you, Dad. Look to your left. See, right there,\u201d she answered while pointing to his bed.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stable, Dad. He\u2019s doing really well. They got the problem fixed, but he\u2019s in a coma right now. I don\u2019t want you to worry. The hospital\u2019s taking excellent care of him. He\u2019s just worked too hard for too long, and this is his body\u2019s way of telling him he needs a nice long nap,\u201d Bree said.</p><p>George had a tear in his eye, but the corners of his mouth lifted at his daughter\u2019s positive attitude. He finally looked up, and smiled more when he saw that all of his family was there.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve missed you, Dad. I agree with Bree. You need to start taking better care of yourself,\u201d Trenton said as he stepped forward.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Aunt Katherine said there are no more joy rides for you two,\u201d Max added as he came and squeezed his father\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNot unless you want to face her wrath, that is,\u201d Austin added.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, George Anderson. You certainly won\u2019t be getting any more joy rides. I can\u2019t handle seeing you in a hospital bed twice in such a short amount of time,\u201d Katherine said as she sat in the chair next to his bed. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, my friend. Your brother is strong. Bree\u2019s right, he\u2019s simply catching up on some much needed rest. What I need from you is to not worry about him. I need you to get better, so you can help me bring Joseph back.\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s eyes filled and spilled over at Katherine\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou will not do that, George. I won\u2019t allow you to take any of the blame. It wasn\u2019t Joseph\u2019s or your fault. It was that disgusting man who made a conscious decision to drink too much, and then decide to get behind the wheel of a vehicle. Sadly, for his family, he won\u2019t be coming home. He was selfish and now his poor children have to bury their father. I am thanking God daily that you and Joseph are still with me. Now, I better not hear even one more apology from you,\u201d she scolded, looking him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, George. You know you\u2019ll always be one of my best friend\u2019s. For some reason, seeing you in the checkered hospital gown reminds me of when we were in our twenties, dancing all night and laughing until dawn. You must have had a button up shirt with a similar pattern. But enough of the past. We need to focus on now and getting you out of here. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, a small but genuine smile appearing.</p><p>\u201cGeorge!\u201d Esther cried as she walked into the room, her face lit up. \u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d she finished as she quickly moved to sit next to Katherine.</p><p>She and George stared into each other\u2019s eyes, before Esther seemed to realize everyone in the room was watching them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you talking,\u201d she said as she quickly sat back, looking uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d George whispered, looking at Esther, then his eyes roamed across the room, including everyone in his heartfelt appreciation.</p><p>Kinsey stepped outside the doors so they could speak privately. What a beautiful family they made.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>An entire week and he\u2019d been on his best behavior. In and out. Out and in. More in than out.</p><p>Torture!</p><p>Austin watched as Kinsey walked into the room for the fourth time that day, and felt his muscles tense. He\u2019d tried talking to her several times, but she was great at giving him her most professional smile before turning her back to him. He was getting sick of playing Mr. Nice Guy.</p><p>\u201cKinsey, I need to discuss a few things about my father with you. I haven\u2019t had a chance to eat yet so let\u2019s do it over lunch,\u201d Austin said, knowing he was putting her on the spot.</p><p>Her supervisor was in the room and he knew Kinsey couldn\u2019t refuse without looking bad. He wasn\u2019t stupid. He\u2019d timed his request well.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lunch break for another hour,\u201d she hedged, then went back to checking on George\u2019s vitals. She was smart, not giving him a refusal, but certainly dismissing him.</p><p>\u201cYou can go early if Mr. Anderson needs to discuss the patient with you,\u201d her boss offered. Austin gave Kinsey\u2019s boss his thousand-watt smile, feeling pretty smug when the older woman blushed.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Kinsey replied, but he could see she was seething.</p><p>Good, he thought. He liked her even more when her hackles were up. He shifted in his seat as his pants became a bit uncomfortable. His gaze never left her as she took her time finishing in the room.</p><p>Finally, with a glare in his direction, Kinsey exited the room, making him have to rush to catch up to her. She ignored him as they silently walked down the long hallway toward the cafeteria. Once inside, she took a tray and started grabbing food from the shelf. It didn\u2019t look like she was paying the least bit of attention to her choices. Seemed to him she was just trying to get the meal over with. Well, he\u2019d have to eat extra slow then, because they were going to have it out, one way or another. He could think of one thing they could do to relieve the tension between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so important we had to speak outside of the room?\u201d Kinsey asked as soon as they were seated. He watched as she stirred her coffee, repeatedly swirling the spoon around repeatedly until he placed his hand over hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as bad as you think. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019ve been trying to make me a villain since our incredible night together. You were right there with me, and if I do recall correctly, quite satisfied,\u201d Austin said, ignoring her question.</p><p>Kinsey gasped as she tried to pull her hand from his. He gripped it tighter. She finally let go of the spoon and allowed their joined fingers to rest on the table. Finally, she looked up and met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook, Austin, I understand how you may think I\u2019m someone that I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t do one night stands. I don\u2019t have affairs. I have a career to think about, a great family, and believe it or not, a reputation to uphold. I think it's best if you get over this idea you have of me, so we can both go on our merry ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but that doesn\u2019t work for me. First of all, I\u2019ve never accused you of being the \u2018one-night-stand\u2019 kind of girl. Secondly, I wasn\u2019t asking you for a cheap affair. And thirdly, I\u2019m not exactly chopped liver. My family is respected in this community, and contrary to what you might think, I care about my reputation as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah!\u201d</p><p>Her childish outburst made Austin grin. He looked at her as he fought the laughter wanting to spill out. She was the most intriguing woman he\u2019d ever had the pleasure of meeting. He couldn\u2019t seem to stop chasing her. Maybe that was why he was so intrigued. He was usually the one being chased. It was nice to feel like a man \u2013 to hunt his prey. He felt like jumping on the table and pounding his chest. His grin grew bigger.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Kinsey\u2019s lips twitched as she looked at him. Maybe she was realizing how bull-headed she was acting.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I can concede that you\u2019re not the devil. I\u2019m still not interested in dating you, though.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSince we\u2019re around each other night and day, how about we at least be friends? After all, your best friend is married to my brother. We\u2019re going to see each other often,\u201d he offered.</p><p>She had no way of knowing his legs were crossed. He had much bigger plans with Kinsey than just being friends. He had a few ideas about some of the empty hospital rooms. Damn, his body was in a state of half-arousal whenever she was in his vicinity.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes and he knew she wasn\u2019t buying it, but what was she going to say? If she refused, she was admitting that he affected her. If she accepted, she\u2019d have to fight herself and him. He knew he\u2019d put her on the spot, and he could practically read the indecision on her face. He relaxed as he felt the power shift back into his favor.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call us friends, but I can agree to be civil,\u201d she finally said. He grinned, satisfaction radiating off him when her cheeks pinkened.</p> <p>He\u2019d give anything to just throw her over his shoulder and cart her off to the nearest broom closet. Oh, the possibilities of the seemingly endless hospital.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s either we\u2019re friends, or... I\u2019ll just have to prove to you how great a friend I can be. That could take a while \u2013 a really long time,\u201d he threatened with the same confident smile in place.</p><p>He watched as her eyes widened. She knew what he intended, and she wanted him. She just didn\u2019t want to admit to it. He had to get her away from crowded rooms. Her on-call room didn\u2019t sound too bad at that moment.</p><p>\u201cI have to get back to work,\u201d she said as she quickly stood from the table. She hadn\u2019t even touched her food. He knew the amount of hours she was working and he didn\u2019t want her missing meals because of him.</p><p>He stood and placed his hands on her shoulders, bringing her body to within a few inches of his own. He leaned his head down, his breath brushing across her face, causing the loose strands of her fallen hair to flutter at the corners of her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cFinish your meal, Kinsey. I\u2019ll back off... for now.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away and dropped to her seat. It seemed he\u2019d taken the words right out of her mouth. He liked that as well. He sat and began eating his meal while she slowly picked up a juicy piece of watermelon.</p><p>She slid it into her mouth and softly bit down, and he barely managed to stop himself from groaning. The anticipation was hell on his body, but he had a feeling the build-up would be worth it when they finally did make it to a bed. Heck, it could be a cave for all he cared, just as long as he could sink deep inside her.</p><p>A few minutes of strained silence went by as sweat beaded on his brow, and he forced food into his mouth. He didn\u2019t know how her meal tasted, but he could\u2019ve been eating cardboard for all the enjoyment he was getting out of his. He was satisfied, though, when he noticed that she finished her entire fruit salad. She was too skinny \u2013 smaller than when they\u2019d been together. She was beautiful no matter what, but she could stand to put on ten pounds.</p><p>That thought led him to picturing her with a rounded belly, her breasts straining against a tight T-shirt as her body ripened. Before he could stop it, a low groan escaped and she looked up, making eye-contact. Her eyes dilated at what he was sure was unadulterated lust shining from his own.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d give a million dollars for just five minutes alone with her. Okay... maybe more like an hour. Her body deserved to be worshiped.</p> <p>After a few more minutes of strained silence, he cleared his throat. He really did want to talk to her about his father.</p><p>\u201cMy dad will be ready to leave the hospital soon. He\u2019s agreed to stay with Katherine at the main house to support her. She\u2019s acting strong, but we all see the massive amount of strain this is placing on her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been concerned about Katherine, too. I can\u2019t begin to imagine how she feels. I\u2019m glad your father is doing well, at least. I\u2019m sure that helps her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that, Kinsey. The point of all this is that Uncle Joseph will need to stay here longer, which means he still needs round the clock care. If his situation hasn\u2019t changed in a couple weeks, we\u2019ll look at alternatives, such as bringing him home, where he\u2019d still need full care. My aunt will be here most of the time, and so will the rest of us. It makes no difference if it\u2019s my dad, or Uncle Joseph. We take care of each other.\u201d</p><p>He could see Kinsey was confused by where the conversation was leading. He could\u2019ve just let her supervisor tell her, but then he couldn\u2019t see her reaction.</p><p>\u201cIf we take Uncle Joseph home, we\u2019ve requested for you to remain his nurse.\u201d</p><p>He waited as he let his words sink in. She didn\u2019t disappoint him when it clicked. He knew she felt safer around him in the hospital. He could see she was worried about her own ability to resist him if they were in a quiet house together \u2013 night and day.</p><p>\u201cI... I\u2019d have to talk to my supervisor. I don\u2019t think the hospital can afford to let me go,\u201d she stuttered.</p> <p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a permanent placement. My uncle will recover,\u201d he stated with confidence.</p><p>\u201cI really do need to get back now,\u201d she said as she quickly stood as if afraid he was going to stop her again. He didn\u2019t say another word \u2013 just let her walk away.</p><p>He watched as she dropped off her tray and practically ran from the room. He smiled as he sat back. She could try to run...</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>Kinsey turned the corner outside of the cafeteria, then started jogging. She needed fresh air \u2013 and she needed it now!</p><p>Her entire body felt as if it was on fire. How did the man work her up so quickly with so few words. There was no way she could be a personal nurse for Joseph. Normally, she\u2019d love to take the job. It was ideal, and would practically ensure her a lifetime job with the hospital, considering how much money the Anderson\u2019s donated, and the influence they had, but thinking of those long, silent nights with Austin always there...</p><p>She knew he\u2019d be there \u2013 all the time.</p><p>A shudder racked her body as she pushed through a side exit and took in a deep breath of lilac scented air. The cool spring breeze of the late morning was just what she needed in her lungs. She took several breaths as her thoughts kept jumping over one another in her head.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t this wanton woman. She had plans, goals. Heck, she even had a ten year plan all typed up, double spaced, Times New Roman font, sitting on her desk at home.</p><p>She absolutely didn\u2019t get fuzzy headed, or weak in the knees, over a man, especially an arrogant, self-satisfied, amazingly great lover of a man.</p><p>Stop it!</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t think of Austin and lover in the same sentence. She had to pull herself together and do her job. She\u2019d simply tell her boss, thank you, but no thank you.</p><p>Yeah right. That conversation was going to go real well.</p><p>After about ten minutes, Kinsey calmed down enough to head back inside. She didn\u2019t care if she caught slack, she was taking a few minutes to go to her on-call room and lay down. She needed to get her head to stop spinning before she faced Austin again.</p><p>She walked inside, leaving the lights off, and sighing as she closed her eyes against the pitch blackness of the space that was no bigger than an average closet. Her pager went off before she could relax too much, and she reluctantly sat up, knowing her hiding time was over.</p><p>As she left the room, she had to remind herself that she was a professional. She was being paid twice her normal salary, and she wasn\u2019t going to let a man stand in the way of her career. She\u2019d just have to develop thicker skin and continue to ward him off. Eventually, he\u2019d grow bored with his game of chase. He had to, she reassured herself.</p><p>With her shoulders back, she entered the Anderson room, then let out a sigh of relief when she saw that Austin wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>As the day wore on and she noticed herself checking the door often, she couldn\u2019t decide if she was relieved or disappointed when he didn\u2019t return. She may need a prescription for Valium before the day was out, let alone the month.</p><p>\u201cI swear I\u2019m going to walk out the door if you don\u2019t pull yourself together,\u201d Austin\u2019s secretary, Margie, said as she glared at him across his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Austin glanced up at his highly irritated employee.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been walking around here like a bear with a thorn in his paw, snapping at everyone, and acting like a horse\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargie,\u201d he said with shock. She\u2019d worked for him for ten years and was like a member of the family. She\u2019d never been afraid to speak her mind, but she\u2019d never been quite as verbal before.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you Margie me. I\u2019m not some new kid, fresh out of college, and I refuse to put up with your bad behavior. You can either talk to me about it, or I can take the rest of the afternoon off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cWell then, I guess it\u2019s option two. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d she said as she turned to leave the room.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave. We have a lot of work to get done,\u201d Austin insisted, rising from his seat.</p><p>Margie turned and stared him down with her brow raised. She was waiting.</p><p>With a sigh, he resumed his seat. He knew he was being a little grumpier than usual, but he hadn\u2019t thought it was to the point of employees walking out the door.</p><p>He was just so frustrated. He\u2019d been avoiding the hospital for a week, thinking that maybe a bit of distance would help his hormone ravaged body.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>Nothing was.</p><p>Margie stood in front of him with her glasses hanging halfway down her nose, her gray eyes glaring at him over the top of the gold rims. She had one hand on her hip, and her toe was tapping. He felt the corners of his mouth rise, which wasn\u2019t a smart move on his part.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed further and she blew her breath out in frustration through her bright pink lipstick. She really was amusing when she was in a snit. He noticed this week she had bright pink streaks running through her short white hair. She was close to sixty, but she\u2019d once told him that age was nothing but a number. She said she was a long way from being dead, and she\u2019d dress and do what she liked.</p><p>It was one of the things he loved about her. She brought humor, love and loyalty to the office. Plus, she was a genius. He had no doubt he\u2019d crumble without her. If she needed him to talk, he\u2019d dang well talk, cause his office would fall down around him if she staged a walkout.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just been a lot going on... My father, Uncle Joseph...\u201d he trailed off. He knew from her narrowed eyes that she wasn\u2019t buying it.</p><p>\u201cWe both know that\u2019s bull. Yes, you\u2019ve been concerned about your family, but this has to do with something else,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just that... I\u2019m dealing with a personal problem,\u201d he hedged. He really didn\u2019t want to admit to dating issues.</p><p>\u201cAh, now we\u2019re getting somewhere. What\u2019s her name? Did one of your Barbie dolls get a blister on her foot from her five inch heels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargie...\u201d He blew out a frustrated breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Margie suddenly grinned, and he had to fight the damn blush that wanted to creep into his cheeks. She was far too smart to be working for him. She should be running for president. He saw the knowing look come into her eyes, and he felt his humiliation was complete.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness. Did a girl actually tell you no for the first time. One did, didn\u2019t she? Ha, that\u2019s hilarious. Welcome to the real world, Austin Anderson,\u201d she mocked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what happened,\u201d he practically shouted.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, it is. You\u2019re hooked on a girl and she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you, and you just don\u2019t know how to deal with that. It\u2019s about time. She may just be a keeper if she\u2019s that smart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t saying no when I met her,\u201d Austin snapped. He immediately regretted his words when Margie\u2019s eyes narrowed again. He knew a well-deserved scolding was coming.</p><p>\u201cAustin Jeffrey Anderson! That was unacceptable to say. It sounds like you\u2019ve finally met a real woman, and you\u2019re doing her an injustice by demeaning her that way. Don\u2019t you dare let your pride run away with your mouth. I\u2019m going to have to meet this woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I just meant that we hit it off in the beginning. Then she got scared, or something, and went running for the hills. I\u2019ve been trying to talk to her for months, and now she just... Well, hell, I don\u2019t know what she thinks or doesn\u2019t think. I know she wants me. The air practically sizzles when we\u2019re within a few feet of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019d better step up to the plate and figure it out, because I already like this woman,\u201d Margie said in a softer tone. He\u2019d been forgiven for his outburst.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep working on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we please get some work done, now?\u201d he asked. He found it ironic he was asking his employee if they could work.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll go ahead and stay. The reason I came in here in the first place is there\u2019s a problem at the shipping yard. Some items have come up missing, and then this morning a fight broke out,\u201d she said, immediately resuming her professional tone.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s handling it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean\u2019s in charge, but he called a few minutes ago, ready to explode. It seems Jack is causing trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap, I should\u2019ve known,\u201d Austin grumbled.</p> <p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Margie agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head down there right away.\u201d</p><p>Margie left and Austin stood up. He was almost grateful for the problem. At least it got his mind off his failing personal life.</p><p>He drove to the warehouse, blaring his music to try and drown out his own thoughts. It didn\u2019t seem to be working, as nothing else was, either.</p><p>He was happy when he stepped inside and found his brother, Trenton, already speaking to their supervisor, Dean.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, you look like crap, little brother,\u201d Trenton said as he walked up.</p><p>\u201cThanks, and how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than you, apparently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat information do you have for me, Dean?\u201d Austin asked. He decided the best defense was to just ignore Trenton. Maybe his brother would take the hint and let the subject drop.</p><p>\u201cWe had almost ten-thousand dollars\u2019 worth of shipments come up missing. It wasn\u2019t all in one load, but through four different vendors. I have my staff checking orders over the past six months, because apparently the person was smart. They\u2019re taking a few items out of each order and I don\u2019t think many of our clients have noticed. They must\u2019ve gotten greedy, though, because they took enough out this time that we had complaints come in,\u201d Dean said, his eyes blazing as he spoke.</p><p>Dean had worked for them for twenty years. Austin had no doubt he\u2019d be on top of the situation until it was solved.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack got into it with a couple of other guys. Everyone has been on edge since we found out about the stolen goods, and someone made a comment that Jack didn\u2019t appreciate, I guess. He\u2019s being tight lipped right now. I sent the three men home for the day. That\u2019s why I called you. I don\u2019t want to throw out accusations...\u201d he trailed off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just us, Dean, and we trust you. Who do you suspect?\u201d Trenton quickly asked.</p><p>\u201cWell... I really don\u2019t have any evidence at this point, but things are pointing toward Jack,\u201d he said with hesitancy.</p><p>Dean was a good man. He didn\u2019t want to falsely accuse anyone without proof. He knew each of the men who worked there, depended on their paychecks to support their families. He didn\u2019t want to be responsible for an innocent man getting fired.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do a thorough investigation before we throw out any hard-core accusations. I have a feeling you\u2019re right, though. I\u2019ve had my doubts about him the past year. Too many mistakes, too many accusations from the men. He\u2019s been close to losing his job for a while now, anyway,\u201d Austin said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the office and start going through the files,\u201d Trenton said. They began walking through the plant together, getting stopped several times as employees asked them questions.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now spill. What\u2019s eating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, Trenton, you\u2019re in a mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mood isn\u2019t the problem. What\u2019s causing the circles under your eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not going to lay off, so you may as well tell me,\u201d Trenton insisted.</p><p>Austin let out a long-suffering sigh. He loved his family, but sometimes they were a royal pain in the ass.</p><p>\u201cKinsey,\u201d he finally said. His brother busted up laughing as they entered the small office. Austin felt like slugging him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Austin. I needed that. With all this stress in my life, I can certainly count on you to lighten the mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I could help,\u201d Austin snarled.</p><p>\u201cOkay, if brotherly love time is over, we have work to do,\u201d Dean said, but Austin noticed the corners of his lips twitching. It looked like his love life, or lack thereof, was great entertainment for all the people around him.</p><p>It was times like this when he missed his mother the most. He could go sit with her and visit, let his worries wash away, and she wouldn\u2019t interrogate him, or mock. She\u2019d just be the person she always was.</p><p>Loving and understanding.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cJoseph, I know you can hear me deep down inside. You deserve to catch up on your sleep, so you go ahead and rest as long as you need to. Just as long as you remember to come back to me,\u201d Katherine whispered as she lay next to him in his hospital bed.</p><p>The staff had long ago given up on trying to keep her from him. They\u2019d just adjusted a few of his monitors so she wouldn\u2019t get snagged on anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve certainly earned some rest. You\u2019re supposed to be retired, but you can\u2019t keep yourself from butting into our sons business. I may not have been saying anything to you these last few years, but I know all about you meddling in our kids\u2019 lives. I haven\u2019t complained too much because I like the end results. How could I not? I now have three beautiful daughters, along with the world\u2019s greatest grandchildren. Plus, we now have George back home and our family continues to grow. I wouldn\u2019t be admitting any of this to you if you were awake, but I\u2019ve never been happier in my life,\u201d Katherine continued speaking. Her voice caught with her last sentence as tears slipped down her face.</p><p>Seeing her larger-than-life husband lying so still in the sterile bed caused a bigger ache each day he didn\u2019t wake up. The doctors kept telling her the same thing \u2013 only time will tell.</p><p>If she heard that one more time, she may forget all about her southern roots of being raised a lady, and accidentally slap one of them.</p><p>She missed her husband.</p><p>She missed her best friend.</p><p>Another tear slowly fell as she gently stroked his face.</p><p>So handsome.</p><p>Even in his sixties, he was stunning, the most beautiful man she\u2019d ever known. Her mind drifted as she remembered those early days and how close she\u2019d come to walking away from him.</p><p>\u201cMom, are you okay?\u201d Lucas asked as he stepped into the room. His brows were furrowed in worry. She didn\u2019t want to upset the kids. She normally made sure to put on a positive mask so they didn\u2019t stop living their lives. Joseph wouldn\u2019t want that.</p><p>Everything he did was for his children. He wanted them happy and successful, not brooding or worrying about him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine, Lucas. I was just speaking to your father about the day we met,\u201d she answered as she sat up slowly. It took her a few moments longer these days to get to her feet. Lucas rushed over to help her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard about how you met. Would you tell us about it?\u201d Amy shyly asked.</p><p>\u201cBless your heart, Amy, but that\u2019s a long story,\u201d Katherine said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear, too,\u201d Jessica said as she stepped inside the room with Alex.</p><p>\u201cAgreed. I think it\u2019s the perfect time to learn about the beginning of a great love story,\u201d Emily added as she walked inside on Mark\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI guess if you all insist...\u201d Katherine hedged.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d was chorused from everyone in the room.</p><p>\u201cWell then, you\u2019d better pull up a chair. This may take a while,\u201d Katherine said with a fond smile of remembered times.</p><p>Her beautiful sons, and their wives, quickly sat down and then looked expectantly at her. She gazed at the couples who were still so in love with each other. Joseph had chosen well for his children.</p><p>\u201cI fell in love with your father instantly,\u201d she began.</p><p>The women sighed at what they expected to be a sweet romance. She couldn\u2019t wait to shock them. Where did her boys think they\u2019d learned to be such rakish rogues? She loved them all, in spite of their faults, not because of them.</p><p>\u201cI fell in love with Joseph immediately. I was only eighteen years old the first time I met him. We were at a party, and he danced the whole night with me. I felt like the most special girl in the room. He had eyes only for me, which surprised me because he was so dang handsome. His glittering blue eyes, short dark hair, and stunning smile, combined with the custom made suit he was wearing, made him look like a prince. Every girl in the room wanted to dance with him, but I was the one he chose. I felt like a princess as he spun me in circles across the floor,\u201d she said.</p><p>Katherine could practically hear the music playing as she remembered how that night had started.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never been in love before \u2013 but I fell that night, and I fell hard. We were inseparable for the next month. He showed up at my door with flowers practically every day, and it didn\u2019t take me long to fall under his spell. When he kissed me, it was always magical, it still is today. I wanted to give him everything \u2013 including my innocence...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Mark said with shock, his eyes rounded.</p><p>\u201cYou just hush up and let your mother tell her story,\u201d Emily scolded her husband. She actually found it pretty endearing that he was actually blushing.</p><p>Katherine found it quite amusing shocking her son. How did he think he\u2019d come to life. She quietly chuckled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo on, please, Mom,\u201d Jessica urged. The women were all leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cBoys, you may cover your ears. As I was saying, we were inseparable, so it didn\u2019t take him long to charm me. We would kiss forever while lying beneath the starlit sky. I was in heaven. Another month passed and I was waiting for him to propose. I was so in love with him, and he professed his love for me each day. I knew we\u2019d be married, but I didn\u2019t want to bring it up. I wanted a romantic proposal. After all, our entire relationship had been nothing but romance.\u201d</p><p>Katherine stopped for a moment as she took a deep breath. Her eyes glazed over as a furrow creased her brow.</p><p>Oh, the wasted years...</p> <p>\u201cThen, I overheard Joseph and George talking one night, and stood back to eavesdrop. I thought that maybe Joseph would drop a hint of how he was planning to propose. Instead, I ended up getting my heart shattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Alex interrupted, looking confused.</p><p>\u201cThen listen,\u201d Katherine gently scolded. He sat back and pretended to zip his lips.</p><p>\u201cQuit interrupting,\u201d Jessica quietly scolded Alex.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled.</p> <p>\u201cGeorge was angrily yelling at Joseph, saying that he really went all out to win a bet. The longer I listened, the more I wished I hadn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t take me long to figure out that Joseph went after me that night because, apparently, several people had whispered about me, saying I was too prudish, and couldn\u2019t be conquered. George bet Joseph a thousand dollars he couldn\u2019t get a kiss by the end of the night. What made it hurt all the more was that George had become my best friend. When I wasn\u2019t with Joseph, I was with George.\u201d</p><p>Her daughters-in-law gasped as her sons looked at her with bulging eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrible,\u201d Emily said, looking on the verge of tears.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes it was, dear. I ran away before I could hear anything further. My heart was broken and I never wanted to see Joseph Anderson again. He called several times over the next few days, and I had my mother tell him I was sick. He still persisted, so sadly, I made up a horrid lie, one that I knew would make him leave. I just couldn\u2019t face him. I figured if I was the one who walked away, then I could somehow gain my pride back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Mark tried to interrupt this time, but stopped when Katherine gave him her mother\u2019s look.</p><p>\u201cI told him I\u2019d met another man, we were in love, and though I\u2019d had fun with him, it was over. I then held my head high as I walked away. He never tried to stop me. I shocked him to the point that he probably stood there for a long time afterward.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to be interrupted, but you have to get to the part where you got back together,\u201d Lucas practically shouted. Katherine smiled at her most impatient child. Always wanted the bottom line, her son. He was so very much like his father.</p><p>\u201cFive years passed before I saw him again...\u201d</p><p>Katherine closed her eyes, her memory taking her back in time. She remembered those days like it was yesterday. When Joseph and she had finally figured everything out, he\u2019d told her the whole story, from beginning to end...</p><p>His grandfather had made a mess of things. Royally! Joseph sat back as the jet circled the Seattle airport.</p><p>He was coming home.</p><p>His mind should\u2019ve certainly been on his family\u2019s corporation, who\u2019d be elected to C.E.O. It couldn\u2019t be his horrible uncle. When his father had called him, telling him everything his grandfather had built was about to be destroyed, Joseph knew that there was no question he\u2019d come home.</p><p>He loved his father. He adored his grandfather \u2013 may he rest in peace. He hated his uncle. The man had venom running through his veins, and he had to be stopped...</p><p>Joseph didn\u2019t know if he could save the corporation, but he\u2019d fight to the death for what his grandfather had built and what his father had worked hard to maintain.</p> <p>The loss of his grandfather sent the stocks plummeting, people running scared since they didn\u2019t know which Anderson would take over.</p><p>Joseph\u2019s father, Milton, was a kind man, a caring person, but he wasn\u2019t the type of man who wanted to head a corporation. He didn\u2019t have the shark inside that was needed.</p><p>Joseph, however, did.</p><p>Since his grandfather\u2019s death, only a month ago, his uncle Neilson had been gunning for the C.E.O spot. He wanted one thing, and that was to beat out his brother, Milton, Joseph\u2019s father.</p><p>The two were twins, but about as different as any twins could be. Inside and out. Milton was kind and tried to help everyone, where Neilson was greedy and thought of no other than himself. He was the epitome of evil, and he absolutely couldn\u2019t get his greedy hands on the corporation.</p><p>Too many jobs would be lost. Too much damage left in his wake, and he wouldn\u2019t care. He may care, but only to laugh as he squashed the little people beneath his ten-thousand dollar loafers.</p><p>The light flashed on for him to fasten his seatbelt, so he quickly did as he looked out his window at the gloomy Seattle evening. His lips tilted up at the corners.</p><p>Katherine.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her, even after five years. He\u2019d been head over heels in love with her. No one before \u2013 and certainly no one after \u2013 had come close to Katherine. She\u2019d stomped all over him, and then walked away without a second thought.</p><p>He was determined to get her out of his system. He had to see her again. His lips tilted up more. She was working for the corporation, a member of the board. She held one of the votes on who would take over as CEO. His little innocent Katherine had changed greatly since the first time he\u2019d met her.</p><p>Of course, she hadn\u2019t really been the innocent little thing he\u2019d thought she was during that first dance. She\u2019d taken his breath away for two months. Her innocence - intoxicating. How he\u2019d wanted to take her, claim her \u2013 possess her. But he\u2019d waited...</p><p>His stomach knotted as the jet started making its final descent into the Seattle Airport. He wasn\u2019t waiting any longer.</p><p>\u201cCan I take that for you,\u201d the flight attendant asked, irritating him.</p><p>He wordlessly handed her the glass. She gave him a wink before she turned to walk to the front of the aircraft with his empty cup.</p><p>She\u2019d flirted with him the entire flight, making it more than clear he could take her home for the night. He sighed in frustration. As usual, he just wasn\u2019t interested.</p><p>As the jet touched down, then began its taxi to the gate, Joseph\u2019s anticipation grew.</p><p>Soon he\u2019d see Katherine. Soon, she\u2019d be in his arms. Then, he\u2019d finally purge her from his system...</p><p>\u201cHow many times do we have to go over this? Neilson has been practically running this company for the past ten years. Benjamin was a great man. He started the corporation, but he\u2019s been sick a long time. Milton just isn\u2019t capable of keeping us on top.\u201d</p><p>Katherine felt a pounding headache coming on. She hated these meetings. She hated the politics involved. All she wanted was a hot shower and ten hours of uninterrupted sleep. She knew one of those things could happen, not the other.</p><p>She never managed to get more than five hours a night before her phone was ringing with one emergency after the other. Life had been chaotic since Benjamin\u2019s death. She feared it would only get worse before the event was over.</p><p>\u201cThe worst thing we can do is make a rushed decision. This situation needs to be handled delicately. The investors are already scared \u2013 if we rush into anything, the corporation could come tumbling down around us,\u201d Katherine scolded.</p><p>One of the other board members sent a glare her way. He was from the old-boys club, where he didn\u2019t think women should sit on the board of directors. She\u2019d always despised him. Her dream hadn\u2019t been to sit in endless meetings, but life had turned out that way. If she could deal with it, he certainly could.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to work for Joseph\u2019s family, but during her time with him, she\u2019d formed a real bond with his father, Milton. When Joseph left, Milton had practically begged her to take a job at the main offices. It hadn\u2019t taken her long to earn her stripes, so to speak, and quickly rise to the top.</p><p>She smiled fondly, remembering Benjamin. He\u2019d been a good man. At least she\u2019d had the last five years with him. She despised Neilson. She found him the slimiest of snakes, but she had to keep that opinion to herself. After all, her job was to remain objective, not to take sides. The only side she could be on, was the side that benefited the corporation in the most positive way.</p><p>\u201cOn the other hand, we don\u2019t want to take too long and make the investors think we\u2019re incompetent. They need to know we can make a decision,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have more faith if we do a thorough job,\u201d she countered.</p><p>They argued back and forth for a while longer before the meeting broke up, agreeing to reconvene in three days. They each had their own investigating to do.</p><p>Katherine walked to her office and sank into her chair, her head falling forward. It had been another long day and that shower was sounding better with each passing hour.</p><p>Her thoughts turned to Joseph, as they often did. She knew there was a chance he\u2019d come home during the negotiations, and she needed to be prepared.</p><p>Five years, it\u2019s been five years. You can do this, she told herself.</p><p>He\u2019d moved to New York, where he\u2019d stayed for five years. He\u2019d been very successful in the big apple, even without his family\u2019s financial backing, which he\u2019d refused. She hoped, for her sanity\u2019s sake, he stayed there.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe how much she still missed him, how he still invaded her dreams nightly. No other man she\u2019d met over the years compared to him, and she feared that\u2019s how it would always be.</p><p>He was larger than life, so it stood to reason that every other man would get lost in his shadow.</p><p>Katherine was stewing as she threw on her coat. Joseph was ancient history \u2013 gone. Out of her life. Kaput. She wasn\u2019t going to let him control her emotions. She was a big girl now, no longer the innocent eighteen year old with stars in her eyes.</p><p>If only he hadn\u2019t been so... so... No! She wasn\u2019t going there. Her mind betrayed her, though. He\u2019d been so... good.</p><p>Tender.</p><p>Kind.</p><p>Passionate.</p><p>Enough!</p><p>Katherine gathered her purse as she continued to berate herself. How did she expect others to listen to her if she wouldn\u2019t even listen to herself?</p><p>She walked from the office, grateful she didn\u2019t run into any of the other board members on the way out. She was fried for the day, and done talking, certainly done putting on her professional mask.</p><p>She grabbed a taxi and made her way the short distance across the city to her apartment. As she stepped inside and shut the door, she leaned against the solid wood and let out a relieved sigh.</p><p>Home at last.</p><p>She felt the day\u2019s tension begin melting from her body as she tossed her purse on the couch and made her way to the bathroom, discarding clothes along the way.</p><p>She was naturally a clean person, but she tended to let clutter build up by Friday. Then on Saturday\u2019s she\u2019d clean the apartment spotless, only to let the process start all over again come Monday morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Katherine stepped under the pulsing water, the last of her strain washed down the drain.

She wasn\u2019t up for visitors. She wanted nothing more than to eat her dinner while getting lost in some comedy on television before falling into a deep sleep.</p><p>She thought about ignoring the person, but when the door chimed again, she knew she had to answer. It may be one of her neighbors who\u2019d spotted her coming in. If she didn\u2019t answer, they\u2019d know she was purposefully ignoring them.</p> <p>She slowly made her way to the front door, gritting her teeth when the bell went off for a third time.</p><p>\u201cHave some patience,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>She yanked the door open, really hoping her face didn\u2019t show her irritation at being interrupted.</p><p>She was ready to say hello when her good start to the weekend, instantly crumbled.</p><p>She was left speechless as she looked across the threshold at the one person she\u2019d been hoping to avoid at all costs.</p> <p>Joseph...</p><p>His arrogant face took in her short robe, slightly gaping open at her neck, then slid down to her bare legs, before he leisurely assessed her flushed face.</p><p>His arms were framed in the doorway, preventing her from slamming the door shut in his face. He smiled like a panther would just before pouncing.</p><p>\u201cI have a question for you that couldn\u2019t wait until tomorrow,\u201d he said as if they had spoken yesterday instead of five years previously.</p><p>She was sure her face registered shock, because his grin grew wider as he continued looking deep within her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid the man you cheated on me with make you cry out the way I did with nothing more than a kiss?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe did not say that!\u201d Emily gasped.</p><p>Katherine blinked as she looked around the room full of people, feeling like she was coming out of a trance. She\u2019d forgotten she was even telling a story. For those few minutes, she\u2019d been back at that day. The day Joseph returned to her.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, he did,\u201d Katherine said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI really hope you slapped him,\u201d Amy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened next...\u201d Katherine began before a monitor alarmed and everyone went silent, fear written on their faces. Several nurses ran into the room, including Kinsey, and began pushing buttons, before the noise stopped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, everyone. One of his wires just came loose,\u201d Kinsey quickly assured them.</p><p>\u201cThank you, dear,\u201d Katherine said as she bent down and kissed Joseph on the forehead.</p><p>She finally looked around and noticed Bree and Austin had joined them. She\u2019d been so focused on her past, she hadn\u2019t noticed her niece and nephew step inside.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to continue, Aunt Katherine?\u201d Bree eagerly asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you more tomorrow. I\u2019m tired right now, sweetie,\u201d Katherine replied. \u201cCan you give me a ride to the house, Lucas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Lucas placed her arm through his and she leaned on her son as he led her from the hospital. She hated to leave Joseph, even for a few hours, but she needed to clean up and gather more supplies. She knew, though, that she\u2019d end up back at the hospital to spend the rest of the night beside her husband. She\u2019d slept beside him too many years to do it alone now.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cAre you ashamed of me, Esther Lyon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s simply absurd, George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you acting like a vampire and only visiting me in the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why, George. We agreed we wouldn\u2019t say anything just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve changed my mind, woman. I love you, and I don\u2019t care who knows. If this accident taught me anything, it\u2019s that we shouldn\u2019t waste time,\u201d George said in a huff.</p><p>\u201cAre you snapping at me?\u201d Esther asked with her sternest expression plastered on her face.</p><p>\u201cThat I am,\u201d George said, acting just as stubborn.</p><p>\u201cYou know I love you, too, George,\u201d she started, but quickly covered his mouth when he was about to say something. \u201cBut... this isn\u2019t the right time. Joseph is still in a coma, the kids are all upset, and if I\u2019m not mistaken, there are possible wedding bells in the future for your youngest son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my family means the world to me, Esther, but you\u2019re my family now, too. I want you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were just in a horrible accident a few weeks ago. You\u2019re finally getting out of the hospital in a couple days, and you\u2019re flying high on pain medication. On top of all that, your twin brother, who you love very much, is in a coma. People make mistakes when they\u2019re dealing with one of these events, let alone all of them. I refuse to marry you because you\u2019re feeling like time is running out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved you last month, last week, and yesterday. I\u2019ll continue to love you today, tomorrow, and fifty years from now,\u201d he said, his voice growing thick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that if we\u2019re still here in fifty years,\u201d she replied with a watery smile.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d he asked with hope.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. You get some rest. I\u2019m coming in this afternoon, and I\u2019m warning you now that if you give anything away, you won\u2019t be getting any of my sweet apple pie when you get home,\u201d she threatened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll behave, but I can\u2019t guarantee for how long,\u201d he pouted.</p><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s long enough for us to get you safely home.\u201d</p><p>Esther bent down and gently kissed George. With his good arm, he pulled her close and deepened the chaste kiss she\u2019d started. She finally pulled back, her cheeks flushed and her eyes sparkling.</p><p>\u201cGeorge Anderson, you make me feel like a twenty-one year old girl again,\u201d Esther said with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you only feel that way. I wouldn\u2019t take a single day of your life away. Your years have added a beauty only time can give. I\u2019ll get you to marry me, Esther, and soon.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing further as she slipped out the door. Kinsey quickly jumped into the next room so Esther wouldn\u2019t see her. Esther had what seemed to be a permanent grin on her face. Kinsey couldn\u2019t wait to see Cassie and tell her what she\u2019d overheard.</p><p>Kinsey sighed as she stepped outside and was instantly and irritatingly soaked. You\u2019d think she\u2019d be used to the Seattle rain by now. But she hated getting drenched, always shivering as she waited for the \u2018consistently late\u2019 bus.</p><p>No one else was standing with her as she did her best to stay dry. She was looking at the ground when she heard a car horn. She ignored it until it beeped again. When she looked up, her eyes locked with Austin\u2019s. She sent him a miserable glare.</p><p>\u201cGet in. I\u2019ll give you a ride,\u201d he hollered.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d she answered before turning away and looking down the street, hoping to see the bus down the block. She was out of luck.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kinsey. Am I really so bad that you\u2019d rather get drenched than accept a ride? It\u2019s too late for you to be hanging out on the street, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey thought about it as another shiver racked her body. Finally, her low tolerance of the wet, cold and dark won out and she reluctantly rose. Though miserable, she took her time walking over and climbing in. She felt a bit of evil glee as she soaked his seat.</p><p>The blast of the furnace blowing hot air in her face made her feel like giggling. It was such a welcomed relief. As the heat started seeping through her clothes, she couldn\u2019t stop the tremors racking her frame. The harder she tried, the worse they got. She locked her jaw, but her teeth kept on chattering.</p><p>Austin gave her an \u2018I told you so\u2019 look that she chose to ignore.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the shop, again,\u201d she replied. Her car had a mind of its own and decided when and where it wanted to work. She really needed to get another one, but she couldn\u2019t stand spending some of her hard-earned savings.</p><p>\u201cWhere you headed?\u201d he asked as he put the car into drive and started moving down the busy street.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going two miles down the road to the super center,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence. I\u2019m on my way there, too,\u201d he said with a grin directed her way. She\u2019d bet her next paycheck he hadn\u2019t been planning on going to the discount center. For that matter, she couldn\u2019t imagine him shopping, period. He probably had others do it for him.</p><p>They rode in silence during the short minutes to the store. Luck was on his side as he found a close parking space. As soon as he turned off the motor, she reluctantly jumped from the warm vehicle. Her still soaked clothes got even more wet as she ran for the double doors.</p><p>Just as she was about to reach the entrance, she caught her toe on the edge of the sidewalk and went flying to the ground, landing in a six inch puddle. The wind was knocked out of her as water flew up her nose. Kinsey was too shocked and numb to feel pain. She was sure her knees were bruised, if not bleeding, and her elbow was most likely going to have a nice scrape, as well.</p><p>Suddenly she was hauled into the air and pulled tightly against Austin\u2019s chest as he jogged the remaining feet to the entrance of the store. He walked through the doors and took a sharp right, then gently sat her down on a metal bench.</p><p>He kneeled before her and lifted up her soaked scrubs to look at her knees. She was too cold and miserable to protest the inappropriate touching. Her teeth chattered as his incredibly warm hands ran down her sore legs. She glanced down, and sighed in relief to see the skin wasn\u2019t broken - just bruised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he told her before jumping to his feet and jogging away.</p><p>For once she didn\u2019t argue. He returned in less than ten minutes holding a sack. Then he gently picked her back up and moved toward the bathrooms. Before she realized what he was doing, he walked inside the \u2018family care\u2019 room and shut and locked the door behind them.</p><p>Without saying anything, he stripped her coat off, dropping it on the large sink counter, then grabbed the bottom of her scrub top and hauled it over her head. When his hands reached for her pants, she regained some semblance of control and stopped him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she tried to snap, but the effect was ruined by her chattering teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get out of these clothes. You\u2019re actually turning blue. I\u2019ve never before seen someone turn blue, just heard the expression, but I\u2019m worried about you getting hypothermia. I\u2019ll turn my back if you want to finish, but the clothes need to come off, now,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cF..f...fine,\u201d she stuttered. Dang the chattering.</p><p>Austin handed her a new towel with the tag still on and she wrapped it around her arms, grateful he\u2019d gotten a large beach sized one. Just getting rid of the jacket and top was helping her fight off the chill. With trembling fingers she gripped her scrub bottoms and tugged them down her legs. It was difficult since they were plastered to her body, but she finally managed to kick them off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She ran the towel across her body, still wearing her wet bra and panties, but not willing to fully strip, though he was staying true to his word and keeping his back to her. She\u2019d make him leave the room, but then someone could walk by and see her in a nearly nude state. She didn\u2019t know which was worse.</p><p>She reached for the bag and blushed scarlet when she saw a skimpy red laced thong sitting on top. She emptied the contents and found a tight undershirt, sweater, sweat pants, socks and slippers. No bra, of course. He wouldn\u2019t know what size to get.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what size shoe to buy, so I figured you could wear slippers in the store. I\u2019ll carry you back to the car when we\u2019re done,\u201d Austin said as if he could read the question marks in her head. She looked at his back with suspicion. He wasn\u2019t facing the mirror so he couldn\u2019t see her, but still, she needed to cover herself.</p><p>Her need for warmth outweighed her modesty, so she stripped her bra and panties quickly, finished drying and then threw on the new clothes. She had to fight the urge to hug him. It was actually the most thoughtful \u2013 almost romantic \u2013 thing a guy had ever done for her. Yes, she\u2019d been bought flowers, even jewelry, but Austin had thought quickly, and was... well he was taking care of her.</p> <p>She pushed the thought down, but it wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Austin,\u201d she said, her body still cold, but much better than it had been.</p><p>\u201cI never could resist a damsel in distress,\u201d he said as he turned and grinned at her.</p><p>She began ringing out her sodden clothes in the sink, and he quickly jumped in to help. They finished and put her wet clothes in the bag before he opened the door for them to leave. Glancing at her reflection in the bathroom mirror as they exited, she cringed when she noticed that she looked like a drowned rat with her hair plastered to her face. She decided she didn\u2019t care. She was feeling much better \u2013 well, besides the bruised knees, and tender elbow, so it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>An old couple walked by, then did a double take as they realized she and Austin had just come from the bathroom. The old man actually gave Austin a wink before they passed. Kinsey\u2019s cheeks flamed again.</p> <p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d Austin asked as he snagged a cart.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t need to hang out with me as I shop,\u201d she said as she tried to dismiss him.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I have things to get, too. I need new razors, toothpaste \u2013 you know, all the good stuff,\u201d he said.</p><p>She gave up and moved forward, taking the cart from him. It helped to take some of the weight off her sore left knee.</p><p>They walked silently down the aisles and Kinsey had to smile at the lost look on Austin\u2019s face. He obviously had no idea what he was doing. She could bust him on the fact, or just accept he was doing a kind thing for her. Considering she didn\u2019t want to get soaked waiting for the bus again, she decided to keep her mouth shut.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p> <p>Austin looked at what seemed like miles of products. He\u2019d shopped before, he wasn\u2019t a complete invalid, but never in a huge market. He wouldn\u2019t admit to Kinsey, but he couldn\u2019t stand shopping and had his staff do most of it.</p><p>If he needed something simple, he\u2019d jot down to the local store. Beef jerky, fresh donuts, a bag of chips \u2013 those were simple items to get. But when it came to the right brand of shampoo, toothpaste, mouthwash, even toilet paper, he had no clue. He\u2019d be damned before he admitted that to Kinsey, though.</p><p>They continued walking while she grabbed an item here or there and tossed it in the cart. For good measure, he did the same. He didn\u2019t know what the heck he was buying, though. Heck, if it wasn\u2019t something he needed, he\u2019d just donate it.</p><p>For a \u2018non-date\u2019 date, he was having a great time. He enjoyed being with Kinsey \u2013 when she was happy, mad, surprised \u2013 hell, any mood she was in. He just liked... well, he liked who he was when he was around her. He liked that he felt... energized, ready to do anything.</p><p>By the third or fourth aisle they entered, he decided that shopping was definitely for women only. He passed a couple of men trailing their wives, and they gave each other sympathetic looks. They looked just as miserable as him as they chased their kids or answered their wives with which products they liked better. If they were like him, he didn\u2019t care if the shampoo smelled like peaches or vanilla. Any scent on Kinsey was enough to harden him.</p><p>He needed to get her alone soon. If she wouldn\u2019t have been turning blue in the bathroom...</p><p>He shook his head to clear those thoughts, or the entire store would know it had been a while for him. He shifted as they walked, his wet pants were already too tight, he didn\u2019t need to add to the problem.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p> <p>Kinsey couldn\u2019t seem to take her eyes off Austin. The way his jeans clung to him in all the good places, the sight of his shirt plastered across his flat stomach. She wouldn\u2019t mind helping him out of his clothes, he looked a bit uncomfortable. The thought made her giggle.</p><p>She stopped suddenly and doubled over. She was sore, cold, and exhausted and hysterical laughter consumed her. If he could read her mind, he\u2019d probably take her right there in the produce aisle.</p><p>When she glanced at Austin\u2019s perplexed expression, she began laughing even harder, finding it hard to breathe. He started patting her back and she tried to suck in breaths of air. Her head was starting to feel light.</p><p>\u201cP...please...y...you have...to stop...\u201d she gasped in between fits of laughter. He took a step back, which was wise. He was dealing with a crazy woman, after all, she thought. One minute she was putting him at arm\u2019s length, the next yelling at him, and then her final break in sanity, had her laughing hysterically in the middle of a super-center.</p><p>After several minutes, she finally pulled herself together. He didn\u2019t say a word as she began walking again, a few more giggles slipping out.</p><p>\u201cI need some healthy snacks. Since I\u2019m practically living in the hospital, I\u2019m gaining too much weight,\u201d Kinsey said as they neared the fruit section.</p><p>\u201cYou could stand to gain a bit of weight, not that you don\u2019t look great no matter what,\u201d Austin quickly told her. Ah, he was a smart man. She actually smiled at him, her first real smile in a long time. He was easy to be around \u2013 which was why she fell for his charm in the first place. She tried to remind herself of that fact, but gave up and decided to just go with the flow. It wasn\u2019t like anything could happen in a huge store.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say for our first real date, this isn\u2019t too bad,\u201d Austin said with a wink.</p><p>Kinsey stopped and looked at him like he was insane.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI carried you inside, helped undress you, and am now shopping. I choose to believe it\u2019s a date,\u201d he countered.</p><p>\u201cFine, but then you\u2019re a cheap date. I didn\u2019t even get flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want flowers? I\u2019ll buy you a room full,\u201d he said with a gleam in his eyes that worried her. She knew he would indeed buy them if she didn\u2019t put a stop to it.</p><p>\u201cI was just kidding. I have no room for flowers,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always room for flowers.\u201d</p><p>She quickly changed the subject, hoping to distract him.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you married like the rest of your family?\u201d That stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just never found someone I could see myself spending the rest of my life with,\u201d he hedged.</p><p>\u201cWhat about kids? You do so great with your nieces and nephews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love those little rugrats. I can\u2019t believe how amazing they are. A few years ago I would\u2019ve been convinced I wasn\u2019t father material, but now...\u201d he trailed off.</p><p>Kinsey was shocked by his answer. She\u2019d been trying to make him uncomfortable so he\u2019d drop the whole dating thing, not find more reasons to like him. She could easily picture him with a baby girl in his arms, his face beaming with pride. Her imagination took over and she could see herself beside him.</p><p>No!</p><p>She couldn\u2019t afford to go there. He already told her he wasn\u2019t planning on getting married, that he hadn\u2019t found anyone worth making that commitment. He wanted to sleep with her, sure, but he didn\u2019t want to put a ring on her finger. Besides, she didn\u2019t want that, either. Right? Oh, she was so confused. She just needed a good night\u2019s rest. That was all.</p><p>Their gazes locked. She could practically feel the steam rising from their damp bodies. One word, that\u2019s all it would take for her to have the most fantastic night of her life, but she didn\u2019t want that... She really didn\u2019t, she reminded herself.</p><p>Finally, she managed to tear her gaze away. She took a step forward, grabbing random items as she tried distracting herself. Without realizing what she was doing, she grabbed a box of condoms, tossing it in the cart.</p><p>I\u2019m stronger than this. A way-too-sexy-for-his-own-good guy isn\u2019t what I need right now. He\u2019s the brother-in-law of my best friend. An affair with him would be awkward. I can\u2019t even go there. She repeated those sentences over and over in her head. She couldn\u2019t fight him, and herself, too. She\u2019d cave \u2013 she knew she would.</p><p>Austin had stopped and was staring at her with fire burning in his eyes. She looked at him, wondering what was going on. Then he reached into the cart and pulled out the condoms, a confident grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he practically purred. Then, he laughed, pleasure obvious as he went on and on.</p><p>Kinsey looked at the box of extra-large condoms and her face flamed. She quickly pushed ahead, too mortified to comment. She was hoping the floor would just go ahead and swallow her up right there.</p><p>He quickly caught up to her, and they were silent as they strolled through the store over the next twenty minutes. She grabbed a few more items, but she wanted to be done. Once she had everything she needed, they started making their way to the checkout stands. The sooner the trip was over, the faster she could regain her sanity. She knew once she was away from him, she\u2019d remember all the reasons not to date \u2013 or sleep with \u2013 the very confident and gorgeous Austin.</p><p>Austin insisted on loading the belt, then paid for the entire purchase. She wasn\u2019t going to argue with him in front of the cashier, but she\u2019d have words for him once they got inside his car. It wasn\u2019t a lot of money, but still...</p><p>They were nearing the front door when they were interrupted.</p><p>\u201cAustin?\u201d An annoying female voice called.</p><p>She seemed surprised to see him in a discount store. Kinsey was surprised anyone he knew would be in the store. She didn\u2019t picture the kind of ladies he normally associated with, shopping in a discount warehouse, especially late at night.</p><p>They both turned and saw a stunning woman, wearing a tight skirt, a shirt with her cleavage on display, and her hair and make-up done to perfection.</p><p>She squealed before rushing to them and throwing her arms around Austin\u2019s neck, smashing her huge breasts against his chest.</p><p>They have to be fake, Kinsey thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Austin pushed the woman away, but he didn\u2019t look to be in too big a hurry to do it, Kinsey thought snidely.</p><p>She had to catch her errant thoughts. He wasn\u2019t hers and he could do what he wanted. She\u2019d told him several times that she didn\u2019t want anything to do with him. She knew he wasn\u2019t a monk, and had plenty women at his disposal, but it was awkward standing next to him while another woman clung on tight. Kinsey felt like scratching the Barbie\u2019s eyes out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Candy,\u201d Austin said.</p><p>Kinsey was surprised by the stiffness in his voice. He didn\u2019t sound pleased to see her. She decided to give them privacy, because three was definitely a crowd.</p> <p>She turned and took a step, trying to move away, when Austin\u2019s arm snaked out and gripped her around the waste. He pulled her snugly against his body, and the woman turned, seeming to notice her for the first time. Her eyes narrowed slightly before she returned her full attention to Austin.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re shopping. You used to always complain that there was never a reason to grocery shop with all the available restaurants around town,\u201d she said with a pout.</p><p>\u201cWell, things change,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>She giggled an annoying sound and Kinsey wondered if she\u2019d sounded that terrible when she\u2019d had her laughing fit earlier. She really hoped not. She tugged against Austin, really, really wanting to get away from them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to reach you for a couple of weeks. I heard about your father, and figured you\u2019d need comforting,\u201d she said in a husky tone. Kinsey knew exactly what kind of comforting the woman was offering.</p> <p>Slut!</p><p>\u201cThanks for your concern, Candy, but Kinsey\u2019s been with me the entire time. I wouldn\u2019t have made it through without her.\u201d</p><p>Candy barely glanced in Kinsey\u2019s direction, as if she wasn\u2019t in the least concerned about the frumpy woman his arm was around.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know I\u2019m here for you. Why don\u2019t you come by my place on Saturday...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we already have plans Saturday, don\u2019t we, Darling?\u201d he asked as he looked into her eyes. He was pleading with her to play along. She was so shocked by the turn of events, she really wasn\u2019t capable of speaking right then. She just looked at him slightly wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes we do.\u201d He answered his own question. \u201cWe have to get going, Candy. It was good to see you. Tell your brother hello for me.\u201d</p> <p>Austin didn\u2019t give Candy time to say another word. With his arm still around Kinsey, he moved to the front of the store. At the doors, he grabbed her in his arms, then swung her around to his back. She was so shocked by the motion, she automatically tightened her arms around his neck. Pushing the cart, he quickly stepped outside.</p><p>Luckily, the rain had eased up while they were in the store, so it was only a light drizzle. Austin rushed them to his car, opened the door, then set her inside in one smooth motion.</p><p>He quickly placed their items in the back of his Benz, then jumped in the driver's seat. He turned toward her, his hair wet, his cheeks flushed from the cold, and a look in his eye that warmed her up about a hundred degrees.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d she asked. He didn\u2019t try to insult her intelligence by playing dumb, at least.</p><p>\u201cShe was a woman I went on one date with a while back. There was no reason to go on a second date, but she never quite figured that out. I\u2019ve run into her a couple times, and she\u2019s done all she can to throw herself at me. It was easier to let her think you and I are a couple. I plan on that happening anyway,\u201d he answered as if it was no big deal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damn presumptuous. Maybe I didn\u2019t want to play in your little cat and mouse game, and for the last time, I\u2019m not going out with you. I had sex with you - once. Big deal. It was forgettable, anyway,\u201d she lied. She licked her lips, immediately knowing her words were a mistake, as she watched his eyes darken with desire.</p><p>Before she could utter another word, he was dragging her across the seats, her body crushed between the steering wheel and his rock solid chest. His obvious arousal was pressing into her quickly heating core. Her eyes widened as he lifted his hand into her hair and tugged hard, bringing her mouth down to his.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t gentle or coaxing. He was outright demanding as he pressed his tongue against her lips, insisting she open for him. She gasped as sensations washed through her, giving him full access to her mouth.</p> <p>His tongue ran along the edge of her lips, making them tingle, before he drove inside her mouth, making her lose all thoughts. One hand gripped her head, holding it in place, while his other ran down the curve of her back, and pulled her even tighter against him.</p><p>Without thought, she ground her hips against his, searching for relief. Pressure continued building inside her.</p><p>Pushing into him only made her burning need worse.</p><p>She groaned as multiple sensations washed over her, electricity sparking in the air.</p><p>She reached around his neck, running her fingers through his damp hair, tugging on the strands, needing him to keep kissing her. She\u2019d never been so consumed.</p><p>Her heartbeat accelerated as she lost her breath. She slid her tongue in his mouth, and when he sucked on it, a shiver racked her from head to toe. He was turning her to jello with just a kiss.</p><p>As Austin\u2019s hand slid under the hem of her shirt and straight up to her straining nipples, Kinsey was quickly forgetting all her reasons why an affair with him was a bad idea.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Austin was losing all semblance of control as he stroked Kinsey\u2019s body. His hand moved under the hem of her shirt until finally he cupped her heavy breast in his hand, his thumb sliding across her tight nipple.</p><p>His tongue delved deeper in her mouth, tasting her, enveloping her.</p><p>Claiming her as his.</p><p>Her body was made for him. The way her spread thighs cradled him perfectly, the fit of her soft breast spilling from his palm, even the feel of her lips devouring his own. If his jeans weren\u2019t in the way, he\u2019d easily slip inside her heat, her body gripping him, sending him to another existence. One where pleasure was all that mattered.</p><p>He was losing it \u2013 forgetting he was in a store parking lot, forgetting anyone could pass by. He had one thought on his mind.</p><p>Claim her.</p><p>He reached down her sweats, his fingers gliding across the smooth, flat surface of her stomach, sliding inside the silk panties he\u2019d just purchased for her.</p><p>He slid under the thin elastic, and when he felt her wetness \u2013 her readiness for him \u2013 his body throbbed in pain. He had to take her, now. He\u2019d pleasure her more later.</p><p>He shifted to undo his pants, when there was a tapping on his window. Kinsey jerked from him, her eyes widened to the point that if he wasn\u2019t in so much agony, it would\u2019ve been comical.</p><p>There was tapping again and he glanced at the driver\u2019s side window, unable to see out because they were so fogged up.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d necked in a car. Not since he was a teenager, that\u2019s for sure. He definitely couldn\u2019t remember the last time someone had busted him in the middle of making love.</p><p>He\u2019d only meant to kiss her for a few moments, to prove to her that, yes, it really was that good. For her to blow him off hadn\u2019t done wonders for his ego. He knew she was lying. She\u2019d received just as much pleasure as him, but still, it had stung.</p><p>\u201cHello. Please roll down your window,\u201d came an authoritative voice.</p><p>Austin sighed as Kinsey jumped from his lap as if he had the plague, and quickly resumed her seat, her head cast down, while her body practically hugged the passenger door. He finally rolled down his window to find an officer standing there with his flashlight shining in directly at him.</p><p>\u201cEvening, officer. What can I do for you?\u201d Austin asked, quickly recovering.</p><p>The cop looked at Austin, then Kinsey, surprise showing on his features. It was obvious he\u2019d expected to find a couple of teenagers.</p><p>\u201cHello, Sir. There\u2019s no loitering in the store parking lot,\u201d the officer finally said, a small smirk on his face.</p><p>Austin could practically feel the heat radiating off of Kinsey\u2019s face. He knew she was as red as a fire engine.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. We were just... um... talking,\u201d Austin said. He knew the officer didn\u2019t buy it, but what was he supposed to say? Sorry Officer, but I\u2019m so damn horny for this woman, I forgot where I was. I just about had her pants down when you interrupted us. He somehow didn\u2019t think that would go over too well.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you finish your....um, talking, at home. Have a nice day, folks. I\u2019ll wait here to make sure you don\u2019t have any engine problems.\u201d With that, he turned and walked back to his cruiser. Austin shifted the vehicle into drive, flashed on his lights, and quickly merged into traffic.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything until they were parked at the hospital. Kinsey immediately tried to jump from the car, but he grabbed her arm.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe how off kilter she was constantly throwing him. He looked at her head until she finally turned and locked eyes with him. She was shaken, that much was obvious, as tremors still racked her body.</p><p>She was also afraid. He could understand that. They had something... something unusual. It scared the hell out of him, too.</p><p>\u201cI need to go,\u201d she whispered in a plea. He knew she wanted to build her walls back up. He had no choice but to let her, but what he wanted was to drag her home with him.</p><p>\u201cKinsey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to work, Austin. Thank you for the ride, and the items, but I have to get inside. I\u2019m late now,\u201d she said more firmly. She was gaining her iron will back.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said and let go of her arm. She scrambled out of the car and took a few steps toward the hospital, her slippers visibly getting soaked. \u201cYou forgetting something?\u201d</p><p>She turned as he opened the trunk. He saw the hesitation, like she wanted to just leave the items there. Finally, she walked back and grabbed her bags.</p><p>\u201cI can help you carry them,\u201d he offered. She looked down at the three bags, then at him with an, are you kidding me, look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m neither helpless, nor a damsel in distress. I do appreciate your help tonight, but I\u2019m not trying to play hard to get, Austin. I\u2019m too busy for a relationship, and we just don\u2019t...well, we don\u2019t click. I told you, I don\u2019t do affairs. Let it go.\u201d With those words, she turned and walked inside. He admired the view of her hips moving as she marched off.</p><p>He smiled. He didn\u2019t really know why. She was the most frustrating female he\u2019d ever dealt with, but he liked her. Really liked her, as a matter-of-fact.</p><p>\u201cSee ya soon, Kinsey,\u201d he called. He watched her step falter for a moment, before she resumed her pace. He waited until she was safely inside before he climbed back into his car. He turned up the music on the radio and sang along. For having to go home and take an ice cold shower, he was feeling pretty good.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>A few days passed with Kinsey managing to avoid Austin. Apparently, something at the offices had come up and he\u2019d been unable to make it to the hospital during her shifts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She finally got two full days off. It was a win, win, because that meant her patients were doing well enough for her to step away for a couple days. She was thrilled George was better, and Joseph was stable. She needed the days off, too - desperately.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t hesitated when her boss told her to go home and rest. The first thing she\u2019d done was take a two hour bath while reading, then she\u2019d glared at her pile of mail.</p><p>She had to pay bills, whether she liked it or not, so she may as well get it over with. She sat down with her checkbook and started ripping into her mail. An hour later, she felt a headache coming on, so she lay on the couch with her eyes closed, and a hot cup of coffee next to her.</p><p>As she rested, she couldn\u2019t help but think of Austin. The man was invading her day and night, whether he was actually there or not. She was so high strung, she knew she was going to have to do something, but she couldn\u2019t figure out what.</p> <p>She reminded herself of all the reasons she didn\u2019t want to have a cheap affair with him, but her body was in a constant fight with her mind. She was in a permanent state of arousal, it seemed.</p><p>With frustration, she finally got up and went to the kitchen to find a snack. There was hardly any food in the house since she\u2019d been practically living at the hospital. Her paycheck was gratifyingly large, though, so she was able to pay all the bills while putting away a nice chunk of change for a rainy day.</p><p>She may even treat herself to a day at the spa. She knew Cassie would be up for it. It seemed like forever since the two of them had been able to get out with no one else around. She loved being surrounded by people, but sometimes she just needed her best friend and no one else.</p><p>She found a can of soup and put it on the stove to boil. While she waited, her mind drifted to the kiss a few nights previously. Just thinking about it had her nipples tightening and her legs clenching together, seeking relief from the pulsing of her body.</p><p>She wondered if the cold shower thing worked for women. She\u2019d never needed one before meeting Austin Anderson. The corners of her mouth lifted at her errant thoughts.</p> <p>When she was thinking about turning the stove off and giving the cold shower idea a try, her doorbell rang, causing her heart to flutter. If he was on the other side, she was throwing in the towel and attacking him on her living room floor.</p><p>She neared the door, her heart beating erratically in her chest as she flung it open. She didn\u2019t know whether to sigh in relief, or cry in frustration when she saw Cassie standing there.</p><p>\u201cHey, love. I was so excited to hear you got a day off work that I rushed right over. Max has Ariel, and I\u2019m in desperate need of girl time,\u201d Cassie gushed as she gave Kinsey a quick hug and stepped through the threshold.</p><p>Kinsey smiled, her heart slowing to a normal speed, happy to see her best friend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you could pull yourself away from your hunk of a husband long enough to remember where I lived,\u201d Kinsey teased.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you\u2019re not far off. I can\u2019t believe how lucky I was to have found him, or him finding me. I don\u2019t care as long as we\u2019re together. It still feels like we're on our honeymoon, even after all this time, and a three month old baby,\u201d Cassie gushed. Her tone softened and her eyes got all dreamy as she talked about Max. Kinsey felt the tiniest bit jealous. Not of Cassie, of course, just that her best friend had been lucky enough to find one of the good men out there.</p> <p>With a sea of scoundrels, it was hard to find a true prince. Maybe that\u2019s why Kinsey was always so leery to date. She\u2019d been burned more than once by a guy she thought was a knight in shining armor.</p><p>\u201cI ran into Austin last night,\u201d Cassie said as she sat down.</p><p>Kinsey counted to five in her head. She didn\u2019t want to seem eager for information. She wanted to be casual, not look as if she cared about Cassie\u2019s brother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, I guess,\u201d Kinsey replied, hoping her tone sounded bored.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he looked kinda miserable. Really hung up on something...or someone,\u201d Cassie persisted, like she had her own secrets. She was killing Kinsey.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I hope he feels better soon. Hold on a minute. I need to check my soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your soup away. We\u2019ll go have lunch,\u201d Cassie called.</p><p>Kinsey figured she was pulling off her whole indifferent act. She nearly breathed a sigh of relief until Cassie spoke again.</p> <p>\u201cThen you can fill me in on why Austin looks like crap, and you\u2019re trying so hard to act like you don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Kinsey whispered as she turned the burner off. She should\u2019ve known she couldn\u2019t keep anything from Cassie. They\u2019d known each other for too many years. It had been worth a try, though.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell, Cass. You know we had a one-night-stand. Nothing came of it,\u201d Kinsey said. It was much easier to try and deceive her friend if she didn\u2019t have to look her in the eye.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard from Max. Apparently you two shared a hot and heavy kiss the other night in a store parking lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe talked about that?\u201d Kinsey shouted.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m just the messenger. Don\u2019t yell at me,\u201d Cassie said with a chuckle. \u201cI was eavesdropping on him and Max. He was talking about frustrating women, cold showers, and inconsiderate law officers.\u201d</p><p>Cassie deepened her voice, trying to sound like a guy. She wasn\u2019t pulling it off.</p><p>\u201cIt was just a little kiss. No big deal. Nothing to even talk about. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s making such a big deal about it. I completely forgot about it until you brought it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suck at lying, you know,\u201d Cassie said, making Kinsey jump when she realized her friend had snuck up on her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so the kiss was good. Great, in fact. All of them have been, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything. I could have a great kiss with a dozen different guys, at any club in the city, on a Friday night. I don\u2019t have time to get involved with anyone right now. Besides, even if I did, it wouldn\u2019t be Austin. He\u2019s a known playboy, he\u2019s told me he isn\u2019t interested in commitment of any kind. I just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just like to lie to yourself. He\u2019s hot, Kinsey. Hot for you \u2013 for your body. He\u2019s a good guy, believe it or not. Yes, he\u2019s a bit arrogant, and definitely sure of himself, but he\u2019s got a heart of gold. Don\u2019t let yourself be so scared that you run away when you should just slow down and take what\u2019s being offered. What he wants to give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you to pieces, and always will, but it would never work. I know the thought of us being married to brothers was always the dream come true scenario, but that\u2019s not going to happen, so let\u2019s quit talking about Austin and just have an amazing day. I haven\u2019t had two days off in a row in forever. I don\u2019t want to waste them,\u201d Kinsey begged.</p><p>\u201cYou win for now, but I\u2019m not giving up. I think the two of you were meant to be together. I\u2019ve never seen him so hung up on a girl. And believe me, I see a lot of girls chasing him.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey had to fight the jealousy overriding her good sense at even thinking about Austin with other women. Of course he was with other women; he was a playboy, for goodness sake. Still, it made her see a bit of red. Nothing a pedicure and lots of chocolate wouldn\u2019t cure, though.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving. Let\u2019s get Chinese food, pedicures and endless chocolate. I\u2019ll treat, but only if you agree not to mention a certain bachelor\u2019s name,\u201d Kinsey said with a fake laugh.</p><p>\u201cDeal. But one more final thought. Just make sure you\u2019re not passing up on a great thing because you\u2019re afraid of getting hurt. I almost did that with Max and that would\u2019ve been the worst mistake of my life,\u201d Cassie said with complete seriousness.</p><p>\u201cYou and Max were meant to be together. The two of you should be on posters for dating services. I swear the gushy looks he gives you are almost sickening. I promise you, though, that I\u2019m not letting life pass me by. I\u2019m just, well, busy. What is it with married people? They\u2019re always trying to marry off everyone else. I guess marriage isn\u2019t as bad as millions of divorced couples believe,\u201d Kinsey said, trying to pull off her joke, but falling a bit flat.</p><p>She\u2019d been in relationships before, but just hadn\u2019t managed to find that spark. That little extra something that made her want to go to sleep each night, and wake up each morning next to the same person.</p><p>Austin immediately popped into her head. She could see herself waking next to him. That wouldn\u2019t be a heartache in the least. No, she scolded herself again. That was just the exhaustion talking. She\u2019d be over it in a few more days. She was saying it so much, she was almost believing her own lies.</p><p>Good.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I promise to be good. I know the perfect place for lunch. I just found it when Max and I were out the other day. They have the best egg rolls I\u2019ve ever tasted. Light and flaky skins, just the way I like them,\u201d Cassie babbled as Kinsey grabbed her purse.</p><p>\u201cI promised I wouldn\u2019t go out the entire two days off, but even after a couple hours in my apartment, I\u2019m going a little stir-crazy. I\u2019m glad you came over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are best friends for? We tend to know when the other person needs us. Sometimes, we even know it before the other one does,\u201d Cassie said wisely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right as usual. Seriously, thank you, Cass. Thanks for always being there \u2013 for knowing what to say, and not to say, and for just being you.\u201d</p><p>Cassie gave her a quick hug before they strolled outside. Kinsey was thrilled to see Cassie had a car with a driver - that meant they could have drinks with lunch and while getting pedicures. She felt her stress immediately start to ease. It was turning into a great day, even after her rocky beginning.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cCongratulations. You\u2019re doing great, George. You won\u2019t be running marathons anytime soon, but you\u2019re clear to go home,\u201d the doctor said as he signed the discharge forms.</p><p>\u201cI feel good, Doctor. Do you have any good news about my brother?\u201d George asked as he looked over at Joseph, who hadn\u2019t stirred in weeks. He could see the strain on Katherine\u2019s face, along with the rest of the family.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stable right now. He hasn\u2019t gotten any better or worse at this point,\u201d the doctor hedged.</p><p>George sighed in frustration. How could he possibly celebrate his own health when his brother was hanging on by a thread. Nothing would ever be the same again if Joseph didn\u2019t come out of the coma.</p><p>He had to. He was stubborn and strong and he couldn\u2019t leave his family. They needed him too much. He hated that he couldn\u2019t talk to Joseph, especially since it took a car wreck to make him want to open up about his relationship with Esther. Guilt was eating at him.</p><p>\u201cGeorge, I\u2019m so glad to see you\u2019re feeling better,\u201d Esther said as she joined the family.</p><p>George\u2019s heart skipped a few beats at just the sight of her. As he looked at Esther, his aching eased. He never thought it possible to find love again, but then he\u2019d never expected to meet a woman like Esther. She was kind, loving, and full of life. He could see them traipsing around the world over the next several years. What thrilled him most of all, though, was the growing love between Esther and his children. He could never even consider marrying again, unless the woman loved his family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even though his children were grown, they still needed each other. That\u2019s what family was about.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Esther,\u201d he finally replied, trying to act casual. He hoped he was pulling it off.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up, Katherine?\u201d Esther asked as she approached Katherine and enveloped her in a comforting embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking it a day at a time. I miss him, but I know he\u2019ll come back to me. His life isn\u2019t finished yet. He has so much more to give,\u201d Katherine said, her voice deep with emotion.</p> <p>George\u2019s own throat tingled as he heard the pain in his sister-in-laws voice. He loved her, had been thrilled when Joseph finally came around and married her. He smiled, thinking back to those early days. How stupid and bullheaded both he and his brother had been, especially when it came to women.</p><p>No wonder their own children had been so leery to take a leap of faith into marriage and families. It seemed to take the Anderson men a bit longer than the average male to admit they were wrong and to allow themselves lifetimes of happiness.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do, you let me know,\u201d Esther offered.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, but I think the only thing any of us can do at this point is wait...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give me a ride home, Esther? I\u2019d like to shower and change. I\u2019ll come back real soon, Katherine,\u201d George said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that will be fine,\u201d Esther replied, her cheeks pickening when several heads turned toward her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to come back tonight, George. Please, stay home and rest. You need to take care of you, so you can help me take care of Joseph when he wakes up,\u201d Katherine said.</p><p>\u201cJoseph Anderson, you don\u2019t rest too much longer, okay? You need to come back home to us. We all love and miss you greatly,\u201d George said as he leaned down and hugged his brother. His heart was broken with their constant connection between one another lost. He so badly wanted to hear that booming, wonderful voice, sit down by the fire with a fine glass of bourbon, and laugh about their stubborn children.</p><p>Soon, he promised himself. Joseph would wake soon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready, Esther. I appreciate the ride,\u201d George finally said.</p><p>The nurse tried to insist on him riding in a wheelchair to the front entrance, but he blew her off. He wasn\u2019t an invalid. He\u2019d been walking since he was eight months old, and he wasn\u2019t going to start being pushed around now.</p> <p>He slipped his arm through Esther\u2019s and they walked from the room.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Mom? I know you miss dad, but you need to get out of here a little more,\u201d Mark said as he sat next to Katherine.</p><p>\u201cAh, Mark, you\u2019ll understand after you\u2019ve been married as long as I have. It hurts me to be away from him. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe when we\u2019re apart. Your father needs me here. I know he can hear me. I know he\u2019s aware that I\u2019m by his side. The more time I\u2019m here, the sooner he\u2019ll come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t you mom me. I\u2019m doing just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell us more of your story?\u201d Amy asked. \u201cYou left off with Joseph standing at your door. He was being quite the pig headed man. I\u2019m really hoping you put him in his place,\u201d she finished with a smile to take any of the sting out of her words.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019d love to tell you more. It takes me back. Oh, how I miss those days of young love, passion, and romance. Obviously, it worked out for Joseph and me, but I seriously had my doubts...\u201d</p> <p>Katherine trailed off. She sat back, making herself comfortable before she began...</p><p>Katherine stood in the doorway in shock. She couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d show up at her door, and then dare to insult her. Oh, she\u2019d missed him, even knowing what he\u2019d done. She\u2019d thought him handsome five years ago, but time had only refined him.</p><p>He stood before her, taller than life, his bright blue eyes practically shooting sparks, as they gazed at her. His dark hair was cut short, and his clothes were slightly wrinkled, as if he\u2019d traveled a great distance, only to show up on her doorstep.</p><p>His face was a bit more chiseled, all traces of youth gone. His shoulders a little wider, stronger. He\u2019d always tied her stomach in knots, but she thought she\u2019d purged him from her mind.</p><p>She\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Her knees were trembling, and she had to lock them together to keep from dropping in a puddle. She couldn\u2019t let him know how much he was affecting her. She also couldn\u2019t seem to find her voice as they stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cYou going to answer?\u201d he mocked, his baritone voice cascading over her skin. She fought the tremors wanting to rack her body. He wasn\u2019t there to proclaim his love, she was sure of it, not that she\u2019d believe him anyway. He was there for revenge for what he perceived a wrongdoing on her part.</p><p>She knew he could see what he was doing to her. It was obvious. She\u2019d never been good at hiding her feelings. He\u2019d often commented on how he loved the passion just underneath her prim surface. He\u2019d been all about releasing that passion, exposing her, making her feel almost raw in his arms.</p><p>She\u2019d never given to another, what she\u2019d promised to Joseph. She\u2019d thought she was over him \u2013 she\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve often thought about you \u2013 wondering how many other men you\u2019d played games with. I wonder who of us has had more partners, Katherine,\u201d he said with a sneer. That did it. Her temper finally overrode her shock.</p><p>\u201cWell, Joseph, I don\u2019t kiss and tell, so you\u2019ll just have to keep wondering. I\u2019m sure, though, if I was a gambler, I\u2019d lay the odds in your favor. With the number of concubines at your service, you can have a new woman at your disposal each night of the week.\u201d</p><p>She was proud of the casual tone she used, as if she didn\u2019t have a care in the world. Let him think what he wanted.</p><p>He looked at her in surprise. She\u2019d never before had such a sharp tongue. She\u2019d grown up, too, in the years they\u2019d been apart. Still, she wondered how she was able to use any wit with him staring at her.</p><p>\u201cPoint taken,\u201d he said with humor filling his eyes. \u201cConsidering your parting words, you can\u2019t blame me for wondering, though. A woman of your immense needs wouldn\u2019t be single for any length of time. I\u2019ve heard rumors that you aren\u2019t currently taken. I guess luck is with me.\u201d</p><p>Katherine wanted to smack him - he deserved it. He was trying to make her lose her temper, and he was succeeding. There was no way she\u2019d give him that victory, though. She wouldn\u2019t allow him to know how much he affected her. The best thing she could do to win their little sparring match would be to act indifferent. She\u2019d played in the corporate world long enough to know how to bluff \u2013 she\u2019d just never enjoyed doing it. She was too honest a person to be a true shark.</p><p>Also, she had to remind herself, if he was back, it was because of the shift in power in the Anderson family. His father, who she loved, must have called him. She could bite her tongue for the sake of Milton, who needed the extra support his son would provide.</p><p>Under no circumstances did she want to see the corporation put into Neilson\u2019s hands, even if she had to deal with Joseph.</p><p>Because she was part of the board making the decision on who took over the reins of the corporation, she couldn\u2019t let old wounds influence her in a negative way. If Joseph\u2019s name was added to the list of possible candidates, then she needed to look at his qualifications, not the fact that he\u2019d shattered her heart. How he treated women didn\u2019t affect how he was in business.</p><p>He was known as a shark \u2013 a CEO any company would be proud to have at their helm. She knew if that was best for the corporation, she\u2019d vote that way. She also knew she\u2019d resign afterward.</p><p>A woman could only take so much, and there was no way she could handle seeing him on a daily basis, yearning, but never having. It would destroy what was left of her barely healed heart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business whether I\u2019m single or not. I don\u2019t track your hundreds of girlfriends,\u201d she snapped. Before she could feel guilt over losing her battle of wills with herself and snapping, he smirked. Katherine continued, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I must\u2019ve underestimated you. Hundreds is too low a number.\u201d</p><p>He laughed aloud at her words. His shoulders shook as he gripped her door, still preventing her from shutting it. The open merriment on his face caught her unaware, and she felt a deep heat burning inside her. She\u2019d taken years to try to get over him, and still she wasn\u2019t there. Seeing him carefree and filled with humor, even when she was trying to insult him, would cause many more years of yearning.</p><p>How was she supposed to find a man who even came close to affecting her the way Joseph Anderson did? Why did he have to be such a charming snake?</p><p>\u201cI do have a reputation to protect, Katherine, but even I have my limits. You, on the other hand, have developed quite the mystique, yourself. It\u2019s said you rarely date the same man twice, that you\u2019re cold as a serpent, and can destroy a man\u2019s ego with one piercing gaze from those beautiful eyes of yours. I can\u2019t imagine the rumors to be true, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say about assuming, Joseph.\u201d</p><p>He roared with laughter again, drawing her eyes to the fullness of his lips. She wanted to sink to the floor, remembering the feel of him gently trailing kisses up the side of her neck. He\u2019d been so tender, so passionate. He\u2019d shown her a world she\u2019d never even imagined existed. To have it so brutally ripped away was unfair. She couldn\u2019t have it happen to her twice.</p><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s good to be home, darling. I\u2019ve missed our talks.\u201d The endearment that came so casually from his lips sent a pang straight to her chest. He\u2019d rarely called her by her name when they\u2019d dated. It had always been an endearment, and she\u2019d loved it. She\u2019d felt so cherished.</p><p>She hardened her resolve and pushed on the door a little, not even causing his six-foot-five-inch frame to budge a bit. She kicked out with her foot, hitting his expensive loafers, trying to show him he was unwelcome. She needed to stop their exchange.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Joseph? We could go on all night insulting each other, but I\u2019ve had an extraordinarily long day and I just want to eat some dinner and go to bed. Tell me what you want, then we can quit torturing each other, and go back to our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, Katherine.\u201d</p><p>Wow, she thought. That was straight to the point. He wasn\u2019t trying to secretly seduce her. At least he was up front, letting the truth of his intentions linger like a haunting shadow. He\u2019d been the same way five years previously, but she\u2019d been wrong about him then, and she knew nothing was different now.</p><p>Katherine was convinced it was all a game to him. He must\u2019ve felt she\u2019d slighted him in some way, so he wanted his pound of flesh. He wasn\u2019t going to get it. She\u2019d given him enough already.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not up for the taking, Joseph, nor am I for sale. This is one transaction you aren\u2019t going to close, so you can exit the way you came in. I\u2019ll ask you to leave, once again,\u201d she said, speaking through clenched teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cInvite me in.\u201d</p><p>The seductive purr in his voice was meant to melt her from the inside out. He was well practiced in his acquisition of women. The way his voice deepened on the word in as his eyes glanced down her body. The way he was stripping her of her clothes, letting her know he could remember every detail of her.</p><p>She felt naked, though she was perfectly covered. Her body responded as it had done so many times previously. She wanted to invite him in. She wanted to forget her heartbreak, forget the rules, forget her iron will and just feel... feel desire, love, passion. She wanted to feel needed.</p><p>She almost uttered the invitation, before she snapped out of her trance.</p> <p>As he took a step forward, she quickly blocked him, knowing if he came through those doors, she\u2019d been too vulnerable, too easy to seduce.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what this visit has been about, but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s been pleasant, Joseph. Again, I repeat my invitation for you to exit my building. You\u2019re not coming in, not tonight, tomorrow, or a week from now. Please step back so I can shut my door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of me, Katherine?\u201d Her eyes widened at the challenge in his eyes. \u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t think you are. I think you\u2019re afraid of yourself. I think you want me. Maybe even more than I want you, though I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s possible. Do you not trust yourself to be alone with me?\u201d</p><p>The smirk on his face told her he\u2019d read her telling body like a sign language expert. She was afraid. Terrified, in fact.</p><p>He leaned back against the doorjamb, thankfully not forcing the issue, and just pushing her aside. She knew it was a power of wills. He knew he could get inside. He weighed twice as much as she did, and easily towered over her by a foot. He didn\u2019t want to power his way in, though. He wanted her submission to his will.</p> <p>He could keep on wanting!</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you worried about your neighbor\u2019s eavesdropping on our little conversation. You always were concerned with what others thought of you. I\u2019d say they\u2019d probably pull out the popcorn and grab a chair if they could hear our little talk in the hall.\u201d</p><p>It was a threat. She had no doubt about it. He was promising her he\u2019d get louder. But she knew he wouldn\u2019t do it. He had a reputation to protect. His image was splattered on magazines on at least a monthly basis. She was a nobody.</p><p>She crossed her arms and glared. She just had to stand firm. Ignore his empty threats.</p><p>He shifted, clearing her door, and she quickly started to shut it in his face. Before it could latch, his hand shot out, and she knew to struggle would be useless. He weighed a solid two-hundred pounds, if not a bit more, of nothing but solid muscle.</p><p>She had no chance in a physical challenge against him. Heck, she barely had a chance in a mental battle. He was far more sophisticated than her and he really knew how to play all the games she\u2019d avoided her entire life.</p> <p>\u201cAh, Katherine, you realize I\u2019m not some pesky fly you can shoo away, right? When have I ever let the word no deter me? I came here to see you and talk privately. Have you ever known me not to get whatever I pursued?\u201d he asked with full authority \u2013 total confidence.</p><p>She shook at the power in his eyes. She didn\u2019t know how she could win this battle. Why keep fighting?</p><p>She knew why.</p><p>He wanted to have a quick roll in the sack, while she needed to hold onto her sanity. If she caved to him, she\u2019d lose a lot more than if he just walked away. He could take the hit on his pride. She absolutely couldn\u2019t take the hit on her heart.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a battle, Joseph. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve thrown down an imaginary gauntlet, or accidentally challenged you. You win, okay? You get the points for one-upmanship. Now, leave like a gentleman, and we can possibly talk later, maybe do coffee,\u201d she pled.</p><p>She was willing to meet him in a public place if it got him off her doorstep. She\u2019d be prepared by then, armed. Not out of sorts and shocked at seeing him for the first time after all these years.</p><p>He looked into her eyes, his face softening for a moment and she thought she\u2019d finally convinced him. Then his eyes narrowed, just slightly at the corners, and his shoulders stiffened. He wasn\u2019t done \u2013 not even close.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re doing this the hard way. Just remember that I\u2019ve warned you. I always get what I want, and right now I want privacy with you.\u201d</p> <p>He turned and walked away from her door. She shut it to just a crack and peeked out. If he stepped back, she could quickly slam it, but she didn\u2019t trust what he was up to. There were elderly people who lived in her complex, and kids, a lot of kids.</p><p>She knew he wouldn\u2019t bring harm to any of them, but that\u2019s all she knew. Maybe he really didn\u2019t care if the news stations camped out on her doorstep, but she sure as heck didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>He walked about twenty feet from her door, right in the middle of the floor. She held her breath. What was he doing?</p><p>He turned, looking straight through the crack of her door, right into her eyes. Then winked.</p><p>He threw his head back and hollered.</p><p>\u201cKatherine! Where are you, Katherine?\u201d</p><p>His shouts rang like a shotgun through the narrow halls, echoing off the doors. Before she could figure out his intentions, doors started opening. She opened hers wider, as she watched her neighbors step into the hallway.</p><p>He was causing a scene.</p><p>He knew how she felt about public fighting. It had always disgusted her. She\u2019d told him that responsible adults could wait until they got home before yelling at each other.</p><p>He turned, as if spotting her for the first time, and staggered over. What was he doing? He weaved up the hallway. He was acting... acting drunk.</p><p>Oh my gosh!</p><p>\u201cKatherine, there you are. I\u2019m so sorry, baby. I didn\u2019t mean to talk to the other girl. You left so suddenly, but you know you\u2019re my only one,\u201d he slurred.</p><p>He was going to get his way. She was seething as she stepped closer to him. Her fear of public displays was greater than her fear of being alone with him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Joseph. Come inside and we\u2019ll talk,\u201d she said through clenched teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, everyone. You can go back inside now,\u201d she told her neighbors, who were looking at the scene like they\u2019d just bought tickets to the newest Hollywood premier.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kiss her. Really. She kissed me. I want you \u2013 only you,\u201d he said in a falsely moaning voice.</p><p>Katherine heard her sixty-four year old neighbor gasp. Her face flamed as the humiliation got worse. What was he trying to do to her? She knew he\u2019d take it to any level to win, but this was going too far.</p><p>\u201cReally, he\u2019s not feeling well. I\u2019m so sorry about this,\u201d she apologized. \u201cCome with me now, Joseph,\u201d she growled as she grabbed his hand and tugged him toward her open door. She had to get him inside before he said anything else, especially something that would make her have to move from the apartments, even the city, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cYou forgive me then, baby? I need you,\u201d he cried, his words still slurred as he went from obnoxious to pathetic.</p><p>She was seriously thinking about murder. A life in prison couldn\u2019t be worse than the humiliation she was feeling at that moment.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Joseph. Now come inside!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, baby, I\u2019ll rock your world,\u201d he gasped as he flashed a lopsided grin and added another stagger for effect.</p><p>She heard the couple in 5B laugh at the display. She sent them a glare, and the woman winked at her. Katherine was thrilled her misery was entertainment for her neighbors.</p><p>She got to her door and pulled on him, but he leaned against the frame, his sharp eyes looking right into hers, the neighbors unable to see he was anything but drunk.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want me to come inside?\u201d he mocked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, please, Joseph. It would please me greatly if you\u2019d just get in here,\u201d she whispered in a deadly voice.</p><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re so good to me,\u201d he slurred as he leaned toward her. She held her hand against his chest, stopping his lips from touching hers by only a couple inches.</p><p>\u201cRound one goes to you, okay? Can you stop humiliating me and just come inside,\u201d she demanded, hoping her voice was low enough not to carry to her neighbors.</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, I\u2019ll do the striptease for you,\u201d he said loudly. She was going to kill him. No doubt about it.</p><p>She kicked him hard in the shin, hoping it caused him to stagger for real this time. When he winced, she shoved him through the door and slammed it shut.</p><p>She stood two feet away, steam practically shooting out of her ears. She couldn\u2019t ever remember being so angry. He\u2019d straightened with his back to the door, not even looking like her kick had affected him in the least, though her own foot was throbbing. There was no way she\u2019d admit it, though.</p><p>He seemed to know, as he knew everything else. With a quick movement, he was at her side and lifting her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI warned you, by any means necessary,\u201d he said as he carried her to the couch.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you. Are you trying to ruin my life? Will that make you happy? Because you\u2019re doing one hell of a fine job of it. I won\u2019t be able to look into any of their eyes again. They think, not only am I some pathetic loser, but that I abuse you, too.\u201d</p><p>She balled her hand up and punched him in the chest, not affecting him in the least. Now her foot and hand hurt. He sat on the couch with her on his lap.</p><p>She struggled against him for a moment before figuring out it was useless. When she felt his arousal pressing into her hip, she knew she\u2019d lost.</p><p>She met his eyes to find intense desire darkening their depths.</p><p>She was in trouble. Deep, deep trouble.</p><p>He closed the small gap between them, his lips taking hers. Anger, frustration, and pure need mixed as his tongue delved into her mouth, claiming her as his as if no time had passed.</p><p>She grabbed his hair, intending to push him away, stop the seduction. But when his hand gripped her bare leg, desire shot through her, and she started falling into an abyss of pleasure. She couldn\u2019t fight him. It was impossible.</p><p>His kiss turned from angry passion, to tender seduction and she was gone. Her body melted against his, and she caved. She\u2019d lost the second he\u2019d shown up at her door, so what was the use of fighting it anymore?</p><p>\u201cI could have saved a lot of arguing had I just kissed you immediately. Your body knows what it wants. It\u2019s your mind that\u2019s trying to confuse you. We\u2019re meant to be together,\u201d he gasped before all talking ended and he kissed her again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how it happened, but soon she was lying on the couch with him stretched out above her. It felt right. Everything was perfect. Just one night, she promised herself.</p><p>Just as his hand was reaching for the tie on her robe, the doorbell rang. Katherine tried to acknowledge it, but she couldn\u2019t think past the haze of desire swarming her.</p><p>It rang again and suddenly Joseph was standing, several inappropriate words leaving his mouth. He stomped to the door and yanked it open.</p><p>It took Katherine several moments to realize she was spread out on the couch while he was opening her front door.</p><p>\u201cIs...Katherine home?\u201d a voice asked. She tensed as she sat up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her humiliation was complete. Her brother was there, and she knew her hair had the just-climbed-out-of-bed look. Heck, her neighbors had probably still been in the hall and filled him in on the whole scene already.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s busy,\u201d Joseph snapped. She knew he recognized Aaron.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Aaron. Come on in,\u201d she called as she dashed toward her bathroom. She was going to take a few minutes to compose herself. Hopefully, Joseph would be gone when she came back out.</p><p>When she finally did reappear she was wearing wool slacks and a thick sweater. She was geared up for protection. She entered the living room to the sound of laughter. Her brother had his head thrown back at something Joseph had said, and Joseph was smirking.</p> <p>When she approached, Joseph\u2019s eyes pierced her own, desire still simmering underneath the surface.</p><p>\u201cWalk me to the door, Katherine,\u201d he commanded. She followed him on auto pilot. He said goodbye to her brother, then bent down and whispered in her ear.</p><p>\u201cThis is far from over,\u201d he promised. With that, he turned and strode away. A shiver of trepidation raced through her. She had a bad feeling he was right...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to be appalled at or smitten with my father-in-law,\u201d Jessica said with a horrified laugh.</p><p>Katherine once again returned to the present and looked around the room. She agreed with Jessica. Thinking back to those days, she didn\u2019t know how the two of them ever managed to come to an agreement of any kind.</p> <p>Their early days were full of passion and anger. Misunderstandings and assumptions. It was so long ago, but it was the beginning.</p><p>The beginning of the greatest love she\u2019d ever known.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to continue the story later. Thank you for listening. It actually helps ease the pain of missing him so much,\u201d Katherine said.</p><p>\u201cIt helps us, too, Mom. It\u2019s hard to imagine the perfect couple as ever having problems, but wow, just wow,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>\u201cYour father was a stubborn man. He still is. But that stubbornness is what will help him come home to me,\u201d Katherine sighed.</p><p>The family all left the hospital together. Katherine would return soon, and once again, lay beside her husband and draw on the immense strength he carried even while in a coma.</p> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cI think we have enough information to agree it\u2019s time to fire Jack. The question is, are we going to press charges?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cFire him, yes, but I think we\u2019re wasting everyone\u2019s time if we press charges. Yes, we know it\u2019s him, but it\u2019s all eye witness reports and suspicions. He\u2019s done well at covering his tracks,\u201d Trenton said.</p><p>\u201cI agree with both of you. We\u2019ll let him go, but I think it\u2019s already going to be messy, and pressing charges is just going to drag too many people into it, who would rather he just leave, so they can get on with their jobs,\u201d Austin said.</p><p>Austin despised dishonest employees. His family treated their staff with the utmost respect, gave them good benefits, time off, helped their families and invested time and money into them. That\u2019s why, even though it was business, it felt more personal to him when an employee stole from them.</p><p>Jack was paid well, and had been with them for years. There wasn\u2019t a good reason for theft other than pure greed.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like Dean did a great job of gathering all the information we needed, plus he spoke to all the receivers who had suspicions. Jack got away with about fifty-thousand dollars\u2019 worth of merchandise. He doesn\u2019t have a banking account, so where the money has gone is anyone\u2019s guess,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s just fire him and write it off. It could\u2019ve been a whole lot worse,\u201d Austin said with a sigh. He wanted to press charges just because it burned him that the guy was going to get off with nothing more than a job loss. He had to let it go, though.</p> <p>The family was going through enough stress with Joseph still in a coma and his own life was filled to the brink with personal issues. It had been a couple weeks since he\u2019d last had a moment alone with Kinsey. He was getting tired of her avoiding tactics.</p><p>One way or the other, they were coming to a showdown. He could hardly wait.</p><p>\u201cAll right, guys, that\u2019s the last of the business. Now, tell me about your hot, or should I say, cold, romance with Kinsey,\u201d Trenton demanded, snapping Austin out of his musings.</p><p>Austin sent his brother a glare. He was a grown man and shouldn\u2019t have his brothers ragging on him about his love life.</p><p>\u201cMy relationship with Kinsey is... well hell, it\u2019s... complicated,\u201d he lamely finished.</p><p>Max and Trenton started laughing at his frustrated tone. He guessed he deserved it with the amount of grief he\u2019d given both of them when they were having relationship issues. It didn\u2019t feel so good being on the receiving end.</p><p>\u201cAre you losing your swagger, little brother? I\u2019ve never seen you crawl before, but it seems to be a constant thing with Kinsey,\u201d Trenton mocked.</p><p>\u201cMy swagger is just fine. As a matter of fact, I have a list of available women just waiting by the phone for my call,\u201d he snapped. The thought of calling even one of them left him feeling empty.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but the one you actually want seems to think you\u2019re about as appealing as salmonella,\u201d Max added.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I seem to remember when Cassie had you crawling on your hands and knees, so you\u2019re not one to mock. And before you interrupt, Trenton, Jennifer was making you chase her all over the place,\u201d Austin smugly reminded his brothers.</p><p>They both just flashed goofy grins at him. They were so sickeningly in love, his comments didn\u2019t affect them in the least.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and look at me now. That unbelievably beautiful woman is mine,\u201d Max said, his chest puffing out. It was more than obvious Max would walk on water for her.</p><p>\u201cMaking Jennifer my wife is the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. She and the kids make me realize why dad wanted us to find someone so badly. If you think Kinsey is the one, you need to hold nothing back. Don\u2019t let her get away because, trust me, it will haunt you forever,\u201d Trenton warned.</p><p>Austin sat back and waited while Trenton talked. He knew his brother\u2019s heart was in the right place, but he was sick of people telling him what to do. What was wrong with wanting to just live for the moment? As he saw it, nothing. He liked Kinsey. Big deal. Females came and went. Yes, he wanted to be with her, but not for the rest of his life.</p><p>He grabbed a beer and took a long swallow as Max joined in and said something inaudible. Austin decided he just needed to tune both of them out. Since they\u2019d gotten married, they\u2019d become too sentimental. The thing that scared the living crap out of him was he wasn\u2019t so emphatic in his bachelorhood convictions anymore.</p><p>Another large drink of cool liquid went down his throat. His brothers were messing with his head. He had to get out of there. Maybe he\u2019d better go have a chat with Kinsey. Yes, that seemed like the thing to do.</p><p>\u201cLook, both of you,\u201d Austin finally interrupted, stopping Max mid-sentence. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing right now, but I like her, okay? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m planning on bedding her at some cheap hotel, then throwing a fifty on her pillow. She\u2019s pig-headed, irrational, over-emotional, and a royal pain in the ass, but for some reason, I can\u2019t quit thinking about her. When I next need your opinion on the status of my dating life, I\u2019ll ask, but for now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, we get it. Butt out,\u201d Max said, his lips turning up at the corners.</p><p>\u201cPaybacks a bit-\u201d Trenton tried to say.</p><p>\u201cI get it. I\u2019m sorry for all the grief I caused while you were chasing Jennifer,\u201d Austin interrupted.</p><p>\u201cHey, I wasn\u2019t chasing her. She wanted me,\u201d Trenton said, though they all knew the truth. Jennifer had taken one look at him and ran the other way. Trenton had quickly followed. It seemed all of the brothers had gone from running as fast as they could from anything that even resembled wedding bells, to sprinting down the aisle.</p><p>Was it their age? Was their mortality catching up to them? Austin didn\u2019t even want to think about that. He was only thirty-four, certainly didn\u2019t have one foot in the grave yet. It has to be stress, that\u2019s all, he reasoned with himself.</p><p>One thing he did know for sure, though, was that no matter how irritated he became with his brothers, sister, or even cousins, he would still always love them. He\u2019d also be there for any of them in a heartbeat, so it went to reason that he\u2019d also put up with their ribbing, and their long-winded advice.</p><p>That\u2019s what families did for each other. Take \u2018em or leave \u2018em.</p><p>\u201cI gotta run,\u201d Austin said as he jumped to his feet. He had to see her, talk to her. He had to be with her again. Then his life would go back to normal.</p><p>Trenton and Max said nothing as he left the room. He was sure they\u2019d start talking about their insane brother as soon as he was out of earshot, though. He didn\u2019t even care.</p><p>Austin made a beeline for the hospital. He looked at the employee parking lot and breathed a sigh of relief when he found her car in its usual place. He knew her shift had ended a half hour ago, but this was her on-call night.</p><p>Since Joseph\u2019s condition was steady and George was home, she was only on call at the hospital two nights a week, though also working five twelve-hour day shifts. Still, it made it difficult to track her down, try and get her alone.</p><p>Austin strode inside and made his way down the quiet hallway. He preferred the hospital late at night. There wasn\u2019t as much chaos as the lights were dimmed, the staff lighter, and the halls quiet.</p><p>He found her room and knocked.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>He knocked again and waited. Still, no answer. He tried the knob and found it unlocked so he peaked inside the incredibly small space.</p><p>A rush of relief filled him when he saw her curled up on the small bed with a book in her hand, a dim reading light illuminating the side of her face. She wore a pair of headphones, probably hoping to drown out any noise from the hallway.</p><p>Expectation.</p><p>Hunger.</p><p>Need.</p><p>They all filled him as his gaze took in her fragile frame. She was wearing her scrubs, but from the look of her damp hair, she must have recently climbed from the shower. He could just smell a hint of mint in the air, making his nostrils flair.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to desire her, but he couldn\u2019t deny that he did. His body urged him to move forward, while his mind reasoned for him to slow down. He was too involved, too mixed up over her.</p><p>His desire won out.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tear his gaze from her naturally pink lips, the hint of cleavage barely showing, her shapely legs curled beneath her. He knew what was underneath the unflattering scrubs, and his fingers itched to remove any barrier from their path. Her long, dark hair was resting across her shoulders. He loved it when she wore it down, the thick waves acting like a curtain. He wanted her on top of him, her hair falling forward and rubbing against his chest.</p><p>His body tightened more.</p><p>He stepped inside and closed the door, waiting for her to look up and notice him. When she did, her eyes widened as she clutched at her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou startled me,\u201d she said with a nervous laugh.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy pager hasn\u2019t gone off. Is there something wrong with Joseph?\u201d She looked concerned as she rose from the bed, her book set aside as her instincts took over and she went into nurse mode.</p><p>He was impressed with how quickly she responded. He knew if something were to happen to Joseph, she was the one he\u2019d want to help him. She was good at what she did - she\u2019d already proven that.</p><p>\u201cJoseph\u2019s fine. I wanted to talk to you,\u201d he said as he leaned closer.</p><p>She finally realized they were alone in her private room. She glanced at the closed door behind him and her eyes widened. He waited until she nervously looked back at him, and then he smiled.</p><p>There was desire burning in her eyes, and he knew it wasn\u2019t him she was afraid of. It was herself. Piece by piece, he was tearing apart her self-built walls of protection. She was going to succumb to him. She was finally going to give in to her own desires.</p><p>He knew the waiting had ended.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>Kinsey looked into the predatory eyes of Austin, feeling like a cornered mouse. She fought the trembling in her body, knowing if she let her guard down even the tiniest notch more, he\u2019d have her on her back.</p><p>She tried telling herself it wasn\u2019t worth it. She was already too used to him, looking for him each time she stepped into a room, listening for the sound of his laughter, wanting him with a burning need.</p><p>If she let him seduce her, she\u2019d be a goner, too attached to let go of him. Their one night together had been fantastic, but their tension filled days had been... too memorable. He was carving a place for himself in her heart, and she couldn\u2019t afford to let him do that.</p><p>\u201cI should go and check on him,\u201d she finally said after an uncomfortably long silence. It was taking all of her wits to remember they were talking about Joseph.</p><p>\u201cI just checked. He\u2019s in good hands right now. Katherine is asleep beside him. You don\u2019t want to disturb her, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d But I want to get the heck out of this room before I make a monumental mistake, she silently added.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, let\u2019s chat,\u201d he said as he took a step forward. She automatically retreated.</p><p>At her show of weakness, his eyes lit even more and he closed the small gap. He was like a wolf \u2013 she his prey. She was in big, big trouble.</p><p>Danger! Her brain screamed.</p><p>Shut up, her heart admonished.</p><p>The room was filled with thick, pulsing desire. With her back against the wall, she could do nothing but wait.</p><p>He was inches from her body, his arms rising as his hands created a cage around her trembling form. His scent engulfed her, a slight musk mixed with a hint of driftwood. She wanted to reach forward and run her tongue down the column of his throat, to taste him, feel his heart pumping beneath her lips. She\u2019d never taken a pulse with her tongue before...but was willing to give it a try.</p><p>She felt the heat building up as her muscles quivered. Her body was barely holding together and when he kissed her, because she knew he was going to, she thought she may explode. She closed her eyes, trying to block out at least that sense.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes to look at him with confusion. Stop what?</p><p>\u201cStop fighting it \u2013 you \u2013 me \u2013 us. Just let yourself feel,\u201d he murmured, his breath caressing her face.</p> <p>He leaned down and took her bottom lip between his teeth, gently biting down before running his tongue across the surface. He didn\u2019t take his eyes from hers, showing her the intense desire shining in their depths.</p><p>He needed her \u2013 more than a desert needed rain.</p><p>She felt lightheaded, yet powerful. She couldn\u2019t say no. She wouldn\u2019t think of anything but him if she did. If she just let herself give in, she could purge him from her system, realizing it wasn\u2019t as great as she remembered.</p><p>Hundreds of thoughts raced through her mind as she tried to reason with herself.</p><p>When his lips fully closed over hers, her mind went blank. When he sucked her tongue into his mouth, her body took over.</p><p>Kinsey\u2019s heartbeat accelerated as Austin pressed his entire body against hers. His arms were a solid cage around her, his chest pushing against her breasts, making her nipples harden as they strained toward him.</p><p>Fever rippled through her as he let go of her tongue, then chased it back into her own mouth, twining the two of them together in a dance of seduction.</p><p>He moved his hand, just a few short inches, and ran his fingers down her flushed cheek. The corner of his thumb skimming the edge of her lip as he moved a fraction of an inch back. Instinct took over as her tongue sprang out and licked the rough pad.</p><p>He groaned in pleasure, encouraging her to go on. She opened her mouth and sucked his finger inside, exulting at the savage lust in his eyes. She gently bit down before he pulled his hand out of her mouth and grabbed the back of her neck, his lips claiming her once again.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t gentle as he owned her mouth, kissing her with unadulterated need. He was possessing her, and holding nothing back in the process.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he growled as he leaned back far enough to pull her scrub top over her head. Before she could take a breath, he kissed her again, igniting the inferno her body had become.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she cried when his hand lifted up and cupped her breast, kneading it as his thumb rubbed her nipple. She didn\u2019t want even the thin piece of lace between his hands and her flesh.</p><p>This was what she\u2019d needed all along. Austin. Only Austin. Since the night he\u2019d taken her so long ago, this was inevitable. He filled a need in her no one else could fill. He gave her pleasure no one else could come close to giving her. He made her heart beat.</p><p>Moving his other hand down her body, he tightly gripped the soft flesh of her behind as he pushed his erection against her core. She met his movements, wanting the clothes gone, but not wanting to break away from him long enough to remove them.</p><p>As he groaned her name, anticipation built. Her desire multiplied with the power of knowing what she was doing to him. He needed her, and she had to please him, just as she knew he\u2019d give her more pleasure than any one person deserved.</p><p>When he pulled his lips from hers, she whimpered in protest, her lips tingling with the need to be taken again. Then his tongue ran down her jaw and followed the smooth line of her throat to where her pulse was pounding against her skin.</p><p>He nibbled his way across her collarbone, smoothly licking each spot, causing heat to cascade over her in wave after wave. She moved her neck, silently begging for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cI want you so much, Kinsey. I think of nothing but you. I need to push deep inside your body, and feel your nipples rubbing against my chest. I have to sink my tongue into the very core of you while you scream in pleasure. I can\u2019t stop until you\u2019re shaking in my arms as I make you cum over and over again,\u201d he whispered before biting down on the edge of her earlobe.</p><p>She was done. Her legs gave out as she sagged against him. With the smallest of touches she was going to explode in his arms. Never before had a man brought her so close to the brink of ecstasy with only his words. But then, Austin wasn\u2019t just any man.</p><p>His hips held her against the wall as he undid her bra and brought both hands up to cup her naked breasts, taking her nipples between his fingers and pinching them as he rolled and tugged them hard. She wouldn\u2019t be able to bear much more.</p><p>\u201cNow, please, now,\u201d she demanded. No more denial. No more waiting.</p><p>His hands left her breasts and she moaned her disappointment. No! He needed to keep touching her. In a quick motion, he stepped back, lifting her up before she dissolved to the floor.</p><p>Before placing her on the bed, his head bent and he took her nipple into his mouth, sucking her deep inside, his tongue sweeping across the hardened peak. He let go only so he could claim the other one, giving it equal attention as his teeth scraped across the pink bud.</p><p>He dropped her the last few inches to the bed, making her body bounce on the soft cushion. She looked at him with confusion until he started ripping his clothes off. In a matter of seconds he stood before her in all his magnificent glory.</p><p>His large arousal looked like it was pulsing as he stepped forward, the head glistening. Before he could lay down, she quickly sat up, surprised she even could.</p><p>\u201cI need to taste you,\u201d she said before grabbing his satin covered steel and tugging. He stumbled the last inch to her, giving her all the access she needed.</p><p>\u201cAh, Kinsey, no...\u201d he protested in a guttural groan as she took him deep inside her mouth, sucking his throbbing flesh.</p><p>She responded to his protest by running her tongue across his silky head, tasting his pleasure on her tongue. He said no, but his hands gripped her head as she moved up and down his erection, sucking him deeper with each stroke.</p><p>\u201cNo more,\u201d he cried, grabbing her hair and pulling her away.</p><p>She cried out her displeasure at him making her stop. He bent down and grabbed a package from his pants pocket, quickly slipping a condom on. She got over her frustration of him pulling from her mouth when his body covered hers and he kissed her again.</p><p>His hands moved up and down her naked torso, grazing the edges of her breasts as the light dusting of hair on his chest teased her nipples. He ground his naked hips into her still covered core, making her whimper.</p><p>She needed the pants gone. She had to have him inside her.</p><p>Nothing and no one outside their bubble existed. Only Austin. Only her. He moved his head again and nibbled down her throat, then slowly kissed the tops of her breasts. His tongue swirled around the edges of her nipples, wetting the area before he finally sucked each straining bud into his mouth, moving back and forth. When he lifted his head and blew on each one, she strained her hips against him, rubbing, grinding, seeking...</p><p>\u201cPlease, no more. I need... please...\u201d she sobbed. Her head moved from side to side as she gripped the bed.</p><p>He shifted and then his hands were finally on the waistband of her scrubs, pulling them, and her panties, in one smooth motion down her legs. With his foot, he pushed off her shoes, never stopping the downward removal of the final pieces of her clothes.</p><p>He quickly moved back up her body, finally lying on her skin to skin. His heat was scalding as he pressed fully against her, his manhood pressing against her wet entrance. She spread her legs, opening herself up to him, encouraging him to fill her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I need you too much,\u201d he groaned as he finally started sliding inside.</p><p>She groaned as he stretched her skin. She couldn\u2019t even answer him to say she didn\u2019t want to wait. She wanted what he was giving her. She twisted against him, opening her thighs wider, letting her body speak for her.</p><p>With a hard thrust, he buried himself fully, his hips meeting against hers, stretching her small body to the point she didn\u2019t know if she could handle him. Her stomach tensed as she took his entire girth, her body trying to adjust.</p><p>His eyes closed as he moved backward, before thrusting forward again, his thick shaft easily sliding in and out of her wet core.</p><p>\u201cSo wet, you\u2019re so wet,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>That did it for her. As he slammed hard back inside her, his shaft buried to the hilt, his skin rubbing against her sensitive flesh, she fell apart, her body exploding as pleasure washed through her, wave after wave of unbelievable pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It went on and on, her body clenching around him, the feel of his hard manhood inside her, intensifying the orgasm.</p><p>When the tremors finally slowed, she opened her eyes and looked into Austin\u2019s. His face was tense, sweat dripping from his brow, down his cheeks. His teeth were locked together, and fire was burning in his eyes.</p><p>She realized he was very gently moving in and out of her body, prolonging her own pleasure even though it was obviously painful for him. Her heart nearly exploded as it pounded. She was losing her carefully created wall, falling for him, falling hard.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d she said as she pulled his face to hers, lifting her hips to greet his next thrust into her.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t say anything as his lips greedily took hers, his tongue mimicking the movement of his hips, thrusting in and out of her, faster and faster.</p><p>With one hand, he reached beneath her hip, gripping her butt in his hand, pulling against her harder with each downward movement. As he pushed into her, she felt her stomach tighten, her body building up pressure again. She didn\u2019t know how it was possible, but she was on the brink of intense pleasure again.</p><p>Her nipples strained into his hard, dark chest, her core pulsed against his solid steel. She reached for the sky, seeking...needing...</p><p>\u201cYes, Kinsey,\u201d he cried as he pushed hard into her, his full weight sinking on top of her. She felt him pulsing inside her as he groaned, and that sent her back over the top. She cried out with him as the rest of the world ceased to exist. Pleasure. Only pleasure lingered.</p><p>Kinsey drifted between consciousness and sleep, barely acknowledging when Austin rose. She couldn\u2019t open her eyes. She commanded them to open, but they wouldn\u2019t cooperate. She felt the bed move, then felt him touch her feet.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t...\u201d she moaned, not even able to compose a whole sentence.</p><p>She heard him laugh, a rich, deep, satisfied laugh. She wanted to open her eyes, wanted to see his face lit up with pleasure, but her lids wouldn\u2019t cooperate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting you dressed, Kinsey. You\u2019re still on-call...\u201d his voice faded as his fingers slid up her thighs, pulling her scrub bottoms back into place.</p><p>She knew she should be horrified, shocked that she would make love to him at work, but she felt too good to care.</p><p>Maybe when she woke...</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>\u201cOoh, Kinsey, you two look so cute!\u201d</p><p>Kinsey groggily woke up, feeling like she couldn\u2019t breathe. There was an enormous pressure on her chest, and she almost panicked wondering what had her trapped. She snapped her eyes open and looked into the slowly opening lids of Austin\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he mumbled as he bent down and kissed her, his lips gently caressing hers for a moment, instantly causing heat. He started deepening the kiss as he pressed his rapidly rising arousal against her, making her ache deepen.</p><p>\u201cUm, hello?\u201d</p><p>Kinsey and Austin both froze as they turned their heads. Normally, Kinsey would find the expression on his face comical, but not when she was caught with him on top of her. She pushed her arms against his chest, and he leaned back. She took in a deep breath, her lungs finally able to fill with air.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt, but I\u2019ve been looking all over for you. We have an appointment in a half hour and you haven\u2019t been answering your phone. Now I see why,\u201d Cassie said with a wink, mortifying Kinsey even more.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Cassie. Can you go away for a few minutes?\u201d Austin asked as if nothing was wrong.</p><p>\u201cOnly a few minutes? Wow, Austin,\u201d she goaded him.</p> <p>Kinsey sent her best friend a pleading look, which Cassie pretended not to see.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll meet you in Joseph\u2019s room,\u201d she said before shutting the door behind her. Austin turned back to her and bent down like he was going to kiss her again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Kinsey said as she quickly scrambled to her feet and held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kinsey. Last night was great,\u201d he said as he followed her.</p><p>\u201cStop right there, Austin. I can\u2019t think when you touch me,\u201d she admitted, then wanted to sew her mouth shut when he gave her a cocky grin.</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with that, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she said in a panic, then skirted around him and flew out the door. She didn\u2019t turn to see if he was following. She ran for the nearest bathroom and locked herself inside. When she looked in the mirror, she groaned. Her hair was sticking up in all directions, her lips swollen from his savage kisses, and when she brushed her hair aside, she turned scarlet as she noticed the slight bruising on her neck.</p><p>She had a freaking hickey!</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had one of those since high school.</p><p>She did her best to untangle her hair, pulling it forward over her neck, then rinsed her mouth out, using a paper towel to brush her teeth. It was as good as it was going to get until she snuck back to her room, hoping he was gone.</p><p>She slowly opened the door and peaked both ways before deeming it safe, then she rushed back to her small room. She breathed easier when she found it empty.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even have time to sit and think about her actions. She had to meet up with Cassie, who she knew was going to grill her worse than a prison interrogator.</p><p>Kinsey left her room and tried to walk with confidence down the hall. She peeked in Joseph\u2019s door, grateful when she noticed Austin wasn\u2019t there. It was only Katherine and Cassie. She felt her heart calm a little.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Katherine. How is Joseph this morning?\u201d she asked as she walked over and looked at his chart. There\u2019d been no changes the night before.</p><p>\u201cI know this sounds silly since the night nurse said nothing was different, but I feel something. I think he\u2019s getting ready to come back to me,\u201d Katherine said with a serene smile.</p><p>Kinsey envied the unbreakable connection between Joseph and Katherine. How would it feel to have someone love her so much, they never lost faith?</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d Kinsey agreed. There was no way Joseph could stay away for long. Not with a woman as remarkable as Katherine waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to leave?\u201d Cassie asked.</p><p>Kinsey wanted to say no. She knew the inquisition was coming and she needed to gather herself together before Cassie grilled her. She thought quickly of a reason to stay. Her mind raced as sweat broke out on her brow.</p><p>Got it!</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019re supposed to get pedicures, but I\u2019ve been hanging by a thread while waiting for Katherine to tell us more about her romance with Joseph,\u201d Kinsey said with almost giddy relief. She knew Cassie would want to hear the story continued, also.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Emily said as she stepped into the room with Amy and Jessica. \u201cWe rushed down here this morning with snacks and a do not disturb sign.\u201d</p><p>The three women pulled up chairs and looked expectantly at Katherine, who looked at the five women before her.</p><p>\u201cEach one of you are so beautiful, inside and out. I\u2019m so happy to have you be a part of my family,\u201d Katherine said, making eye-contact with each woman, including Kinsey.</p><p>Kinsey shifted uncomfortably on her feet. She didn\u2019t know if Katherine knew about her and Austin, but even if she did, Kinsey having sex with her nephew, didn\u2019t make her a part of the family.</p><p>\u201cWe love having you as family,\u201d Jennifer said as she stepped inside the room and brushed away a tear. \u201cSorry, these dang pregnancy hormones are killing me,\u201d she added with a giggle.</p><p>Kinsey looked down at Jennifer\u2019s petite frame, her belly just starting to show. She felt her own internal clock start ticking. Her hand grazed her flat stomach as she wondered what it would be like to carry a life inside her.</p><p>\u201cI can help you with that,\u201d Austin whispered in her ear, making her jump. She hadn\u2019t even heard him enter the room. His words sent a shiver down her spine. She could picture a little dark haired boy with bright blue eyes lying in her arms. She almost ached for the child. She knew he didn\u2019t really mean the words. He just wanted to get her back underneath him.</p><p>\u201cThis is a hospital room, brother. You may want to watch the hands,\u201d Trenton said as he walked in the room behind Jennifer. Trenton smiled at Kinsey in a knowing way, then winked. She quickly looked at the floor.</p><p>She finally realized Austin\u2019s hands were resting at the top of her butt, his thumbs dropping dangerously low. She tried to pull back, but he curled his arms around her waist and pulled her flush against his body.</p><p>All eyes in the room turned to the two of them. She didn\u2019t want to cause a scene, but she hated being the center of attention. She knew her face was flaming. As Austin\u2019s fingers caressed her hip, she melted. He was messing with her head, causing all kinds of confusion.</p><p>\u201cOh, leave them alone, Trenton. There used to be a time you couldn\u2019t keep your hands off me, either,\u201d Jennifer scolded her husband.</p><p>\u201cUsed to be a time,\u201d Trenton said in mock outrage before he gathered his wife in his arms and kissed her so intimately, Kinsey felt like an intruder.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re forgiven,\u201d Jennifer said breathlessly a few moments later when Trenton released her lips. Trenton turned her in his arms, not willing to let her go, as he backed up to a seat, pulling her onto his lap. Jennifer actually giggled as she laid her head back to rest against his chest.</p><p>Austin pulled Kinsey to the couch against the far wall of the room. He sat down, pulling her beside him. His arm wrapped around her shoulders, trapping her against the side of his chest. She was too embarrassed to look up and see if everyone was still watching the two of them.</p><p>His hand rubbed along the side of her neck, making her wish they were alone \u2013 one touch from him and she was putty in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI guess I can continue the story. Where exactly was I? Oh yes, so the day after Joseph left, after making such an ass of himself in front of my neighbors, I had to deal with the aftermath,\u201d Katherine began.</p><p>All attention focused solely on Katherine as she began reflecting back...</p><p>\u201cYou have to spill. Is he an escort? Honestly, I don\u2019t even care if he was hired, just as long as you give me the number to his service.\u201d</p><p>Katherine took a deep breath in, then slowly blew it out. She was standing in her doorway, her hair a mess, her robe having seen better days, and with what she was sure was atrocious morning breath.</p><p>Her neighbor hadn\u2019t wasted any time whatsoever in knocking on her door, first thing in the morning so she could get the scoop on the hunk in the hallway the night before.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t even drunk. He\u2019s an old friend who I haven\u2019t talked to in a very long time, and he showed up unannounced. I wasn\u2019t going to let him in, so being the stubborn fool he is, he decided to embarrass me to get his way,\u201d Katherine said.</p><p>She could see by the look in her neighbor\u2019s eye\u2019s that she didn\u2019t believe her. Katherine tried not to let it bother her, but she cared what people thought of her. She in no way wanted anyone to think she\u2019d been at some bar picking up strange men, or worse, calling an escort service.</p><p>\u201cFine, keep it to yourself. Rumors will just continue to spread, though. It\u2019s better to fess up and tell us.\u201d</p><p>Katherine decided right then that it was time to move. The hassle of dealing with gossip over her sex life for the next few months just wasn\u2019t worth staying. Her neighbors had no lives, so her love-life would be their entertainment until the next big event happened to take their minds off of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, Penny...\u201d Katherine started to say when Penny\u2019s eyes widened as she looked over Katherine\u2019s shoulder. Katherine decided she didn\u2019t want to turn around and find out what was causing the stunned look on her neighbor\u2019s face. Joseph was probably back. He tended to have that effect on women.</p><p>\u201cHoly mackerel, how in the heck do you get all these gods beating down your door? I\u2019ll pay you to teach me your secrets,\u201d Penny reverently muttered.</p><p>\u201cPenny, I explained to you already that Joseph is just an old friend,\u201d Katherine snapped, losing all semblance of patience with the woman.</p><p>\u201cWell, you may have been a lot more believable if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Zeus number two is currently walking toward us with an earth shattering smile plastered on his face. Oh my gosh, you have to give me the number.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine felt a chill run down her spine. There weren\u2019t many men she knew who could inspire that kind of reaction in women. The drop to your knees, strip naked, and roll over look that had come into her neighbor\u2019s eyes. She had a really bad feeling...</p><p>She slowly turned, her eyes rising up the custom fitted slacks and button up shirt, open at the neck, showing a glimpse of his smooth chest. As she finally met his eyes, her heart pounded and rage took over her temporary shock.</p><p>George.</p><p>How dare he show up. He saddled over to her and leaned in for a hug. Without conscious thought, she raised her arm and slugged him square in the jaw.</p><p>His smile faltered as he looked at her with astonishment. It took about three seconds before Katherine felt a searing pain shoot from her knuckles all the way up her arm. His jaw felt solid as granite.</p> <p>Tears welled up in her eyes as she gripped her hand and jumped back.</p><p>George\u2019s eyes immediately looked down, concern radiating from their deep blue depths.</p><p>\u201cKatherine, you should be more careful,\u201d he uttered as he reached toward her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare touch me,\u201d she snarled. He seemed amused because the corners of his lips turned up. It seemed she wasn\u2019t as intimidating as she wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Penny said as she gained back the ability to speak. She crept up right next to George, her barely clad breasts rubbing against his arm as she introduced herself. \u201cI\u2019m Penny.\u201d</p><p>Katherine looked on in shock as the woman actually batted her eyelids. She shouldn\u2019t be shocked. When she\u2019d dated Joseph, and thought George was her friend, she\u2019d seen countless women throw themselves at the two men. George had always shamelessly flirted back, but she\u2019d been so impressed when Joseph had seemed to not even notice them. She guessed it had all been an act for her benefit, though.</p> <p>Without even acknowledging Penny, George took Katherine\u2019s arm and pushed his way inside her apartment. He shut the door in the face of her stunned neighbor. It was almost comical enough to make Katherine laugh. Almost.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Katherine. I think it's long past the time for me to explain my actions,\u201d George said as he led her to the couch. He walked away, making her wonder what he was doing. She heard some noise from her kitchen, then he was back with ice wrapped in a towel. \u201cPut this on your hand and it will feel better soon. It doesn\u2019t look broken, you most likely just bruised it.\u201d</p><p>He acted as if her punch had done nothing to him, which wasn\u2019t fair, considering that her hand was throbbing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, George. I think you\u2019ve done enough damage already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, my friend. There are a lot of misunderstandings from our time five years ago, but if you give me a half-hour, I can explain...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to explain. You and your brother like to play games with innocent girls. No problem, I get it. I was just stupid enough to think you were my friend, and even more stupid to believe Joseph loved me. Good job,\u201d she said with sarcasm.</p><p>Katherine was barely hanging on to her anger. If she let it go, she\u2019d internally combust and be nothing but a pile of ash. The temporary Band-Aid placed over her emotional wounds had been quickly ripped off, leaving her hurts fully exposed to the elements around her. Seeing Joseph, and then George, was almost unbearable. It was like looking at that coveted toy in a store window, only a thin piece of glass separating her from it, but having it be just out of reach. She knew the men were out of her reach. She couldn\u2019t ever trust George to be her friend again, and certainly couldn\u2019t trust Joseph with her heart anymore.</p><p>He\u2019d abused it too badly.</p> <p>\u201cKatherine, I\u2019m here to beg for forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Do you and Joseph have another bet. Which of you will I forgive first? The lover or the friend?\u201d</p><p>George leaned close to her, and took her uninjured hand in his. When she tugged, he refused to release it. Reluctantly, she finally looked up and met his pain filled eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was a fool. You truly were my friend, really my best friend. I was arrogant and immature, and now Joseph and I barely speak. Everything\u2019s changed,\u201d he said, his voice filled with so much emotion, she couldn\u2019t pull away from him. Was he actually speaking the truth?</p><p>Katherine was silent as her gaze raked over him. Even though, he and Joseph were twin brothers, they weren\u2019t identical. Both men were superbly good-looking, but she\u2019d never once felt desire toward George.</p><p>She\u2019d felt love, the kind of love one would feel toward a sibling. He\u2019d become her best friend, and the betrayal of the two men had wounded her to her very center. She\u2019d not only lost the love of her life, but also the best friend she\u2019d needed so badly to help her make it through.</p><p>Usually when you went through heartbreak, you at least had your friend to turn to. In her case she\u2019d been doubly devastated because she\u2019d lost both in one day.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve it, and if I was a better man, I\u2019d stay out of your life, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve missed you and I need you to know what happened,\u201d he said.</p><p>She hated to admit it, even to herself, but she\u2019d missed him, too. Missed him so much it hurt to sit there with him in her tiny apartment and try to hold onto her resentment. Her fragile emotions were about to splinter into a million pieces. She had to let him say what he needed to so he\u2019d leave and she could have a breakdown.</p><p>\u201cFine, George, go ahead and speak, but I\u2019m telling you now that if I detect even the tiniest piece of deception in your story, I\u2019m going to find something a lot stronger than my fist to hit you over the head with,\u201d Katherine warned.</p><p>George laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners. She had to remind herself how he\u2019d deceived her, because it would be too easy to fall back into her old routine with him. He\u2019d always brought laughter and joy to the forefront, wherever they happened to be.</p><p>\u201cI deserve your anger, Katherine. It took me a while, but I finally figured out that you somehow found out about the bet,\u201d he stated, cringing as he said the last word.</p><p>Katherine glared at him, not even bothering to respond to his statement. Of course she knew about the bet. It had nearly destroyed her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to explain...\u201d</p><p>Katherine held up her hand, stopping him mid-sentence. It felt like she was back at that day, finding out all over again how little they thought of her. She didn\u2019t think she could listen to him, resurrecting those old feelings of hurt and betrayal. Her chest hurt as she looked at him, anger and humiliation seeping from every pore.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try and tell me you didn\u2019t have a bet. Don\u2019t even try and insult my intelligence like that, George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, I can\u2019t deny that. But, please listen. You promised to give me a few minutes. Let me explain what happened, though it will never excuse what I did,\u201d he pled.</p><p>Katherine sat back, her arms folded across her chest. She was on the verge of tears, only her shear will was keeping her from releasing them. It hurt so much worse to silently listen as he explained how little he\u2019d thought of her. He needed to relieve his conscious, though, even if it meant tearing her apart.</p><p>\u201cI was resentful of Joseph. There were a few years that I actually hated him. He made everything look so easy. He just seemed to have the Midas touch. If he decided he wanted to do something, then it was almost done before he even finished the thought. He was better at sports, academics, and women. Every single thing he set out to conquer, he conquered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does any of that have to do with this?\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there. But to fully understand, you need to know the history. When we were young, I adored Joseph. He grew faster than me, and instead of looking at him like a twin, it was almost as if he was an older sibling. Even at a young age, Joseph was taking the world by storm. I was content to follow behind in his shadow. At least for a while,\u201d George said as he sat back. Katherine wasn\u2019t sure if he even realized she was in the room anymore.</p><p>\u201cAll siblings\u2019 fight, that\u2019s nothing new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, all siblings fight, but then they make up. I remember the moment I stopped idolizing Joseph and started to resent him. We were in the seventh grade. A new girl moved into our school, and I fell hard for her. Yes, I know, I was only a kid, but to me it was true love. She was shy, and sweet, and so pretty. A Valentine\u2019s dance was coming up and it took me a week to work up the courage, but I finally decided to ask her to be my date. I picked her out a nice necklace, and decided to wait until after school. I\u2019d told Joseph I had a crush on her, but I hadn\u2019t gone into many details. At lunch that day, he asked her to the dance, and she said, yes. I was devastated. Looking back, I had barely said anything about her to Joseph, so he didn\u2019t really know, but to me he\u2019d just stolen the only thing I\u2019d asked to keep for myself.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension left Katherine\u2019s body as George talked. She could hear the confusion and hurt from so many years ago, and she found herself wanting to comfort him. She had to make herself keep her defenses up, but it was becoming increasingly more difficult.</p><p>\u201cHe took her to the dance, and they decided they wanted to be friends and nothing more, but she was tainted to me after that. I didn\u2019t see her the same way. She tried to talk to me the following Monday during lunch as we\u2019d been doing for months, and I snubbed her. I don\u2019t think she ever realized why I suddenly stopped being her friend. She ended up moving two years later and I never did explain it to her.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey felt bad for the shy teenager. She\u2019d been the exact same way, too afraid of rejection to put herself out there. It was silly when she thought about it, but one thing she hadn\u2019t figured out how to do was go back in time and slap herself upside the head.</p><p>After that, I pulled away from Joseph. He was so popular and always busy so he didn\u2019t notice until the bond was severed beyond repair. In high school he asked me if we had a problem, and I acted like there wasn\u2019t one. I told him I was busy with school and different activities. He believed me, but he started pulling from me as well. We continued drifting apart. To this day, we hardly ever talk. I miss my brother. He was my best friend and I let jealousy tear us in two.\u201d</p><p>George choked as he spoke the last sentence. Katherine couldn\u2019t hold the tears off any longer, and one fell from her eye, slowly sliding down her cheek. He looked at her and gave her a semblance of a smile before carefully lifting his hand and wiping the lone tear with the soft pad of his thumb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you, or wallow in self-pity. It\u2019s just that sometimes it really gets to me,\u201d he apologized.</p><p>\u201cI also cry during those sappy coffee commercials so don\u2019t be too hard on yourself,\u201d Katherine told him with a depreciating laugh.</p><p>\u201cThe years continued slipping away from us, one right after the other and all of a sudden we were adults and still had this strange distance between us, but added to that was a new competition. I was determined to beat him at anything. I wanted to watch him fall on his face, to see the all perfect Joseph Anderson fail. We saw you at the dance, and I overheard some of the girls talking about you, calling you the ice queen.\u201d</p><p>At least he had the decency to cringe as he said it. Katherine still felt hurt about those days. Her shyness was taken as condescending. Her choosiness in men as snobbery. She hadn\u2019t wanted to make the mistakes she\u2019d watched her mother make.</p> <p>\u201cBefore I thought about your feelings, I goaded Joseph. I bet him there was at least one girl at the dance he wouldn\u2019t be able to make fall all over him. Since he\u2019d never had that happen, he felt pretty sure in accepting the challenge. He hadn\u2019t heard the girls talking. I pointed you out, and his eyes widened when he took you in for the first time. I think he was instantly smitten. As he approached you and asked for a dance, I had a smirk on my face, expecting you to snub him and walk away. When you accepted with a pure, sweet smile, I realized my mistake. No girl can fake that innocence. I instantly regretted the bet, knowing it was all going to go south. When you danced straight through the next three songs, and I saw the way you looked at him, I felt like the lowest of the low.\u201d</p><p>Katherine didn\u2019t even realize her cheeks were wet from her tears. As he talked about that night five years ago, it was as if she was living it all over again. She remembered it like yesterday, how she felt when the most eligible bachelor in the room had walked up and asked her to dance. How his laughter had brightened her world. By the end of the night she was half-way in love with him, by the end of the month, she was over the moon in love.</p><p>\u201cWhen the two of you became a couple and you were at our home all the time, I got to know you, see why Joseph was spending every moment with you. I truly did love you as a friend. The bet was long forgotten, and you were starting to bridge that gap between my brother and me. Your insistence we do things together, your pureness, everything about you drew me in.\u201d</p><p>George paused long enough that Katherine asked her own question. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about the bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you would hate me. How did you find out about it, anyway? I never brought it up again.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine thought about making him suffer, letting his life-changing bet haunt him the rest of his life as it did her, but then she wasn\u2019t that kind of person.</p><p>\u201cYou did bring it up, at least one more time. I overheard you and Joseph talking one day. After that, well, you know the rest...\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s eyes rounded as he thought back and remembered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Katherine, more than I could ever express. I know it doesn\u2019t take anything back, but I truly am sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t matter anymore, George. It was years ago and I\u2019ve moved on with my life. You may have regretted the bet, but a bet\u2019s all I was to Joseph \u2013 a foolish prize to be won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Katherine. I never before, and have never since, seen him look at someone the way he gazed at you that night and the months that followed,\u201d George insisted.</p><p>She wanted to believe his words, but how could she trust him. She was scared to open that door again. Afraid to be hurt any more than she already had been.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did it take you so many years to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>Her question wasn\u2019t asked in anger or even resentment. She was perplexed as she began to believe his words.</p><p>\u201cI was a fool. I was so embarrassed about my behavior, I figured you were better off without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why come back now? Why not just continue staying away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI moved to Chicago, fled was more like it. I was trying to outrun my demons. After a couple years, I realized they were within me and no matter where I went, they\u2019d continue to be my constant shadow. Then, last year, I got married to a wonderful woman, who\u2019s brought joy back into my life, and loves me enough to want all of me \u2013 not the shell of a man I\u2019d become. She\u2019s been helping me heal. I came home to make amends. I need to try to clear past wrongs and I needed to tell you the truth.\u201d</p><p>Katherine looked at him, saw the truth in his eyes, and she knew she had her friend back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, George.\u201d She let it go. Continuing to hold a grudge against him for making a stupid bet before he knew who she was made her no better than the fool he was when he made it. His true colors had shown when he\u2019d befriended her, spent hours talking to her and brought excitement into her life. He\u2019d never been anything but respectful to her. She\u2019d missed him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve your forgiveness, nor your friendship, but I\u2019m not going to refuse it. I\u2019ve missed you, too, Katherine,\u201d he said as he moved over and engulfed her in a bear hug. She returned the hug, glad to have one wrong in her life fixed.</p> <p>\u201cKatherine, you always have been too forgiving,\u201d George admonished, bringing Katherine back to the present, reality hitting her hard.</p><p>She looked at the bed where her husband was lying so still. He looked as if he was doing nothing more than taking a nap. If it wasn\u2019t for all the monitors hooked up to him, she may be able to actually believe that\u2019s all it was.</p><p>\u201cHi, George, I didn\u2019t hear you come in,\u201d Katherine said with a fond smile.</p><p>\u201cI had to sneak so I could listen in. I think you\u2019re making me out too well, actually. I was so horrible back then,\u201d he said with remembered pain in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI forgave you from that moment, George Anderson, and I\u2019ve never regretted it. You\u2019re a great man and you haven\u2019t deserved the moments of unhappiness in your life. I\u2019m so glad you and Joseph finally came around,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWe probably never would\u2019ve if it hadn\u2019t been for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, what happened?\u201d Cassie questioned, sitting on the edge of her seat. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not stopping again. You always leave us hanging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetie, but I\u2019ve had enough remembering for one night. We\u2019ll continue the story soon,\u201d Katherine promised.</p><p>It was both joyous and painful to remember the past. Even though it had been many years ago, it seemed like only yesterday to her. She\u2019d fought so hard to keep her heart safe from Joseph, when all along he only wanted to cherish her.</p><p>\u201cWe understand, Aunt Katherine,\u201d Cassie replied, and the others in the room agreed as they rose from their chairs, each stopping and kissing Katherine on the cheek before they exited.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d Katherine told them, then walked out on George\u2019s arm. He was still a great friend, and support system in her life.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cI caught the two of them kissing behind the garage last night. I almost stumbled right into them. Thank goodness I looked up at the last minute. I quickly ducked behind the wall. Then I was stuck there for about fifteen minutes while the two of them giggled in between kisses. They were acting like teenagers who\u2019d gotten away with sneaking out of the house,\u201d Lucas said with a smile.</p><p>The entire family had gathered to discuss the secret romance between George and Esther. The two of them wouldn\u2019t admit they were a couple for some reason, and none of the family understood why.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think they won\u2019t tell us they\u2019re dating? It seems pretty serious,\u201d Trenton asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s serious. Last night when I left the hospital, I found the two of them smooching in the stairwell. I had to quietly go back upstairs and then go down the elevator, so they wouldn\u2019t know I was there,\u201d Austin said.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the first incident any of you can recall? Let\u2019s try and figure out how long they\u2019ve been together,\u201d Max suggested.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I got suspicious was about six months ago at Jasmine\u2019s birthday party. They were giving each other flirtatious looks all night, and then went into the house to bring out some extra chips, and didn\u2019t return for thirty minutes. It doesn\u2019t take that long to open a bag of Doritos,\u201d Amy said.</p><p>\u201cCan anyone remember anything earlier than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, yes, I do,\u201d Emily eagerly replied. \u201cIt was last year at Mom and Dad\u2019s anniversary party. George leaned down and said something to Esther that had her turning scarlet. I thought it was kind of cute, so I watched as George gave her a wink then left the room. About two minutes later, Esther glanced around, so I looked away, and then when I looked up again, she was going through the same door. Neither of them came back until it was time for dinner. I think it was about an hour. A lot can happen in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s definitely suspicious,\u201d Cassie said with an animated smile.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>The room full of siblings and cousins looked at each other while everyone shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so it looks like they\u2019ve been dating for at least a year, probably longer if they were already sneaking out of the room for over an hour at a time,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cThen the big mystery to solve is why they\u2019re keeping it a secret from us,\u201d Jennifer said.</p><p>Everyone was silent for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he believes we\u2019d be upset because of mom, do you?\u201d Bree asked. They looked at one another perplexed.</p><p>\u201cNo, I honestly don\u2019t think that would be it. He knows we all adore Esther. I think he\u2019s scared,\u201d Mark said, quite enjoying his thought.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to tell me after all the grief both him and Uncle Joseph have given us, he\u2019s afraid to take a walk down the aisle,\u201d Trenton said in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cSounds like Mark might be on to something,\u201d Max agreed.</p><p>\u201cWell then, what are we going to do to get them to come out in the open?\u201d Austin asked with evil delight.</p><p>\u201cI think we start beating them at their own game. Instead of hiding when we run into them, let\u2019s not give them a single moment of peace. Then we\u2019ll see how much longer they\u2019re able to keep things a secret,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cI love that. I\u2019d hate to never get to be alone with Chad,\u201d Bree said while clapping her hands. Chad leaned over, giving her a kiss, and she snuggled into his arms.</p><p>\u201cCome on, you two. We\u2019re trying to work here,\u201d Austin grumbled.</p><p>He was the only one in the room without someone in his arms. Kinsey was working at the hospital and he was already missing her. He would\u2019ve been there at that moment if his family hadn\u2019t called an emergency meeting.</p><p>After another hour of planning, they had it worked out. If they didn\u2019t have George and Esther come out in the open within a week, two at most, they\u2019d come up with plan B. They didn\u2019t see that happening, though, because what they had planned for the couple was going to drive them batty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Day One</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad I caught you, Esther. I need your help,\u201d Amy said as she walked into the family den and spotted George and Esther on the couch. She had to hide her smile when she saw the two of them quickly jump apart.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, dear?\u201d Esther asked, her voice sounding a bit breathless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m filling in for Lucas\u2019s assistant this week and it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve worked there, I\u2019m simply lost. Would you please come into the office and give me a hand? You know how my husband is when the paperwork starts stacking up,\u201d Amy asked, very proud of how sincere her voice sounded.</p> <p>In reality, she was excited to spend the week in the office. Plus, she could do the work with her eyes closed. She always filled in when Lucas needed her. After all, that\u2019s how the two of them met. She almost blushed thinking about last month. She\u2019d filled in for the day, and Lucas had in turn, filled her. She clenched her thighs remembering him clearing the desk and taking her for hours. Neither of them got much work done.</p><p>Sometimes with the children and family schedules, they didn\u2019t get to make love as often as they had in the beginning. Her day at the office had made her feel desired again. She was hoping for a repeat performance that week, but Monday was her day to run interference between George and Esther. That was okay, though \u2013 she always had Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cNow Amy, Esther\u2019s retired. She may not feel like going in,\u201d George grumbled. Amy made herself widen her eyes like she was just about to break down if that were the case. She turned her pathetic look on Esther, who looked at her like a deer caught in headlights.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, George. Of course, I\u2019d love to spend the day with Amy at the office. It will be like old times,\u201d Esther said. She sounded both happy and disappointed at the same time. Amy wondered what the two of them had planned that day.</p><p>\u201cI can give you a ride there and pick you back up if you want. That way you only have to work a half day,\u201d George offered hopefully.</p> <p>\u201cOh no, Uncle George. There\u2019s a huge file Lucas was talking about. I guess it\u2019s a really old account, but one that Esther knew well. I can\u2019t exactly remember, something about Mercer Wents,\u201d she said, acting clueless.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean Mentor West?\u201d Esther asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d Amy said.</p><p>Esther sighed, her shoulders sagging a bit before she straightened them.</p><p>\u201cYes, no need for a ride, George, but thank you for the kind offer. Mentor West is a very old client, and they\u2019re quite picky. They insist on having multiple copies of the contracts sent throughout the day. They take an actual red pen and cross words off, then fax it back and make you redo it. The worst day I had with them was when they sent it back thirty-two times. I was at the office until midnight that day,\u201d she said with a sigh.</p><p>If Esther knew that it was Lucas on the other end of that fax line this time, she\u2019d take his head off. Amy turned and coughed to hide her laugh.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ahead and see if Bree wants to have lunch at that new little Italian diner by the water?\u201d Esther asked George.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s too late for them to get a reservation. Even with connections, it takes at least a month to get in. I heard the food is so fantastic it practically melts on your tongue. The service is supposed to be five-star plus,\u201d Amy said.</p><p>\u201cI actually got reservations a while back that I was telling Esther about. I was going to... um... figure out who I was taking, and Esther was giving me ideas,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bree will love that. Great idea, Uncle George. Come on, Esther. We don\u2019t want to be late,\u201d Amy said, sticking out her arm.</p><p>Amy could see Esther was struggling with how to get two seconds alone with George. When she finally figured out Amy wasn\u2019t leaving without her, she stood up, nodded at George and followed Amy from the room.</p><p>As they walked down the hall, Amy almost felt guilty about making her miss a very romantic lunch. She had to remember all the kids were more than a little suspicious their father\u2019s had done plenty of their own meddling in their lives. Payback was justified.</p><p>\u201cYou and George have become such good friends. I\u2019m glad he has you to lean on,\u201d Amy said as they entered the car.</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s a good man. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m friends with all of your family, dear,\u201d Esther said, not giving even an inch.</p> <p>Amy smiled to herself. They\u2019d break them, one way or the other. If for some reason they couldn\u2019t, well, they\u2019d have a heck of a fun time trying.</p><p>Day Two</p><p>\u201cI have plans for a picnic today. I missed you yesterday. You were at the office all night,\u201d George grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I knew the second she said it was that account, it would take forever,\u201d Esther said, leaning in for a gentle kiss.</p><p>\u201cI understand, but now we have the entire day to ourselves. I want to stop by and see Joseph and check up on Katherine first,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cDad, glad I caught you,\u201d Trenton said as he stepped into the room. \u201cHi, Esther, nice to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Trenton. Good to see you, too,\u201d Esther politely replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, son. I was just getting ready to give Esther a ride to the hospital. She wants to visit with Katherine,\u201d George said as he took a step back from Esther.</p><p>Trenton smiled. He knew his dad wasn\u2019t going to be happy in a few moments.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a problem with our division in Dallas. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t ask, but I need you to come with me. We\u2019ll be gone for two nights, so pack a bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re more than capable of handling it,\u201d George said as he looked at Esther with a bit of panic.</p><p>\u201cI know, but you know this division like the back of your hand. I think you need to come. I\u2019ll visit with Esther while you get ready,\u201d he said, not allowing his dad to say no.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d George hedged. He\u2019d never told his kids no when they truly needed his help, so Trenton knew he was going to cave.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, George, I\u2019ll give Esther a ride to the hospital,\u201d Jennifer said as she joined them in the room.</p><p>George and Esther looked at each other like lost puppies, as Esther gave him a, what can we do look.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jennifer, but if you\u2019re too busy...\u201d Ether trailed off.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. I was on my way there, anyway,\u201d Jennifer insisted. \u201cWe can leave now, as a matter-of-fact.\u201d</p><p>Jennifer walked over to Trenton and gave him a deep kiss, and he put on a bit more of a show to make the other two even more envious they weren\u2019t coming out in the open. As Jennifer\u2019s breath hitched, he forgot for a moment they weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>She took a wobbly step away while waiting for Esther to gather her coat and purse and Trenton\u2019s heart raced as he sent a longing look to her.</p><p>\u201cHave a safe trip, George,\u201d Esther said as she slowly turned and followed Jennifer from the room.</p><p>George watched her leave with a lost look in his eyes. Trenton smiled, thinking, at least he wasn\u2019t the only one in the room suffering.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dad, the jet\u2019s ready so we better get going,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right down,\u201d George told him before he went to pack.</p><p>Trenton picked up his phone and dialed Lucas.</p><p>\u201cPlans going great, Lucas. You should\u2019ve seen their faces. They had plans today for a romantic picnic. It\u2019s only day two and I think we\u2019re already breaking them,\u201d he said as he finally let some of his laughter free, knowing his father wasn\u2019t in hearing distance.</p><p>\u201cGood. Bree\u2019s ready for her turn with dad when you guys get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in a couple days.\u201d He hung up and waited for his father to come back downstairs. He\u2019d called the manager in Dallas already, and he had a slew of \u2018problems\u2019 for George to fix. He wouldn\u2019t even have time to sneak off and make a phone call.</p><p>Day Five</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been in, Katherine. There was an emergency in Dallas that Trenton needed help with,\u201d George said as he bent down and gave his sister-in-law a kiss on the cheek. \u201cAre there any changes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The doctors are concerned about some test results that came in last night, though. They haven\u2019t told me anything, yet. They wanted to verify a few things first,\u201d Katherine replied with worry in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing. You know Joseph will come out of this. He wouldn\u2019t dare leave you,\u201d he reassured her.</p><p>\u201cThanks for your patience, Mrs. Anderson. We did get those results back, and it\u2019s good news. We were concerned about his kidney function, but everything looks good. He\u2019s still steady at the moment, and we\u2019ve actually seen an increase in his brain activity. We often see this before a patient wakes,\u201d Dr. Kirby said as he stepped into the room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d Katherine said, her shoulders sagging in relief. Bree sat next to her, holding her hand, glad to be there for support.</p><p>\u201cCan we take him home soon? If he\u2019s stable, he can receive the same care at home as he\u2019s receiving here, right?\u201d Bree asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s true. Let us run more tests and I\u2019ll consult with the Neuro Surgeon who operated and see if we can release him for home care,\u201d Dr. Kirby replied.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Katherine said before he left.</p><p>They sat for a while before Esther walked in the room, her eyes slightly widening in pleasure at seeing George. Bree could see she wanted to make a beeline straight to him, but somehow managed to hold herself back.</p><p>After another hour passed, Bree watched as the two of them gave each other a look. It was a code of some sort, she was sure.</p><p>\u201cI better get going. I\u2019ll come visit tomorrow, Katherine,\u201d Esther said as she rose from her seat.</p><p>\u201cI can walk you out. I\u2019m pretty exhausted after my trip. I need to head home and get a hot shower and rest,\u201d George eagerly replied as he jumped from his seat, not looking the least bit tired.</p><p>\u201cActually, Dad, I needed to talk to you, so I\u2019m glad you\u2019re ready to leave. Did you get dropped off?\u201d Bree asked.</p><p>George looked at her with surprise, and then at Esther, who was looking at the floor, before meeting Bree\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, Trenton dropped me off on his way home,\u201d he reluctantly said. \u201cI figured I could catch a ride with Esther since it\u2019s on the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to put Esther out. I\u2019ll give you a ride. Chad\u2019s out of town tonight and I want you to come over. There\u2019s been some stuff going on in our neighborhood that\u2019s really frightening me. You and I can visit and I\u2019ll feel more secure having you there,\u201d Bree said.</p><p>She saw the indecision in her father\u2019s eyes as he looked at Esther once again. How could he possibly refuse his only daughter? She felt the tiniest bit guilty... but not enough to stop. The two of them could just admit they were a couple and the kids would stop messing with them.</p><p>\u201cDo you have other plans, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Here was the perfect opportunity for him to fess up and say, Yes, I\u2019m taking Esther on a romantic date. His shoulders drooped seconds before he responded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019d love to come over,\u201d he said, his voice sounding anything but pleased.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Thanks, Dad. Come on, Esther. You can walk out with us,\u201d Bree said as she put her arm in Esther\u2019s and led her from the room. Bree made sure to stand in the middle of them, so they wouldn\u2019t even have a chance for a secret touch.</p><p>When they arrived at the cars and the three of them stood around awkwardly, George finally sighed, knowing he wasn\u2019t going to get even a moment alone with Esther. He told her a polite goodbye, then climbed in with Bree.</p><p>Day Ten</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. We haven\u2019t had so much as five seconds alone in over a week. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into the kids lately, but they seem to need either you or me every minute of the day,\u201d George said over the phone.</p><p>It was almost midnight and he was lying in his bed worn out because his nephew had insisted he help with the habitat house. Because Joseph was in the hospital, they were a person short. Then they\u2019d all had a family dinner, and finally he\u2019d managed to make it home, only to find Austin spending the night.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even get his evenings alone with Esther. He was done with hiding their relationship.</p><p>\u201cIt has been unusual. You don\u2019t think they\u2019re purposely trying to keep us apart, do you?\u201d she asked with horror in her voice.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t even know we\u2019re a couple. Why would they keep us apart?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... It just seems odd, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said, her voice calming.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just agree to marry me? Then we can leave on a month long honeymoon with no kids, no distractions,\u201d he pled.</p><p>\u201cGeorge Anderson, we can\u2019t leave while your brother\u2019s in the hospital. That wouldn\u2019t be right,\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, Esther. I love you, and you love me, so why do you still want to keep our relationship a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right...\u201d she hedged.</p><p>George\u2019s heartbeat picked up at her words. He wanted nothing more than to tell his family what he thought of this amazing woman. He respected her decision to keep their romance private, but he was tired of hiding and sneaking around. He knew his family would be happy for the two of them. Sneaking around had been fun for a while, but now he couldn\u2019t get a second alone with her.</p> <p>\u201cEsther Lyon, I want to kiss you so badly right now,\u201d he said with frustration.</p><p>\u201cI know how you feel, George,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sneak out of here early in the morning before anyone can stop me,\u201d he vowed.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good to me,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>George reluctantly hung up the phone, then lay in bed with his hands behind his head as he looked at the ceiling. He turned over and opened the drawer where the ring he\u2019d purchased for her months earlier was sitting.</p><p>He opened the box and looked at the exquisite diamond set in a beautiful platinum band. His heart quickened as he pictured her wearing it.</p><p>He was a lucky man. Not only had he been married once to a beautiful, wonderful woman who\u2019d given him many years of joy and four perfect children, but he\u2019d managed to find real love twice. Esther wasn\u2019t replacing his lost wife, she was adding a new chapter. She was giving him hope.</p><p>He counted his blessings to have met such a wonderful woman and he hoped he\u2019d be able to give her as much joy as she already gave him.</p> <p>George fell asleep with a smile on his face and the ring clutched in his hand.</p><p>Day Eleven</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re up. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong, but my stomach has been hurting all night. I think I better have it checked,\u201d Austin said as George crept by the living room.</p><p>He\u2019d been so close to the front door. It was five in the morning. He felt like screaming when he saw Austin sitting in the chair.</p><p>\u201cYou probably just ate something bad. I think the best thing you can do is to try and sleep it off,\u201d George said as his eyes looked toward the front door.</p><p>Austin had to look down to hide the smile. He was supposed to be in pain. It was a good thing his friend was on shift so he knew what was going on. Otherwise, he\u2019d end up with all kinds of tubes sticking out of him when they couldn\u2019t find out what the problem was.</p><p>Hell, his friend owed him a few paybacks and he just might end up with a few tubes anyway. He hadn\u2019t really thought that one through.</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad, I\u2019ve been trying all night. You better take me in,\u201d Austin said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d George mumbled, looking ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you up so early, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep so was going for a walk,\u201d George answered.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Austin replied as he slowly got up. It was difficult for him to pretend he was hurting. He was always going ninety-miles-an-hour, and he didn\u2019t take much time to slow down. He figured he had plenty of time in his later years to sit back and smell the roses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lock up,\u201d George told him as they stepped into the garage.</p><p>\u201cLooks like a bit of food poisoning, Austin. Take it easy, drink plenty of fluids, and make sure you have someone with you today,\u201d his friend, Dr. Whitman, said. When George turned away, he sent a wink to Austin.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Spence. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call your sister and see if she can stay with you,\u201d George said while taking out his phone.</p><p>Austin didn\u2019t try to protest. He knew each of his siblings and cousins would have some pressing matters to attend to. His dad would be stuck taking care of him all day long.</p><p>Ten minutes later, George blew out his breath as he turned back to Austin.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like everyone is busy. I\u2019ll have to sit with you today,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad. Did you have plans?\u201d They were all giving him ample opportunity to fess up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop and see Katherine. Ring me when you get discharged.\u201d</p><p>He walked from the room and Austin cracked up, his friend joining in with him.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are putting him through the ringer,\u201d Spence said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we are. We\u2019re all a little suspicious they were sticking their noses in our lives not too long ago. You know what they say, paybacks a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa there, Austin. This is a kid friendly place,\u201d Spence interrupted him with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of paybacks, did you have to find the biggest needle in this place?\u201d Austin grumbled as he rubbed his sore arm.</p><p>\u201cI searched for that one special, just for you. I haven\u2019t forgotten about the pills you slipped me in college. Kathy thought I was a freaking sex addict, suggesting I go to meetings. I couldn\u2019t leave the house for two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I was just trying to help you out with your date. I didn\u2019t stab you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you shouldn\u2019t mess with a doctor. Next time, I might knock you out for a few days and leave you lying in your own urine for hours on end in your hospital bed.\u201d</p><p>Austin didn\u2019t doubt for a minute he\u2019d do just that. They\u2019d gone through college together and the pranks had been never-ending. He still thought slipping his roommate Viagra had been worth the huge needle, today.</p><p>\u201cI better have one of these pretty nurses wheel me out. I\u2019m feeling a bit too queasy to walk. Is Kinsey on shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Is something going on there?\u201d Spence asked, obviously curious.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t resist me,\u201d Austin told him with a confident smile.</p><p>Spence paged her, and when she entered the room, her look contradicted what Austin had been telling his friend.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s over the moon with you. Looks like she wants to use a needle twice as big on you as the one I did,\u201d Spence whispered.</p><p>\u201cShut up and lock the door on your way out. Make sure no one comes near this room,\u201d Austin growled.</p><p>Spence left, laughing as he exited. Austin knew his friend would guard the door for him.</p><p>\u201cYou had me paged? Seriously? This is my job, Austin. I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t get me fired,\u201d she said in a huff.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m injured here. I have to be wheeled out,\u201d he said, his voice sounding weak.</p><p>Her entire demeanor changed in a flash as she looked at him with concern. She walked over and noticed the bandage on his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy stomach,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>Heck, two for one with his fake food poisoning. He\u2019d take all the nursing she could give him. His conscious immediately ate at him for lying, though.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Austin,\u201d she said, guilt in her eyes for snapping at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really hurt, Kinsey. All of us are on a mission to drive my Dad and Esther crazy so they\u2019ll finally admit they\u2019re dating,\u201d he said as he jumped off the bed and moved toward her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She took a step back.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m feeling pretty good now that you\u2019re here in those sexy scrubs,\u201d he added as he reached her and quickly pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cAustin, this isn\u2019t the time or place,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cThis is the perfect time and place. I see many possibilities. I\u2019ve missed you the past week,\u201d he said before his mouth descended on hers and he kissed her.</p><p>She was only stiff for a second before her body melted into his. Austin felt his stress drain the second she was in his arms. His dad could wait. The entire hospital could wait. He needed her.</p><p>\u201cI have to work,\u201d she breathlessly protested, though her arms lifted as she ran her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cThen I better not take too long.\u201d</p><p>He backed her up against the small hospital bed, then removed one hand long enough to pull the privacy curtain into place. He\u2019d always wanted to make-love in a hospital room. Chalk one fantasy off his list. He saw the moment her eyes darkened, desire overriding her fear.</p><p>Austin pulled away long enough to slip her top and bottoms off, then he ripped his own clothes away. He picked her up, cherishing the feel of her in his arms and the way her breath caressed his neck. He gently laid her on the table, then stood for a moment, his breath taken away by her sheer beauty.</p><p>She was lying in nothing but two small pieces of lace, barely covering her most sacred assets. He watched her stomach quiver as he touched her with nothing but his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he reverently murmured as he took his hand and touched her face, then slid his palm down her throat, over the mounds of full breasts, across the flat plane of her trembling stomach, and then across her toned thighs.</p><p>She groaned when he caressed his way back up her legs, stopping at the juncture between her thighs. He slowly pushed them open, then slipped his finger inside the bright pink lace panties, his own breath hitching when he felt how hot and wet she already was.</p><p>She was so responsive, it was taking great effort for him to go slow enough to pleasure her. He ached with a driving hunger only she could fill.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she moaned when he inserted his finger deeper, then rubbed his thumb in slow circles across her womanhood. Her hips lifted off the bed, begging him to continue. He felt his own legs grow shaky as he stood before her nearly naked body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want you all the time, night and day. I wake up with my body hard, sweat dripping off me because I need you so badly,\u201d he whispered as he bent down and ran his tongue from the hollow of her throat to the corner of her lip.</p><p>His arousal grew to the point of pain when a low groan rumbled out of her chest, and her core became even slicker as his finger gently pushed in and out. He pulled out, then pushed two inside, causing her back to arch even more.</p><p>She gripped the table, her head turning as he continued to stroke her body with his hands and mouth. Her skin warmed beneath his hot breath as he pulled his fingers out, then straddled the table, and kissed her, his tongue exploring her mouth.</p><p>She reached her arms up and rubbed his back, causing sweat to bead on his skin. It was taking all his concentration not to sink inside her, relieving the ache of his pulsing erection.</p><p>He moved his mouth down, determined to explore every curve of her body. He lifted her back, quickly unhooking her delicate pink bra so he could take her luscious nipples into his mouth.</p><p>Her strawberry fragrance was intoxicating, causing his stomach to clench as he ran his tongue over the perfect mounds of her breasts, lavishing equal attention to both.</p><p>His teeth scrapped the sensitive peaks, her back arching into him, her hands lifting to pull him tighter against her skin. He sucked her deep into his mouth, drawing her very essence into him. He wanted her full surrender, and he was getting it, as she clung to him, her body shaking with its need for release.</p><p>Every groan she uttered sent fire to his groin, creating a volcanic size eruption building inside him. He moved down her body, his mouth scraping along the satin skin of her stomach, dipping inside the delicate circle of her belly button.</p><p>Every inch of her turned him on. He moved off the table and slowly pulled the triangle of lace away from her core, his eyes taking in the luscious sight of her spread before him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Kinsey. Stop fighting me \u2013 us. This is too good,\u201d he whispered before his mouth descended and he ran his tongue along the inside of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she cried, shifting on the small table.</p><p>Austin spotted the stir-ups and quickly pulled them out, placing her feet in the holders. She tried to say no, but he continued trailing his lips up her thighs, and all protests vanished.</p><p>When he reached the junction of her thighs and kissed her intimately, her back arched again. He nearly lost control at her first taste, how sweet and moist she was, how ready, how turned on.</p><p>He slid his tongue along her heated folds, kissing her deeply. Then he drew her swollen womanhood into his mouth and sucked, making her scream out as her body shattered beneath his mouth. He slowly caressed the area, drawing out her pleasure until she finally collapsed against the table, her legs still spread wide.</p><p>He lifted his head and gazed at the incredible sight of her. Her body was flushed, a slight sheen of sweat sparkled off her torso, her nipples red and swollen from his mouth.</p><p>She was spectacular.</p><p>He stood on shaking legs and pressed the head of his arousal against her quivering opening, then watched as he slowly sank inside her. He could barely breathe at the sight of her body taking him fully inside her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Austin, so good,\u201d she slurred, her breathing coming in gasps. \u201cSo, so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, baby, you\u2019re so perfect,\u201d he groaned as he pulled all the way out just so he could see himself spreading and entering her again.</p><p>He started moving faster, still watching as he pumped inside her. She was so ready, so eager to take him in. The sheen of her desire coated his throbbing staff. He moved quicker, gripping her butt in his hands and pulling her against him, pushing hard against her.</p><p>\u201cYes, more,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He willingly obliged as he thrust his hips faster, her body cushioning him as he hit against her. Finally, he tore his gaze away, his eyes traveling up her body, taking in the soft motion of her breasts swaying as his body hit against hers.</p><p>Then he reached her face, her head thrown back in pleasure, her eyes shut. Her mouth open, panting breaths and moans escaping each time he rocked into her, harder with each thrust.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t...last...much...longer,\u201d he grunted between thrusts as he continued loving her.</p><p>\u201cTake me...hard,\u201d she cried, and he felt her body tensing, getting ready to erupt with him.</p><p>He leaned forward, changing the angle, making her eyes snap open in delight. His body covered hers and his mouth captured her lips in a possessive kiss so intense, he nearly passed out.</p><p>She moved beneath him, her hips thrusting up to meet his every stroke, her breasts pressed against his chest, their torso\u2019s sliding together. All of it intensifying the sensations washing through him.</p><p>He pressed tightly into her body, rocking his hips, pushing up, caressing her swollen bud, while his chest teased her nipples.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she cried in a broken whisper, her body shaking beneath him as she edged toward the cliff of her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he cried as he pulled back, then sank to the limit inside her tight body. She arched up, pressing herself into him as she exploded, her heat gripping him \u2013 pumping him repeatedly.</p><p>Austin exploded in a wash of sensation, his body tensing as he pulsed inside her, the pleasure going on and on, draining him of everything he had. He shook from the power of his release, exhausted and satisfied beyond anything he\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>When the shudders finally ceased, he collapsed against her, cradled in the safety of her thighs. He turned his head and gently kissed her neck, sliding his tongue out to taste the sweet, salty flavor of her skin.</p><p>When their breathing was under control, Kinsey started struggling beneath him, obviously being crushed by his dead weight.</p><p>\u201cThat was worth getting an I.V. stuck in my arm,\u201d he said with a chuckle as he propped himself up on his arms and looked into her sleepy eyes.</p><p>\u201cI... Well... um, thank you,\u201d she said, her cheeks flushing.</p><p>\u201cPleasure was all mine,\u201d he replied as he bent down and softly caressed her lips with his own. His body, still enclosed in hers, jumped back to life at the slight touch of her mouth.</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise when she felt him growing inside her. He grinned with confidence, loving how much she affected him.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to immediately begin round two, I don\u2019t want you to get in trouble,\u201d he said with reluctance as he softly moved within her folds a few times. He couldn\u2019t resist. It just felt so incredible being inside her warmth.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she called as her eyes widened. It was obvious she\u2019d forgotten where they were, let alone that she was on shift. As he moved, her eyes began misting over, work once again forgotten.</p><p>Austin pushed inside her one last time before he reluctantly pulled out, surprised at the feeling of loss with the separation. She uttered a protest as he moved away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m picking you up Friday night at seven. We have a family dinner, and you\u2019re my date.\u201d He didn\u2019t ask. He wouldn\u2019t give her the chance to run and hide again. He decided the best way to pursue her was full-on, in her face.</p><p>\u201cI... well, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.</p><p>He gripped her face in his hands as he made her look at him. He waited a couple heartbeats before speaking.</p><p>\u201cKinsey, I\u2019ll be here at seven. Friday,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she finally whispered as she nodded. He was enjoying the sated look on her face.</p><p>\u201cGood, now let\u2019s take a quick shower,\u201d he said, feeling lighter than he had since meeting her.</p><p>Kinsey said nothing as he led her into the small bathroom and turned the spray on. As he soaped up her body, he couldn\u2019t help but take her one more time. He was only human, after all. His father ended up waiting another hour.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cIs there something you want to tell us, Kinsey?\u201d</p><p>Kinsey looked around the nurses\u2019 station with confusion. Several of the staff were standing around with huge grins on their faces, all directed at her.</p><p>\u201cUh, not that I can think of,\u201d she slowly answered.</p><p>\u201cReally? Are you sure about that?\u201d one of the women asked.</p><p>\u201cDid I miss something? I know I haven\u2019t been getting enough sleep lately, but you\u2019re all acting a bit stranger than normal,\u201d she said as she came around the counter to access the computer, her eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>She stopped dead in her tracks when she saw twelve vases lined up with a dozen roses in each one, all different colors, all beautiful. She got a really bad feeling, especially since she\u2019d been finding single roses on her pillow for the past week. There\u2019d been no notes, nothing, but she had no doubt they were from Austin. How could she continue to resist him when he acted so romantic? Her heart picked up as she stared at the myriad of colors before her.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Spill,\u201d one nurse demanded.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Kinsey hesitated, at a complete loss for words.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like there may be a good reason you aren\u2019t getting enough sleep,\u201d another nurse commented, then giggled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just been working long shifts,\u201d Kinsey defended.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all I\u2019ve heard. We heard there was some late night activity in your on-call room,\u201d Kathy said. She\u2019d been hired the same time as Kinsey, and the two had become close the past year.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kinsey gasped, feeling her cheeks heat up, hating that she was signing her guilty papers without saying anything.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Michelle said she walked by and heard a moan, and that it certainly wasn\u2019t pain filled, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know what you guys are talking about. You know how rumors spread in the hospital,\u201d Kinsey said, knowing she was wasting her breath. She would\u2019ve been right there with them, teasing whoever had gotten lucky, if she weren\u2019t the one on the receiving end. There was no privacy in the hospital. She knew that \u2013 but when she was with Austin, she forgot everything.</p><p>\u201cWell, we might have been convinced that you were only having a really, really great dream, if not for the dozens of thank-you-for-the-best-sex-of-my-life-roses,\u201d Kathy said with a laugh.</p><p>Kinsey was torn between wanting to throttle Austin and wanting to give him a reason to give her three times as many roses. She\u2019d received flowers before, but not at her workplace, and never so many. She shouldn\u2019t have made that comment in the store...</p><p>\u201cHow do you know they\u2019re even mine?\u201d Kinsey said. Maybe, just maybe, there wasn\u2019t a card attached.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s not a roomful, there\u2019s always tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing more beautiful than your smile is your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour scent sets me on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dream of nothing but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bought a rose for every moment of pleasure you gave me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, that last one made my heart pound. I swear, if you don\u2019t want the guy, I\u2019ll take him. I can think of all kinds of ways to bring him pleasure,\u201d Marsha, another nurse, said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou read my cards?\u201d Kinsey asked in astonishment, no longer trying to deny the roses were for her. She was horrified as she listened to her friends read the intimate cards in pathetically deep voices. None of them were going to get any best actor awards. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDuh! They weren\u2019t sealed. We were just going to peak at one, but they kept getting better and better. I really like the one about your luscious body,\u201d Kathy said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you guys have work to do?\u201d Kinsey snapped, feeling her face flame even more.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, this is so much better than cathing the old guy in room three again. You have to spill. I swear, with all the excitement of having Joseph Anderson here and all those sinful boys of his roaming the halls, then your new and exciting love life, our hospital has become better than an episode of Grey\u2019s Anatomy. I\u2019ve forgotten all about Dr. McDreamy,\u201d Marsha said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a love life, obviously just a secret admirer,\u201d Kinsey lied, for some reason not wanting to tell them anything about Austin.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not even the slightest chance we believe that, Kinsey. Who\u2019s the guy? If you don\u2019t tell us, rumors will just spread. Please, please tell me it\u2019s one of those dreamy Anderson men. I know most of them are married, a sad situation indeed, but at least one or two of them have to be single,\u201d Betty said, joining the conversation. She was a paramedic, unfortunately for Kinsey, not on a call at the moment.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s really nothing, not even worth gossiping about. I had a date with a guy, who I\u2019m not even telling you vultures about, and obviously he liked the night. That\u2019s all,\u201d Kinsey said with what she hoped was a believable tone. She knew many staff used on-call rooms for more than sleep, but she never had before Austin.</p><p>Working in the hospital could be an incredibly stressful job, and there was nothing like a few minutes of wild passion to calm the nerves. Her body heated even thinking about Austin sinking inside her.</p><p>\u201cCode Blue,\u201d a nurse called as alarms started ringing.</p><p>All teasing immediately ceased as the staff rushed into action. They may have a great time ribbing one another, but when a life was on the line, they were the first nurses the doctors called. They were the best the hospital had.</p> <p>By the time they got the patient stable, the roses were forgotten about as the hospital kept them busy. Kinsey knew she was only getting a short reprieve, but she\u2019d take it. When she found the nurses\u2019 station empty of any staff a few hours later, she quickly swooped in and gathered the cards Austin had written her, then took off for a bathroom.</p><p>She hid in one of the stalls and read each one at least three times, her heart racing. He wasn\u2019t playing fair. How could she resist him when he said such romantic things? What if he really did want more than just sex? Was she willing to give a relationship with him a try?</p><p>She went through the rest of her shift on autopilot, often checking on Joseph, hoping he\u2019d come out of the coma. She knew of patients that never did \u2013 that couldn\u2019t be the case with Joseph.</p><p>By the time her day was over, she still wasn\u2019t any closer to knowing what she wanted. A good night\u2019s rest would help, she decided. She was already starting to miss Austin, and it had only been a day. She wasn\u2019t going to get anything worked out until she took her time thinking about the matter. With a sigh, she turned off her mind, putting her problems on the back-burner as she made her way home, the smell of his roses invading her car, causing her heart to thump.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cI brought chocolate, all different kinds, and sparkling cider,\u201d Bree said as she entered the hospital room with an expectant smile on her face.</p> <p>She bent down and kissed Joseph\u2019s forehead before giving Katherine a hug and then getting comfortable on the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d Katherine asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready for the story to continue. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve made us wait an entire week. You have me on the edge of my seat. Seriously, I\u2019ve been dreaming about you and Joseph. It\u2019s just so romantic. I never really thought about you and Uncle Joseph meeting,\u201d Bree answered.</p><p>\u201cI agree, Mom. I\u2019ve been going crazy having to wait. You have to tell us more. Amy and Jessica are right behind me,\u201d Emily said as she came in with a bag full of her own goodies. She quickly hugged Katherine, then sat down next to Bree.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the rest of the family to file into the room. Even the guys were intrigued by the story. Katherine looked around the room at her family, so grateful to have them during this time without her husband.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d go on if Joseph never woke up, but she knew she\u2019d at least have the moral support she needed from her loved ones. It wouldn\u2019t be enough \u2013 nothing would be, but it still brought comfort.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kinsey? I thought she was working today,\u201d Austin asked as he came inside.</p><p>\u201cShe had to assist in another room, but should be back any minute,\u201d Katherine answered. She looked at her husband with a smile. He would be thrilled to have his nephew on pins and needles for the pretty nurse.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Katherine,\u201d George said as he walked in with Max. He looked quite grumpy and Katherine had to fight back a knowing smile. She may be at the hospital most of the time, but she was still aware of what was going on around her.</p><p>She knew the kids were playing games with George and Esther. She actually agreed with them. It was time those two stopped hiding and finally admitted how in love they were.</p><p>As she gazed at her sleeping husband, time took on a whole new meaning. Life was too short to let even a single day pass them by.</p><p>\u201cJoseph was going through a lot in those early days. He had an Uncle who was a very bad man. Neilson was out to destroy the corporation Joseph\u2019s father built. Also at that time, there was a lot of misunderstanding between him and George, such trivial stuff, and so many years wasted,\u201d Katherine said with a sad sigh.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more, Katherine. If I could take back that time...\u201d George trailed off, his eyes brimming with his own memories.</p><p>\u201cIt all worked out, George, so don\u2019t you be hard on yourself. I\u2019m just trying to let the kids know why some of the events happened the way they did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it makes me feel like such a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were all fools then, George. But luckily, we grew up. I can\u2019t imagine how my life would have turned out...\u201d she said, too choked up to continue.</p><p>\u201cIf this is too hard...\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>\u201cNo dear, it\u2019s just that it makes me hurt to think of those years we missed out on. But hopefully you can learn from us, learn about how precious time really is, and how the small things in life aren\u2019t worth getting upset over. When you find your true love, you run to them. Don\u2019t walk, don\u2019t hide, you take them in your arms and never let them go.\u201d</p><p>She watched as Austin\u2019s eyes glanced toward the door, awaiting Kinsey to walk through the opening. She had a feeling another wedding was in the future. As she looked at George, who was also looking out the door, she modified that. It looked like there may be two weddings.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying, Joseph was dealing with a lot of emotions. Let me tell you about how our beautiful home came to be...\u201d</p><p>Joseph looked at the spectacular view from the small porch. He\u2019d needed to get away from the city, so he\u2019d jumped on the road and drove until he came to the Washington Floating Bridge. He drove across, remembering his grandfather taking him to Mercer Island when he was young. He\u2019d been fascinated by the fact that such a huge structure was held up by what he thought of as balloons.</p><p>Arriving on the island, he felt his muscles relax, and his stress fade. He was instantly in love with the area.</p><p>As he watched the sunset wash the Puget Sound in a myriad of colors, he knew he\u2019d found home. He could see himself sitting in the very spot he was standing, fifty years from now. He could also see Katherine by his side.</p><p>She\u2019d refused his calls, ignored his requests to meet, and was making it darn near impossible for him to see her \u2013 but that was all going to stop, and very soon if he had his way.</p><p>\u201cThe owners are eager to sell. The husband moved last month and his wife wants to join him, but can\u2019t until the property is taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Joseph turned, startled by the woman talking to him. He\u2019d forgotten she was there. He\u2019d spotted the For Sale sign and called. The agent excitedly agreed to meet him right away. Apparently, there hadn\u2019t been a lot of interest in the location.</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand why. It was perfect.</p><p>Sitting on the sandy beach of Mercer Island, the land was engulfed in trees offering privacy. The home was old and poorly built, but that didn\u2019t matter to him. Only the land did. Sitting on ten acres, it was a true find and he couldn\u2019t believe someone hadn\u2019t snatched it up.</p><p>He knew it would be his.</p><p>The calm, dark water was lapping against the shore, offering a soothing breeze, drifting through the grass, right to him. The sunset sparkled on the water, creating a dreamlike picture.</p><p>Higher up on the land, he could practically see the home he wanted to build.</p><p>A castle.</p><p>Suited for his queen.</p><p>In his quest to forget her, he\u2019d tried unsuccessfully to outrun his life. Each business transaction added to his resume a sense of conquering the world. But all of it had been empty, meaningless. A hollow victory.</p><p>He would crawl to her if he thought it would do him any good, but he knew she\u2019d never respect a man on his knees. No, he\u2019d win her, by any means necessary. She\u2019d walked away and nearly destroyed him, but fate had given them another chance.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her go again.</p><p>Katherine.</p><p>It was always about her, from the moment he\u2019d laid eyes on her five years prior.</p><p>He was known throughout the world as being heartless. It was rumored that he had ice flowing through his veins instead of blood. He\u2019d heard it all and inwardly smiled. Let them fear him, because they also respected him. He was never refused something he went after. Katherine being the one exception.</p><p>That was about to change, though.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d he said, causing the woman\u2019s mouth to drop open.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s... um, great,\u201d she said, quickly regaining her composure. He was sure dollar signs were dancing in her head as she hadn\u2019t yet listed the price of the property. He didn\u2019t care, he\u2019d pay whatever they asked.</p><p>The woman was underdressed for the cool night air. She was dressed to seduce. Seduce a buyer into purchasing a home by any means necessary. From the short length of her skirt, to the cleavage on display in her tight blouse, all the way to her bright red, kiss-me lips. He felt not even the tiniest stirring of lust.</p><p>No one stirred him but Katherine. Not since he\u2019d met her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the paperwork in my car. Why don\u2019t we drive down to a local restaurant I know and fill this out while we have a bite to eat,\u201d she offered, her manicured fingernail running down his arm.</p><p>He was sure her dining choice was in the lobby of a hotel, where she hoped to seal the deal in a room afterward.</p><p>He fought to keep the disgusted look off his face. She wasn\u2019t anything unusual. Women threw themselves at him often, some more bold than others, but always the same old story. He had money, power, and looks, it was almost expected from them - he was used to her kind of game. He\u2019d played it years ago but he was grown up now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Here\u2019s my card. Fill out the paperwork tonight and fax it to this hotel. I\u2019ll sign and have it sent back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even told you the price,\u201d she said, shock and hurt registering in her eyes. She was trying to keep herself together, but he wasn\u2019t making it easy for her. He didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d found what he wanted. All the rest was a waste of his time.</p><p>He raised his brows, waiting for her to get on with it.</p><p>\u201cLet me see, here,\u201d she stalled as she looked in her folder, her fingers trembling. He blew out his breath. He knew she had the price memorized. It must be overpriced because she was hesitating to tell him. She was afraid once she did, he\u2019d walk away.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know him.</p><p>Finally, she stopped and listed a price. He knew it was about twenty percent above market value. He dealt in real-estate deals all across the world. If he were buying the property for business, he\u2019d have the owner selling to him for half the price.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t business, though. It was pleasure.</p><p>Pure pleasure, he hoped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it. Fax me the papers tonight.\u201d</p> <p>With those words, Joseph turned and walked away from the stunned realtor. He\u2019d made his deal so there was no use in standing around any longer. He moved through the overgrown path, circling the small house. He gave the property a final look before walking to his car.</p><p>As he drove down the private road, he felt exhilaration rush through him, knowing he was going to occupy such a beautiful piece of ground. He was surrounded by water, trees, and not far away, the cascades, featuring Mt. Rainier. He was disappointed it was night and he couldn\u2019t spot the majestic mountain. The land was beautiful, and soon...soon, he\u2019d bring his Katherine home.</p><p>As he entered the freeway and the lights of Seattle drew closer, his mind was consumed by thoughts of her. He had to see her, be with her, have her appease his rising hunger.</p><p>He hated the power she held over him, but at least she was unaware of it. If she ever got even a hint of how easily she could drop him to his knees, he was sure she\u2019d be dragging him around by the collar.</p><p>He laughed as he put his foot down on the accelerator. He\u2019d find her, hopefully in her apartment, where he could finish what he\u2019d started several days prior. For that matter, five years prior.</p><p>He looked forward to the fight in her, though. He liked the game of wills they had going on. He had enough women falling at his feet. He needed the challenge Katherine brought him. She revitalized him, made him remember what intense wanting was like.</p> <p>She told him no, he thought with a smile. A word he didn\u2019t hear too often. In fact \u2013 never.</p><p>She\u2019d run, he\u2019d pursue. Then, he\u2019d capture.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>Joseph quickly arrived back in the city, then circled her block, looking at her apartment building, her lights turned off. She was either out, or asleep. He groaned, thinking of her lying on her bed. He yearned to join her.</p><p>Instead, he made his way to his hotel. It may be safer for both of them if he called. Maybe she\u2019d even had time to think about them and would willingly invite him back to her place.</p><p>He handed his car to the valet, then impatiently waited for the elevator to stop at his penthouse suite.</p><p>As soon as he walked in the door, he threw his jacket aside and strode to the phone, dialing her number by memory. His heart thundered as he waited for her answer.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>The sound of her sleep filled voice fueled his desire even more than it was already stoked. He briefly closed his eyes to picture her, then snapped them back open when he realized it wasn\u2019t helping his situation.</p><p>Soon, he promised himself.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss me, Katherine?\u201d His voice was deep and soft, deliberately meant to seduce.</p><p>The phone was silent as he waited. For a moment he wondered if she\u2019d hung up, but as he listened, he could hear the soft sigh of her quick breaths.</p><p>He knew she was having as hard a time being apart as he was. She was just unwilling to admit defeat. Soon she\u2019d realize she was only punishing herself.</p><p>\u201cI drove by earlier. I was going to stop, but decided twice in a row was ungentlemanly. I\u2019d be more than willing to come back, though. I have the perfect remedy to help you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me, Joseph? Did you really just give me such an asinine line? I don\u2019t see you in five years and you humiliate me to get in my apartment, then you call and try to use me like a cheap hooker,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never use you, Katherine, simply please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d</p><p>Ah, she pleased him. He chuckled, not even attempting to hide his joy in simply speaking to her, or should he say, sparring with her. She had a quick wit that could slice a weaker man, and her strength had certainly grown in the last five years.</p><p>He\u2019d loved what a spitfire she was back then, but the woman she\u2019d become now was irresistible.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t eager to get away the other night...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is easily explained by temporary insanity. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. I\u2019m over you, Joseph. I have been for a long time. I suggest you get over me, too. I know you just don\u2019t like to lose anything, but this is one battle you can\u2019t win. Now, go back to whatever hole you crawled out of and leave me be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine, how quickly you forget that I never give up when I want something. And right now, I\u2019ve decided what I want is you. I want you next to me twenty-four-seven, at least until I\u2019ve sated the desire you left me with. Then, I may actually let you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou arrogant, egotistical, pig of a man. I can\u2019t believe women throw themselves at you. Why? Are they crazy? Do they feel like they deserve punishment? Get it through that thick skull of yours, into whatever tiny brain is in there, that I don\u2019t want anything to do with you,\u201d she huffed, her breathing ragged with her rising temper.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it, he started laughing, his stomach shaking with the force of his merriment. He didn\u2019t think it possible, but he wanted her even more than before.</p><p>\u201cYou are so good for me. I know you\u2019re trying to anger me, but all you\u2019ve done is make me more determined. I love a challenge, Katherine, and you\u2019ve become my number one priority.\u201d He happily threw down the gauntlet and awaited her response.</p><p>\u201cYour number one priority should be your family\u2019s corporation and making sure it doesn\u2019t fall apart. I guess you haven\u2019t done any growing up if all you can think about is what\u2019s below your belt and where you\u2019re going to put it next. I have a job to do, which I take very seriously, so I\u2019m done with this call. I was fast asleep when you so rudely woke me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you being counterproductive, Katherine? If you love your job so much, shouldn\u2019t you be schmoozing me, trying to gain my trust, so I\u2019ll swoop in and save the day? You and I both know I\u2019m what the corporation needs. You just don\u2019t want to say it out loud. What would the other board members think if you chased me away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d thank me for getting rid of a pesky fly. You\u2019re not that important in all of this,\u201d she bluffed. He\u2019d always been able to tell when she was lying. Her voice hitched a bit at the end of the sentence. It seemed not a lot had changed.</p><p>His call to her had amused him, but also left him nearly trembling with need. He had to have her soon.</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, Katherine. We both know you\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>There was silence on the other end of the line for nearly a minute and he wondered again if she\u2019d hung up on him, or possibly fallen asleep.</p><p>\u201cGrow up, Joseph. This call is over,\u201d she finally said. He expected the sound of a click, but all he heard was silence. He waited another moment.</p><p>\u201cSee, Katherine, you do want me. You want to hear the sound of my voice, to feel my hands caress your body. You want me, even if you don\u2019t want to. You can\u2019t even hang up on me, being afraid of breaking the connection we have. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of you,\u201d he huskily whispered.</p><p>After a sudden intake of breath that had his chest pounding, he heard the click of the phone as the call was disconnected.</p><p>He laid his own phone in its receiver, and then went to take a long shower. He couldn\u2019t wait for his next round with her.</p><p>Joseph walked up to the front doors of the building his grandfather had built. He had not only designed it, but actually used his own two hands to help create it. Joseph always felt a sense of pride when he looked at the custom design, the appealing flow of windows and walls.</p><p>His grandfather, Benjamin, had wanted to make a statement. He was entering the business world, and he wanted everyone to know he was a force to be reckoned with. Joseph\u2019s neck stretched back as he looked high in the sky, where the top of the building towered above those around it. He knew someday, it most likely wouldn\u2019t be the tallest building in Seattle, but at that moment it was.</p><p>He walked through the front doors, his appearance stating to the world that he was confident, the one they could count on. No one would know his gut was clenched with nerves. This company meant something to him, it had history.</p><p>Financially he\u2019d be fine without the corporation. He\u2019d gone out and conquered the world on his own, amassed a large fortune, but his grandfather\u2019s company was history. It was family, everything he\u2019d been taught to respect and honor.</p><p>There was no way he could let his uncle get his hands on it. He\u2019d rip it apart without a thought to the family, nor the thousands of people employed. He\u2019d do what was good for him, and not care about anyone left in his wake.</p><p>Joseph couldn\u2019t let that happen, even if he had to sink every last million of his own funds into the corporation to save it.</p><p>There was a skeleton security crew working as he passed the front desk. He passed by with just a nod, not in the mood for small talk.</p><p>He was headed to the top floor where a meeting was being held. The board wanted to hear from all the players, all those who were up for taking Benjamin\u2019s place. Joseph hadn\u2019t wanted to come back home, but now... now, he\u2019d do whatever it took to ensure the position was his. He couldn\u2019t walk away.</p><p>Without breaking his stride, he stepped into the elevator and rode to the top of the building. He was mentally preparing for the barrage of questions awaiting him.</p><p>If he cared so much, why had he left for five years?</p><p>He was so young, what could he offer that Neilson couldn\u2019t?</p><p>He had his own corporation to run, how would he do both?</p><p>Those would just be a few of many. He needed to show confidence. He needed to keep his head in the game. It wouldn\u2019t be easy considering Katherine would be at that table, so close to him, but still untouchable. She figured she was safe being surrounded by a crowd.</p><p>She figured wrong.</p><p>As he stepped off the elevator, he turned to the right. The path to the conference room was well memorized as he\u2019d run the corridors as a child, his grandfather always happy to see him. He\u2019d known from the time he could barely talk that he\u2019d follow in his grandfather\u2019s footsteps.</p><p>The entire life had appealed to him. The suits, meetings, travel. All of it was fascinating. It had been a no-brainer for him to intern with the corporation. He\u2019d learned a lot at the hand of the most brilliant man he knew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before he got too far, he heard something that made his step falter. Someone was with him. His heart increased as his instincts told him it wasn\u2019t someone he wanted to see.</p><p>He had two choices, either continue on as if he didn\u2019t know, or turn and face whoever was slinking around behind him.</p><p>A small smile formed on his lips. He\u2019d never been one to run from a challenge. Joseph slowly turned, then the smile fell as he made eye contact with his uncle.</p><p>The man looked even worse than the last time he\u2019d seen him. He\u2019d always been distant, not caring to know his brother\u2019s family, but the look on his face at that moment was almost hard to describe.</p> <p>It was void of emotion, only a gleam of hatred flashing in his eyes exposed his true feelings. It was obvious he wasn\u2019t happy Joseph had come. The man had figured his battle was only against Milton and that he\u2019d have an easy victory.</p><p>Joseph\u2019s father was a great man, full of love and laughter. A corporate shark he wasn\u2019t. He\u2019d decided years previously he didn\u2019t want to deal with the hustle and bustle of the city, so he\u2019d moved to the land his grandfather had founded, a beautiful ranch. It was close enough he could stay active with his family, but far enough to do what he wanted.</p><p>Under his watch, the ranch was successful. He thrived in the environment. Benjamin had been proud of his son, not needing him to follow exactly in his footsteps, just wanting him to find his own place in the world.</p><p>Milton had stepped up when his father had become ill, not wanting his father\u2019s corporation to fall into the hands of his brother, who only wanted to destroy it, but Joseph knew Milton didn\u2019t want to work as the CEO. He wanted to be with his horses. That\u2019s when his father called him, and Joseph knew he couldn\u2019t say no.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re trying to win the vote by seduction,\u201d Neilson snarled as he stepped closer.</p> <p>Though, Joseph knew the man didn\u2019t care for him, he had no idea how much Neilson actually despised him. He wasn\u2019t even trying to hide his disdain for his nephew. Joseph was left speechless for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou know that seducing one of the board members won\u2019t help you, right? Even if she is making herself quite... what\u2019s the word? Oh yes, accessible. That just shows how desperate you really are.\u201d</p><p>Joseph found his voice as anger consumed him. The man had no right to speak of Katherine in any manner, let alone turning it around and making her look like anything other than a lady.</p><p>How had his uncle even known he\u2019d seen her? He must have people spying for him. That fit his character quite well, actually.</p><p>\u201cJealousy is an ugly color on you, Neilson. It\u2019s obvious you know you\u2019ve already lost, so you\u2019re grasping at any straw you can,\u201d Joseph said, not allowing the rage to show in either his voice or face.</p><p>A burst of satisfaction rushed through him, seeing the rage on Neilson\u2019s face. Joseph knew how to deal with men like him. He just couldn\u2019t understand how someone so evil could be related to his late grandfather, or his father.</p> <p>\u201cYou may have one of the board members eating out of your hand, but I own the rest. You won\u2019t ever get this corporation. You won\u2019t be allowed the reigns. I\u2019ve worked them for years. You\u2019ve had minimal success, but you know nothing,\u201d Neilson spat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been successful on my own, without the help from my family. Can you say as much for yourself? I know how to build a business, unlike you, who only knows how to tear one down,\u201d Joseph countered.</p><p>A lethal fury radiated from Neilson. It was so potent, the air nearly ignited. Joseph had no doubt that if the man thought he could get away with it, he\u2019d kill him right there with zero remorse.</p><p>How long did it take a man to become that way? Was he born with it in him or did he develop it through his life? Joseph would never know, but he did know he wouldn\u2019t trust Neilson anywhere near him. His uncle would stab him in the back with a smile on his face and a skip in his step if given the opportunity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve grown bored with this conversation, Neilson. We\u2019ll let the board members decide the outcome of who\u2019s more fit to run the corporation. When it\u2019s me, I\u2019ll take pleasure in watching you slink back to wherever it is you hide in the dark these days,\u201d Joseph said as he turned and resumed walking toward the meeting.</p><p>Neilson grabbed his arm and spun him around, hatred so intense on his face, his eyes were burning with it. He opened his mouth to speak and spit bubbled at the corners of his lips. It seemed he didn\u2019t like not getting the last word.</p><p>\u201cYou arrogant bastard. Do you have any idea who I am? I can destroy you in less than a heartbeat. You\u2019d better watch yourself, Joseph, watch very carefully. No matter what you do or where you go, I\u2019ll be one step ahead of you. I\u2019m not going to rest until I\u2019ve crushed you beneath me!\u201d</p><p>Joseph looked at the boney hand tightly gripping his arm. He wanted to punch the man, but somehow managed to hold onto his temper. Barely.</p> <p>Two years prior to that, he would\u2019ve hit Neilson and then stepped on his head as he passed by. Neilson was begging for him to do it.</p><p>With an outer calm he wasn\u2019t feeling, he gripped Neilson\u2019s fingers and pried them off his arm, barely holding back the temptation to snap them backward. With his hand removed, Joseph faced him, his face mere inches from his enemy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cBe very careful, Neilson. I may be young, but I\u2019ve a world of experience. Your threats mean nothing to me. I\u2019m not afraid of you, nor intimidated. If you touch me again, though, I won\u2019t hold back my wrath.\u201d</p><p>Joseph looked into the man\u2019s eyes, not backing down. When he saw a spark of fear behind the rage filled depths, he finally retreated. Neilson was a coward, all talk and zero follow-through. He was done dealing with him. He had a meeting to attend and he didn\u2019t want to be late.</p><p>This time when he walked away, he knew Neilson was left standing in his shadow.</p><p>Joseph reached the door to the conference room, took a breath, then stepped inside...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, Mrs. Anderson, but it\u2019s time for your husband\u2019s blood to be drawn, and then we need to give him a bath,\u201d a nurse said, stopping Katherine in the middle of speaking.</p><p>\u201cNo way. You absolutely can\u2019t stop right there. I swear I\u2019ll have nightmares all night. You have to tell us how the meeting goes. What happened? Did he get the CEO position right then, or did Neilson get his hands on it? We obviously know he eventually gets it, because it\u2019s still in the family\u2019s hands now, but...\u201d Amy cried out.</p><p>\u201cWe can move to another room. Or go to the house for a while,\u201d Jessica suggested.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Emily blurted. \u201cThis is the corporation, right? This isn\u2019t one that he started on his own, is it? What happened? What was your reaction when he walked in the doors? How long did it take Neilson to get there? How did the other board members not know what Neilson truly was?\u201d</p><p>Katherine laughed at their panicked expressions. Telling her story gave her a reprieve from the constant worrying she felt.</p><p>She looked around the room, at the eager expressions on her family member\u2019s faces, and took pride in knowing that her life had them so mesmerized. She\u2019d always told Joseph their romance was meant to be in storybooks. It was her own fairytale.</p><p>\u201cI promise to continue soon. I could really use a walk right now, though, to gather my thoughts. George, would you accompany me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>There were several disappointed sighs but no one argued further. She could see that George had been hoping to sneak off with Esther, but she thought she\u2019d help the kids out a little. Plus, she could use a bit of peace with her friend.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Katherine,\u201d George said as she knew he would.</p><p>\u201cHow about we meet up here tonight after supper?\u201d Katherine asked.</p><p>They all answered in the affirmative. She slowly got to her feet and left the room on the arm of her brother-in-law. As she stepped outside, she took in a deep lungful of fresh air. Then followed as George led her down to the garden path.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Austin walked from his Uncle\u2019s room, intent on finding Kinsey. She\u2019d managed to stay away the entire time he was there. For that matter, she\u2019d been avoiding him since they\u2019d made love last time.</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand it. When she was in his arms, she was pliant, and obviously satisfied, so why the heck did she keep running every time he was away from her for five minutes? He was bound and determined to get answers. He\u2019d proven by now that he wasn\u2019t just after her for the short haul. He wanted a relationship, not a one-night-stand.</p><p>He moved up and down the halls, searching for her, hoping when he found her, they\u2019d have privacy. His aunt\u2019s story was getting to him. She was so filled with pain for the time she\u2019d missed out on when she and Joseph had so many misunderstandings between them.</p><p>Well, he wasn\u2019t going to make the same mistake. Kinsey was going to talk to him, then hopefully, they could reconnect. The thought instantly had his body stirring. When he passed by her on-call room, he turned rock solid.</p><p>He shifted as he continued moving, quickly un-tucking his button up shirt and letting it hang down, hoping to hide the evidence of his desire. He was acting like a hormone riddled teenager instead of an experienced man. But that was what Kinsey did to him. She stirred him in ways he was beginning to not only expect, but anticipate.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>Kinsey ducked her head and splashed more cold water on her face. It had been a very long day already and she was exhausted. On top of it, she was coming down with a cold, and her day had taken a nosedive for the worse.</p><p>She\u2019d managed to avoid Austin for days, but she knew that would come to an end soon. He didn\u2019t tend to be the most patient even on the best of days, let alone after she refused to answer his calls.</p><p>She was confused, though, and didn\u2019t know what to think about their relationship. She had no doubt that it was, in fact, a relationship. She could no longer call it a one-night-stand. Not after the two exquisite times in various parts of the hospital, the massive amount of roses he\u2019d given her, and his messages. Oh, the messages.</p><p>He\u2019d been leaving her voicemails that made her want to melt. How could she possibly gain perspective on what to do when he wasn\u2019t giving her time to think?</p><p>She\u2019d been in the same examining room they\u2019d made exquisite love in earlier that day, and her body had responded as if he were going to walk through the door at any minute. She had to be in control, always. That was how she managed to survive. Since being with him, she seemed to have lost all semblance of that carefully measured control she lived by. Was it really so bad giving up a little control in return for being with him?</p><p>After cooling off her face, she dried it, reapplied her chapstick, then knew she had to get back out there. Her shift was almost over, then she had three days off. She was grateful for the extra time she got, taking care of the Anderson men, but she was still having a difficult time catching up on her needed rest. It was nice to have a normal schedule again.</p><p>She came out of the bathroom and quickly went down the hall. She just had to get through another fifteen minutes, and she was free. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned a corner and ran right into a solid wall of muscle. She knew without looking up that it was Austin\u2019s arms around her.</p><p>She\u2019d been telling herself she didn\u2019t want to see him, she needed to escape, but the reality was that she\u2019d missed him, missed him so much that being in his arms was like coming home.</p><p>As she lifted her head, her eyes clashed with his. He didn\u2019t give her time for words. He didn\u2019t even allow her a second to catch her breath, his mouth just descended on hers, and as usual, the rest of the world faded into nonexistence.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p> <p>Austin felt relief the moment Kinsey was in his arms. Her literally running smack dab into him had him in a much better mood.</p><p>He\u2019d missed her. There was zero hesitation in taking her luscious lips with his own. His day didn\u2019t really begin until he could taste her.</p><p>He leaned against the wall, not caring they were in the public hospital, not bothering to hide his passion for her. He wanted her always and he didn\u2019t care if the world knew. He was falling for her, fast.</p><p>He finally broke away and watched as her eyes slowly opened and gazed at him through passion filled clouds. He needed to get her to the nearest on-call room.</p><p>\u201cFancy running into you here,\u201d he said with a fake southern drawl. She looked at him in surprise, then, as he\u2019d hoped, her lips twitched and laughter spilled out.</p> <p>\u201cI bet you say that to all the girls,\u201d she replied, batting her eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cNot since meeting you,\u201d he answered, suddenly very serious.</p><p>She blinked at him. He could see she was trying to figure out if he was telling her the truth. She\u2019d eventually have to learn to trust him because he couldn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>\u201cAustin Anderson, you\u2019re breaking down every wall I\u2019ve ever managed to put up,\u201d she said, making his heart soar.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be off work soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for ten minutes, but I\u2019m all caught up. There\u2019s a janitor\u2019s closet just around the corner,\u201d she said shyly. It was the first time she\u2019d ever taken the initiative. Pleasure consumed him, his body responding in a flash.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t need any more invitation than that. He pushed away from the wall, grabbed her hand, and went racing into the room.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kinsey, can you...\u201d someone started to ask, but he flew by them, not giving her a chance to respond.</p><p>He knew it had only been a week, but it felt like years. They\u2019d make love and then talk. They really needed to talk. For that matter, he had to take her on a real date. This hospital stuff was fun, but if he wanted her to believe it was more than just sex to him, then he needed to prove that by romancing her.</p><p>He\u2019d have to ask his sister for ideas. He\u2019d never dated a woman before with the intention of it lasting longer than a night or, at most, a week.</p><p>He got to the closet and threw open the door, pushing her inside as he quickly shut and locked them in. Any kind of interruption wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>He took two seconds surveying his surroundings, shelves lined with cleaning supplies, brooms, mops and dusters in the corner. Not an ideal room of seduction, but he didn\u2019t care \u2013 he didn\u2019t need anything other than her.</p><p>He backed her against the wall and lifted her arms. He was hungry and he needed her naked and screaming his name.</p><p>He stripped her in a matter of seconds, then removed his own clothes in record time. She was standing before him, panting as she lifted her arms to him in invitation.</p> <p>He grabbed her around the waist and lifted her up, her eyes going wide at the savagery of his touch. He couldn\u2019t even think. Her hands lifted and gripped the bar behind her, arching her breasts toward him.</p><p>Her legs were wrapped around his back, pulling her core tight against his body, where he could feel her wetness caressing his pulsing arousal.</p><p>His head descended as he took one pert nipple into his mouth and sucked on it, encouraged by her moans of pleasure. He took the peak between his teeth and tugged as his tongue stroked the hard edge.</p><p>\u201cYes, more,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>His arousal jumped painfully at her need filled words. He gripped her butt tight, as he thrust his hips into her, rubbing himself along the outside of her wet folds, their bodies made to fit together.</p><p>He lifted his head back up and took her lips, needing to taste her. She greedily sucked his tongue into her mouth, then released it, before sucking it back in. His knees nearly buckled at her erotic foreplay.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he growled as he shifted back so he could position himself at her entrance.</p><p>\u201cHard, I want you to take me hard,\u201d she cried as his considerable length pressed against her, torturing them both.</p><p>Austin lost the last ounce of his control and surged forward, entering her in a rush of movement. She cried out as her back pressed tightly into the wall, her breasts crushed against his chest.</p><p>He didn\u2019t slow down, just pulled back and thrust in again, quickly establishing an intensely satisfying rhythm for both of them. Her cries of pleasure pushed him on, faster, harder, longer.</p><p>Suddenly, her body tensed and she cried out as his body slapped hers with a forceful motion. He pulled back out and slammed back inside, making her yell again as she shook in pleasure.</p><p>Her head descended to his shoulder and she clamped her teeth against his skin, her cries muted against his flesh. The pain of her bite didn\u2019t even dampen the pleasure of her body holding him tight.</p><p>He paused, giving her time to catch her breath, though his body shook from holding back. He needed completion \u2013 needed to spill his release deep inside her writhing body.</p><p>When her bite softened and her lips caressed his swollen skin, he started to move again. She sighed as he started caressing her from the inside out, his swollen member stroking her pleasured flesh, his hands gripping her butt tight, pushing her from behind \u2013 moving her up and down his shaft.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she purred, her lower back arching as he started to pick up speed. He was trying to draw it out for her, wait for her to build back up, but he didn\u2019t know how much longer he could hold out. His body was on fire, all the blood in him pooled in one engorged place.</p><p>Her hands fell from the bar she\u2019d been holding and caressed his slick back, feeling like silk on his skin. She scraped the edges of her nails across the surface, heightening his pleasure. Her every touch, singeing him in the most erotic way he could imagine.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he commanded, suddenly needing to see her eyes. Needing to see her pleasure for him as she climaxed.</p><p>Her eyes slowly opened as if it took all her strength, the intense need in their depths sending him to a whole new realm of reality. His temperature spiked another few degrees as she opened her mouth in shock and delight as he rocked against her.</p><p>\u201cSo full, so incredible,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>He was done for.</p><p>He gripped her tight as he picked up speed, faster than before, and repeatedly rocking against her, filling her over and over again as he felt his pleasure getting ready to explode. His face was next to hers, their eyes locked together in desire, her deep depths darkening as her own body readied itself for a second explosion.</p><p>Need \u2013 burning, blinding need \u2013 that\u2019s what they did to each other.</p><p>Her hand shot out making something clatter to the floor. He didn\u2019t care. Then her leg stiffened as she reached even higher. Something else fell over. There was probably a line of people outside the door, wondering what was going on.</p><p>Let them keep wondering.</p><p>Raw, untamed, explosive need consumed him.</p><p>He thrust forward and she exploded around him, gripping him so tight, he could barely push into her. Her head fell back against the wall, her arms going limp as she shook. He watched in amazement as her eyes dilated, her mouth opened in wonder, and the moan from deep within her stomach became sweet music to his ears.</p><p>His gaze never left her face as he thrust into her several more times, her core pulsing around him as she quivered with her release. His body erupted, making him groan as his release shot deep within her womb.</p><p>He shook as wave after wave of pleasure washed over him, pumping his release inside her. He was shaking from the intense chills radiating throughout his body.</p><p>As the last of his release died down, his legs gave out. He slid down the wall with her still gripped tightly in his arms, and landed on his butt, her cradling his still full staff.</p><p>The small bounce as they sat had him groaning as she gripped him. There was no way he could go again, but his body hadn\u2019t quite figured that out yet.</p><p>\u201cYou make me crazy,\u201d he murmured as he moved his lips to her damp neck and sucked on the delicate skin, enjoying her taste. He slid his hand up the curve of her back, and danced his fingers along her rib cage, until he took the weight of her breast in his hand, his thumb skimming over her nipple.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d she pleaded with him.</p><p>Austin chuckled as he moved his mouth to kiss the corner of her lips, then her cheek. He vowed to kiss every single inch of her skin, to taste every delectable curve.</p><p>He was almost in a stupor as he held her, completely sated. He realized in those moments that he was falling in love with her. He thought love was a myth \u2013 unattainable. Even though he\u2019d seen it happen with his siblings, he never thought it would happen for him.</p><p>No woman had captivated him, no woman until Kinsey.</p><p>Just as he closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, trying to find the energy to move, he stiffened. His entire body grew taught as he thought over their love-making moments earlier, and then again a week ago.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t used protection. He always used it, without fail. Never had a woman had him lose his sanity to the point he forgot to protect both her and him.</p><p>\u201cKinsey, are you on the pill?\u201d he asked, praying the answer was yes.</p><p>She\u2019d been lax in his arms until he spoke those six words. Then, her entire body stiffened as if she too were realizing for the first time how stupid they\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cI... uh... there\u2019s been no reason,\u201d she finally managed to say, her head lifting as she looked into his eyes.</p><p>He was sure his expression matched her own dismayed one. His contentment evaporated as he thought about what the consequences could be. Sure, he was falling in love with her, but that didn\u2019t mean he was ready for the whole, white-picket-fence-two-point-five-kids thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kinsey. I\u2019m the one who should\u2019ve paid attention \u2013 should have protected you,\u201d he said, ashamed of himself.</p><p>His father had taught him and his brothers to never compromise a woman. He\u2019d told them they should be happily married before kids were ever mentioned. Then he\u2019d watched as a few of his family members had completely ignored his father\u2019s advice. He\u2019d vowed it wouldn\u2019t happen to him.</p><p>He was probably overreacting. How likely was it that she could get pregnant when they\u2019d only had sex twice with nothing? Couple\u2019s spent years trying without success. He gulped as he thought of his cousins. Hell, it seemed his family had supersonic swimmers, because it didn\u2019t take much for all of his nieces and nephews to pop up.</p><p>\u201cIt takes two, Austin. I should\u2019ve been making sure you were using a condom, too. You aren\u2019t going to play the martyr and take all the blame,\u201d Kinsey snapped, seeming to come out of her shock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pushed against him, and even though Austin was scared, he still felt the stirring of his body as she squirmed on his lap.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she demanded when he didn\u2019t loosen his grip. He quickly dropped his arms and she jumped up, gathering her clothes and slipping them on. It took Austin a minute to get moving, but finally he stood on shaking legs and followed suit.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything, Kinsey. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019ve been taught better. I should\u2019ve never thought about putting you in this position.\u201d</p><p>Even when he was trying to be a good guy, she had to snap. He was beginning to get irritated about it. He tried to reason with himself that they were both stressed, but he wasn\u2019t in the best frame of mind to keep his cool.</p> <p>\u201cSo, in other words, I haven\u2019t been taught correctly. I\u2019m just a female, after all. I don\u2019t think of things like pregnancy or disease. I just expect the big strong man to take care of me,\u201d she said with sarcasm. Austin felt his last thread of temper snapping.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your problem? We\u2019re fighting over something that probably isn\u2019t even an issue. The next time we have sex, I\u2019ll make sure to put on two condoms,\u201d he barked as he pulled his shirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cNext time? Are you flipping kidding me? You really think there\u2019s going to be a next time? Not even if my life depended on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s going to be a next time, Kinsey. And a time after that, and after that. We\u2019re not nearly done with each other,\u201d he warned.</p><p>She stood gaping at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind. He may have, in fact, lost it. He didn\u2019t even know any more. He couldn\u2019t seem to think around her, well, not with the right brain, at least. He knew he couldn\u2019t stand being away from her. He certainly wasn\u2019t ready to end their romance, or whatever it was they had going on.</p> <p>Kinsey marched up to him, her eyes flashing fire as her hand came up and poked him hard in the chest. He suddenly forgot what they were fighting over as desire consumed him.</p><p>She was magnificent in a temper. Intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not some push-over, Austin. I blame it on temporary insanity, lack of sleep, too much to drink, any number of excuses for the few times we\u2019ve been together. But that\u2019s all over. Do you hear me? Over! I\u2019m done with whatever this is, and I\u2019m getting on with my life. I don\u2019t think you have to worry about a pregnancy, because right now my body is certainly a hostile environment, and if your seed comes anywhere near my uterus, laser beams will strike the little swimmers down,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Austin couldn\u2019t keep from smiling, which led to laughter. A deep-from-the-stomach, bend-you-at-the-waist, healing sort of laughter. She was so glorious in her anger, so unbelievably exceptional that he wanted to haul her over his shoulder and cart her off to the nearest cave, where he could pound his chest and claim her as his.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, move from that door right now!\u201d</p><p>Her chest was heaving she was so angry. It took a mighty effort but he managed to stop the laughter, though his lips were still twitching. He leaned back, even more comfortably, as if he had all day.</p> <p>Kinsey\u2019s eyes narrowed before she lifted her leg and slammed her foot down on his still bare one. Austin inwardly cringed as a small pain shot up his leg, but he just smiled at her. There was no way he was letting her know he\u2019d felt a thing.</p><p>\u201cThis discussion isn\u2019t over yet, Kinsey, so you may as well make yourself comfortable so we can chat,\u201d he said, keeping his voice calm.</p><p>She glared at him for several more moments before letting out a frustrated breath and taking a step back. She must\u2019ve figured out there was no way she was going to physically move him, so she had little choice but to stay in the closet and hash it out.</p><p>\u201cFine, then talk. But make it fast because I\u2019m exhausted and want to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re pregnant, how soon until you know?\u201d he asked as if it was a simple question to answer. In his mind, it was pretty black and white.</p><p>\u201cReally, Austin? How soon will I know? Well, let\u2019s see, considering I\u2019ve never been pregnant before, I wouldn\u2019t know. Most women that come into the hospital are in their second month and still shocked when we tell them they don\u2019t have the flu, but they\u2019re going to be a mother in about seven months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either, Kinsey. It isn\u2019t like I go around knocking women up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAustin, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it tonight. The deed is done. It\u2019s not like we can go back in time and slip a condom on you, so let\u2019s leave it alone until we know something. I\u2019ll tell you what, in a few weeks if I haven\u2019t started my cycle, I\u2019ll get a test, then give you a call. Until then, back off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe sooner you know, the better, Kinsey. If you\u2019re pregnant, I want to get married right away. I don\u2019t need our son or daughter figuring out the math earlier than they need to,\u201d he said as he bent and started putting on his socks and shoes.</p><p>When he was done, he looked up, and he could swear he saw smoke coming out of her ears. Her face was red and she was looking at him like he was an alien from another planet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. He had no idea why she was still so ticked off.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Really? I mean every woman dreams of the ideal proposal, but I think I need to send this one in to Bride\u2019s magazine,\u201d she replied tartly.</p><p>\u201cYou want romance? Fine, I\u2019ll give you romance,\u201d he thundered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want romance. I don\u2019t want anything right now but to get out of this claustrophobic room,\u201d she yelled back.</p><p>They stood glaring at each other for several minutes. Austin knew it wouldn\u2019t do him any good to continue the conversation, but for some reason he didn\u2019t want to open the door. He knew the second he did, she was going to run out and then he\u2019d have a heck of a time seeing her again.</p><p>Why was he chasing a woman so hard who obviously didn\u2019t want to be caught? His pride was taking a serious downward spiral the longer he spent with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to do the right thing, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never asked you to, Austin. I didn\u2019t ask for you to sacrifice yourself for me. If I were pregnant, that would in no way mean I\u2019d expect, or even want, to get married. It would just mean there would be a small being growing inside me. I refuse to get married because you think you have to do the right thing. That\u2019s no life for me to live, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to you, either. We would just end up hating each other and making our child miserable,\u201d she explained, some of her temper dimming.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t look at it like a sacrifice, Kinsey. I don\u2019t think being married to you would be a hardship. We\u2019ve proven we\u2019re great in bed. That, right there, is half the battle. We obviously don\u2019t have a problem with expressing ourselves, so there\u2019s the other half. I say we\u2019re a match made in heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about everything, okay? I just... I need some time,\u201d she begged.</p><p>Austin knew the discussion was over. He couldn\u2019t hold her hostage all night in the janitor\u2019s closet. If she thought it was the last she\u2019d hear from him, though, she was sadly mistaken.</p><p>\u201cFine, but we need to talk more about this after you\u2019ve rested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed too easily. He had a feeling once she marched out the door, the discussion would be over in her mind. Well, she thought he\u2019d been persistent in pursuing her before. It was nothing compared to what he\u2019d do to fight for his family \u2013 and if she carried his child, she was family.</p><p>Austin opened the door without another word, and Kinsey quickly skirted around him and made a beeline through it. He followed her out and watched as she rushed down the hallway. He let her go. She could blow off some steam and then they\u2019d revisit the discussion later.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>Kinsey stepped outside the hospital and kept on walking. She didn\u2019t dare look back. She couldn\u2019t. She was both afraid he was there, and he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Really, what was wrong with her?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get a handle on how she felt about Austin. When he was with her, he seemed to inspire her strongest emotions, whether it was happiness, lust, joy, or sorrow. She also had to admit that when he wasn\u2019t there, she missed him. Missed him past the point of rationality.</p><p>Why did she like him so much? Was sex really that important? There must be a switch in her brain that would allow her to turn off her attraction to him. If only she could figure out how to find it...</p><p>Her mind replayed the last year. Her best friend\u2019s wedding \u2013 where it all had begun. He\u2019d made her burn that night, and she hadn\u2019t stopped since. She was fighting him each step of the way because he scared her. She knew she could easily fall in love, if she wasn\u2019t there already. She also knew he could walk away without a thought. That\u2019s who he was. She knew that, so she\u2019d only have herself to blame if she were in love.</p><p>Her stomach dipped, and she felt tears burn behind her lids. What if they really had made a baby together? What would she do?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even go there right now, Kinsey,\u201d she muttered aloud, needing to hear the words spoken.</p><p>Life changed all the time. Sometimes it was for the better and sometimes for the worst, but no matter what, it was important to remain standing. She\u2019d been through a few hard times in her life, she could make it through this.</p><p>Kinsey thought about her family. It was time to go home for a visit. Her mother would know something was wrong the moment she walked through the door, but that was the price she was willing to pay, because she needed her mom\u2019s shoulder to cry on. She needed her father\u2019s comforting hug. Heck, she even needed the harassment she\u2019d receive from her brothers about her never visiting anymore.</p><p>She could deal with it all if she just went home and regrouped.</p><p>With a plan in motion, Kinsey picked up her pace. It was too far of a walk to her apartment, but she needed to burn some energy or she\u2019d never be able to sleep once she got there. She decided she\u2019d just walk until she was tired, then find the nearest bus stop.</p><p>After a half-hour she was ready for the warmth of the bus. She found a pick-up location and waited. Her luck was with her when it showed up five minutes later. She climbed on board, huddled in her seat and waited for her stop.</p><p>She smiled when she thought that by noon tomorrow she\u2019d be with her mom, sitting in her big country kitchen, while chaos erupted all around her. It was exactly what the doctor would order.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Day Eighteen</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t seem to get a single second alone with you. I don\u2019t want to do this on the phone, but Esther Lyon, will -\u201d George said into his phone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say it, George,\u201d Esther interrupted him.</p><p>George groaned in frustration. He felt like an errant teenager, hiding in a bathroom stall. He\u2019d tried to get away from his kids, but something was always coming up. Every time he turned around, there they were. He had to speak to Esther \u2013 had to make her see they were meant to be together.</p><p>He missed her \u2013 missed her more than he thought possible. He knew, without a doubt, he loved her, and he was dang well going to get her to agree to be his bride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>There was a long pause on the other end of the line...</p><p>\u201cI miss you, too, George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is let me tell my family and then this is all over. We can quit hiding. I\u2019ll take you around the world where there won\u2019t be a chance of anyone interrupting us. Let me spoil you, Esther. Nothing would please me more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a romantic, George. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve fallen in love with you. But nothing has changed. I don\u2019t feel right about this with Joseph in the hospital. What if he doesn\u2019t make it? Then, our start would always be a moment of sadness,\u201d Esther explained.</p><p>\u201cJoseph wouldn\u2019t want me to be unhappy, even if he didn\u2019t make it. I know my brother,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think the kids would accept it, George. What if they somehow know, and they\u2019re trying to keep us apart because they don\u2019t approve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense. My children want me to be happy, and they already love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know....\u201d She trailed off.</p> <p>\u201cEsther...\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cDad, are you in here?\u201d Max called. George wanted to yell. Instead he remained quiet, hoping his son would go away.</p><p>\u201cI can hear your son, George. I\u2019ll talk to you later,\u201d Esther said before quickly hanging up. With a frustrated groan, he kicked the metal wall, causing a loud echo in the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m here. I\u2019ll be right out,\u201d he muttered, trying to mask his annoyance.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right? What was that noise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I just slipped and kicked the wall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ve been looking for you. It\u2019s time to go back to Joseph\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>George gave up on his hiding time and made his way out of the stall. I can\u2019t even use the toilet in peace, he thought grumpily.</p><p>Max looked at him with suspicion, but didn\u2019t question him further. George hung his head as he followed Max, having no clue that Max was texting his siblings and cousins at that moment, telling them they\u2019d have a new member added to their family at any time.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>The room filled as everyone came back at the same time. They beamed when they found Katherine waiting for them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very eager,\u201d Katherine said.</p><p>\u201cYes, please continue. We won\u2019t say a single word,\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>Katherine smiled as her nephew, Max, leaned in and gave his wife a kiss. The kids were all doing so well, still looking very much in love and happy with their spouses. She knew their love would continue to grow, long after she and Joseph had to leave them behind.</p> <p>She looked to her husband and silently told him it wasn\u2019t yet time to leave, though. They had many years left, and a family to still take care of.</p><p>\u201cNow, where was I when we last left off?\u201d Katherine asked.</p><p>\u201cThe big meeting was coming up,\u201d Mark answered quickly.</p><p>Katherine chuckled, enjoying the enthusiasm of her son. It was amusing how even the boys were enthralled with her memories.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, Mark, that\u2019s right. I was so nervous. We were having a huge board meeting. I hadn\u2019t heard from Joseph since the phone call and I knew he\u2019d be there. Of course he would. I hoped he\u2019d sit back and stay in the background, but you know Joseph isn\u2019t one to hide in corners. I was getting ready to open the meeting when there was a stirring in the room...\u201d</p><p>Katherine took a deep breath and rose from her chair. She looked around the table where the other board members sat, all eyes on her. Then she looked out at the crowd, the investors who wanted answers, wanted to know their money was being taken care of. They all had a stake in the company, and wanted what was best for them. What was that, though?</p><p>Benjamin had handpicked his board and had complete faith they\u2019d choose wisely after he passed. Katherine felt the weight of the thousands depending on them to make that decision.</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, when there was a stir in the room. She didn\u2019t need to meet his eyes to know Joseph had walked in. He was the wild card. The one they all wanted, but didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d be the right person for the job. He was both the hope and the tragedy.</p><p>They knew he loved his grandfather, but he\u2019d left without a word. He was also wildly successful on his own, so why would he want to lock himself down to such a demanding position. If they chose him, and he declined, the stocks would plummet because the people would lose faith in the board of directors. He was there, but he hadn\u2019t said whether he\u2019d actually accept the position if it was offered to him.</p><p>It was a difficult decision, and she had one of the key votes. Sweat broke out on her brow as she looked over the crowd, her eyes immediately finding his. He stared back, unconcerned with the people watching. It was as if he were letting the world know he didn\u2019t care what they thought. He\u2019d do whatever pleased him.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>His gaze locked with hers, Joseph was frozen for a moment. She stood proud at the table, wearing a black business suit, her hair in a knot at the base of her long, slender neck, and a notebook in her hand as she waited to begin her presentation.</p><p>She was stunning.</p><p>He wanted to start by taking down her hair, watching it cascade across her shoulders, making her appear softer. He missed the girl of five years before, who had stars shining in her eyes. This woman she\u2019d become was spectacular, but she was too guarded. He needed to sneak beneath the wall she\u2019d built and slowly tear it down, piece by piece if need be.</p><p>As their eyes stayed locked together, he could swear he saw her breath hitch. But she quickly regained her confident demeanor and turned away. There was no hesitation in her manner, no indication that she was burning as hot as he was.</p><p>He was determined to find out if it was an act, or if she was indeed over him.</p><p>Joseph sat back and watched. His eyes constantly strayed to her as she spoke, pointing out numbers and logistics, but he didn\u2019t care. He already had the corporate information memorized. He was impressed with her knowledge, though.</p><p>As she finished, questions were fired at her, one after the other. She never sweated it. She calmly answered each one, leaving no room for doubt that she was on the board for a reason. A very good reason.</p><p>She\u2019d changed since he\u2019d last known her. The fire that had always burned bright inside of her was now out in the open for the world to see. Her demeanor seemed to say if people don\u2019t like it, then they can back off.</p><p>He found himself even more drawn to her.</p><p>She was a rare woman. Beauty, passion, poise. She had the crowd eating out of her hand before she was done. He wondered if she could see past the show some of the members put on. Only time would tell.</p><p>The meeting droned on with other board members speaking, more questions asked. He was losing patience with it all by the third hour. He wanted Katherine to himself. He was done with the politics involved in a new CEO being elected.</p><p>He could wait. He\u2019d waited five years, already. What was another hour or two?</p><p>Katherine felt as if a thousand needles were being drilled into her head. She knew Joseph\u2019s gaze rarely left her. It took momentous willpower to keep from shifting her eyes and connecting with his cold blue depths.</p><p>Her stomach was tied in knots as she waited for the meeting to end. The questions kept coming, one after the other, several of them just a variation of the one before it. She had to keep on her toes, though, had to pay attention, because if she missed even the slightest verbiage, she\u2019d be lost and the piranhas would pounce.</p><p>They\u2019d love to take a bite from her flesh, as much as she knew Joseph would be first in line for that honor.</p><p>Katherine knew Joseph was making a stir among the people. His very presence stopped traffic wherever he was, but there seemed to be no middle ground when it came to him. The people either loved him and looked at him like a savior, or they despised him and expected him to destroy their world.</p><p>She wondered for a moment what it must be like for him to yield that kind of power. To be so important that your very existence influenced the lives around you.</p><p>As she shook off the thoughts, she realized the room was silent. Maybe the people had heard enough for the day. It seemed Round One was soon to be over.</p><p>\u201cThank you all for being here today. The board members have agreed to stay for the next hour and answer individual questions you may have. We understand that the decision we\u2019re making affects all of you and we want your faith and trust in us. Meeting adjourned,\u201d Katherine said.</p><p>The room erupted in conversations as people moved about, everyone trying to figure out where to go that would benefit them the most. Who did they want to rub elbows with the most, who could advance their careers? It was all a game \u2013 just a game on a million dollar scale.</p><p>She quickly gathered her belongings, already having notified the other members she wasn\u2019t staying for this part. She wanted to escape before Joseph came near. She knew he would. It wasn\u2019t in him not to.</p><p>\u201cVery impressive, Katherine. I think you\u2019ve learned quite well how to play games in the corporate world, how to dance a different routine to each separate piece. I guess you\u2019re no longer the na\u00efve girl I met five years ago,\u201d Joseph said, stopping her movements.</p><p>Had she really been so dumb to believe she could escape without him tracking her first?</p><p>She slowly turned, frustration brewing in her. There were too many people standing around for her to make a scene. She couldn\u2019t act antagonistic toward him, or rumors would spread.</p><p>She felt like having a small tantrum, possibly using her three inch heel to dig into his foot. The thought almost made her smile.</p><p>She managed to keep a cool expression as she looked into his face.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Joseph. I appreciate your kind words. I\u2019m running late, but would love to chat later, perhaps after the next board meeting,\u201d she said, then turned to leave.</p><p>His hand shot out and gripped her arm. His fingers holding on tightly, though no one around them would know. The way he held her would look to any outsider as if he was simply escorting her for a walk.</p><p>He began leading her toward the very door she\u2019d meant to escape through. She didn\u2019t want to go through it with him, though. She didn\u2019t trust herself, not after what happened in her apartment.</p><p>\u201cYou should know by now, Katherine, that I\u2019m not a patient man. I can\u2019t wait until the next meeting. I think you also know that I\u2019ll use any means necessary to get my way. You can either speak to me willingly, or I could always try another method to get your cooperation,\u201d he threatened.</p><p>A shiver ran down her spine at his words, spoken in a pleasant tone, but passionate, nonetheless. She knew he wouldn\u2019t be at all afraid of causing a scene. She, on the other hand, would be mortified by it.</p><p>He could easily ride off into the sunset, once again leaving her behind, nearly broken, trying to pick up the pieces of her shattered life.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary, Joseph. I\u2019ll just modify my plans a little. I wouldn\u2019t want to upset one of our candidates,\u201d she said through gritted teeth. She hoped no one was paying attention to their conversation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What made the entire situation even worse was the desire flowing through her at his touch. He was dressed to impress, though she knew it was just who he was.</p><p>His custom fitted suit draped his body in a way that left nothing to the imagination. His wide shoulders filled the coat out to perfection, while the pants hugged his hips, and showcased his muscular legs. One hand gripped her arm, while the other rested in his pocket, making him appear like he was headed to his next photo shoot.</p><p>He was impressive, even more so than he\u2019d been five years ago. There were men who appeared confident, and then there was Joseph. He was a rare specimen of the most perfect order. He knew all of that, though. He knew exactly what he was doing to her, just like he knew every single female in the room would go home and dream about him, a few of the married ones, too.</p><p>If his piercing blue eyes, and flawless body weren\u2019t enough to make her heart race, the sound of his deep voice caressing her from the inside out had her knees shaking. She wanted to find a wall and sink down it to the floor.</p> <p>Just a few more minutes, she promised herself. A few more minutes and you can escape.</p><p>\u201cHave you cast your vote, Katherine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be none of your business, Joseph,\u201d she quickly replied as she tugged at her arm, not enough for others to notice, but enough for him to get the hint she wanted him to let go. He managed to get them closer to the door, though she was doing all she could to block his path.</p><p>\u201cI get the feeling you\u2019re not enjoying our talk,\u201d he mocked her.</p><p>Katherine fumed at his knowing look. He enjoyed his power game. She decided to quit giving him the victory.</p> <p>\u201cI always enjoy speaking with any member of the Anderson family, Joseph. I know you\u2019re a busy man and I\u2019m grateful you\u2019ve been able to attend,\u201d she said in the politically correct response.</p><p>She stopped struggling for release and allowed him to lead her from the room. At least once they got away from people, she could quit biting her tongue and let him know how she truly felt. As if he figured her out, he stopped their forward movement at the door\u2019s threshold.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans the rest of the day?\u201d he asked as if he had the right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a full schedule. It was nice speaking with you, but I need to leave now,\u201d she told him as she stepped away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow you. I have extra time on my hands,\u201d he said, switching from gripping her arm to placing it through his. She noticed they\u2019d drawn attention, just what she hadn\u2019t wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have more important things to attend than harassing me, Joseph. You\u2019re starting to cause a scene, so please be a good little boy and run along,\u201d she hissed as she stepped from the room.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so good for me, Katherine. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to let you go.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, terrified when she saw the seriousness of his words written on his face. He may actually mean what he was saying. A shiver racked her body.</p><p>Escape.</p><p>She had to get far away from him, because she could too easily see herself once again falling under his spell. She was half-way there already.</p><p>As soon as they were clear of people, she snatched her arm back and dashed down the hall, her only thought was to get as far from him as humanly possible. The spell he weaved was intoxicating. It wouldn\u2019t take much more to make her fall at his feet.</p><p>She reached the elevator and pushed the down button, turning her head and breathing in relief when she didn\u2019t see him. The doors opened and she climbed inside, leaning against the back wall and beginning to breathe easier as the doors started closing.</p><p>Just when she thought she was free, a hand reached out and stopped the doors from closing. Within seconds, Joseph was sealed inside with her \u2013 giving her nowhere to hide.</p><p>Her heart thundered at the predatory look in his eyes. Her stomach tied in knots, she looked at him \u2013 really looked at him, standing there so self-assured, fire brewing in his eyes.</p> <p>She knew she was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Katherine, I\u2019m beginning to enjoy our game of cat and mouse. Chasing you seems to be my new favorite pastime. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do for fun once you\u2019ve accepted the inevitable,\u201d he whispered, his voice seductive, his body sending a challenge she desperately wanted to accept.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing, Joseph. I don\u2019t want you,\u201d she replied, her breathless voice betraying her words.</p><p>He smirked knowingly as he took a step toward her. She pressed her back as far against the wall as humanly possible. If he touched her, it was all over. She knew she was on the edge of the cliff, and just the slightest whisper of wind would push her over.</p><p>\u201cDo you truly believe that, my Katherine? Are you lying to me, or to yourself? This has been inevitable \u2013 it has been from the first moment I spotted you at the dance. We haven\u2019t finished our song yet.\u201d</p><p>His words were pure seduction, melting her. Her legs shook, and her lips parted as air rushed in and out of her lungs. She tried telling herself it was only a game to him, that he\u2019d grow bored as soon as he caught her, but her brain function was short-circuiting. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to deny him.</p><p>With a last ditch effort at survival, she set her shoulders and tried her hardest.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t always win, Joseph. You don\u2019t always get what you want. I don\u2019t want you,\u201d she snapped, though, the breathless quality of her voice betrayed the tone she\u2019d been going for.</p><p>\u201cYou are correct, Katherine. I don\u2019t always get what I want. But you\u2019re also wrong. You do want me. Need is burning in your eyes, desire for me.\u201d</p><p>He hit the emergency stop button, bringing them to a halt. Then he stepped up close, his body only an inch from touching her. She refused to look him in the face, and in turn chose to pour all concentration on the emerald green of his tie, such a pretty color...</p><p>She tried distracting herself, anything to keep from reaching out and running her hands along the thick muscles of his biceps. She had to fight her mind not to think of him lying next to her, his chest bare for her to explore.</p><p>His hand reached up and cupped her chin, forcing her head to lift. She wanted to be stubborn, to try and fight the movement, but she was no match for him, and they both knew it. Her head tilted and her eyes met his, intense desire burning hot, leaving her breathless.</p><p>The look of power, confidence, and desire was her undoing. She knew the kiss was coming. She also knew she was powerless to stop it. She only had so much willpower \u2013 and she\u2019d reached her limit for the day.</p><p>It had always been him and always would be and he was destroying the carefully guarded fortress she\u2019d dedicated to building around her heart. When she had a moment to think, she\u2019d fall apart. She just hoped she was alone when it happened, then he wouldn\u2019t get to glory in his true victory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you now, Katherine. I\u2019m only warning you because I\u2019m close to losing my sanity at the moment. You may not have figured it out, yet, but I\u2019m powerless with you. You control this. You have the power. One touch from you has my body in flames. One sigh from your lips and my heart quickens. I need you like I\u2019ve never needed anyone. It\u2019s almost a violent compulsion. I feel I can\u2019t survive if I don\u2019t take you with me to the ends of the world and back,\u201d Joseph said, his voice deep, dark, and utterly devastating.</p><p>Suddenly she found herself pressed between his solid frame and the back of the elevator. He was crushing her in the best possible way. Before she had time to think, his head leaned down for his mouth to claim her.</p><p>He was done talking, he was done seducing. He was claiming her in the oldest way known to man.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t fight him anymore. She gave up trying, and wrapped her arms around his neck, letting him have her, relinquishing all she had, his mission now accomplished.</p><p>Katherine didn\u2019t know how much time passed, she didn\u2019t care. She didn\u2019t even know where she was anymore.</p><p>\u201cThis is Anderson Security. Is there a problem with the elevator?\u201d</p><p>Katherine jumped as Joseph lifted his head, his eyes glazed.</p><p>\u201cHello, please pick up the phone to the left of the door. Do we need to call the fire marshal?\u201d a voice spoke over the intercom.</p><p>Joseph swore as he took a step back. Katherine looked around, praying there wasn\u2019t a camera witnessing their behavior. She knew the staff and would be utterly mortified to come back into work knowing they\u2019d seen her acting so wantonly.</p><p>With an angry growl, Joseph released the stop button, ignoring the phone. The elevator started its downward motion again. Only a few floors to go.</p><p>\u201cCome home with me, Katherine,\u201d he commanded as he turned back to her, the fire having dimmed, but still shining in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cJoseph...\u201d she said. She\u2019d come out of her fog.</p><p>Intensity was pouring off of him, urging her to continue.</p><p>\u201cYou want me, Katherine. Quit fighting yourself,\u201d he demanded as he stepped toward her again.</p><p>The elevator doors opened, surprising him long enough for her to skirt around him. Katherine rushed past him and didn\u2019t hesitate for even a fraction of a second. She knew she\u2019d have to build much stronger walls to keep him out the next time they met...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but it\u2019s long past visiting hours,\u201d a nurse apologized as she stepped into the room.</p><p>Katherine looked at the nurse, her mind foggy as she came back from the past. Then she looked at her husband.</p><p>So handsome. He hadn\u2019t changed one bit in her mind. His passion, beauty, and zest for life had only grown deeper, richer and stronger. The more she talked about their beginning, the more she needed him to wake.</p><p>A tear fell down her face as she looked at him. She gripped his hand and let the tears flow. \u201cPlease come back to me, Joseph. You made me love you. You refused to let me go. Now, I refuse to let you go. I refuse to give up. You come back to me soon, real soon,\u201d she demanded. She didn\u2019t even realize she spoke the words out loud.</p><p>She kept her eyes glued to her husband as she felt kisses on her cheek. She knew her family was saying goodbye for the night, giving her time to grieve.</p><p>They knew what she needed. After all, they were here because of the great love she shared with the wonderful man lying so still in front of her.</p><p>With a final tear escaping, Katherine slowly climbed in bed next to Joseph, holding him close. She was exhausted, drained, emotionally and physically.</p><p>The last thing she remembered before blessed oblivion overtook her was the feel of soft blankets being placed over her.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Austin sat back with a determined look on his face. He was grateful to have a distraction from his continual thoughts of Kinsey. He was going out of his mind. Was she pregnant? When would he see her again? What was she thinking?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re up to this. I know you have a lot going on right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he answered. \u201cReally,\u201d he added when Trenton gave him a suspicious look. \u201cQuit trying to coddle me. I\u2019m not one of your kids.\u201d</p><p>They reached the warehouse and Austin climbed from his car. He watched as employees filed through the doors, getting ready for their day to begin. He never enjoyed firing anyone, but he was happy to get rid of Jack. He was bad news all the way around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to take your word for it, but remember to keep calm.

To the outside world, he looked like the corporate shark he was, though he was boiling on the inside.</p><p>They passed through the doors, watching as employees placed personal items in their lockers and put on their safety gear. A few greeted them, not alarmed to have them there. It wasn\u2019t unusual for any of the Anderson family member\u2019s to come and personally check on their varying businesses. They often jumped in while on site and gave a hand.</p> <p>It was their fathers who\u2019d taught them that hard work was expected, not to be passed off. They\u2019d teach their children the same values. Just because they\u2019d been fortunate enough to be born into money didn\u2019t give them the right to forgo certain steps in their learning process.</p><p>\u201cA little sweat helps you grow into a man,\u201d both Joseph and George would say to their boys. Austin had actually heard Trenton say the same thing to his son. The thought almost made him smile \u2013 would have, too, if not for the situation.</p><p>\u201cTrenton. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Can you come look at something?\u201d an employee asked as he rushed over to them. Trenton looked at Austin, obviously unsure if he should leave him on his own.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I\u2019m fine. Go help. Come find me when you\u2019re finished,\u201d Austin snapped, the last of his patience with his brother evaporated.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Trenton said as he turned and went down the hall.</p> <p>Austin figured he had a lot of room to do what he wanted if that were the case. Trenton had been the wildest of them all, the word no just being another challenge for his brother.</p><p>Putting Trenton out of his mind, Austin continued to walk toward the loading dock, where he knew Jack would be. He tuned out the conversations going on around him as he focused on the task at hand.</p><p>\u201cHi, Austin. Glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Dean said as he appeared at his side.</p><p>\u201cYeah, better to get this over with. Which bay is he in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNumber twenty-three. I\u2019m coming with you. He\u2019s been pissier than usual lately and I have a feeling you may need a witness. There\u2019s been mention that he might be on drugs. I don\u2019t know what happened to him. He used to be one of our best guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really bothers me when this kind of thing happens. I like a clean ship ran.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry I allowed it to get this far,\u201d Dean said, obviously embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a great job, Dean. You notified us as soon as the problem was found. You can\u2019t tell when someone\u2019s about to snap. It just happens,\u201d Austin reassured his foreman.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak any further as they approached the bay. When Jack turned and spotted the two of them, his eyes narrowed and he stood up in a defensive stance. Austin took a deep breath. He could already tell the conversation wasn\u2019t going to go well \u2013 not in the least bit.</p><p>\u201cJack, can you come outside with me? We need to have a talk,\u201d Austin asked in his most professional tone.</p><p>Jack looked from him to Dean before answering.</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d He didn\u2019t budge from his stance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d much rather do this in private, Jack,\u201d Austin tried again, though he knew it wouldn\u2019t do any good.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it that we need to do in private?\u201d Jack demanded.</p> <p>Austin sighed. He knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy so he didn\u2019t understand why he was letting it get to him. It had to be everything else going on in his life - Uncle Joseph, his father, and especially Kinsey.</p><p>Jack was already looking for a fight, his defenses up. He had to have known he was going to get caught eventually. Drugs tended to make a person think they were invincible, though, so maybe Jack really had thought he could keep getting away with his little theft ring.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come across some irrefutable evidence that items have been stolen from the yard...\u201d Austin began when Jack interrupted.</p><p>\u201cSo what? I don\u2019t know anything about it. Why are you talking to me,\u201d he bellowed. Jack\u2019s temper was starting to really escalate. With just a few words, he was darting his eyes around, before turning back to Austin, glaring with an intense hatred.</p><p>\u201cJack, the evidence points to you,\u201d Austin said, his voice quiet. He was trying to avoid a scene, but wasn\u2019t having much success.</p><p>Several workers had stopped and were openly staring. Many of them already knew the situation. Rumors flew rampant in any workplace, but most of these guys had been working together for years already and rumors spread faster than normal. They weren\u2019t even trying to hide the fact that they were watching.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. You can\u2019t come in here and accuse me. It\u2019s probably one of your greedy relatives. I\u2019ve been framed, that\u2019s it,\u201d he shouted, his face turning red, his nostrils flaring. He looked around, starting to notice all the people watching. \u201cWhat are you looking at? Don\u2019t you all have a job to do? This is none of your business,\u201d he cried out.</p><p>Austin heard someone chuckle, and he tensed, waiting for Jack to explode.</p><p>\u201cGet security here, now,\u201d Austin whispered to Dean, who nodded and quickly left.</p><p>Jack wearily watched Dean go before his gaze locked back on Austin.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jack. Let\u2019s go outside,\u201d he tried one more time.</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to hide. You can\u2019t bully me around just because you were born with a silver spoon in your damn mouth. I ain't going anywhere. If you want to go outside, then be my freaking guest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough, Jack,\u201d Austin thundered. He was losing his cool no matter how much he tried to reign it in. The man was pissing him off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough, too. Now, get the hell out of here so I can do my job!\u201d</p><p>Jack actually turned away, acting as if Austin was dismissed. Austin stood there for a moment in shock. The man had to be on some pretty intense drugs if he truly thought he could talk to his employer that way and still have a job. His job had been over no matter what, but seriously, what was he thinking?</p><p>\u201cJack, you no longer work for this company. A guard is coming to escort you off the premises. You can gather your possession, and then you aren\u2019t to step foot on any of the Anderson properties again. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Austin\u2019s voice was back under control. He was a professional and needed to remember that. He carefully watched as Jack turned back to him, his face a swollen red ball, fists clenched at his sides, stance threatening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked for you for years. Years! And this is the way you pay me for it. You treat me like a common criminal? I\u2019ll sue you for wrongful termination, take everything you\u2019ve got, you pansy ass son of a b...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough, Jack. Follow me to the lockers, this conversation is over,\u201d Austin interrupted. He was damned if he\u2019d stand there and allow the thief to speak to him that way.</p><p>\u201cYou can go to hell!\u201d Jack yelled and Austin heard his steps charging toward him. He quickly stepped to the side and turned. Jack had his fist raised and was bringing it downward toward his face.</p><p>Austin easily blocked the forward movement, stunning Jack. Then Austin threw a punch of his own, landing a solid right to the man\u2019s jaw, making him stagger back. Jack shook his head, then looked up, rage consuming him as he charged forward again.</p><p>Austin stood still and waited, then sent a hard kick into Jack\u2019s stomach, doubling him over as he threw up at Austin\u2019s feet. He quickly jumped out of the way as Jack collapsed on the floor, groaning in pain and gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me, Jack? You couldn\u2019t take this like a man and just walk out. I was trying to do this as easy as possible, but you had to charge me. Do you really want to go to jail on top of being fired?\u201d Austin demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who hit me. I\u2019ll take you for all you have, you bastard. I\u2019ll own everything, this building, your house, all of it,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and try. There are about twenty people standing around who saw the whole thing,\u201d Austin snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this now, boss. Jack, come with me,\u201d his guard said as he grabbed Jack by the back of the shirt and yanked him up. The guard, Tommy, was intimidatingly huge. Even Jack didn\u2019t look stupid enough to mess with him.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Tommy.\u201d Austin turned and walked away as Tommy began leading Jack from the premises.</p><p>\u201cHow high are you, Jack? Damn, that was stupid,\u201d he heard Tommy say before he got out of hearing distance.</p><p>Austin made it to the office before Trenton found him. By the smirk on his brother\u2019s face, he already knew what had happened. He kept walking, not wanting to hear the gloating. Austin wouldn\u2019t have hit Jack if he hadn\u2019t charged him.</p><p>He knew he was on a short fuse, the whole situation with Kinsey keeping him on pins and needles, but he wasn\u2019t normally violent. But explaining that to his brother would do him no good. Trenton just loved to say \u2018I told you so.\u2019</p><p>\u201cI heard you could\u2019ve used a little back up, that Jack almost took you down,\u201d Trenton said, stopping Austin in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you kidding me? That little piss-ant couldn\u2019t get the upper hand even on my worst day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you kicked his ass just for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! He charged me. It was self-defense,\u201d Austin snapped as he resumed walking. Trenton was trying to get a reaction and he was doing a good job of it.</p><p>\u201cI knew I should\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that would have stopped anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, but then I might have got to jump in and get a few swings myself,\u201d Trenton said with a laugh.</p><p>Austin couldn\u2019t help the smile from appearing. He looked at his brother, at the wicked humor in his eyes, then started laughing. He didn\u2019t know if it was the stress, Jack, Kinsey, his father, Uncle Joseph or what the hell it was, but suddenly he couldn\u2019t quit laughing.</p><p>He laughed until his stomach hurt and tears were in his eyes. After about five minutes, he finally managed to straighten up and look at his brother, who was eying him like he\u2019d lost his mind. Hell, maybe he had.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a really long week,\u201d was his only explanation.</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Trenton replied as he climbed in the car next to him.</p><p>They didn\u2019t say anything more as they left the warehouse behind. Austin relaxed, knowing that was the end of it. Trenton would leave him alone and let him work through whatever was driving him to the point of hysterical laughter.</p><p>He also knew Trenton would be there in a heartbeat the second he needed to talk about it.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cThanks for meeting with me, Kinsey. The family is moving Joseph tomorrow. As you know, he needs nursing around the clock when home, and the family wants you to continue his care. Have you made your decision, yet?\u201d Kinsey\u2019s supervisor asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kinsey had been thinking of what she wanted to do for the past couple weeks. She was going to refuse, even though she knew it could be detrimental for her career, but she didn\u2019t think she could handle being in the Anderson Mansion, knowing Austin would be making appearances often.</p><p>She caved, though, after Cassie begged her. How could she deny her best friend when she was obviously so worried about Joseph?</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll take the position.\u201d</p><p>Her supervisor gave her a relieved smile. It seemed she didn\u2019t want to be the one to tell any of the Anderson family, no. Kinsey could sympathize with the overworked woman.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great news. We\u2019ll miss you while you\u2019re gone, but your position will still be here when he recovers,\u201d her boss said.</p><p>Kinsey loved how optimistic her boss was. She never gave up on a patient, not even when everyone else in the room already had. She\u2019d saved so many lives, Kinsey felt the hospital should be named after her. Most often though, the hardest workers were those who were the most under-appreciated.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and take the rest of the day off. You\u2019ve certainly earned it,\u201d she said as they both stood up.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey walked from the office, grateful she\u2019d get to see Joseph\u2019s care to the very end, but nervous about what it meant with Austin. She hadn\u2019t spoken to him since their fight and she still didn\u2019t know if pregnancy was a valid concern. She was afraid to even go there at the moment. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do if the answer were yes.</p> <p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cIf you sign here, we can discharge your husband and get him ready for transport,\u201d Dr. Weston said as he looked over Joseph\u2019s chart.</p><p>Katherine sighed in relief. She was ready to leave the hospital. She knew getting her husband home would make all the difference. He needed to be where their magic had blossomed. He\u2019d found the land, built their dream home, created their babies, and solidified their love on that property.</p><p>It was a healing place, and she knew he\u2019d come back to her once she got him home.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Doctor,\u201d Katherine responded, not able to say anything more than that.</p><p>The process moved quickly and before she knew it, the ambulance drivers were there, getting Joseph ready for transport.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going home, my love,\u201d Katherine whispered, a small smile on her face.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Day twenty-five</p><p>\u201cI really need to speak to you for a few minutes. Let\u2019s sneak out the back before someone else hollers,\u201d George said the minute Esther walked through the front doors.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she responded and turned the corner with him.</p><p>\u201cDad, there you are. Aunt Katherine needs your help,\u201d Max said, running into the two of them before they could make an escape.</p><p>George blew out a frustrated breath, ready to explode. It had been over three weeks since he\u2019d last been alone with Esther. He was at his wits end. He\u2019d think the kids were purposely doing it, if it didn\u2019t seem so far-fetched.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you help her,\u201d he snapped.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you? I\u2019m just the messenger. You know she\u2019s been stressed today with Joseph coming home and all,\u201d Max said as he held up his hands in defense.</p><p>George immediately felt bad for snapping at his son. It wasn\u2019t Max\u2019s fault that he was so frustrated. He just wanted a few minutes to ask Esther to marry him. Hopefully this time she\u2019d say yes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Max. I guess with all that\u2019s been going on, I\u2019m just more stressed than usual,\u201d George quickly apologized. He looked longingly at Esther, who gave him a sad smile and left. One way or the other he was going to get her alone soon.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cI almost feel bad. You should see the looks the two of them have been giving each other. I think our plan is working, though,\u201d Max said as the group sat in the backyard, making sure they were away from any prying ears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had to bite my lip several times to keep from cracking up. I have to give it to dad, though. He\u2019s a stubborn man. I figured he would\u2019ve broken long before now. Esther, too. She\u2019s been sending him these looks of deep longing when she thinks no one\u2019s watching,\u201d Trenton added.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019re making the situation worse? What if they decide it\u2019s just too difficult stop seeing each other?\u201d Bree asked with worry.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen, Bree. Once I knew you were the one for me, nothing was going to stand in my way, not even your overprotective, chest-pounding brothers,\u201d Chad reassured her.</p><p>\u201cI have to give it to you, there, Chad. We put you through the wringer and you still stuck around,\u201d Austin said with a laugh as he patted Chad on the shoulder hard enough to push him forward.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re all just a bunch of softies,\u201d Cassie said, looking adoringly at her husband.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t so soft until you women got your clutches in them,\u201d Austin said, puffing his chest out.</p><p>\u201cOh, your time is coming, Austin, believe me,\u201d Lucas piped in with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m smarter than all of you,\u201d he returned.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which, how\u2019s Kinsey doing?\u201d Mark asked with a knowing grin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Dang woman is more trouble than she\u2019s worth,\u201d Austin broodingly replied.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Cassie snapped, instantly standing up for her friend.</p><p>\u201cI... that\u2019s not... oh, crap. Sorry, Cass,\u201d Austin muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let that one pass because it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re all kinds of crazy about her. To ease your mind a bit, I think she\u2019s just as crazy about you,\u201d Cassie said with a reassuring smile.</p><p>Austin looked at her hopefully. He didn\u2019t want everyone to know how much he cared for Kinsey, but he also didn\u2019t want to pass up the opportunity to learn something about her. Cassie was his in.</p><p>\u201cSo, have you spoken to her lately?\u201d he asked in what he hoped was a casual tone.</p><p>\u201cOf course. She\u2019s my best friend. Why don\u2019t you talk to her yourself? She\u2019ll be here in an hour,\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>\u201cI thought she wasn\u2019t going to take the job. Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think it mattered to you. What was it you just said? Oh yeah, that she\u2019s more trouble than she\u2019s worth,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever, Alex. As I recall, you were crawling on your hands and knees for a certain woman in this room not too many years ago,\u201d Austin threw back at him.</p><p>\u201cSmartest thing I ever did,\u201d Alex said, not even the least bit embarrassed about his behavior.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand being around you guys anymore. You\u2019re all way too... I don\u2019t know, mushy, I guess,\u201d Austin said as he got to his feet.</p><p>\u201cWe love you too,\u201d Bree said as she sent him an air kiss.</p><p>\u201cLove ya, sis,\u201d Austin said before shooting her a smile and taking off into the house.</p><p>As soon as Austin was out of earshot, Bree turned to the group with a huge smile.</p><p>\u201cOnce we get George and Esther all situated, I say we have fun with Austin and Kinsey. It\u2019s obvious the two are meant to be together. Plus, I have to say this matchmaking stuff is kind of addicting,\u201d she said with excitement.</p><p>\u201cNow, Bree, we really should leave Austin alone,\u201d Trenton warned.</p><p>\u201cWhy? He was a pain in the arse when I was with Chad. I think he deserves a bit of interference from his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Kinsey\u2019s half in love with him, if not all the way. I\u2019m game,\u201d Cassie spoke up.</p><p>With the approval of her best friend, the group put their heads together to see what they could do to help the relationship along.</p><p>If Joseph would\u2019ve been awake, he would have been so proud of them. They were certainly following in his footsteps.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>Kinsey settled into her room, impressed by the luxurious suite the family had put her in. She loved the soft purples Katherine had used, from the curtains to the bedspread covering the king sized four-poster bed barely taking up any room in the spacious suite.</p><p>She walked over to the sitting area and grabbed the remote, pressing a button, causing a soothing fire to leap to life in the huge built in gas fireplace. She was afraid she could get too comfortable in her room. It was bigger than her entire apartment and certainly had much better furniture.</p><p>A knock on her door brought her out of her thoughts. Her body tensed as she made her way to it, afraid Austin was on the other side. She wasn\u2019t ready to speak to him yet. She didn\u2019t have any clue what she\u2019d say.</p><p>She slowly cracked it open, then let out a relieved breath as Cassie pressed forward with a bag of chocolate in one hand, and coffee in the other. Her best friend knew her well.</p><p>\u201cI brought the important stuff. I figure I\u2019ll get you in a good mood first, then demand you spill your guts,\u201d Cassie said, moving over to the sitting area and setting the items down.</p><p>Kinsey smiled. She knew there was no way her friend would leave her be until she dished her a plateful of the most delicious details, so she may as well get comfortable. Normally, she\u2019d rush to Cassie to tell her everything, but this was different. With Cassie being related to Austin, even through marriage, it made it seem a little awkward to complain about the guy, or to even tell her how mixed up her feelings were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have more important things to do than listen to my sorry tales,\u201d Kinsey attempted to joke.</p><p>The look Cassie gave her, quickly evaporated all humor from the air.</p><p>\u201cKinsey, we\u2019ve known each other too many years for you to even attempt to pull that. We\u2019ve always come to each other, and we always will. Just because I\u2019m married to Austin\u2019s brother doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t complain about him. You\u2019re my best friend, number one in my life. Never have we let a man come between us, and we certainly won\u2019t start now. We can either do this the easy way or the hard way, but one way or the other, you will spill.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey grinned at her best friend. It was so nice to have her. She knew it was a rare thing to have someone in your life you loved so deeply. If Cassie needed her to jump off a cliff with her, then Kinsey would do it. She knew the same held true in Cassie\u2019s mind, so she didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d felt hesitant in talking to her, even for one brief moment.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Cassie,\u201d she said as she walked up and gave her a hug. It would feel better to talk to someone.</p><p>She\u2019d managed to snowball her family, which was a first. Her visit home had been relaxing, and no one had figured out how stressed she was. At least no one had called her on it. She should\u2019ve known she\u2019d never get away with that with the one person who knew her more than even her brothers.</p><p>The two women sat on the couch and Kinsey reached for the bag of chocolate, quickly grabbing a piece and ripping off the wrapper. Setting the chocolate on her tongue, she closed her eyes, savoring the flavor for a moment before speaking. The only true way to eat chocolate. She needed a sugar high to get through the upcoming conversation, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, Cassie.

She picked up the coffee and took a sip to wash it down.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, now speak,\u201d Cassie said as she took her own piece of candy and sat back, making herself comfortable.</p><p>Kinsey smiled at her, knowing Cassie had made a stand. It wasn\u2019t worth it to hold out on her. She\u2019d just drag out the information she wanted, anyway, so Kinsey may as well get it over with.</p><p>\u201cI hope you have the rest of the day,\u201d Kinsey joked, though she wasn\u2019t far off.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a full bag of chocolate, hot coffee, and a comfortable seat. I\u2019m in no hurry.\u201d</p><p>Girding up her courage, Kinsey grabbed a few more pieces of candy before she got comfortable. This was going to take a while. With a blush on her cheeks, she began. This time she didn\u2019t hold anything back, telling Cassie about the wedding night, the hospital, the lack of birth control. She told her all of it.</p><p>An hour passed and she slumped back in her seat, completely drained. She actually felt relief at getting it all out. Now, she could find out if she was as screwed as she thought she was.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me, Cass. Tell me how much I\u2019ve messed up,\u201d Kinsey said as she looked at the stunned expression on Cassie\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDang, Kinsey. You\u2019ve been holding out on me. First of all, I should scold you for not talking to me sooner. Secondly, I think my temperature rose a few degrees, there. Mmm, I may have to go admit Max into a hospital so I can replay that sex scene. Holy Mackerel, Kinsey, that sounds so hot,\u201d Cassie said while dramatically fanning her face.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, you\u2019d focus on that,\u201d Kinsey said with a hint of pink in her cheeks. She had to admit to herself, though, that it had been pretty spectacular.</p><p>\u201cWhat red-blooded woman wouldn\u2019t? Okay, back to the present. Do you know what you\u2019re going to do, yet? Have you thought much about it? A baby, Kinsey. You could be carrying a child right at this very moment,\u201d Cassie said in a somewhat dazed tone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been pushing it from my head. It\u2019s so overwhelming, I don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d Kinsey admitted.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no use stressing over it when you don\u2019t know anything yet. Chances are, you aren\u2019t pregnant. It does happen, but you\u2019re probably worried over nothing. More importantly, though, we need to talk about Austin. Dang, girl, there\u2019s enough steam between the two of you to heat this freaking house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was just a fling. We didn\u2019t even go on any dates. It\u2019s just that, well, he\u2019s about as viral a man as it gets. Whenever I\u2019m around him, my panties practically burst into flames. You can\u2019t build a relationship on that, though. You know that, Cass. You have a perfect husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, don\u2019t you remember how it was between Max and I in the beginning. I had to blackmail him for an interview, and then we got snowed in at a remote cabin in Alaska and literally ripped each other\u2019s clothes off. Talk about steam. I\u2019d never in my life desired someone like I did him. I still get all tingly even talking about it. If you weren\u2019t my best friend, I\u2019d be running out of this room right now and dragging him into the nearest closet. That\u2019s definitely on my \u2018to do list\u2019 now, thanks to you.\u201d</p> <p>Kinsey smiled, loving how open Cassie was. Max adored her, and brought so much to her life.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I got off track. My point is that desire is good. It\u2019s healthy. There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to tear his clothes off, or him wanting you so bad, he\u2019s in a constant state of arousal. That should stroke your ego. There are a lot of relationships built on far less than that. If you can\u2019t stand to be with him once the lights come back on, then you have a problem, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with you. At least that\u2019s not what I\u2019m hearing. Don\u2019t run away because you\u2019re scared. He\u2019s not evil, Kinsey, I promise. That\u2019s my two-cents. Of course, I\u2019m one-hundred-percent on your side, and if you want to castrate him, I\u2019ll help you tie him down.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey laughed. It felt good to let her delight spill from her. There really was nothing like a best friend willing to torture men for you. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do without her.</p><p>\u201cI guess I have a lot to think about, but for now, I\u2019m happier to put it on the back burner and take a few more days to breathe. I\u2019m terrified to take that test, Cass,\u201d Kinsey admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here for you every step of the way. I\u2019ll even pick it up for you,\u201d Cassie offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know. I\u2019m not ready to take it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon. I know they have those early detection pregnancy tests now, but I think you\u2019re better off to wait, get a level head, and then do it. That will give you time to think about what your next step will be. You know, Kinsey, you can always move in with us. I know I\u2019ve offered before and you\u2019ve refused, saying I need my newlywed space and all, but I don\u2019t want you going through this alone. Just think, our kids can grow up together,\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>She\u2019d offered many times for Kinsey to come live with her. It had been great when it was just the two of them rooming in college, but they were adults now, and Cassie was married. Kinsey just couldn\u2019t do it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. Now, get out of here so I can shower and go check on my patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get it. You\u2019re done talking for now. I\u2019ll see you at dinner.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey\u2019s stomach knotted again as she shut the door behind her friend. She\u2019d forgotten about their big dinner that night. They were celebrating Joseph returning home, even though he was still in a coma. Katherine felt him coming home was the first true step of his recovery. This was the dinner Austin had demanded she come to with him. She guessed he\u2019d gotten his way.</p><p>Kinsey locked the door, then walked into the huge bathroom attached to her suite. She turned on the tap and started filling the tub, which was big enough for four people.</p><p>As she sank into the sudsy water, her stress started melting away. She laid her head back and pushed everything negative from her mind. She had a couple hours of peace and she was taking full advantage of it.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>Austin sat at the huge table, his eyes repeatedly looking to the door. Kinsey was late. He listened to the chaos surrounding him, catching a word here and there, but not much else. He didn\u2019t know how any of them were having a conversation with everyone speaking at once.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter, though. He loved the chaos. As he looked around at his siblings and cousins, and all of their spouses and children, he thought they were a pretty lucky group, indeed.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine how lonely life would be if it weren\u2019t for the people in that room. The laughter, tears, and even anger, were a part of his life, and he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. He felt almost complete.</p><p>As Kinsey finally made her entrance, he instantly knew what had been missing. As much as he\u2019d fought it, rebelled against it, he wanted what the rest of his family members had. He wanted a wife and kids.</p><p>He wanted what he couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to go there. She refused to even speak to him, so he couldn\u2019t begin to think about whether they\u2019d be parents or not. It was too soon. Only a week had passed. It felt like a month.</p><p>He\u2019d made sure to leave an empty chair next to him, but as his bad luck would have it, there was also one empty spot next to Emily. Of course, Kinsey spotted it and made a beeline there. She wouldn\u2019t even look up and acknowledge him.</p><p>Food was served and conversation continued to pour in from every direction. Austin didn\u2019t pay much attention. He knew he was acting sullen, but he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough. Everyone quiet!\u201d</p><p>Austin turned in shock to see his father standing at the head of the table. Katherine was looking down at her plate and smiling. Esther looked surprised, but also a bit proud.</p><p>Austin gave his full attention to George. He wanted to know what had gotten him so riled up.</p><p>\u201cYou all know I love you. I\u2019m grateful every day for the big family I\u2019ve been granted. But right now, I could just whip each and every one of you. I\u2019ve been trying and trying to get this beautiful woman alone for five minutes. That\u2019s all. Just five minutes. But for the past month, there\u2019s been emergency after emergency,\u201d George huffed as he glared at everyone.</p><p>Heads turned back and forth between George, and a very red faced Esther.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to do it like this Esther, but I love you. I love you so much my heart swells when I have the slightest thought of you. I can\u2019t pass a floral shop without wanting to go in and buy out the entire store. I loved my late wife, as I know you loved your late husband, and I\u2019d never ask to replace him. But, I\u2019ve been granted a second chance at happiness. A chance to grow old in the arms of the woman I love. I know you wanted to wait. I know you\u2019re worried about the family, and think I\u2019m being rash because of the accident. But, dang it, woman, I love you. I can\u2019t stand the thought of going even one more night without my lips touching yours. I want to go to bed each night with you by my side, and wake up in the morning to the beauty of your face. Please make me the happiest man alive and say you\u2019ll marry me?\u201d George asked as he got down on his knee in front of her.</p><p>Tears were streaming down Esther\u2019s face as she looked at George. You could\u2019ve heard a pin drop, it was so silent, as they waited to hear what she\u2019d say.</p><p>Finally, her eyes lifted and she looked around the table, seemingly embarrassed to be the center of attention.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t...\u201d she trailed off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you asked, George. We\u2019ve been wondering what\u2019s taking you so long,\u201d Katherine said with an approving smile on her face.</p><p>Everyone chorused their approval, smiling in encouragement at Esther. It seemed it was just what she needed because she turned back to George, love radiating from her.</p><p>\u201cYes, George, yes I\u2019d like to marry you. I want all of that and more,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Everyone applauded and Katherine signaled the staff to bring out the Champaign and sparkling cider.</p><p>\u201cToday is truly a day of celebration. My Joseph is home, where he can recover, and both of my friends have found happiness and healing with each other. We are blessed,\u201d Katherine said as she stood up and made a toast.</p><p>Austin looked at his father, beaming with happiness as he took Esther in his arms and kissed her. For a moment he looked no older than his children. The slight wrinkles on his face faded away, the graying of his hair gone. He looked like a new man, ready to conquer the world. Austin was proud of his father for having the courage to not allow the woman he loved to get away.</p><p>He turned, looking for Kinsey, but her seat was empty. He didn\u2019t know what to do. Should he keep pursuing her? Maybe, she really didn\u2019t want anything to do with him. He just didn\u2019t know what was right or wrong.</p><p>He stayed with his family and celebrated long into the night, trying to forget his troubles for at least a few hours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cUgh, I\u2019m so sorry I haven\u2019t been able to make it over sooner, but Jasmine came down with the flu, so you know that meant Isaiah got it, too. It was pure luck I haven\u2019t gotten sick,\u201d Amy said as she quickly came into the sitting room and found a seat.</p><p>\u201cI hate it when the kids are sick. Poor babies. There\u2019s not a whole lot you can do for them other than hold them close and keep giving them fluids,\u201d Emily said with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already getting so big. I can\u2019t believe she just turned eight. Where\u2019s the time going?\u201d Amy asked, a slight panic filling her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI know. Trevor is shooting up like a weed. He\u2019s my little boy. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s going to be like when they hit their teen years, and then, even worse, go off to college,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cI miss them already,\u201d Jessica added, though her youngest was sitting on her lap, contentedly sucking on her thumb.</p><p>\u201cOkay, enough complaining about the future. I\u2019ve waited days for you to continue, Mom. Thank you, everyone, for waiting on me. It would\u2019ve killed me to be the only one not knowing what was happening. I still can\u2019t believe dad was such a pain. And I want to know what happened with Uncle George. How did they make up?\u201d Amy asked.</p><p>Katherine closed her eyes, obviously drifting into her past. They waited.</p><p>\u201cI ran that night.\u201d Katherine began. \u201cI was quickly losing my battle with myself to tell him no. I loved Joseph. I had since the first night I was in his arms. But, you see, there were a lot of misunderstandings, and I truly did believe he\u2019d only been with me because of a bet. I didn\u2019t want to give him my heart when I thought all he wanted was to get me in his bed. But each time I saw him, it was a little bit harder to walk away. He had his own plans in the making, though, and like a headstrong man, he was going about things completely in the wrong way...\u201d</p> <p>Joseph slowly left the elevator, then walked from the building. He couldn\u2019t even think straight. His thoughts were consumed with nothing but Katherine.</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t careful, he\u2019d lose his grandfather\u2019s corporation. He had to find a way to balance his life. He just couldn\u2019t think of how to convince Katherine they should be together, while still keeping his head clear for the race ahead.</p><p>He\u2019d come to prove he could still have her, prove her wrong for walking away from him, but he was the one being proven wrong. He needed her in a way that was neither healthy nor logical. He wondered if it was just the chase. Was he enjoying the game? Or was he truly incomplete without her?</p><p>He drove to his property, his lips turning up as he looked at the calming presence of the water lapping on shore. He\u2019d chosen right. As he sat alone on the sandy shore, he turned and looked at his land, the moon shining down on one particular spot.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he whispered as he rose to his feet and walked up the grassy slope. He reached the spot and turned in all directions. One way gave him a beautiful view of the water and the soothing sound of the lapping sea. The opposite direction showed him the top of the snow covered mountain, standing high above the ground and offering a sense of protection.</p><p>He knew Seattle was growing, and as it grew, more people would spread out further, overtaking the serene little island, but he could make his own paradise right there, build the perfect home, a place fit for a queen.</p> <p>Before he left that night, he had it all planned. All he had to do was begin making phone calls. Within a couple weeks, his palace would start rising. He\u2019d be there to ensure it was perfect.</p><p>He hung his head as he made the decision to stay away from Katherine for a while. He had to save his grandfather\u2019s company. He couldn\u2019t distract her, or let himself be distracted. Soon, though, soon they\u2019d be together.</p><p>With that thought, he walked to his car and got in. He had a long week ahead of him and much to do.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>Katherine was mortified as she walked in her door and quickly shut it. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d done something so foolish as to practically make love to Joseph in a public elevator. She really wanted to find out if there was a camera in there, but if she started asking, then people would wonder why.</p><p>Hopefully, she was just making the situation into something it wasn\u2019t. So what if there was a camera, she tried to reason. It wasn\u2019t like any clothes had come off. He\u2019d kissed her. Yes, it had been beyond hot, but that\u2019s where it had stopped.</p><p>She shuddered to think what would\u2019ve happened had they not been interrupted. She lost her mind too easily when he was around.</p><p>Katherine climbed into the shower, and then quickly into bed. The last week had been exhausting and she instantly fell asleep, for once too tired to even dream.</p> <p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cKatherine, do you have those numbers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, one minute,\u201d she replied, looking through her desk for the requested document.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Katherine? This isn\u2019t like you,\u201d her boss asked as he stepped in her small office.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t like her, Katherine had to admit. Lack of sleep, mixed with stress wasn\u2019t helping her a bit.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen Joseph in a month. Not a phone call, not at the meetings, not at all. She sure heard his name often, though, as he was quickly rising to the top of the board\u2019s favorite candidate. The closer it came time to elect their new CEO, the more times she heard Joseph\u2019s name.</p><p>She desperately wanted the decision over with so she could get on with her life. She knew the minute he was elected, and she had no doubts, he would be, she\u2019d turn in her resignation, no notice given.</p><p>There was no way she could continue working in the building he was in every day. It would eventually turn her into only a shell of the person she once was. As it was, she was only operating on half her brain function from just the stress of knowing he was in town.</p><p>He must\u2019ve gotten tired of chasing her, because he\u2019d taken her last rejection seriously and hadn\u2019t contacted her again after the elevator. She should be thrilled, but instead, she was heartbroken all over again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand. He was giving her what she wanted, but she knew that truly what she wanted, was for him to tell her he was in love with her, always had been and always would be. She hoped he could somehow explain the awful bet, tell her he hadn\u2019t meant it. It was all wishful thinking and obviously not going to happen.</p><p>\u201cKatherine?\u201d</p><p>She snapped out of her reverie and looked at her boss, who was looking at her like she\u2019d lost her mind. Maybe she had. Only time would tell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. I haven\u2019t been able to sleep the last few nights. I should probably go see my doctor soon,\u201d she tried to explain. It sounded weak, even to her own ears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. Are you up for working today?\u201d</p><p>She knew he wasn\u2019t threatening her, but honestly asking if she needed to take the rest of the afternoon off. She had too much to catch up on, though, and couldn\u2019t leave.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be fine, sir. Here\u2019s the paperwork. Is there anything else you need right now?\u201d she asked, hoping the answer was no.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m a bit afraid to bring it up, but Joseph has scheduled a talk with the board. He has some ideas to turn around the downward spiral the stocks have taken. With them dropping points each day, this is important, and all the board members need to be there,\u201d he apologized.</p><p>\u201cI understand, just give me the time and place,\u201d she told him. He didn\u2019t need to know how even the mention of Joseph\u2019s name had her stomach knotting.</p><p>Her boss left, and then she got buried in her work, starting to run behind, making it impossible for her to make it to the meeting on time.</p><p>Katherine called Joseph\u2019s secretary and left him a message, letting him know she\u2019d be an hour late. She had to smile, knowing it would probably irritate him, since he normally waited for no one.</p><p>By the time she got out of the office, she hoped she\u2019d be able to get a taxi. It took a bit longer, but finally one pulled up. She hoped he knew the address, because she didn\u2019t recognize it.</p><p>As she climbed inside the car, she handed him the paper, and he assured her he knew exactly where he was going. As the driver began leaving the city, Katherine became more nervous.</p><p>When they reached the floating bridge, leading to Mercer Island, she was perplexed. She\u2019d never been there before for a business meeting and hoped the driver wasn\u2019t getting her lost.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you looked at the address correctly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am. I double checked. This is the location,\u201d he responded.</p><p>He turned down a long driveway, and finally stopped the car in front of a small, older home. What was Joseph thinking? She was afraid to leave the car.</p><p>\u201cOkay, find a place to park and wait for me. I\u2019m not sure how long this will take, but I\u2019ll pay the waiting fee,\u201d she said before climbing out the door he held open for her.</p><p>He agreed before climbing back into the driver\u2019s side and slumping in his seat. She nervously walked to the open front door.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t an answer. She turned to look back down the road, debating with whether to leave or not and just deal with the consequences.</p><p>Finally, her business ethic won out and she stepped inside. She followed the sound of the soft music coming from the back. Walking through a small kitchen first, then an even smaller living room, led her to an open patio door. She stepped through and found a large table in the lit up back yard. Upon closer inspection, she found food and drinks, so this had to be the place.</p><p>No one was around, though. Had she been so late, they finished without her. If they had, why hadn\u2019t anyone called to tell her she didn\u2019t need to come? She\u2019d left the message saying she\u2019d be late.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you could make it, Katherine.\u201d</p><p>She tensed, her entire body reacting to Joseph\u2019s simple words. If he bottled that sex appeal, women around the world would be buying it up for their men, spraying a little on late at night, especially after a particularly hard day, when they needed to feel something other than exhaustion.</p><p>Pure passion \u2013 that\u2019s what he invoked, from the souls of her feet, all the way to her brain. She had to fight the yearning his presence inspired in her.</p><p>Katherine slowly turned to find him silhouetted in the doorway. His frame was eating up the small space, his stance confident, man-of-the-manor strong.</p><p>He was stunning, whether in a suit and tie, or the casual clothes he was wearing. It didn\u2019t matter. He was Joseph \u2013 the man she\u2019d always love, but never have.</p><p>Her heart pounded, and her voice fled as she felt his powerful presence wash over her. What was she thinking coming to the meeting? She couldn\u2019t possibly keep fighting the burning need she felt for him, not even after being distanced from him for a month.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he said as he stepped forward.</p><p>His motion snapped her out of her trance and she walked slowly around the table. She didn\u2019t want him to realize her distress, but she needed something solid between them. It gave her the illusion of protection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI notified you I would be,\u201d she finally said as he kept the same steady motion forward, only stopping when he reached the table, standing directly across from her. From the rise of his brow, he wasn\u2019t fooled by her seemingly casual movements.</p><p>Needing something to do with her hands, she reached for a full glass on the table, not caring what was in it, just needing to do anything to break the awkward moment.</p><p>She lifted it to her lips, taking a sip of the sweet wine, feeling the warmth slide down her throat. It was surprisingly good so she took a larger swallow. Not normally a drinker, she hoped to gain an ounce of courage from the drink.</p><p>\u201cThis is a strange location for a meeting,\u201d she commented when he said nothing else.</p> <p>\u201cI purchased it a month ago. I thought it was a great location. Private, with no chance of anyone showing up. It\u2019s been very conducive for business this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a positive, I suppose.\u201d She took another sip, then realized she\u2019d drained the cup. She set it down and watched as his large hands removed the bottle sitting on ice, and he refilled her cup. She really shouldn\u2019t pick it back up, but her brain was short-circuiting at the moment.</p><p>Once it was filled to the top, she reached for the glass again, this time sipping slowly on the red sweetness.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of the board?\u201d she asked, not able to handle being alone with him any longer.</p><p>\u201cI have a large tent set up to the north where we met. Come with me,\u201d he said, stepping to the side of the table and holding out his arm.</p> <p>There was no way she was taking it, so instead, she took a step back and followed him. He moved quickly through a side gate, and a small distance before her, she saw a large white tent, something seen at a wedding or other big event. There were lights inside, but she still saw no movement.</p><p>That\u2019s when it hit her.</p><p>They were gone.</p><p>She was there, alone with Joseph, just what she\u2019d been trying desperately to avoid.</p><p>As they reached the entrance, she stopped, knowing she didn\u2019t want to go inside. What was he planning?</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d she asked, furious with herself for the small tremor in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cThe meeting adjourned about a half-hour ago,\u201d he stated as if it were obvious.</p><p>\u201cThen why wasn\u2019t I notified? Was this your plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine, you were the one who was late. I can\u2019t control how short or long the meeting lasts. There were no arguments, so we moved quickly.\u201d</p><p>He spoke as if he were talking to a scared child, as if she was acting ridiculous for questioning his integrity. He\u2019d tricked her into coming to his home, where they were completely alone, not even a neighbor within shouting distance.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve cancelled. There\u2019s no reason for me to be here,\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cI want you here, Katherine. I want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>The way he said the words sent longing to her very soul. How she wished he meant what he said. She knew he wanted her. He made no secret of that fact, but she needed more than that. She needed what he wasn\u2019t capable of giving her.</p><p>Joseph closed the small space between them and grabbed her hand. She dropped the empty glass, but he didn\u2019t give her time to pick it back up. She realized her head was slightly fuzzy from the strong wine. That was another mistake she\u2019d made. She should\u2019ve never drank anything that would weaken her defenses.</p> <p>When around Joseph she had to stay strong, aware, and fully protective of herself. She tried pulling away, but he moved forward as if she wasn\u2019t struggling against him.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he pointed.</p><p>She glared at him before finally turning her head. What she saw made her gasp. What was he building?</p><p>There were endless walls being built out of stone, beautiful gray stone at varying levels of completion. On one end, a large tower was underway, the circle wide as it reached toward the sky. Machinery stood everywhere, ready to begin work again come morning light, but she got the idea.</p><p>He was building a castle, a King Arthur, nights-of-the-round-table, gigantic castle. It was going to be stunning.</p><p>She realized it was fitting for Joseph. If they were to have a king in America, he\u2019d be first in line, so it stood to reason, he\u2019d need a place fit for royalty. She fought her expression from showing her awe. She didn\u2019t want him to know how impressed she was.</p><p>He\u2019d obviously brought her there to romance her with it all, but why, was her number one question. Why would he go so far just to get her in his bed?</p><p>\u201cWhy bring me here, Joseph?\u201d For one moment, she let her guard down. She may end up regretting it.</p><p>\u201cTo show you your future home.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sped up as he spoke softly, his voice drifting over her, the magic of the moment wanting to seduce her. This isn\u2019t real, she told herself. How can any of this be real?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. You\u2019re doing all of this to take me to your bed?\u201d</p><p>Joseph turned her in his arms, his expression confused. He leaned forward and lightly kissed her lips, the gesture so sweet, she felt tears sting her eyes. She was dying inside. This moment, this perfect moment, with the only man she would ever love, would destroy her. Because to walk away from him again would deplete her of any remaining life.</p><p>He\u2019d win his game, she always knew he would, but the price was too high for her to pay. The price was her soul.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He answered as he caressed her lips again.</p><p>She stopped fighting. All she wanted was to give him the rest of her and then face the aftermath later, much later. She moved her arms around his neck, and relinquished all control...</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you gave yourself over to him? I\u2019m so lost right now. Please go on, Aunt Katherine. You can\u2019t possibly make us wait another hour, let alone another day or two,\u201d Bree commanded.</p><p>There were several affirmative responses to her outburst. Everyone was focused on Katherine, who\u2019d stopped speaking. They waited for several minutes, but she still hadn\u2019t continued. Maybe she was lost in thought and would start back up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, everyone. I\u2019m tired. I need to go lay next to my husband, now,\u201d Katherine said before she wearily rose to her feet.</p><p>To the astonishment of everyone in the room, she walked out the door.</p><p>\u201cMy stomach hurts, I\u2019m so nervous. This is ridiculous. It\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know how the story ends, but I can\u2019t figure out how they got it all settled. Did he finally profess his love? Did George come back around? Do any of you know? You have to know, Lucas. You\u2019re the oldest,\u201d Emily said as she turned to her brother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard the story before. I\u2019m just as intrigued as you are,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cI guess there\u2019s nothing else we can do. We can\u2019t force her to talk,\u201d Alex said, earning him a glare from his wife.</p><p>\u201cI better get home, anyway. Even though the kids are feeling better, they still want their mom when they\u2019ve had a bad week,\u201d Amy said with reluctance.</p><p>Lucas got up to help her with her coat. The rest of them slowly gathered their things and walked out the door together.</p><p>Austin stood in the hallway, looking from the stairs to the front door, undecided on what he should do. He knew staying in the house would cause too much temptation for him, though. Reluctantly, he put on his coat and followed the rest of his family.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The days were quickly fading into weeks. Kinsey hadn\u2019t seen Austin at the house since the dinner. She tried telling herself she was glad he was respecting her wishes, giving her what she wanted. She knew she was lying to herself.</p><p>Her hand strayed to her stomach as wonder and fear spread through her, adding to her confusion. She didn\u2019t know anything yet, but she was late. She was just too scared to take the test. If she was pregnant, she had zero answers on what she was going to do next. It was all so overwhelming. She knew it wasn\u2019t healthy to pretend it was a non-matter, but she didn\u2019t care. It helped ease her mind.</p><p>Kinsey stepped outside into the cool evening air. It had rained all day, leaving the grounds smelling fresh, washing away any scent of the city drifting over. She loved Joseph\u2019s home. She found it fascinating that he\u2019d managed to create such a serene setting in one of the most bustling cities in the United States.</p><p>She walked down the path leading to the semi-private beach. She spent most of her off time there. Something about the waves crashing on the shore soothed her.</p><p>She found one of the chairs Joseph had set up, then closed her eyes and let the gentle breeze and soothing sounds hypnotize her into a sense of peace.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, she saw a small boat on the water, slowly moving along the calm surface. She decided she needed to try that sometime. If sitting on the shore was soothing, drifting on the water had to be even better, the motion lulling any and all worries away.</p><p>Soon, her thoughts drifted back to Austin. She wondered where he\u2019d been. Did he already have someone new he was pursuing? One of the reasons she hadn\u2019t wanted to date him, was for the fact that it was common knowledge he never had trouble finding a new woman for his arm. He was rarely spotted with the same date two weekends in a row.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being another scratch in his little black book. She shook her head, refusing to let her thoughts stray. She couldn\u2019t do that, not if she wanted to maintain her sanity.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the Andersons?\u201d</p><p>Kinsey sat straight up as a deep voice rumbled at her. She turned to see a large man staggering down the beach toward her. He was huge, hadn\u2019t shaved in at least a week, and from the smells drifting in her direction, he\u2019d obviously been drinking.</p><p>He was less than twenty feet from her when she realized her danger. She didn\u2019t know this man, but he obviously knew the Anderson family, and from his tone, he wasn\u2019t a fan. His eyes were locked in on her as she slowly got to her feet.</p><p>She felt a shudder of fear drift down her spine. She was probably being ridiculous, but she thought her safest bet was to get away as fast as possible. If he was harmless, no harm done, but if he was out to hurt someone, she didn\u2019t want to be in his path.</p><p>\u201cHey! I asked if you know the Anderson\u2019s, the rich snobs,\u201d he shouted as he took a menacing step closer.</p><p>Okay, her instincts had been right. He wasn\u2019t there to sell Girl Scout cookies \u2013 that was for sure.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what the right answer would be. She didn\u2019t want to tell him, that yes she knew them, was staying in their house, in fact, but she didn\u2019t have a good lie to explain why she was on their property.</p><p>\u201cI, um... yes, I know who they are,\u201d she finally stuttered, her teeth chattering from both fear and the cold.</p><p>She\u2019d only wanted a private moment, like she\u2019d had many times over the last couple weeks. She hadn\u2019t even bothered bringing her phone. She\u2019d gotten too comfortable on the little slice of paradise. Living in the city, she normally wasn\u2019t so stupid as to leave herself so vulnerable.</p><p>He took another step toward her as his gaze shot up the hill to where the top of the mansion clearly showed. She knew that people from the top floor could look down on the beach, but there was no reason anyone would be doing so right now. All they\u2019d see, anyway, was two small figures. The light was fading from the sky and soon they\u2019d only be able to see shadows. If the drunken man grabbed her, and someone did happen to look out the window, they would just assume it was two lovers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d seen a few since her arrival. Young men often liked to impress their dates with a beautiful sunset, followed by some steamy make-out time.</p><p>Kinsey took a couple steps around the chair, trying to place distance between her and the crazy man. His eyes were surprisingly alert for as drunk as he obviously was. They darted after her, watching her every movement.</p><p>She looked up the hill in anticipation of bolting to the top. Hopefully, in his condition, he wouldn\u2019t be able to catch her. She hadn\u2019t exercised nearly as much as she should lately, but she was in pretty good shape.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m running late. It was good talking to you, but I have to go...\u201d</p> <p>She turned toward the house and took a few steps, when her arm was gripped so tight she was sure it would bruise, and her body whipped around to face him. He was inches from her as he glared in her face, his breath was making her stomach roll, causing her to fight the urge to throw up. She didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if she puked down the front of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWait. Why are you in such a hurry? Are you one of them?\u201d he thundered, spit flying from his mouth in his fury.</p><p>Kinsey froze, going from frightened to terrified. This guy wasn\u2019t in control of himself, and she was afraid he was going to snap, if he hadn\u2019t already. She didn\u2019t want to provoke him any further.</p><p>\u201cI just have to go,\u201d she said, trying to sound calm.</p><p>She felt the bile rising in her throat and tried to hold her breath.</p> <p>\u201cI need to see the Andersons. They... they did something bad, really bad. I gotta settle a score. Are you a friend, maybe a wife or girlie friend?\u201d he asked, his words picking up force as he finished.</p><p>He eyeballed her as if seeing how much she was worth, what use she could be to him. She decided to be somewhat honest. Then maybe he\u2019d let her go.</p><p>\u201cI just work for them. I\u2019m not involved or anything. I only work for them temporarily. I barely just started,\u201d she explained quietly.</p><p>Her words seemed to send him into a whole other realm of anger, which she couldn\u2019t understand. Why would he be mad that she worked for them?</p><p>\u201cDid you take my job? Are you my replacement!\u201d he screamed.</p><p>The fury on his blotched face left her speechless. He was going to hurt her, hurt her badly if she didn\u2019t manage to get away.</p> <p>Kinsey tugged on her arm as she moved her foot backward, pulling for all she was worth. His fingers just tightened more, trapping her. He was too strong. The situation began to feel hopeless.</p><p>He took a staggering step toward the water, dragging her feet in the sand. Her body shook with real fear at the thought of him throwing her in, or worse yet, holding her under.</p><p>\u201cNo, no I didn\u2019t take your job. I\u2019m a nurse, that\u2019s all, a nurse,\u201d she said as she finally found her voice.</p><p>\u201cA nurse? Is one of \u2018em sick?\u201d he asked, an evil sort of glee filling his eyes at the thought.</p><p>\u201cYes. Joseph\u2019s very sick,\u201d she replied. All she needed was for him to be distracted for a couple seconds, just long enough for her to get free. She\u2019d run for all she was worth.</p><p>\u201cGood, good, that\u2019s good,\u201d he kept repeating.</p><p>Kinsey continued to tug on her arm, but it was useless. Her fingers were starting to tingle from the lack of blood circulating to her hand. At least he\u2019d been distracted enough to stop moving. She eyed the water, only a short distance away. If he lowered her in it, she... She couldn\u2019t even begin to have those thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we walk up to the house together? You can talk to whoever has upset you,\u201d she tried to reason.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you want to do that for me?\u201d he asked, looking at her suspiciously. He was so drunk, he couldn\u2019t properly reason.</p><p>\u201cBecause you look like you need to talk. It sounds like whatever they did, really upset you.\u201d \u201cYeah, yeah they did me wrong. I was just trying to make some extra money, that\u2019s all. They have themselves tons of money. Way more than one family needs or deserves. Why\u2019d they have to fire me over a few lousy bucks! It didn\u2019t hurt them any,\u201d he slurred, his words jumbled and hard to understand.</p><p>\u201cYes, too much money. Let\u2019s fix this,\u201d she urged.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed. As he released her, she felt a shooting pain in her arm, where the blood rushed back through. It hurt almost worse than his grip had. She couldn\u2019t focus on that, though. She had to get away from him before he changed his mind. She had to get to the house and warn the family he was there.</p><p>Kinsey took off running, not taking even a second to turn around and check on him. She knew that giving him any advantage could cost her, her life.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d he shouted, his voice sounding too close. Her vision blurred as tears welled up in her eyes, then spilled over. How was he moving so fast? He could barely even walk, but he was right behind her.</p><p>Kinsey screamed out in pain as his fingers gripped the back of her hair, quickly halting her forward motion as her neck snapped backward.</p><p>\u201cYou whore!\u201d he shouted, spinning her around. His eyes were wide, bulging from their sockets, his mouth opening and closing. If he\u2019d been angry before, it was nothing to what he was now.</p><p>He raised his arm and then she only saw stars, moments before she blacked out. Her last thought was that she\u2019d thought seeing stars was only an expression.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>Austin stepped into the yard and looked around. His aunt had said Kinsey had been gone an hour. Katherine was worried because Kinsey said she\u2019d only be thirty minutes.</p><p>He picked up his pace as he looked around the yard. The light was quickly fading and he wanted to spot her before his visibility was gone.</p><p>Katherine said Kinsey often walked down to the beach. That was his first place to look. He was taking the familiar path down when he heard something.</p><p>He stopped for a moment and strained his ears. It sounded like a man\u2019s voice, but he couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying. He picked up his pace, wondering who\u2019d be out there. It was private property and no one was supposed to be on this section of beach except them.</p><p>As he got closer, he heard the male voice shout for someone to stop, then he heard a female scream. Terror seized him as he realized Kinsey was in trouble.</p><p>He started sprinting down the path, hoping he wasn\u2019t too late. As he rounded the corner, he saw a large man grab the back of Kinsey\u2019s hair and whip her around, then slam his hand into her face.</p><p>Austin saw red. He charged forward as Kinsey fell to the ground and the man lifted his leg as if he were going to kick her. What kind of beast would do that to a woman?</p><p>Austin dived into the guy\u2019s chest a second before his foot connected, sending the two of them flying several feet in the air before they landed on the ground with a hard thud.</p><p>Austin didn\u2019t waste any time. He slammed his fist into the guy\u2019s jaw, then his cheek. The man went still beneath him. It was only then that Austin realized it was his fired employee, Jack. He jumped off him, grabbing his phone and calling for an ambulance as he raced back to Kinsey.</p><p>He felt her pulse, breathing a sigh of relief that it was beating strong. She started to stir as he rubbed his hands along her arms and legs, checking for any other wounds.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d she cried when his fingers brushed over her upper arm. He moved her shirt out of the way, then swore when he saw the angry red flesh. He wanted to go over and pound on Jack a few more times. The idiot deserved it.</p><p>Instead, he cradled Kinsey\u2019s head on his lap while he placed a quick call to the house and told his cousin to bring a blanket.</p><p>\u201cKinsey, are you okay? Can you talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head hurts,\u201d she mumbled as her eyes opened a slit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kinsey. I\u2019m so sorry. What did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was really mad at your family. He thought maybe I was a part of it. I don\u2019t know. He was very drunk,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kinsey. We\u2019ll talk later. Just close your eyes and rest. The ambulance is on the way,\u201d he reassured her.</p><p>For the first time ever, she did as he asked and closed her eyes. If he wasn\u2019t so panicked, he may have even smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell is going on?\u201d Lucas asked as he came skidding to a stop in front of them. He quickly placed the blanket around Kinsey before looking over at Jack.</p><p>\u201cAn ex - employee, who wasn\u2019t happy about being fired, I don\u2019t know much right now. Kinsey said he was drunk and looking for a fight. I think she just happened to be in his way,\u201d Austin explained.</p><p>\u201cYou knock him out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Austin said, feeling the rage boil up again. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever get the image of her falling to the ground out of his head. Her terrified scream would surely haunt him for years to come.</p><p>\u201cGood. You carry her up to the house. I\u2019ll stay with this piece of crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lucas.\u201d Austin stood, easily lifting Kinsey into his arms. He walked up the hill to the gravel service road, then followed it toward the house. He could hear the sirens in the distance, so he picked up his pace.</p><p>He reached the back door at the same time they pulled into the driveway. He quickly went through the house and met them out front. The paramedics took over, getting her on the gurney and taking her vitals. He stood back watching, overwhelmed with helplessness.</p><p>\u201cAre you allergic to anything, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cMy head hurts. My arm does, too, but my head feels like it\u2019s going to burst, the pain is so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can give you a shot in just a moment. I need to ask a couple more questions first,\u201d he reassured her.</p><p>When the police arrived, Austin reluctantly left Kinsey in the care of the paramedics and approached the deputy to explain where Jack was knocked out. After giving a brief statement, he went back to Kinsey to find her sleeping on the gurney as they loaded her in the ambulance.</p><p>\u201cYou can either ride with us or follow, but she won\u2019t know the difference. She\u2019ll be out for a few hours,\u201d the man said. Austin didn\u2019t want to be separated from her, but knew he\u2019d need his car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow, thanks,\u201d he replied, then watched as they shut the door.</p><p>Austin didn\u2019t waste any time in jumping in his car and catching up to the emergency vehicle. He didn\u2019t want her out of his sight, not until he was assured she was okay. Especially, since it was his fault she was in that condition.</p><p>He\u2019d never had an employee attack before. Yes, there were threats on his life, on all their lives, but never before had a disgruntled employee actually carried out one of those threats. He\u2019d learned a valuable lesson that night, and it wasn\u2019t fair that Kinsey had to pay the price.</p><p>Anger still coursed through his veins. He tried to calm himself down as he followed behind the flashing lights, their red and blue pattern somehow soothing, at least giving him something else to focus on.</p><p>Austin sat in the waiting room for hours. Not what seemed like hours, but literally hours. He was getting ready to haul a doctor against a wall if he didn\u2019t hear anything soon. He wasn\u2019t a patient man on a normal day, and his day so far had been anything but normal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMr. Anderson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.

From my understanding, her attacker hit her in the face. She has a slight crack in her cheekbone, but it will heal. Until then, she\u2019s going to have swelling and it\u2019s bruised pretty deep. She\u2019s going to be sore for a few days. At this time we don\u2019t see any brain damage or anything else wrong.\u201d</p><p>Austin wanted to punch something, as rage boiled. He knew that piece of crap was somewhere in the hospital and he wanted nothing more than to hunt him down and do some major damage.</p><p>\u201cMs. Shelton has agreed to press charges, which is good. We have the cops with her attacker now. He\u2019ll go from here to jail. I\u2019m not supposed to say this, but you broke his jaw,\u201d the doctor said. He didn\u2019t look heartbroken over it.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Austin told him, feeling a bit better that Jack wasn\u2019t getting off pain free.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s being moved to a room for the night. We\u2019d like to keep an eye on her in case there was something we initially missed.\u201d</p><p>With that, the doctor left and Austin walked to the front desk, receiving directions to her room. He walked the long hallway, then hesitated outside her door. He didn\u2019t know what kind of reaction he was going to get from her. He knew he couldn\u2019t go in there showing the anger he was feeling. Of course, it wasn\u2019t projected at her, but she still didn\u2019t need to see it.</p><p>He stepped inside to find her sitting up in bed. Her head turned when he came through the doorway, and their eyes locked together. Fury once again overwhelmed him at the bruising on her arm and the deep purple overtaking the left side of her face.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he lamely said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Austin,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kinsey. I should\u2019ve been there sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you got there when you did. I have a feeling I\u2019d be a whole lot worse off, otherwise,\u201d she said as a tremble racked her body. He wanted to take her pain away, to hold her.</p><p>He walked to her bed and sat down with her watching him warily.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he touched you,\u201d Austin growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Austin. Really, I am. My face and arm are a bit sore, but I\u2019m fine,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw him hit you, I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m just glad you happened to be around,\u201d she interrupted. He should be grateful she was admitting she was happy to see him, even if it had taken her getting attacked first.</p><p>His hand came up and gently caressed the uninjured side of her face. Her eyes grew wider as she took in a deep breath and watched him.</p> <p>\u201cKinsey,\u201d he practically begged her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just... I need...\u201d</p><p>Austin stopped trying to vocalize how he was feeling and he leaned in and gently took her lips with his. She didn\u2019t try to stop him. He didn\u2019t want to hurt her any further, but he needed to taste her lips, needed to reassure himself she was really okay, that she was there with him. If something worse would\u2019ve happened, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. He couldn\u2019t let himself even think about it.</p><p>He leaned closer, his hand moving to stroke the back of her neck, his touch on her lips careful as he slid his tongue along her bottom lip. It wasn\u2019t about passion or fulfillment, it was about reassuring himself she was real, she was there, she was his.</p><p>He felt heat rush through him, a warmth that seemed to focus on his heart, and enlarge it ten times its normal size.</p><p>Finally, he pulled back and slowly opened his eyes to look at her face. She opened her own eyes as if she were in a trance, gazing at him with such wonder and awe in her expression, that if he hadn\u2019t been sitting already, her look would\u2019ve knocked him to his knees.</p><p>\u201cLet me stay here with you, Kinsey. Let me hold you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him as the fog started to clear. Her eyes filled with tears - pain, need, confusion all mixed in her expression. He knew the answer before she uttered the word. He was tempted to kiss her again, to prevent her from saying it.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why do we have to make this complicated? It\u2019s just one night,\u201d he asked. He\u2019d never before begged a woman for anything, but she was causing all kinds of firsts for him, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just too... complicated. One night won\u2019t fix or change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want each other, Kinsey. We care about each other. It doesn\u2019t need to be more complicated than that,\u201d he said. He felt a glimmer of hope at the hesitation in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cFor you, it\u2019s easy, Austin. You see what you want and you go for it, no questions asked. I\u2019m not that way. I\u2019m honestly not that girl from the wedding. I don\u2019t know why I did what I did that night. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve continued to lose control with you since, but that\u2019s not me. This is me, right here, right now. I\u2019m not exciting and glamorous. I\u2019m not a jump in the nearest closet kind of girl. As soon as the chase is over, you\u2019ll lose interest. The girl you keep chasing, the fling you\u2019re wanting isn\u2019t real,\u201d she said, her voice hoarse from what he was sure was unshed tears.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I think you\u2019re lying. I think you\u2019re lying to yourself and to me. You say none of this has been real?\u201d he questioned.</p><p>While looking into her eyes, he placed his hand over her stomach, causing her to gasp. Good. He wanted to shake her up, not much, just a little.</p><p>\u201cThis is as real as it gets. You might be carrying my child, Kinsey. The sex didn\u2019t happen in a dream, or my imagination. The explosion between us, every time we\u2019re within five miles of each other, isn\u2019t fake. You can try and build your walls, that's fine, but don\u2019t you dare insult me. Don\u2019t you dare tell me it\u2019s all been nothing but a dream.\u201d</p><p>He knew he was on the edge of a cliff, barely holding on. He also knew he shouldn\u2019t take out his anger on her, but he was mad, mad at just about everything right then.</p><p>He leaned back as he ran his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Austin looked up as she whispered the word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired, so tired of everything. I don\u2019t want to fight any more tonight. I don\u2019t want to think. I just want you to hold me,\u201d she whispered, fear present in her eyes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else, just took off his jacket and climbed in next to her. As he pulled her into his arms, he felt a weight lift from his shoulders.</p><p>He woke up in the early dawn hours and slipped from the room. They both needed to figure out what they wanted, but he wasn\u2019t going to push her anymore. He\u2019d made his intentions clear; now the ball was in her court.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>When Kinsey woke in the morning, Austin was gone, leaving her heart aching, though she tried telling herself it was for the best. Still, she couldn\u2019t stop the tears from falling at the sudden loneliness consuming her.</p><p>While she was trying to eat her breakfast a couple hours later, a knock sounded on her door, making her eagerly look up.</p><p>Instead of Austin, several people silently stepped inside the room with big grins on their faces, all carrying huge bouquets of flowers and balloons. By the time they were finished, her room looked like a florist shop.</p><p>One of the people handed her a card, then they left as quickly as they\u2019d come. With shaking fingers, she opened the envelope and pulled out the note.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry you were hurt. Get better soon.</p><p>Austin</p><p>That was it? She flipped the card around, looking to see if anything else was on the other side. Nothing.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to think. He was sending her massive amounts of flowers, but he was gone, and his note was so impersonal. Was he saying goodbye?</p><p>Kinsey lay back down and cried herself to sleep, still no closer to finding any answers.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cYou should still be resting, not coming back to work so soon,\u201d Katherine scolded Kinsey two days later when she walked in the room to check on Joseph.</p><p>\u201cI know this sounds silly, so please bear with me, but I\u2019ve missed him. I\u2019ve grown quite attached to Joseph, and being away the last couple of days, I felt... I don\u2019t know... just - off,\u201d Kinsey said with a shrug.</p><p>She checked his charts, reassuring herself the temp nurse had done her job well, and then she sat down beside Katherine.</p><p>\u201cThat I can understand,\u201d Katherine said, immediately softening. \u201cJoseph has a way of casting a spell on everyone around him, even when he\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Kinsey had missed being there. She hadn\u2019t wanted to leave Joseph in the care of anyone else. She\u2019d been with him from the beginning, and she\u2019d see it through to the end. She just hoped and prayed the end was him waking up.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and get comfortable. The rest of the family will be here any minute. They\u2019re anxiously awaiting the conclusion of our story,\u201d Katherine offered.</p><p>Kinsey felt like an intruder during the story, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to leave. She wanted to know what made a couple stay together for so many years. She was captivated by Katherine\u2019s voice as she spoke of her love.</p><p>Soon, the room crowded with Joseph\u2019s children, nieces and nephews, even some of the grandchildren and great nieces and nephews. The large space felt as if it quickly shrank, with the amount of people in it.</p><p>Kinsey waited to see Austin walk in, but he was absent. She refused to allow herself to watch the door, instead focusing on Katherine as she got comfortable in the chair next to her husband\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing today, Mom?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing good. Look at his cheeks. Being home is bringing the color back into them. I know he\u2019s on his way back,\u201d she replied with confidence.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come back because we need him to,\u201d Emily said with a hopeful smile.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember where I left off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d tricked you into coming to his place. He was showing you the castle he was building just for you,\u201d Bree said with a sigh. \u201cSo romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I gave up fighting him. I knew when I left that night, I\u2019d never be the same again, but I didn\u2019t care anymore. One minute with him was better than none. I was so tired of hurting, aching. But I knew that hurting was nothing compared to how I was going to feel once he was done with me. But still, I couldn\u2019t refuse him anymore...\u201d</p><p>Joseph lifted his head, his darkened eyes looking into her own frightened ones. The power he wielded over her was too great. She also knew she was powerless to stop it.</p><p>\u201cI do want you in my bed, but that\u2019s not all. This is for you. Since meeting you, everything I do is about you, Katherine. I can\u2019t live without you,\u201d he murmured. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Katherine was confused as she looked at him. He\u2019d won. She was giving herself over to him, so why was he still talking? She couldn\u2019t seem to grasp his words.</p><p>Her heart nearly burst when he dropped to his knee\u2019s on the gently blowing grass. His eyes filled as he looked in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot wrong where you\u2019re concerned, Katherine. Before you, there\u2019s never been a woman I wanted to be with night and day. Never before have I thought of one person so often, I can\u2019t think of anyone or anything else. Yes, I want you in my bed, and by my side, but not for a cheap affair. I\u2019d never dishonor you that way. I want you as my equal partner. I want to give you everything your heart desires. I want to watch your stomach grow round with my children. I want to hold you when we\u2019re seventy-five and do nothing more than watch a sunset together off the balcony of our home that I\u2019m building for you. Please make me complete, Katherine. Please be my wife,\u201d he said as a tear fell.</p><p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out an exquisite diamond ring, his fingers trembling slightly as he knelt before her, baring his soul.</p> <p>Katherine dropped down next to him, her legs no longer able to support her, her arms needing to be around him.</p><p>She reached up and slowly wiped the tear from his cheek, awed that such a strong man was willing to make himself so vulnerable in front of her. How wrong she\u2019d been. How many years she\u2019d wasted. How many pointless tears she\u2019d cried. She leaned forward and kissed him. A kiss filled with all the love she had for her larger than life man.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to say any more than that simple word. She\u2019d decided to give him anything he wanted, and she was so grateful he wanted it all.</p><p>Joseph\u2019s smile lit up his face. He slipped the ring on her finger, a perfect fit, and then his arms wrapped around her, pulling her tightly against him. Neither of them said anything as she rested her head against his chest.</p> <p>After minutes, or maybe hours, passed, he finally pulled back. He kissed her once more, then stood, pulling her up next to him as he wrapped his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cCome. Let me show you your palace.\u201d</p><p>Joseph took her hand and led her to the house. He stepped through an unfinished doorway and walked inside as she looked around in wonder.</p><p>\u201cI can see it all, Katherine. I can see the finished house. It will be beautiful. I can already picture our children running through these halls,\u201d he said with excitement. His enthusiasm quickly drawing her in.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Joseph,\u201d she whispered in awe.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s you I need to thank. I\u2019ve been lost for a long time, but you\u2019ve changed me. You made me realize I didn\u2019t need to settle. I can have it all. Because of you, George and I spoke, really spoke for the first time in years. I knew I couldn\u2019t waste any more time on misunderstandings. I knew I couldn\u2019t hold onto the past. He felt the same way. It\u2019s all because of you. You wouldn\u2019t allow me to be half a man anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Joseph, I don\u2019t understand how I did it, but I\u2019m so glad,\u201d she said, fresh tears springing to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe loves you almost as much as I do,\u201d he said with a chuckle. You did it by refusing to accept anything less than what you deserve. You did it by being yourself.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted your love. I\u2019m so sorry I fought so hard- wasted all this time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t waste even a moment more. I\u2019ll give you any wedding you want, but please marry me quickly. I don\u2019t want to spend even one more night without you,\u201d he begged.</p><p>\u201cYes, Joseph, yes. I don\u2019t need anything fancy. I just need you,\u201d she said, meaning her words.</p><p>\u201cMy Katherine, you\u2019d better get used to fancy, because I need to spoil you. You\u2019re my queen.\u201d</p><p>Joseph pulled her tightly against him in the unfinished space of their home and he spent the rest of the night with her safely cradled in his arms as he whispered his love in her ear.</p><p>\u201cJoseph and I were both such fools for a very long time. Now, you should realize why we\u2019ve wanted you to find your own true loves,\u201d George said as Katherine finished speaking.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d Jessica said, her voice filled with awe.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much you two went through,\u201d Amy said as she dabbed her eye and sniffled.</p><p>\u201cYou had a huge wedding, though. I\u2019ve poured over those pictures. Your dress is right out of a Cinderella story,\u201d Emily said with confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou all know Joseph. He may have said he wanted a quick wedding, and believe me, he did, but that man wouldn\u2019t settle for anything less than the best. We married in two weeks\u2019 time, and it was a fairy tale, with the perfect dress, location, and decorations. It was the most romantic day of my life. Looking back, I\u2019m truly glad he made it special. Back then, I only wanted him, and everything else was just a bonus. The best part of the day was the kiss he gave me after they pronounced us man and wife. It was in that moment that I knew we\u2019d be together forever. He\u2019s never stopped telling me how much he loves me,\u201d Katherine said as she wiped away another tear.</p><p>\u201cAnd I never will,\u201d Joseph whispered.</p><p>The room went silent as all eyes turned to the bed where Joseph lay, his eyes cracked open, gazing at his wife.</p><p>\u201cJoseph?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Katherine, today, tomorrow and always.\u201d His voice was hoarse, but his words were clear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d she cried, joy and relief evident in her expression.</p><p>Kinsey jumped up, immediately calling for the doctor, then getting to work, checking his vitals, moving around the bed, looking in his eyes.</p><p>Joseph batted her away as he weakly lifted his hand to press his fingers against Katherine\u2019s face. She lay in his arms, smiling as gentle sobs racked her body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much, Joseph. Please, please don\u2019t ever leave me again. I need you,\u201d she begged.</p><p>Such and intimate moment, Kinsey thought as she dreamily sighed and stepped back. Their love so obvious, it brightened the room. Everyone was awed as they watched the two of them reunite, their love stronger than ever before.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>The rest of the day was a flurry of activity as the doctor rushed over and did a complete work-up on Joseph. He\u2019d said from the beginning he could wake anytime, but he looked surprised to see him not only awake, but so alert.</p><p>Joseph had trouble speaking, his throat sore from non-use, but as the day wore on, he was picking up strength. Because of the physical therapists, who\u2019d been working his muscles daily, he wouldn\u2019t be wheelchair bound when he climbed from the bed.</p><p>The doctor warned him not to exert himself too much, though. It would take a while before he was climbing up and down stairs and running around. Joseph didn\u2019t care. He only cared that he was awake. He and Katherine couldn\u2019t take their eyes or hands off each other.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, brother. I\u2019m so happy for you,\u201d Joseph said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Joseph. We\u2019ve been waiting for you to wake up. We\u2019d like to have a small ceremony here, where we met for the first time,\u201d George told him.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s perfect. Now, are you sure about the small ceremony...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoseph Anderson, don\u2019t you try and railroad me like you do your kids. I\u2019m an old man, who\u2019s lived a full life. I want a simple ceremony with my beautiful bride. She wants the same,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cCan you get me drink?\u201d Joseph asked in a weak voice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that sick card will work on me either, Joseph. I\u2019m not changing my mind. A small ceremony, do you hear me?\u201d George said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cFine, I get it,\u201d Joseph grumbled, his voice stronger.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d George said, chuckling.</p><p>Once Esther joined them, the three planned a simple ceremony that had Joseph grumbling here and there, but he didn\u2019t fight them too much.</p><p>George was thrilled that in two weeks, Esther would be his wife. He needed nothing more than that.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Kinsey gazed at the pregnancy test, looking back and forth from it to the box it had come in, then re-reading the instructions. She looked at the two other tests next to it, as well. All of them with the same answer. Her eyes spilled over as the results were irrefutable in front of her.</p><p>She needed Cassie.</p><p>Cassie would tell her it was okay. Tell her she wasn\u2019t alone. She\u2019d be there for her no matter what. Kinsey didn\u2019t know what she wanted any more. She was certainly surprised by her reaction.</p><p>She laid her head on the table and cried, then laughed, then cried some more. Maybe she was losing her mind. It sure felt like it.</p><p>After a half hour she picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t need an explanation. The emotion in Kinsey\u2019s voice was all it took for her to drop whatever she was doing and agree to meet. Kinsey named a park about halfway between them, then put on her coat and walked out the door. She wiped her tears as she climbed behind the wheel of her car and went on autopilot as she drove across town.</p><p>She arrived first and sat down on a bench, the tests once again clutched in her hand.</p><p>Cassie joined her a few minutes later, sitting down without saying a word. Kinsey handed her the three tests, and Cassie looked at them, then at Kinsey\u2019s face with worried eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling? Are we happy? Upset? Relieved? What should I be doing right now, because I can\u2019t tell,\u201d Cassie finally said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m... confused. I thought... I thought this is what I wanted, but as I took test after test, I found myself... sad,\u201d Kinsey said as a few tears fell.</p><p>\u201cI understand, Kinsey. You\u2019ve thought for a couple months that a baby could be growing inside you. Your child. Now that you know you\u2019re not pregnant, it\u2019s like losing that child you\u2019ve come to expect. It\u2019s devastating,\u201d Cassie reassured her.</p><p>\u201cBut... I\u2019m not married. I have no reason to be upset. I should be jumping up and down with joy. I know after I have time to think about it, I\u2019ll realize that. I just... I don\u2019t even know,\u201d Kinsey said with confusion.</p><p>\u201cEverything happens for a reason. Maybe this happened so you\u2019d know how you really feel. Maybe you don\u2019t want to be as independent as you\u2019ve been telling yourself. Have you thought about the fact that it wasn\u2019t just your baby you were learning to care about \u2013 but also Austin\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no baby, Cass,\u201d Kinsey said, as if she needed to say it again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Austin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We had a small fight the night of my attack, then he stayed the night with me. But in the morning he was gone. He walked away and hasn\u2019t been back,\u201d Kinsey said in a choked sob, pain seeping inside her. She should call, but she had too much pride. She figured she\u2019d told him no one too many times, and he\u2019d decided to listen.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, you\u2019re in love with him, aren\u2019t you,\u201d Cassie gasped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kinsey admitted. There was no point in lying to her best friend.</p><p>\u201cThen you need to go to him. Let him help you through this, hold you until the tears dry. Don\u2019t be so afraid of being hurt that you actually hurt yourself more,\u201d she said as she took Kinsey\u2019s hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cIt was a game, Cass. That\u2019s all. I ran away, probably the first girl to ever do so to him. Then he chased me. We had amazing, oh-my-gosh, sex, he restored his manhood, and now he\u2019s gone,\u201d Kinsey said, feeling like a fool.</p><p>\u201cI think you may be underestimating him. Give him a chance. If you do, I think you could find more happiness than you ever imagined before. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from listening to Joseph and Katherine\u2019s love story, it\u2019s that time is too precious to waste.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Cass. I just need to think. My emotions are all over the place right now, and I don\u2019t want to do anything I\u2019m going to regret later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the two of you just need a little helpful nudging,\u201d Cass threatened.</p><p>\u201cCassie, don\u2019t you dare interfere, do you hear me? I swear on our pinkie swear oath in grade school, that I\u2019ll hunt you down,\u201d Kinsey said, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>\u201cKinsey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise me right now, Cass,\u201d Kinsey demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI just want you to be happy. You know I love you,\u201d Cassie hedged.</p><p>\u201cCassandra, you better promise me,\u201d Kinsey threatened.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Cassie snapped, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Kinsey was on her way back home that she realized Cassie hadn\u2019t promised. Her stomach turned over with nerves. Cass wouldn\u2019t do anything. It was always friendship first, men second. Her day had been exhausting and she just couldn\u2019t think about it any longer, so she pushed it from her mind.</p><p>She pulled into her apartment complex and walked to her unit. She shut the door and looked around, feeling more alone than she ever had before.</p><p>Joseph was better now and didn\u2019t need a nurse at home. As she\u2019d left the mansion, she\u2019d had to fight back tears, knowing she\u2019d miss the bustle always going on in the large place. She\u2019d grown attached being there, loving her time of taking care of him. She was very happy he was better, though.</p> <p>She looked at her calendar and realized it was George\u2019s wedding night with Esther. Of course she\u2019d been invited, but she couldn\u2019t go, not when she was crying every ten minutes. Seeing Austin and not being able to talk to him would be too much.</p><p>Kinsey\u2019s eyes grew heavy and exhaustion overtook her while she climbed into her bed and fell asleep. She had time to figure it out later.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe dad\u2019s getting married today. It\u2019s so weird,\u201d Trenton exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. I\u2019m happy for him, really happy, but it seems so strange. Especially the fact that he\u2019s acting like a teenager,\u201d Max said.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly romantic. Esther\u2019s been blushing all morning,\u201d Bree added.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s great. I haven\u2019t seen dad this happy in a long time. Moving back here was a really good thing. All of you getting married, now dad, too. What the heck? I guess we\u2019re grown up, now\u201d Austin said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, we. I don\u2019t see a ring on your finger,\u201d Trenton said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d</p><p>Austin hadn\u2019t seen Kinsey in weeks, but couldn\u2019t get her off his mind. When he hadn\u2019t heard anything from her by last week, he figured he had his answer on whether or not she was pregnant. He knew if she were, she\u2019d call him, she\u2019d promised. What really surprised him was the disappointment hanging heavily over him like a dark rain cloud getting ready to pour.</p><p>How could he possibly feel as if he\u2019d lost something that he never had to begin with? It didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>\u201cAustin Anderson, who the heck do you think you are? Seriously? Are you God\u2019s gift to women, Mr. love em and leave em? Huh! What do you have to say for yourself?\u201d Cassie thundered as she stomped into the room, fire burning in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d he asked, taking a step back. His sister-in-law was frightening in a temper. He had new respect for his brother.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, what\u2019s this about?\u201d Max asked as he stepped toward her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you sweetie me, Max,\u201d she snapped, stopping him in his tracks. Then she turned back to Austin. \u201cWhat did I do? Really? Kinsey isn\u2019t some cheap two-dollar-hooker. She\u2019s a lady. She\u2019s beautiful, compassionate, fun and freaking fantastic. You were lucky enough to have her fall in love with you, and you think you can just throw that away?\u201d Cassie snapped, stepping up to him, her hands on her hips as her toe tapped.</p><p>Austin was speechless as the room went silent. He\u2019d never seen Cassie throw a fit before and it was impressive, but her words were what muted him.</p><p>Kinsey loved him.</p><p>Love.</p><p>His mind whirled as he thought about the girl he couldn\u2019t forget no matter how hard he tried. Her smile, laugh, temper, passion. All of it was intoxicating. He wanted to be with. Not for just a night, or even a week, but he really wanted to be with her. The have and to hold kind of being together. He wanted to see her walk down the aisle to him, where they said vows and then kissed in front of their friends and family. He wanted to claim her as his forever. He couldn\u2019t let her go... he was in love with her.</p><p>\u201cI love her,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell, hallelujah, he finally admits it,\u201d Trenton said with a laugh as he thumped him hard on the back.</p><p>He looked up in surprise, forgetting about his family standing there. Cassie was looking at him with suspicion in her eyes, but at least the raging anger was gone. His face turned up in a huge smile as he reached out and lifted Cassie off the ground, spinning her in a circle.</p><p>\u201cI love her. I really do!\u201d he shouted, then gave Cassie a smacking kiss on the forehead before setting her down. \u201cThank you, Cassie. I have to see her.\u201d He turned to leave when Max grabbed his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHold up, Romeo,\u201d he said, but the smile on his face was proud.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think the best idea is to ambush her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think she\u2019s going to let you in to her apartment? She thinks you just want sex, that\u2019s all, nothing but steamy, erotic sex,\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>Austin shifted uncomfortably as all eyes focused on him. He couldn\u2019t even look his sister-in-law in the face. What had Kinsey told her?</p><p>\u201cOh, get over yourself. All women talk, so yes, I do know...a lot,\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>Austin lost the battle with his embarrassment and felt his cheeks grow warm. He didn\u2019t understand women. He\u2019d never, in a million years, want to know about any of his siblings\u2019 sex lives. That would scar him forever.</p><p>\u201cYou need a plan of action. First hurdle. How are you going to get her to let you in?\u201d Trenton asked as if he spoke from experience.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll knock,\u201d Austin said with a shrug. His answer made them laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou poor, clueless man. It\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re here for you,\u201d Bree said as she smiled at him to take any sting from her words. He was beginning to feel tag teamed.</p><p>\u201cYou really do love her?\u201d Cassie asked as she looked him deep in the eyes.</p><p>He felt no panic at her question, zero hesitation.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, Cass. I have since the day she took my breath away at your wedding. I just couldn\u2019t admit it. I guess I\u2019m not much different than these idiots,\u201d he said, looking around at the men in the room, who at least had the decency to shift uncomfortably as his words hit close to home.</p><p>\u201cOkay then. Here\u2019s the key to her place. If you hurt her, I\u2019ll have your brothers tie you down on top of an ant hill while I pour honey on you,\u201d she threatened.</p><p>He gave her a sufficiently horrified face. He had no doubt she was dead serious.</p><p>\u201cThanks for being such a great friend to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the best. Now you can go get her,\u201d Cassie told him before she reached up on her toes and kissed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough kissing between the two of you,\u201d Max growled as he swung Cassie into his arms and kissed in a far from chaste possession.</p><p>Austin turned to leave again, but his path was blocked by his father this time.</p><p>What the heck? Was it a conspiracy?</p><p>\u201cNot so quick, Austin,\u201d George said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back for the wedding. I promise,\u201d Austin said, his eyes glancing to the door.</p><p>\u201cLove can\u2019t wait. You take your time with Kinsey,\u201d George told him.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you blocking me?\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s eyes filled with tears, and Austin felt immediate remorse for the way he\u2019d spoken to his father. If the last few months proved anything, it was that time was limited, and he needed to appreciate every moment he had with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad.\u201d</p><p>George held up his hand to stop him. He cleared his throat, then lifted his head up, both pain and joy in his expression.</p><p>\u201cI loved your mother. Oh, the joy she brought me each and every day I had with her. The sound of her voice when I walked in the door was music to my years. I thank God for the time I was blessed to be with her. I understand why he wanted to bring her home early. She was just that special,\u201d George whispered in a broken voice.</p><p>Everyone was silent as George spoke. Was he having second thoughts on marrying Esther? They were frozen as they waited.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted to find love again, but the funny thing about love, is that you don\u2019t choose it, it chooses you. I loved your mother, and I always will. But, I\u2019ve been blessed in this life to have a second beginning. Esther makes me laugh. She makes my heart pound, and my knee\u2019s week. I\u2019ve fallen a bit more in love with her each new day, and I\u2019m proud to make her my wife. It\u2019s okay to give our hearts away, just as long as the person we give them to is worthy,\u201d George continued, his eyes bright.</p><p>Austin hoped he and Kinsey would share that strong of a love. One so strong that not even the finality of death could break it.</p><p>George opened his hand, palm side up and looked down. As he did, a single tear fell, landing right in the middle of the circle of platinum.</p><p>\u201cYour mother wore this ring for thirty years. Our last night together, when she knew it was time to go home, we were lying together, speaking about our family. She made me promise to take her ring and pass it to one of you. She said whoever wore it was guaranteed an eternity of happiness with their true love. She said I\u2019d know when the moment was right because she\u2019d be by my side, whispering in my ear, watching over our children,\u201d George stopped as he coughed, emotions clogging his throat.</p><p>Austin looked over to find every woman in the room had tears cascading down their cheeks, sympathy in their eyes. Heck, even the men were clearing their throats, trying like crazy to keep it together.</p><p>He turned back to his father, who smiled, with both joy and sorrow in his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s you, Austin. Take your mother\u2019s ring. You treat your future wife like the queen she is, hold her, comfort her, and tell her every single day that she\u2019s the light of your world. You cherish her always.\u201d</p><p>George placed the ring in Austin\u2019s palm, then gently pushed his fingers shut around it. He placed his own hand over his son\u2019s, patted it once, then let go. He smiled at Austin and his other children, then looked in the corner of the room, his gaze clouding over for a moment before his eyes shut briefly. Then, without saying another word, he walked from the room.</p><p>Austin opened his fingers to gaze at the antique diamond set in a stunning platinum band, and his heart flooded with warmth. He shut his eyes, and for one moment, one glorious moment, his mom was right there with her arms wrapped around him.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, he looked at his family and slowly his mouth turned up at the corners as he smiled.</p><p>\u201cThis is a wedding day. A beautiful, sunny, amazing day, so all of you quit weeping. I\u2019m going to beg for forgiveness now, and hopefully win the girl,\u201d he said before finally managing to make it out the door, all sorrow gone as he raced toward his future.</p><p>Austin made it to Kinsey\u2019s house in one piece \u2013 barely. He must have broken every speed limit in the Seattle area, urgency pushing him on.</p><p>His heart raced as he climbed the outside stairs to her apartment, then listened at her door. He couldn\u2019t hear a sound on the other side, so he slowly inserted the key into the lock and turned the knob.</p><p>He felt like a burglar as he looked inside her private space. Shadows danced in the darkened room, little light managing to get through the closed blinds.</p><p>He stepped inside and locked the door behind him, cautiously moving through the small room. It didn\u2019t take him long to locate the opened door at the end of the short hallway. He looked inside and found her sleeping on top of the blankets, her face relaxed, her hair cascading over the pillow.</p><p>His groin tightened at the sight of her laying there in nothing but a T-shirt, which was riding high, showing him the delectable curve of her round behind.</p><p>\u201cPriorities,\u201d he reminded himself, the sound of his voice causing her to stir, but not wake.</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed and reached his hand out, stroking her hair.</p><p>\u201cKinsey, wake up. I need to talk to you,\u201d he whispered as she began to stir. His stomach knotted as she turned on her back, showing him her barely covered body. Only her breasts were shielded from his view. He tried being good \u2013 tried not to look as her leg shifted, her body seeking his in her sleep.</p><p>He laid next to her, his endurance being pushed to the limits.</p><p>\u201cKinsey, please wake-up. I need to tell you something,\u201d he said, his voice a little louder.</p><p>\u201cAustin?\u201d she murmured, her eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cYes, Kinsey. It\u2019s me. I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWe really need to talk first, Kinsey,\u201d he said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cMmm, need you. Please,\u201d she uttered as her body shifted closer.</p><p>Austin was lost. How could he refuse her when she was arching into him, her beautiful core bared, her lips red and inviting. Just a little kiss, then he\u2019d stop. Just one kiss...</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>Kinsey woke up to the feel of Austin\u2019s mouth devouring hers. She knew it was him without opening her eyes. She knew his smell, his taste, his very essence. She knew him.</p> <p>She opened her eyes, shock consuming her as his tongue slipped into her mouth. What shocked her more was the fact that her arms were wrapped around him, pulling him toward her as her hips pushed up against his hard body.</p><p>His hand lifted to her hip, pushing up her shirt, and she felt desire flare through her, cutting all thoughts from her mind. She groaned as his tongue stroked her mouth and his hand climbed higher beneath her shirt. He delved deeper in her mouth, possessing her, claiming her in a way that had her wanting to shout yes.</p><p>He surrounded her, his scent, taste, hands and body. He was invading all her senses, overpowering her with his sheer magnetism. She moved against him, needing him to set her free, to relieve the ache he\u2019d so quickly built.</p><p>\u201cKinsey, I came to talk. I need to talk, but...\u201d he uttered as he lifted his head and looked into her eyes.</p><p>Talk? She didn\u2019t want to talk. She didn\u2019t want to think. She didn\u2019t want to give herself time to feel guilty. She only wanted to feel the explosion she felt building inside. She grabbed him and brought his lips back to hers.</p><p>With a groan, he complied, nipping her bottom lip as his hand slid the rest of the way up her shirt and cupped her straining breasts. He squeezed her nipple, making her gasp into his mouth.</p><p>He shifted, pulling away from her and she protested. He grabbed something from his pants pocket, then shed his clothes in record time. Before she could even blink, he ripped her shirt over her head, then laid on top of her, his full weight crushing her into the mattress.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she begged. She pushed her hips against him, wanting him to sink inside her. She ached, pain throbbing in her core. She needed him buried deep, needed it beyond reason.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he warned.</p><p>He moved down her neck, quickly reaching her breasts. He ran his tongue along her swollen nipples, tasting and teasing them, then pulling one at a time into his mouth, tugging on the buds with his teeth.</p><p>He continued down her body, his hands moving along her thighs, then up to cup her flesh, before coming around and spreading her open for him to explore.</p><p>He pushed his finger inside, making her cry out as his mouth descended and his tongue licked her flesh. Finally, he sucked her sensitive bud into his mouth, running his tongue against it, sending her flying over the edge.</p><p>He stroked her softly as pleasure washed through her, and she fell into an endless black hole, where ecstasy was her only feeling.</p><p>Slowly, he climbed up her body, moving sensuously, kissing and nipping at her skin as he made the journey. He reached her face, his eyes dark, filled with lust as he gazed at her.</p><p>He moved to the side, slipped on a condom, then started sliding inside her still quivering body.</p><p>He gripped her hair, pulling her lips up to meet his as he greedily took her mouth while his hips drove into her, his thick erection pushing harder, faster and deeper.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kinsey, yes, yes,\u201d he cried as his movements quickened to a frenzy. His body pressed into her, slapping against her flesh. She reached behind him, gripping his firm butt in her hands, feeling the muscles flex beneath her fingers each time he thrust.</p><p>Higher and higher. She was reaching, reaching...</p><p>She cried out as the storm broke and she fell into a sea of tranquility and pleasure. She gripped him tight, exploding around him, squeezing him, pulling him under with her.</p><p>\u201cKinsey!\u201d Austin cried her name as his body tensed, his pleasure pouring into her. His hips continued to thrust, drawing the pleasure out for endless moments.</p><p>Finally he slowed, then stopped, as he relaxed against her. Her legs wrapped around his hips, holding him close. Her hands were still clinging to his hair while his lips rested on her neck.</p><p>\u201cI can do that all day, Kinsey. The feel of your body, the taste of your skin. What you do to me is more than I deserve. You\u2019re so beautiful, so sensual. I think of you and my body readies for your welcoming heat. I want you so much, every day, all the time,\u201d he said as he kissed her neck, his tongue sliding out, sending shivers down her sated body.</p><p>He moved them to their sides, her leg trapped beneath him, his still hard staff buried in her pulsing heat. She couldn\u2019t take any more. Her body wouldn\u2019t survive it.</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel like I can fly, Kinsey. I feel like I can do anything when I\u2019m in your arms, like I\u2019m invincible. I didn\u2019t mean to do this until we talked, but you were lying there, so beautiful. The sight of your body makes me lose my mind,\u201d he continued, melting her with his words, while the slightest movement of his hips had her straining for more.</p><p>\u201cI... I can\u2019t think when you touch me,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>His lips turned up at the corners, male pride radiating from his pores as his hands slid down her back, her hip, then up her side and across to her breasts where he gently squeezed the soft flesh, making her moan.</p><p>\u201cGood, then don\u2019t think. Just listen,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I... How... Wait...\u201d she gasped.</p><p>She wanted to know how he\u2019d gotten into her apartment. What was he doing there? Those were just a couple questions she needed answers to, but she was losing her train of thought as he quickly fueled her body\u2019s flames again.</p><p>\u201cI convinced Cassie to loan me her key. I had to talk to you, and I had a feeling you wouldn\u2019t let me in,\u201d he told her as if he knew her question.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d she confirmed, managing to get the words past her trembling lips.</p><p>He smiled before he brought his head down and sucked her nipple into his mouth. While loving on her, he shifted them again so he was on top once more, his growing erection still filling her, his mouth pulling on her nipple, before moving to the other side and giving it ample attention.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Kinsey. I love you so much that the thought of not being with you rips me up inside. I need you. Yes, I need your body. I need to feel your taut heat gripping me. I need to pleasure you in a thousand different ways. But, more than that, I need you sitting next to me every night. I need to see you grow old. I want to have my children with you, watch them grow, as we sit back and love each other. I want it all. I love you... I love you,\u201d he finished in a raw whisper before his lips descended again and kissed her gaping mouth.</p><p>She looked at him, knowing her eyes were wide, knowing her lips were moving but no sound was coming out. She was trying to process his words, trying to allow them to sink past the muddle her brain had become.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said again as his lips caressed her neck, his words whispering along her ear.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he continued, sending shivers down her body. His hips slowly moving again, gently, intoxicatingly. He pushed up on his forearms and looked deep in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Kinsey.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly her heart exploded as unbelievable joy washed through her. He loved her. He wasn\u2019t just saying the words. He was showing her the best way he knew how. He was loving her with his words, his body, his soul. He loved her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she finally whispered.</p><p>Unbelievable elation consumed her as she gripped Austin tighter and arched her back, pressing into him, meeting his downward thrusts. They moved together as one, both of them lost in each other.</p><p>They moved together for minutes, hours, days, she didn\u2019t know. Time stopped having any meaning.</p><p>Kinsey exploded again, pleasure washing through her, her body exhausted, her mind fuzzy. She closed her eyes and fell asleep with his body still cradling her tightly.</p><p>\u201cKinsey, wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kinsey. We need to get to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo...\u201d she moaned as she snuggled closer.</p><p>\u201cMmm, you\u2019re going to make me miss my father\u2019s wedding. He\u2019ll never forgive me,\u201d Austin said with a chuckle as his hand started moving down her body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToo sore,\u201d she murmured, though she flexed her hips toward him.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re slaying me, Kinsey. Really, I think I\u2019m going to die of sexual exhaustion,\u201d he said with a groaning laugh as he kissed her on the neck.</p><p>She finally opened her eyes and blinked. He really was there, holding her close, their naked body\u2019s touching intimately.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to die,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re mine, really mine,\u201d he said, awe in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can say the same thing,\u201d she murmured, hoping she wouldn\u2019t wake up to find it all just a dream.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t do this right,\u201d he exclaimed, quickly jumping up.</p><p>Kinsey felt an immediate loss as he pulled from her. Muscles she didn\u2019t even know existed were crying out from the exertion of their love-making, and she could feel a slight whisker burn on her neck, but still, she wanted more.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of his touch. Her eyes greedily soaked up the sight of his sculpted rear end as he leaned down to get something from his pocket. When he turned around, displaying his impressive manhood, her thighs tightened with desire.</p> <p>He walked over, love shining in his eyes as he grabbed her hand and pulled her up. She forgot to breathe when he dropped on one knee and looked adoringly up into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cKinsey Shelton, you are my world now. I thought I knew what love was before I met you. I love my family. I love my friends, but I knew nothing of what true love was until I thought I\u2019d lost you. You make my heart beat. You make my day begin. You make...\u201d he choked, as his eyes glassed over.</p><p>\u201cAustin-\u201d she tried to help him, but he shook his head, obviously needing to finish. She didn\u2019t even try to stop her own tears from falling as she gazed down at him, this man who wouldn\u2019t take less than her love.</p><p>\u201cYou make me whole. This ring was my mother\u2019s. You would\u2019ve loved her. I know she loves you. I know she\u2019s beaming with happiness right now. Please, marry me. Let me love you for the rest of our lives,\u201d he finished.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak through the lump in her throat, though she was trying to get the words out, it was impossible. She opened her mouth, but still no sound slipped through.</p><p>\u201cI can get you another ring if you want a new-\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She interrupted him, then cleared her throat. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll marry you, Austin, I\u2019d be honored to wear this ring. I\u2019m so touched you\u2019re offering me something so precious. Yes, I\u2019ll marry you. I\u2019ll mess up sometimes. I\u2019ll cry for no reason, burn food because I\u2019m lost in another world while reading, snap at you because I\u2019m having a bad day, and be completely irrational at times, but I\u2019ll love you, always. You make me so happy, so needed...\u201d She lost her words again as emotion choked her.</p><p>Austin slipped the ring on her hand, and she couldn\u2019t pull her eyes away as he leaned down and kissed her knuckle, sealing his promise to always love, honor and cherish her.</p><p>He stood and pulled her into his arms, spinning her in circles as his lips descended.</p><p>They ended up being very, very late to the wedding.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to propose a toast. Congratulations George and Esther. There aren\u2019t two finer people to have found each other. I know you\u2019ll have many years of happiness together, and I\u2019m thrilled you\u2019ve found one another. Never forget that we don\u2019t often get a second chance at extreme bliss in our lifetime. May you always appreciate one another, love each other through the good and the bad, and always turn to each other in everything you do,\u201d Joseph said.</p><p>The room erupted in applause as friends and family approved the couple\u2019s union. As guests made their way to give hugs and good-will to the couple, they never let the other out of their sight.</p><p>When the music began playing, George swept Esther onto the wood floor and showed the kids what real dancing was. As the music began, the newlyweds floated across the floor as if their feet weren\u2019t even touching the ground. They looked like Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire \u2013 dancing together effortlessly.</p> <p>Applause thundered when they finished, not that they noticed, as the two of them were locked tightly in a loving embrace.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Joseph. These boys need to learn how to properly treat a lady,\u201d George called when he finally lifted his head. Esther\u2019s cheeks were flushed, her eyes sparkling, and a smile overtaking her lips. She looked delighted, content, and in love.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk me into it.\u201d He turned to his wife, \u201cKatherine,\u201d he called as he held out his hand. She readily followed.</p><p>The music began, at first nothing more than violins caressing the early evening air. Joseph pulled Katherine close, and slowly began spinning her in a slow circle as they began the French Waltz.</p><p>George smiled at his brother as Joseph got lost in his wife\u2019s eyes, their bodies moving in sync as the other instruments slowly joined the violins, music drifting over the guests, as they watched in awe.</p><p>\u201cDance with me,\u201d George said as he pulled Esther back into his arms, then easily followed Joseph and Katherine across the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen dad dance before,\u201d Lucas said as he watched his parents in awe.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re stunning,\u201d Amy sighed, her eyes glued to the couples who were so lost in each other.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes they are,\u201d Alex said as he pulled Jessica closer to him. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>When she nodded, he led her out to the floor and quickly joined the dance. It didn\u2019t take long for the rest to follow.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cAh, I see you\u2019ve finally decided to grace us with your presence, Austin,\u201d Joseph\u2019s voice boomed out over the crowd.</p><p>Austin never thought he\u2019d be so happy to hear that wonderful sound. He took a moment to say a silent thank you for his prayer being answered. He\u2019d even received so much more than he\u2019d asked for. His father finding happiness, his uncle back to full health, and the love of his life agreeing to be his forever.</p><p>\u201cI had something to do that couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d Austin called back, his face bright as he held tightly to Kinsey\u2019s hand, letting everyone in the room know what, or rather, who couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more important than your father\u2019s wedding?\u201d Joseph asked, his eyes zeroing in on their joined fingers.</p><p>\u201cI had to convince this lovely woman to marry me, though I don\u2019t know how I did it,\u201d he said with pride.</p><p>The room was nearly silent for a moment, with just the sound of the music playing in the background, as his words sunk in. Cassie was the first to rush over and give the two of them a hug.</p><p>\u201cAh, very good, boy,\u201d Joseph said, his voice a bit quieter, emotion in his tone.</p><p>Austin knew exactly how he felt.</p><p>\u201cChampagne,\u201d Joseph called, and the waiters appeared with trays full of sparkling flutes. The adults grabbed the bubbling refreshment, while the children and pregnant women took sparkling cider.</p><p>\u201cWe have so much to celebrate. So much indeed. Here\u2019s to romance, marriages, children, and family,\u201d Joseph called.</p><p>Everyone raised their glasses and moved through the room, excitement overflowing from every corner.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>One month later, Austin stood on the beach as he dipped his wife in his arms and kissed her tenderly. When he stood back up, he turned and looked at the faces of his family, joy radiating off him in waves.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Anderson,\u201d the preacher said as Austin and Kinsey began walking down the aisle of grass, their bare feet hardly touching the ground.</p><p>Austin led her to a large tent where the music was playing, and he immediately pulled her onto the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cHave I mentioned today how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce or twice,\u201d Kinsey replied before resting her head against his solid chest.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I managed to win you, Kinsey, but I\u2019ll be grateful till the day I die. I love you more now than I ever thought possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Austin Anderson. I can\u2019t believe I ever ran from your arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were wise, woman. I plan to wear you out,\u201d he told her, his brows lifting as he attempted an evil grin.</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReceptions are unnecessary. I say we sneak off to our room. I have plans for you,\u201d he said as he stopped moving and looked into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she answered, excitement lighting her face.</p><p>Austin grabbed her hand and they started to slip away, excited they seemed to be eluding Joseph, and the rest of the family.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to-\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around so you can cut the cake,\u201d Cassie interrupted them with a very satisfied expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cCass...\u201d Kinsey pled.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Payback\u2019s such a pleasure,\u201d Cassie said as she snuggled in-between the two of them and started pulling them toward their guests.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just mean,\u201d Kinsey said, knowing full well she deserved it.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve been waiting since my wedding for this moment. Suffer, really, really suffer,\u201d she said with an evil grin.</p><p>Kinsey gave up the fight and let Cassie lead her back to the reception. Payback really did suck, she thought, as she eyed her husband with longing.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cYou never did finish your story, Mom. With all the excitement of dad waking up, and then the two weddings, I forgot for a while, but what happened with the corporation?\u201d Amy asked as they sat by the fire, the kids sleeping, and the adults enjoying a midnight snack.</p><p>\u201cI guess I did leave you hanging. To answer your earlier question, yes, this is the same corporation your grandfather began. The board met and voted Joseph as CEO a few weeks after our wedding. Neilson was furious and threatened to take us all down. It truly was sad he turned out that way,\u201d Katherine replied.</p><p>\u201cWhat ever happened with him? I don\u2019t remember ever seeing pictures of him?\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was quite tragic, actually. We didn\u2019t hear anything for several years. Then one day a woman showed up on our doorstep, carrying a child in her arms, saying she was Neilson\u2019s wife. She had to have been twenty-five years younger than him. Joseph wasn\u2019t home, and I didn\u2019t know what to do so I invited her in, which probably wasn\u2019t wise. She told me Neilson had died of a heart attack, and she had nowhere else to go. I told her to wait until Joseph got home and we\u2019d work things out. In the morning, when I woke, she was gone. She took ten thousand dollars your father had in his office, and disappeared. Joseph searched for her, knowing that\u2019s what his father would want, but we only came up with dead ends. We never did find out if she was speaking the truth, or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sad,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is indeed. We would\u2019ve given her the money, but maybe she was just a stranger, and wanted to get what she could before we found out. We\u2019ll probably never know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid Neilson really die?\u201d Trenton asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. We were able to confirm that. If he was married, though, it wasn\u2019t legal,\u201d Joseph said, obviously still bothered over the events, even after so many years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bree said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too, sweetie. If the child is an Anderson, we would\u2019ve done right by him,\u201d Joseph said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, we never would\u2019ve taken out our anger with Neilson on an innocent kid,\u201d George added.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re honorable men. They just don\u2019t make them like you anymore,\u201d Austin said, looking at his father and uncle with pride.</p><p>\u201cWe had a great father to look up to,\u201d Joseph said, and George agreed.</p><p>\u201cOur story had a very good ending, though. As you all know, we lived happily ever after,\u201d Katherine finished with a smile as she looked at her husband.</p><p>\u201cMay each of you have the same. One day, you\u2019ll be telling your own children the beautiful story of your beginning. Relationships are built on the good and the bad, it\u2019s how we handle each situation that defines our character. Thank you for being here for Katherine while I was sick. Thank you for being here every day for each other,\u201d Joseph said, raising his glass.</p> <p>\u201cHere, here,\u201d each person called.</p><p>They stayed up long into the night, reminiscing about the past and planning for the future.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Joseph looked across the table, his eyes shining as his family gathered. Noise reigned as everyone spoke at once, all of them happy to be together another year. He truly loved Thanksgiving.</p><p>As usual, he had much to be thankful for. He had yet another year together with his wife. He looked at her, still so beautiful. He\u2019d known how truly scared she\u2019d been while he was in his coma last year. He hated that he\u2019d put her through such a horrible ordeal. He\u2019d made a promise to her years earlier that he\u2019d never hurt her again, but he hadn\u2019t been able to keep the promise.</p><p>He vowed he\u2019d do everything in his power to never let it happen again. He\u2019d gotten rid of his fast cars. He no longer needed that thrill. The only excitement he needed was the sight of his wife beside him, each night and morning, and of course, the love of his ever growing family.</p> <p>Sitting closest to him were George and Esther, looking like kids on their honeymoon, even after being married almost a year. George looked over and winked at him, making Joseph smile. His brother was a great man.</p><p>Then there was Lucas and Amy. They\u2019d been married eight years already. Joseph couldn\u2019t believe how time had flown. Their children were growing so fast. He loved all his grandchildren, and great-nieces and nephews equally, he told himself, but Jasmine had a special place in his heart. She was the first. His very first granddaughter. She was the beginning of the next generation. There was a bond between them he thanked God for every day.</p><p>His eyes continued to sweep across the table as he took in Alex, who at that moment, leaned over and whispered something in Jessica\u2019s ear, making her blush. She didn\u2019t realize anyone was watching and Joseph smiled again as she leaned in and kissed Alex.</p><p>Jacob groaned loudly at their display, and they split apart, both of them laughing while Alex picked his son up, then hugged him close. Jacob protested, but Joseph saw the love on the boy\u2019s face.</p><p>Mark and Emily were talking to Trenton and Jennifer. They\u2019d become so close. All of the kids loved each other, but Emily and Jennifer had really hit it off. Joseph loved seeing his growing family also become friends.</p><p>Mark said something that had Trenton laughing. Emily slapped Mark\u2019s arm, but the smile on her face said he wasn\u2019t in too much trouble. Mark turned and kissed her, stopping all protests. When he pulled away, she was flushed and looking very pleased.</p><p>Young Trevor was turning into a man. He\u2019d soon be breaking hearts. He was as handsome as his father. Not that looks mattered if the heart wasn\u2019t pure.</p><p>Trenton suddenly got up and grabbed Jennifer\u2019s hand. He thought with all the chaos around them no one would notice if he slipped away for a few minutes. Of course, Joseph noticed everything. He smiled as he watched his nephew take his wife away for a moment of privacy.</p> <p>Joseph\u2019s eyes moved to Max next. Max had sure been stubborn in finding love. They all had, but Joseph had doubts about Max settling down. He shouldn\u2019t have worried, though. Cassandra was his perfect match. She brought out a joy in Max that was radiant.</p><p>No matter where the two of them were, Joseph always noticed that Max was touching her. His hand on her back as they were standing, or grazing her knee where they sat. He loved her, and his every action showed that.</p><p>Bree was laughing at something Chad said. He was sitting across the table from Mark, and the two men were having an animated conversation. Probably talking about Trenton sneaking off.</p><p>The two of them were most likely jealous they hadn\u2019t thought of it first. Chad turned and looked at Bree, his hand shooting out to tug her close as he kissed her, leaving her looking breathless before he turned back to Mark and started talking again.</p><p>Finally, there was Austin. He was sitting in the corner, Kinsey perched on his lap with his arms around her as she cradled their daughter, Isabelle, close. She was less than a week old, so tiny and delicate, just like her mother. Joseph knew the happy couple also had the kind of love that would last.</p><p>His family was complete. All of his children and nephews and niece were happily married, having children, and living their lives to the fullest. He couldn\u2019t ask for anything more.</p><p>He sat back and watched, watched the way his family interacted, the way the children played, and how they all responded to one another.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done well, Katherine,\u201d he said, his voice low.</p><p>\u201cYes, Joseph, we have,\u201d she agreed. \u201cYou know, if I weren\u2019t so happy about this beautiful family, you\u2019d be in trouble, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said, trying his best to sound innocent.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fool me, Joseph Anderson. However, I\u2019ll let you think you can,\u201d she said, her eyes filled with love.</p><p>Joseph gazed at her for a moment, then he leaned in and gave her a kiss, his lips lingering for a long while. Even after forty years of marriage, she took his breath away.</p><p>He stood up and waited for the table to grow silent. With the growing number of family members, it took a little bit longer each year. He was content to wait.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come to another Thanksgiving. As with each year, we have much to be grateful for. We have good jobs for ourselves, and for many employees. We have our health, some days of course, it\u2019s better than others. Most importantly, we have each other.\u201d He stopped for a moment as he fought the emotion building in him.</p><p>His family was silent as they waited, eyes starting to mist all around. Katherine stood next to him, taking his hand in hers. She looked up at him, her eyes glowing, then turned and faced the table.</p><p>\u201cWe have each other today, tomorrow, and forever,\u201d she finished quietly.</p><p>Everyone raised their glasses as they called out their agreement and toasted their thanks.</p><p>\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca\u25ca</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, George,\u201d Joseph answered.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I can\u2019t complain. I have a wonderful new bride, beautiful grandkids and my family all together again, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, brother, I know,\u201d Joseph moped.</p><p>The two men sat in the den, sipping their drinks as they warmed themselves by the fire. The family was gathered in the sitting room, everyone too full to move around much. Joseph and George had snuck away for a drink.</p><p>\u201cWell, it shouldn\u2019t take that long for the grandkids to grow,\u201d George said as he perked up.</p><p>\u201cHmm, you have a good point there,\u201d Joseph replied as he sat a little straighter.</p><p>\u201cYeah, look how the last ten years have flown past. Heck, the last twenty-five for that matter. I forget at times how old I\u2019ve gotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite your tongue, George. We\u2019ve aged well, like a good scotch, we\u2019re not old,\u201d Joseph admonished.</p><p>\u201cTrue, Joseph, very true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen this all started, I wanted grandkids. I thought my boys were never going to settle down. Now that I have them, I miss the planning and sneaking around. I got quiet clever in ways to trick them all,\u201d Joseph said proudly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to figure out other ways to keep entertained until those kids get a little older,\u201d George sighed.</p><p>\u201cJoseph, time for dessert,\u201d Katherine said as she and Esther stepped into the room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right out, dear,\u201d Joseph called back.</p><p>\u201cWe truly are blessed men,\u201d George said as the women left, his eyes gazing at the door his new bride just walked through.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s join our family, George. I\u2019m not ready to quit celebrating, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back, Joseph. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve made it had you not come out of that coma,\u201d George said as they stood, putting his hand on Joseph\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cIf anything ever happens to me, you will not stop living your life, George Anderson. If something were to happen, I\u2019d just sit down with our dad and catch up while I waited for the rest of you to finish what you needed to. If you want to make me happy, then live. Promise me that you\u2019ll always live life to the fullest, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a great man, Joseph, one of the few. Now, enough of this. Let\u2019s find our wives.\u201d</p><p>The two brothers walked through the door, optimistic about the future that lay ahead. </p> </body></html>"]
