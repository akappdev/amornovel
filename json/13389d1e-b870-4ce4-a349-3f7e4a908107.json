The urge to shift into First, slam the gas and hightail it out of the dismal gray parking lot pulses through my veins.</p><p>I force my stiff fingers to release the gear stick. Music could take the edge off, but the bass from the speakers vibrates in a way that could draw attention to my car hiding in the employee-only lot. From here, I can watch the visitors enter and exit the social services building.</p><p>Ninety minutes ago, my mother walked in. Now I need to see her walk out. With each intake of cold air, the itch to leave grows. So does the itch to meet her.</p><p>The heater died a half hour ago, and the engine stalled twice. A few more things to fix on the growing list. In need of a new resistor, the heater will be a cheap fix.</p><p>My cell rings. Without checking the caller ID, I know who it is, yet I answer anyway. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see you.\u201d Annoyance thickens my social worker\u2019s Southern accent. \u201cShe\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flicker to the corner windows close to her cubicle and six feet from my car. Courtney draws the shades and places a hand on her hip. Her ponytail swings from side to side like she\u2019s a pissed-off racehorse. Fresh out of college, she was assigned my case back in June. I guess her boss figured she couldn\u2019t jack me up more than I already am.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to schedule a visitation.\u201d I stare at her as if we were in the same room. What I like about Courtney? She stares back. She\u2019s one of three people who have the guts to hold eye contact with an inked seventeen-year-old with a shaved head and earrings. The second one is my best friend. The third...well, the third was the girl I loved.</p><p>Courtney sighs and the ponytail stills. \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve, Isaiah. She showed early and brought you presents. She\u2019s waited patiently for a thirty-minute visitation that should have ended forty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Waited. Patiently. My neck tightens and I roll it from side to side to keep from blowing steam at the wrong person. \u201cTen years.\u201d</p><p>I throw those two words at her every time she mentions my mother. Courtney drops her chin to her throat. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. She had her reasons, and she wants to talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>I raise my voice and pound my hand against the steering wheel. \u201cTen years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have been fifteen, but she was a model prisoner,\u201d she says, as if that was a concession on Mom\u2019s part. \u201cShe wrote you once a week.\u201d</p><p>I glare at Courtney through the windshield. \u201cThen be her social worker if you\u2019re up her damn ass so much. She\u2019s been out for over a year and she\u2019s just now coming to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d she says with defeat. \u201cCome in. Give her a chance.\u201d</p><p>I place one foot on the clutch and the other on the gas. My engine roars with anger and the car\u2019s frame vibrates with the need to run. Third Street ends at the social services building and my parking spot gives me a straight shot to the clear strip of road. Give Mom a chance? Why should I? When have I been given one?</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what she did,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Courtney softens her voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about why she went to prison.\u201d I shake my head as if the action can dispel the memory playing in my mind. \u201cYou have no idea what she did to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d A pause. \u201cCome in. We can work this out.\u201d</p><p>No. It can never be worked out. \u201cDid you know that the lights on Third Street are on a timer?\u201d I ask her. \u201cAnd that if you hit the sweet spot speed you can cruise the entire strip without hitting a red?\u201d</p><p>Courtney bangs her fist against the glass. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d</p><p>I rev the engine again. \u201cEver hit a quarter mile in ten seconds, Courtney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah! You\u2019d better\u2014\u201d</p><p>I hit End and toss the phone onto the passenger seat. Focusing on the red light, I shift into First as my foot hovers over the gas. Speed. It\u2019s what I crave. I can race the emotions away. The light turns, I release the clutch and my body slams into the seat as my foot crashes down on the gas.</p><p>Is it possible to outrun memories?</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Rachel</p><p>WAITERS IN WHITE FRANTICALLY STEP out of my way as I race down the hall. The expensive art on the wall becomes a colored blur the faster I go. My breath comes out in a rush and my dress ruffles and crinkles against itself. I\u2019m creating too much noise and garnering too much attention. None of that is good when I\u2019m trying to make a quick getaway.</p><p>My heels dangle in my right hand and I lift the hem of my shimmering blue-gray ball gown with the other. Cinderella ran away because her coach was going to turn back into a pumpkin. I\u2019m running away because I\u2019d rather be knee-deep in axle grease.</p><p>Rounding another corner, I enter the desolate hallway near the country club\u2019s kitchen. The sound of the crowd laughing and the rhythmic beats of the jazz band become muffled the farther I run. A few more steps and I\u2019ll be home free in my sweet, sweet Mustang.</p><p>\u201cGotcha!\u201d Fingers slide onto my arm and I experience whiplash. My hair stings my face as it flies forward, then back. One hand-curled spiral strand of blond bounces near my eye when it breaks loose from the jeweled clip holding the sides of my hair.</p><p>My twin brother turns me to face him. A hint of laughter plays on his lips. \u201cWhere are you going, sis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathroom.\u201d To the parking lot and as far as possible from the ballroom.</p><p>Ethan points back toward the long hallway. \u201cThe girls\u2019 bathroom is that direction.\u201d</p><p>I lean into my brother. My eyes widen and I wonder if I look crazy, because I feel a little crazy. \u201cMom wants me to give a speech. A speech! I can\u2019t give a speech. I can\u2019t! Do you remember the last time Mom put me on display? Two years ago when she threw us that horrid \u2018surprise\u2019 fabulous fifteenth birthday party. I vomited. Everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was there. It even grossed me out.\u201d His face twists in mock disgust. Ethan is laughing at me and I cannot be laughed at\u2014at least not now.</p><p>I grab hold of his white button-down dress shirt and shake him. Or try to. The boy doesn\u2019t budge. \u201cIt took me months to find the nerve to talk at school again. Everyone there has long memories, Ethan, and they\u2019ve just now forgotten. I would like to be kissed before I graduate from high school. Boys will not kiss girls who keep vomiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever noticed you talk a lot when you\u2019re on the verge of a panic attack?\u201d Ethan\u2019s kidding, but my panic is real. I\u2019m close to an attack\u2014very close. And if I don\u2019t get out of here soon, he\u2019ll discover my secret.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he continues, \u201cthat was two years ago. So you hate public speaking. You\u2019ll sweat a lot, stutter a little and move on.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. If only that was my worst fear.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s my opposite. He resembles Dad with black hair and dark eyes, he\u2019s a good foot taller than me and he\u2019s brave. His eyes narrow and he tilts his head as the last word of my outburst registers. \u201cYou said vomit. Which means an actual panic attack. I thought you were over that.\u201d</p><p>My fingers curl tighter into the material of his shirt. I messed up. How could I make such a careless mistake? For two years I\u2019ve kept this secret from my family: that I still suffer from panic attacks. That when I\u2019m the center of attention or too anxious or stressed, I become paralyzed and lose the ability to breathe. Nausea will coil in my stomach, bile will rise in my throat and the pressure will continually build until I throw up.</p><p>Life has been hard on my parents and two oldest brothers. I made the decision after the horrendous birthday party that they would never have to worry about me\u2014the child who won\u2019t die from her illness.</p><p>\u201cI am over it,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to make a fool of myself. I...I...\u201d Can\u2019t think of anything good enough to get myself out of this. \u201cI forgot my speech and I left my notes at home and I\u2019m going to sound like an idiot.\u201d Wow\u2014fantastic save. \u201cLook, I\u2019m calling twin amnesty on this.\u201d</p><p>His eyes search my face, I\u2019m sure assessing my level of near-crazy. Years ago, we agreed to cover each other ten times in a year, regardless of repercussions. Ethan burned through his amnesty cards weeks ago and knows I usually use mine for midnight drives so I can push the speedometer on my Mustang.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got one amnesty card left this year,\u201d he says as a blatant reminder that in a few days, when the new year rushes in to greet us, we\u2019ll be starting with a clean slate and I\u2019ll be covering for him again.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is the hand you want to play the card on?\u201d he continues. \u201cDo the speech and then I\u2019ll cover your ass when you sneak out to drive the Mustang later. Driving always makes you feel better, and this ride should be relatively guilt-free. It\u2019ll be your first legal midnight run.\u201d</p><p>My brother enjoys reminding me that my infatuation with driving late at night was illegal on my intermediate license. Ethan\u2019s right\u2014I love to drive and I have a full license now. The only way I\u2019ll get caught for breaking curfew is if Ethan blows my cover or if I leave before the speech. Either one of those options will mean a grounding for life.</p><p>All of this should be taken into consideration, and I should be thinking it through logically, but I abandoned logic back in the ballroom. My pulse begins to throb in my ears. \u201cYes.\u201d Definitely. \u201cYes, I\u2019m playing the card now.\u201d</p><p>He lets go of my arm and glances down to where my fingers are still clutching his shirt. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you. Do you understand? You slipped out the entrance and we never talked. I\u2019m not taking heat from Gavin for this, twin amnesty or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot taking heat for what?\u201d Gavin\u2019s deep voice calls from down the hallway. My hope disintegrates and falls to the floor. Crap. I\u2019m never getting out of here.</p><p>I force myself to release Ethan and fake the smile on my face even though my heart thuds against my rib cage. My brothers are used to my disposition, what Ethan annoyingly refers to as sunshine and rainbows. I\u2019m so going to be sunshine and rainbows if it kills me. \u201cHi, Gavin. I saw you dancing with Jeannie Riley. She\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s the oldest of my parents\u2019 brood of five children. We\u2019re a close family, even though a huge age gap extends between the siblings. Gavin was eight and Jack was seven when Ethan and I were born. Jack stands beside Gavin and they both fold their arms over their chests when they see me and Ethan. Guess this time I didn\u2019t feign sunshine and rainbows well enough.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s looking for you,\u201d says Jack. \u201cIt\u2019s time for your speech.\u201d Jack\u2019s quiet and that may be his longest monologue for the night. Which makes it rough for me to say no to him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rach,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cYou\u2019re the one that approached Mom and Dad about speaking at this event. Not the other way around. You need to get over this fear of being in the spotlight. It\u2019s in your head. It was one thing when you were seven, but it\u2019s gotten old. You\u2019re a junior in high school, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gavin\u2019s right. I offered to speak at the leukemia event. A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon Mom crying over a picture she\u2019d found of her oldest daughter, Colleen, and I hated the pain in her eyes. I had overheard Mom mention a few days before to a friend that she\u2019d always dreamed of me talking on Colleen\u2019s behalf. When her friend suggested Mom should ask me to participate at this fundraiser, Mom declined, telling her she\u2019d never put me in a situation that made me uncomfortable.</p><p>Mom\u2019s been in hell for over twenty-one years and the sole reason for my birth was to make her feel better. She still cries, so I guess that means I haven\u2019t done a very good job.</p><p>My stomach cramps and my hands begin to sweat. It\u2019s coming\u2014the attack. I try to remember what the therapist in middle school said about breathing, but I can\u2019t breathe when my lungs won\u2019t expand.</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind,\u201d I whisper. \u201cI can\u2019t do the speech.\u201d I need to get out of here fast or everyone will know that I\u2019ve been lying. They\u2019ll know I still have the attacks.</p> <p>\u201cAre you really going to let us down?\u201d asks Gavin.</p><p>The squeak of the back door announces the arrival of my last brother. In one easy stride, West lopes into our private circle. The two of us favor Mom with our blond hair and eyes so blue they almost appear purple. Along with his white tux shirt and undone bow tie, West wears a baseball cap backward. \u201cNot sure what\u2019s going on, but you should leave my little sister alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet that hat off, West,\u201d says Gavin. \u201cMom told you she didn\u2019t want to see a thing on your head until tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Gavin leads us. He always has. But just because the four of us have always followed doesn\u2019t mean we think Gavin\u2019s awesome. In fact, Ethan, West and I find Gavin annoying. Jack is Gavin\u2019s best friend.</p><p>West pulls the cap off his head and flashes the smile that says he\u2019s playing the field...again. \u201cThere was a girl and she likes hats.\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes as my brothers chuckle. There\u2019s always a girl. Less than a year older than me and Ethan, West is our high school\u2019s version of the guys from an MTV reality series that sleep with a new girl each night. And lucky us, Ethan and I have front row seats to watch West\u2019s show. \u201cYou\u2019re a pig.\u201d</p><p>West waggles his eyebrows at me. \u201cOink.\u201d</p><p>Gavin points at West. \u201cNo hat.\u201d West shoves it in the back pocket of his dress pants.</p><p>Then Gavin turns on Ethan. \u201cShe\u2019s not getting out of this, so stop trying to snatch her keys.\u201d</p><p>My head jerks to the small matching purse attached to my wrist and I catch Ethan dropping his hand, my keys in his fist. Gavin motions with his fingers for Ethan to relinquish them. With a huff, Ethan tosses to my oldest brother my only chance at escape.</p><p>Gavin raises his arms at his sides as he nears us. It\u2019s a gesture that makes me feel part of this inclusive family, yet the action also makes Gavin, who is already massively built, larger. His frame so encompasses the small hallway that I draw my arms and legs into my body in order to give him more room. Each of us responds to Gavin in our own way, but I always withdraw because I am the youngest, the lowest and the weakest.</p> <p>\u201cThis is important to Mom and Dad,\u201d says Gavin. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t get in there and say a few words, you\u2019re going to disappoint both of them. Think of how upset you\u2019ll be later tonight when the guilt eats at you.\u201d</p><p>A lump forms in my throat and my lungs tighten. Gavin\u2019s right. I hate disappointing Mom and Dad, and I don\u2019t handle guilt well. But at least if I choose to bolt, I won\u2019t run the risk of humiliating myself in public.</p><p>\u201cRach,\u201d Gavin pleads. \u201cThis is important to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo us,\u201d adds Jack.</p><p>I inhale deeply to keep from dry heaving. Mom and Dad have thrown this event during the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s for the past sixteen years. It means the world not only to them, but also to Gavin and Jack. My strongest allies, Ethan and West, both lower their heads. For the three of us, this night reminds us why we\u2019re alive, why Mom had more kids. She longed for another girl.</p><p>West shuffles his feet. \u201cBreathe through it, okay. Look at me or Ethan while you talk.\u201d</p><p>Ethan shrugs one shoulder. \u201cOr look at Gavin and pretend he\u2019s grown antlers to match that obnoxiously large snout of his.\u201d</p><p>Gavin flips Ethan off and soon my brothers toss insults like athletes toss balls. I don\u2019t want to give a speech. My brothers see me as weak, and maybe I am, but how do I make them understand I have no control over the panic that consumes me? \u201cWhy me? Why not one of you?\u201d</p> <p>My questions stop the flurry of insults. The four of them exchange long glances. I know the answer, but if I have to do this, then someone has to admit it out loud.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d says Gavin. \u201cYou\u2019re the one Mom wanted.\u201d</p><p>No, I\u2019m not, but I\u2019m the best replacement Dad could give her. I close my eyes and try to find some sort of center. I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll give the speech. If I\u2019m lucky, the worst thing that will happen is that I\u2019ll stutter and shake my way through the performance. Why did Mom and Dad have to invite West and Ethan\u2019s friends this year? Just why? \u201cI\u2019m never going to be kissed.\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes to see my brothers gaping at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t kiss boys,\u201d says West. \u201cBoys shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near you. Guys only want one thing, Rach, and it ain\u2019t conversation. I should know.\u201d He waves off the subject in frustration, then shakes his head as he speaks again. \u201cWhy are we even talking about this? You aren\u2019t seeing anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell,\u201d mumbles Jack. \u201cWe\u2019re having the sex talk with my baby sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she dating?\u201d Gavin demands of West and Ethan. \u201cShe can\u2019t be dating. Now we have to beat the snot out of some horny teenager. You should have told me this was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake them stop,\u201d I whisper to Ethan. Along with the dread of speeches and vomiting, I\u2019m also dying of embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dating!\u201d West shudders as if spiders cover him. \u201cThat\u2019s just sick, Rach. Don\u2019t talk like that. Ever. Again.\u201d</p><p>Gavin sends me a glare clearly meant to warn me off from kissing and dating boys before he heads for the main ballroom. The look is lost on me as either of those things happening would require a guy first showing interest in my general direction.</p><p>Jack and West follow Gavin, both mumbling about having to beat up boys. Ethan locks an arm around my neck and pushes me forward. \u201cTwo sentences. Three tops.\u201d</p><p>Easy for him to say. He\u2019s not the one that has to stand in front of hundreds of people. Each of them hanging on my every said and unsaid word. The adults\u2019 eyes judging my shaking hands and quavering voice. Anyone age eighteen or below will giggle as they remember my past failure involving a crowd.</p><p>With each step, my knees tremble as if they\u2019re going to buckle and a cold sweat breaks out along the nape of my neck. My stomach lurches and I clap a hand over my mouth. As I fall back against the wall, Ethan\u2019s eyes widen with concern. My gaze flickers to our brothers and he jumps in front of me, blocking their view.</p><p>\u201cGive me a sec with her,\u201d he calls out. \u201cI promise she won\u2019t run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan,\u201d I warn, the moment I hear the doors to the ballroom click shut.</p><p>Ethan presses his hand into my back, edges me into the women\u2019s bathroom and locks the door behind him. I drop my shoes and they clatter against the floor of the empty restroom. I stumble and trip over my big, fluffy dress and barely catch the toilet. Water runs in the sink behind me and Ethan approaches when I\u2019m able to breathe for thirty seconds without retching.</p><p>He hands me a cold, wet paper towel. \u201cWas there blood?\u201d</p><p>I wipe my face gingerly. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t tell Mom or Dad, okay? Or anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? I thought you hadn\u2019t had an episode since freshman year.\u201d I wince from the mixture of anger and reprimand in his tone.</p><p>I hate this illness. I hate it in ways that make my blood run cold and my muscles heavy with rage. I hate the way my family has always looked at me as if I\u2019m breakable. I hate how I\u2019ve been a constant disappointment when each of my brothers has excelled at so many public things like sports or debate teams.</p><p>I\u2019m always off in the shadows and after my disastrous fifteenth birthday, I decided to suck it up and force a happy public front even if I\u2019m dying inside. My facade must be working if Mom and Dad permitted me to make the speech when I offered. They\u2019d never do anything to purposely upset me.</p><p>\u201cHave you been throwing up this entire time?\u201d Ethan persists.</p><p>\u201cLeave it alone.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his eyes. \u201cMom and Dad want to know when you have a panic attack. I want to know. This isn\u2019t a game.\u201d</p><p>My temples throb. I\u2019m the weakest member of this family. I always have been. \u201cIf I tell them, they\u2019ll send me home and Mom will hover. You guys are right. I\u2019m a wuss and I can get through this. Tonight isn\u2019t about me. It\u2019s about Mom and Dad. This is their night to remember Colleen, and I can\u2019t stand in the way of that, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ethan slides down the wall and sits beside me. \u201cI\u2019ll cover you tonight. Get through the speech, then go for a drive. I\u2019ll make sure you aren\u2019t missed.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything to keep you from getting sick again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>I ENTER THE OLD TWO-STORY house converted into apartments and I\u2019m greeted by the sound of Elvis Presley\u2019s \u201cBlue Christmas\u201d still carrying through the first-floor apartment\u2019s door. Skipping the third and sixth steps because of dry rot, I climb the stairs and slip into the door on the right.</p><p>I\u2019ve been here since August, even though Courtney believes I live in a foster home. What she doesn\u2019t know doesn\u2019t hurt me. My assigned foster family agreed to let me move out as long as I stay clear of trouble and they keep receiving their checks from the state.</p><p>Plaster flakes from the walls when a train rolls by, the wood smells like old men when it rains and rats the size of rabbits call it home, but this place beats the hell out of foster care.</p><p>Noah walks out of the bedroom with a smug smile and no shirt. \u201cHey, baby, Isaiah\u2019s back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Isaiah!\u201d Echo pops her head around the halfway-open door to the bedroom. Her red curls flow over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey, Echo,\u201d I say in return as she closes the door. A trail of shoes, Noah\u2019s shirt and Echo\u2019s sweater make a path from the couch to the bedroom. Looks like the two enjoyed my belated Christmas present to them: time alone.</p><p>Noah picks their clothes up off the floor. He knocks on the bedroom door, opens it and mumbles something as he hands her the sweater. Noah has tried to play it off for a couple of weeks, but he\u2019s worried about her. To be honest, so am I. Echo began covering her arms again last week.</p><p>He touches her face as he talks to her. It\u2019s a simple touch, but one she responds to by hugging him. I once thought I had found what Noah and Echo share: love. But I was mistaken, or maybe I was too late. Either way, I fucked up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah shuts the door, giving Echo privacy, and clears his throat. \u201cThanks, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, problem. Is she, ah...okay?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs his shirt on. \u201cHer mom\u2019s been screwing with her, using the excuse of the anniversary of Echo\u2019s brother\u2019s death in order to do it. I don\u2019t understand why Echo gives her the time of day. Her mother is a worthless pile of shit.\u201d</p><p>Noah pauses, waiting for me to agree, but I\u2019m not interested in being a hypocrite. I spent two hours last week stalking my mother in a parking lot. Evidently, Noah is a magnet for people with mom issues. Not that he would know it. The only person I told about my mother\u2019s release from prison was Beth, and I haven\u2019t talked to Beth in over two months.</p> <p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d asks Noah when I say nothing.</p><p>I think about it\u2014telling him that my mom was released from prison over a year ago and has just now requested a visit. Noah and Echo are the closest thing I have to a family and it would be nice not to carry the burden of the secret around by myself. To have someone empathize with what it\u2019s like to have been thrown away as a child.</p><p>I could even tell them why she went to jail and how I was part of it.</p><p>As I start to answer, my eyes rest on Noah\u2019s new stack of college textbooks. Noah wouldn\u2019t get it. Technically, he wasn\u2019t a throwaway. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>I open the door to the refrigerator and find the same scene as this morning: two beers and nothing else. \u201cGuess we should have hung a stocking in the fridge, man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d says Noah. \u201cWe need to put a stocking in a savings account.\u201d</p><p>He sits on the only piece of furniture in the living room besides the television: the couch we bought for thirty dollars at Goodwill. Noah and I live simply. We have a closet called a bedroom, two mattresses with box springs, one bathroom, and one larger space that contains our living room and a kitchen. Kitchen is a loose term. It consists of one sink, the refrigerator, two cabinets and a microwave.</p><p>Noah holds his hands between his knees and bends his head as if he\u2019s lost in prayer. My best friend isn\u2019t a heavy guy and this load he\u2019s shouldering\u2014it\u2019s weighing down the room.</p><p>\u201cYour student loan didn\u2019t come through, did it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Noah kneads his eyes. \u201cI need a \u2018responsible\u2019 adult to cosign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d It\u2019s like the world wants people like me and Noah to fail.</p> <p>\u201cIs what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ask anyone to help?\u201d Noah\u2019s got some nutcase therapist he\u2019s been close to since last spring, and he\u2019s been working things out with his younger brothers\u2019 adoptive parents.</p><p>\u201cCosigning a loan isn\u2019t asking for gas money.\u201d</p><p>He gives no indication of whether he let pride get in the way or whether he sought help and people said no. Because of that I let the subject drop. Me digging would only be shoving the stake in further.</p><p>\u201cI hate to ask,\u201d says Noah, \u201cbut how much can you contribute to bills this month?\u201d</p><p>Not much. Business at the auto shop where I work has been slow and what little work they do have is completed while I\u2019m in school. Plus what money I have scraped up after bills, I\u2019ve given to Echo to pay off a debt I owe her.</p><p>A debt I took on because of Beth. When the familiar ache flashes through my chest, I immediately deflect all thought to the subject at hand. \u201cHow much do we need?\u201d</p><p>Noah cracks his crazy-ass grin. \u201cAll of it. I used my last paycheck to buy the books I need for next semester and that jar of peanut butter we\u2019ve been eating from this week.\u201d</p> <p>His smile wanes and the heaviness returns. \u201cWhen we agreed to move out of foster care together I thought I\u2019d be taking on more hours at the Malt and Burger instead of dropping them, but you know...\u201d</p><p>Noah looks away. His grades took a nosedive in the first semester of his freshman year. My best friend is a smart son-of-a-bitch, but the transition from high school to college kicked his ass. In order to raise his GPA, the hours at work went down. That student loan was his last-ditch effort to find a way to exist.</p><p>\u201cAsk Echo to move in,\u201d I suggest. \u201cYou spend all of your free time together. A third body could help with bills. You two can have the bedroom and I\u2019ll crash on the couch.\u201d</p><p>He cocks his head as he contemplates, then shakes it. \u201cHer scholarship covers everything and she\u2019s too focused on school and her art to make decent money.\u201d A rat scurries from one corner and disappears into another. \u201cBesides, visiting is one thing. Living here is another.\u201d</p><p>True. His depression becomes contagious and I lean against the refrigerator. \u201cSay what you gotta say, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one advantage of graduating from foster care is that the state pays for my college tuition. They\u2019ll also pay for me to stay in the dorms.\u201d</p><p>My stomach sinks like I\u2019m falling down a damn well. He\u2019s looking to take advantage of the deal he gets for being a system kid and he wants me to return to the foster home we shared before he turned eighteen and graduated. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to foster care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have five more months until you graduate,\u201d Noah says. \u201cShirley and Dale weren\u2019t that bad. They were the best foster home I had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re Beth\u2019s family,\u201d I snap. At my side, my fists open and close. I gave the girl everything inside of me and she still walked. There\u2019s no way I can crawl back to her aunt and uncle and beg for them to take me in again, and I\u2019d rather die than go into another home. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be another way.\u201d There has to be.</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Noah says. \u201cI was there in hell right along with you, but we\u2019re drowning here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I find a way to make it work? What if I raise the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Noah\u2019s mouth tightens.</p><p>\u201cJust let me fix this.\u201d \u2019Cause I can, but in ways Noah doesn\u2019t want to know about.</p><p>Neither one of us blink as we stare at each other. Yes\u2014we\u2019ve both experienced hell, and Noah promised me when he graduated from the system that he wouldn\u2019t leave me behind.</p><p>Noah nods right as Echo opens the door to the bedroom. She stretches her long sleeves over her fingertips. I swear under my breath. She\u2019s definitely hiding her scars again. The girl has had a messed-up life and last year she finally found the courage to not give a shit what people thought of her. Leave it to a mom to reappear in her kid\u2019s life and jack everything up. Echo and I would have been better off raised by wolves.</p><p>Noah pulls her into the shelter of his body. \u201cReady to roll?\u201d</p><p>Right, dinner with Noah\u2019s younger brothers\u2019 adoptive parents. Noah and I\u2014we\u2019re brothers despite not sharing blood, and Echo became my sister the day she put a smile on his face. They\u2019re my family and I\u2019m going to fight to keep what\u2019s mine. \u201cI think I\u2019ll miss this one. I got business to take care of.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Rachel</p><p>THE DRIVER\u2019S SEAT OF MY Mustang is one of the few places where I find peace. I guess I could go on some tangent about how my older brothers influenced my love of cars, but I won\u2019t, because it\u2019s not true.</p><p>I get cars. I like the feel of them. The sound of them. My mind clears when I\u2019m behind the wheel and there\u2019s something about the sound of an engine dropping into gear as I press on the gas that makes me feel...powerful.</p><p>No fear. No nausea. No brothers to boss me around. No parents to impress. Just me, the gas pedal and the open road. And a big, fat, fluffy dress that reminds me of a flower. Shifting in this getup was a nightmare.</p><p>The fluff from the ball gown pops out of Ethan\u2019s old gym bag, and I try to shove the overflowing lace back in as I exit the gas station bathroom. No matter how I try, the fluff won\u2019t fit. I wind through the aisles and out the automatic doors into the cold winter night. My parents would kill me if they knew I was on the south side of Louisville, but this isn\u2019t my destination. Just a pit stop. The county south of here contains backcountry roads that are flat for several miles. Perfect for maxing out the speedometer.</p><p>Two college-age guys in jeans and nice winter coats chat as one pumps gas into a 2011 Corvette Coupe. She\u2019s impressive. Four hundred and thirty horses are compacted into that precious V-8 engine, but she\u2019s not as pretty as the older models. Most cars aren\u2019t.</p><p>On the opposite side of the pump, I insert my credit card and unscrew the gas cap. My baby only receives the best fuel. It may be more expensive, but it treats her engine right.</p><p>I suck in a breath, and the cold air feels good in my lungs. My stomach had settled when I left the country club and the nausea rolled away when I turned over the engine. I\u2019d made it through the speech with shaking hands and a trembling voice. Only a few people from school laughed.</p><p>When it was over, my mother cried and my father hugged me. That alone was worth the trips to the bathroom.</p><p>The guys stop talking and I glance over to see them staring at my baby.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d The driver nods at me.</p><p>Did he just talk to me? \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Uh...yep, he just talked to me. \u201cNothing.\u201d This is called conversation. Normal people do it all the time. Open your mouth and try to continue. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as any other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your \u2019Vette,\u201d I say and decide to test them. \u201cV-8?\u201d Of course it has a V-8. It\u2019s the standard engine for the 2011 \u2019Vette, but some guys have no idea what sweet cargo they own under the hood.</p><p>The owner nods. \u201c3LT. Got her last week. Nice Mustang. Is it your boyfriend\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Loaded question. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he says again. \u201cHave you ever raced her?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. It feels strange to talk to guys. I\u2019m the girl who hangs on the periphery. The other girls who attend the most expensive private school in the state don\u2019t want to discuss cars, and most guys get intimidated when I know more about their car than they do. When it comes to any other type of conversation, my tongue often grows paralyzed.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to race?\u201d the guy asks.</p><p>Our gas nozzles clink off at the same exact time and my heart flutters in my chest with a mixture of anxiety and adrenaline. I\u2019m not sure if I want to faint or laugh. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He inclines his head away from the safety of the freeway and down the four-lane road\u2014deeper into the south end. I\u2019ve heard rumors of illegal drag races, but I thought they were just that\u2014rumors. Stuff like that only happens in movies. \u201cAre you for real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any more real than where I\u2019d be taking you. Stick with us and we\u2019ll help you get a nice race.\u201d</p><p>I have four brothers, and one is the type that mothers warn their daughters against. In other words, I\u2019m not that naive, but to be honest, his proposal intrigues me. But I\u2019m also sure this is how horror movies begin.</p><p>Or the best action flicks on the face of the planet.</p><p>I lift the nozzle, place it back on the pump and scan the guy\u2019s car out of the corner of my eye. A University of Louisville student parking tag hangs on the rearview mirror along with a maroon-and-gold tassel. Only my school has those god-awful colors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But to be safe... \u201cWhere did you go to high school?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWorthington Private,\u201d he says with the arrogance most guys from my school use when saying the word private.</p><p>\u201cI go there.\u201d And I don\u2019t bother hiding my grin.</p><p>Neither do they. The car owner continues to be the spokesman for his duo. \u201cWhat year are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA junior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe graduated last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I say. Very cool. My brother would be a year behind him, but West has made it his business for people to love him. \u201cDo you know West Young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He brightens. I\u2019ve seen that look before with guys as they talk to other girls at school. \u2019Vette boy thinks he\u2019s so close to scoring. It\u2019s hysterical that he has that expression with me. \u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a guy. Do you two party together?\u201d</p><p>I laugh and I can\u2019t stop myself. \u201cNo. He\u2019s my brother.\u201d</p> <p>Their smiles melt quicker than a snow cone on a summer\u2019s afternoon. \u201cYou\u2019re his baby sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to be called Rachel. And you are?\u201d</p><p>He runs a hand over his face. \u201cGoing to get my ass kicked by your brothers. I saw the last guy that pissed off West Young and I\u2019m not interested in a nose job. Forget I said anything about racing, or that we even saw each other.\u201d</p><p>As he inches to his car, I spring over the small concrete barrier. I only meant to make sure the guy would keep his distance, not sprint for Alaska. \u201cWait. I want to race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brothers don\u2019t play around when it comes to you, and aren\u2019t you supposed to be sickly or something?\u201d</p><p>Stupid, stupid brothers and stupid, stupid rumors and stupid, stupid hospital visits when I stupid, stupidly was so panicked my freshman year I had to stay overnight twice. \u201cObviously the whole sick thing is wrong and if you don\u2019t take me to the drag race, I\u2019ll tell West about tonight.\u201d No, I won\u2019t, but I\u2019ll try bluffing.</p> <p>Owner Guy looks over at his friend hovering near the passenger door. His friend shrugs. \u201cI bet she\u2019ll keep her mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I blurt. \u201cKeep my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Owner Guy curses under his breath. \u201cOne race.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>I LEAN AGAINST MY CAR door and assess the group illegally loitering in the parking lot of the abandoned strip mall. Green, blue and red neon lights frame the bottom of different makes and models. A few of us puritans remain on the streets, refusing to decorate our cars like Christmas trees. The bass line of rap rattles frames and a couple drivers are brave enough to blare the screeching electric guitar of heavy metal.</p><p>Clouds cover the sky, leaving all of us in a dark pit. Close to a week after Christmas, the presents have been opened, the turkey dinners have been demolished, and mommies and daddies are either tucked in bed or sucked into a bottle of Jack. Time for the rats to hit the streets.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah!\u201d Eric Hall abandons two girls in short skirts and faux fur jackets to head for me. Most people underestimate the bleached-blond, skinny son of a bitch, but that mistake could prove lethal for your billfold and your health. On the streets of the south side, this nineteen-year-old is king. \u201cMerry belated Christmas, my brother. Did Santa bring you some good shit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it good.\u201d I accept his outstretched hand and the half hug.</p><p>Eric is who I came to see, and if I don\u2019t watch myself, I\u2019ll end up indebted to him. My goal in life is to be free of everyone\u2014foster care, school, social workers. Eric Hall may not be official, but he\u2019s an organization all his own with the street business he created. He even has \u201cemployees\u201d: guys with bats and tire irons that willingly beat the hell out of anyone who doesn\u2019t pay.</p><p>He motions to the two giggling girls. \u201cSanta brought me twins, and in the spirit of the season, I\u2019m willing to share. That is, if you drive for me tonight.\u201d</p><p>This is the reason why I\u2019m here. Noah and I need cash, and Eric can make that happen. If I play this right, I\u2019ll rake in money and stay free.</p><p>While sucking on a lollipop, the twin with black hair stares at me longer than her sister. \u201cHo, ho, ho,\u201d mumbles Eric.</p><p>My thoughts exactly and I turn my back to them. I have a bad track record with girls with black hair. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t street race.\u201d</p><p>Typically, I don\u2019t. Street racing can put my ass in jail and cost me the setup I have with Noah. I have no intention of being placed in juvie\u2014or worse, a group home. I race legally at The Motor Yard, but The Motor Yard is closed for the holidays. Tonight will be a onetime deal.</p><p>He leans in close as if what he\u2019s about to say is a secret. \u201cI\u2019ll give you twenty percent of what I make on top of the Christmas cheer. I\u2019m giving my other boys ten.\u201d</p><p>I consider twenty percent. Eric has never offered anyone such a commission, but if he\u2019s starting off high, maybe he\u2019ll go even higher. \u201cTwenty percent isn\u2019t going to cover my bail if I get arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you, my brother,\u201d says Eric. \u201cYou need speed, and I have the need for green. Say yes and you can race my recently acquired suped-up Honda Civic with two full tanks of nitro.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest. \u201cRecently acquired\u201d means some messed-up kid got in over his head on a bet and lost the papers to his car. He possibly also spent a couple nights in the hospital.</p><p>\u201cNitro and Honda,\u201d I slur as a curse. \u201cGive me American-made with a real live engine pushing horsepower.\u201d</p><p>Eric shakes his head. \u201cFYI\u2014James Dean died over sixty years ago.\u201d He pauses as realization snakes onto his face. \u201cYou aren\u2019t saying no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a onetime race, Eric. That is, if we can come to an understanding.\u201d</p><p>The sweet purring of an engine grabs not only my attention, but that of every hot-blooded, car-worshipping male in the lot. Jesus\u2014that\u2019s a 2005 Mustang GT. And unlike the other muscle cars parked on the strip, not a piece of her looks like it\u2019s seen the inside of a body shop.</p><p>A flood of male bodies surround the beautiful pony. I drop back and let the wolves have first crack. A car like this is here for one reason\u2014to race\u2014and any new piece of machinery has to pass Eric\u2019s inspection. Someone is going to have to approve the engine and I have no doubt I\u2019ll be the one caressing that soft underbelly.</p><p>The driver shuts down the engine, opens the door and a halo of sunshine slides out of the car and into the light of the only working streetlamp. Fuck me. God does exist and he sent an angel in a white Mustang to prove it.</p><p>Angels are small\u2014at least this one is. She stands barely a foot taller than the top of her car. Her long golden hair curls at the ends and she has a slender frame. Her leather-gloved hand grips the top of her door and she uses that door as a shield between herself and the street rats.</p><p>\u201cNice car.\u201d Like a vulture, Eric slowly circles her.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She glances at two guys exiting a Corvette. Those college boys belong here even less than she does. All three of them are easy prey.</p><p>Eric knows how to play people. He told me once he was voted most likely to succeed in high school. If bleeding people dry of their money and manipulating them into deals that only benefit him is a measure of success, then Eric met his high school buddies\u2019 expectations.</p><p>The angel tucks her hair behind her ear. \u201cIs this where I can drag race?\u201d</p><p>I wince internally at her words. Asking for anything on the streets is a cardinal sin. Asking nicely is basically serving your soul to the devil. God didn\u2019t send this angel to save me. He sent her as a sacrifice.</p><p>Several people laugh, and her eyes flicker over the crowd to pinpoint danger. I watch the two guys cowering near the Corvette. Come on, boys. Now\u2019s the time to step up and protect your girl.</p><p>Eric\u2019s eyes wander the length of her body. I agree, she\u2019s something to look at in the black fabric coat tailored to her curves, but everything about her screams high-priced and high-maintenance. Only the conceited girls at school wear clothes that nice. Eric gestures to the Corvette with his chin. \u201cAre those your boys?\u201d</p><p>Answer yes, angel. Tell him those rich boys are cocky serial killers with jealousy issues and will happily take down anyone who messes with their girl.</p><p>She clears her throat. \u201cNo. They told me about the race.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. A muscle in my jaw jerks. It\u2019s like the girl wants to be taken advantage of. If this were any other night, I\u2019d shove my way through the crowd, toss the girl back in her car and tell her to go home. But this isn\u2019t a normal night, and I need money. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t get involved. My neck tightens, and I pop it to the side to release the pressure.</p><p>A sly smile spreads across Eric\u2019s face. \u201cGood. Then we\u2019ll work out a deal. Open the hood and we\u2019ll get started. Isaiah, I need a little help.\u201d</p><p>Because no one messes with me, the crowd parts without my having to say a word. The angel\u2019s eyes widen and travel over my arms. What is she concerned about? That it\u2019s forty degrees and I\u2019m not wearing a coat? Or is she unnerved by the tattoos?</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter. In less than ten minutes, this girl will be out of my life.</p><p>I raise the hood and a rush of adrenaline hits me when I see the pure power and beauty before me. My eyes snap to hers. \u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019ve got in this?\u201d</p><p>Of course she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s some stupid rich girl who got her Daddy\u2019s leftovers for Christmas. She bites her lower lip before answering, \u201cFour point six-liter V-8.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl knows her shit,\u201d says Eric with a hint of respect. Too bad her knowledge of engines won\u2019t save her from him.</p><p>I place my hands on the frame of the car and bend over to get a closer view. \u201cIt\u2019s the goddamned original engine.\u201d Untouched as if it just rolled off the line. The engine\u2019s aluminum has a shine that only comes with reverence. Someone has taken care of this beauty.</p><p>The girl abandons her safe shield of the door and flitters to my side, waving me away. \u201cI\u2019d really rather that you not touch it.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, because I\u2019m trash that knows nothing about cars and my one stroke will destroy the engine. \u201cScared Daddy will know you lifted his car if he finds fingerprints?\u201d</p><p>She takes a possessive step, wedges herself between me and the car and looks me square in the eye. Her chin lifts in a kittenish cute-pissed way. \u201cNo one but me touches that engine.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of \u201cOhs\u201d and \u201cDamns\u201d rises from the crowd. One of my eyebrows slowly pushes toward my hairline. She called me out. If she were a guy, my fist would have already made impact, but girls deserve respect. She holds my stare for a record-breaking five seconds before losing her short burst of courage and lowering her head.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t touch my car,\u201d she says softly. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dart to mine for assurance, and I incline my head a centimeter. If this was my car, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else touching it, either. \u201cGo home,\u201d I mutter so only she can hear.</p><p>Lines wrinkle her perfect forehead, and Eric claps a hand on my back. \u201cWhat\u2019s the verdict?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The angel and I glance at each other. Come on, don\u2019t make me get involved more than I already am.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah?\u201d prompts Eric.</p><p>Damn. \u201cThe car has speed,\u201d I say loud enough for everyone to hear. Eric can make plenty off the unsuspecting owner, but he cashes in on side bets. \u201cBut it\u2019s the original engine. No modifications. No nitro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Eric asks her.</p> <p>\u201cHow much what?\u201d Holding her elbows, she folds into herself, as if becoming smaller will help the situation. Go home, angel. Take your beautiful pony and park her back in a safe garage in an upscale neighborhood where you both belong.</p><p>Eric chuckles deeply and his fingers flick the air. The movement reminds me of the way the legs of a spider gracefully work as it spins a web. \u201cHow much money are you putting down to race your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just race someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d The driver of the Corvette approaches us at a strange, hesitant yet eager pace. As if his feet are afraid to move, but the top half of his body gravitates toward us. \u201cDid you mention that she needs to make a bet?\u201d</p><p>The angel closes her eyes as she visibly relaxes and mumbles, \u201cFinally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Eric, mimicking the asshole\u2019s more formal tone. \u201cAre you willing to place that bet on her behalf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you the person that holds the bets?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Eric eyeballs Corvette Guy. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The guy becomes eager as he reaches for his back pocket. No. Not happening. I\u2019ve seen that front hundreds of times on guys at races\u2014the attitude that says he gets a hard-on from betting. This girl will lose the slip to her car by the end of the night if he gets involved.</p><p>Fuck. Just fuck. \u201cDo you have money?\u201d I glare at the angel.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says asshole Corvette owner.</p> <p>\u201cNot you, dickhead.\u201d I size him up and stare him down to keep him from opening his mouth again, then snap my gaze to her. \u201cYou. Do you have money?\u201d</p><p>Her golden eyebrows furrow together. Worry isn\u2019t an expression angels should wear. \u201cI have twenty dollars.\u201d</p><p>The crowd laughs and so does Eric. I pull out my wallet and slam my last twenty onto the hood of Eric\u2019s car. The laughter stops and the only sound filling the night is a pounding bass line and an electric guitar.</p><p>Eric slides a hand over his drawn face. \u201cWhatcha doing, my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalling my race.\u201d</p><p>Eric glances at the crowd that\u2019s completely absorbed in us. I\u2019m costing Eric money, and everyone here knows it. Assessing me, Eric takes a tripped-out gangster stride in my direction and leans in close. \u201cFill me in on what I\u2019m missing here.\u201d</p><p>I match his low tone. \u201cYou asked me to race for you. This is me accepting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRacing for me means I pick the races you drive and I negotiate the racing fees.\u201d</p> <p>I know that. Hell, everyone here except the angel and her fucked-up friends knows that, but I claim ignorance. \u201cMy bad. We never got to the negotiating part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue that,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cAre you trying to play me?\u201d</p><p>I assess the Corvette owner. Two feet distances him from the angel. He\u2019s either the worst boyfriend ever or she meant what she said earlier\u2014he just informed her about the races. Still, she shouldn\u2019t be in this position.</p><p>Regardless, this girl ruined whatever negotiating room I had. \u201cShe\u2019s got an \u201905 Mustang GT. Original engine. I\u2019m curious if my pieced-together Mustang can take hers. You get better betting when the cars are evenly matched. Let me do my shit and you do yours.\u201d</p><p>Eric stares at the angel before replying. \u201cFine, but the next time you decide you want a personal race, you talk to me first. Did you get a good look at that college boy? I could have made a couple grand off of him.\u201d</p><p>The boy wears slacks and a watch that costs more than I make in a year working at the auto shop. Eric shakes his head, clearly disgusted at the lost opportunity. \u201cYour commission is twenty percent tonight as a signing bonus, but because I like you, I\u2019ll give you fifteen every night after this. You\u2019ll drive my cars, not your own. American-made can\u2019t beat nitro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight is a onetime deal.\u201d</p><p>Eric snorts. \u201cSure it is.\u201d</p><p>He turns, and I remember the question I should have asked before I accepted the deal. That damn angel shot this whole night to hell. \u201cWhat happens if I lose?\u201d</p><p>From over his shoulder, Eric cracks his maniac smile. \u201cMy brother, I suggest you don\u2019t lose.\u201d He glances over to the GT and winks at me as if we\u2019re friends. \u201cYou should get over Beth and make a move on that chick. Mustang Girl owes you for saving her car.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Rachel</p><p>I GIVE THE GUY WHO introduced himself as Eric twenty dollars, and my legs hit the front bumper when I step back to keep a safe distance between us. He seriously creeps me out in a need-to-take-a-shower type of way.</p><p>The other one, the guy they call Isaiah, doesn\u2019t freak me out, though he should. Tattoos decorate his arms and two silver hoops hang in each ear. He turns from a black Mustang and pins me with his gaze. He reminds me of a high school version of Gavin\u2019s friend Kyle, an Army Ranger. Well, minus the piercings. Isaiah shares the same rugged, strong build, dark hair buzzed close to his scalp and a five o\u2019clock shadow lining his jaw. He\u2019s a muscular thick. Like a jaguar.</p><p>What I like about him is his eyes. They\u2019re serious. Too serious. And they\u2019re gray. Gray and mesmerizing.</p><p>Not that I should be looking straight into his eyes, because when I do, he has no problem staring back. I don\u2019t like people focusing on me, and I especially hate it when people I don\u2019t know stare at me.</p><p>Isaiah moves to my side and my heart skips a beat. Guys don\u2019t stand this close to me. Ever. With a touch more gentle than I could have imagined coming from a guy like him, he shuts the hood of my car with a simple snap. His eyes rove from me to the street leading to the freeway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not safe here,\u201d he says. His deep voice is like water running over a creek bed of smooth rocks. \u201cYou need to leave.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the different groups of people talking and laughing and betting. The way some of the guys ogle me propels me to cross my arms over my chest. Even with that small barrier of protection, I feel as if they still see parts of me no one has seen before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave after the race,\u201d I say, not sure if following West\u2019s friends to this place was officially the worst decision of my life or the best. My blood hums with anticipation. I want this race. I want to know what it feels like to push my car against another.</p><p>\u201cLast bets!\u201d calls Eric as he eyes me and Isaiah. \u201cMount up!\u201d</p><p>Isaiah inclines his head to his shoulder as if trying to release tension. \u201cDo you see the side street running parallel to the abandoned warehouse?\u201d</p><p>The two opposing parts of my personality, the girl who panics and the girl who loves speed, declare war and the result is a head rush. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull up to the first line of the white crosswalk. We\u2019ll race a quarter mile to the stop sign. Then you leave and never come back.\u201d</p><p>He pivots on his heel and returns to the black Mustang. Excitement ripples through me when I notice the body. That\u2019s a \u201994 GT. I\u2019m racing against a \u201994 GT! \u201cWhat if I win?\u201d I call.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d he replies. I snort and his shoulders stiffly roll back. Like a \u201994 Mustang GT could beat my baby.</p><p>The crowd moves. Some hop into their cars and drive toward the abandoned road. Others travel by foot. I slide behind the wheel and shut the door. As I turn the key, my lips curl up at the familiar rumble of the engine.</p><p>I love this car. I really, really do.</p><p>I shift into First and maneuver to the starting line. The moment I ease into place, the battle for control over my body kicks into gear. Surrounding the edges of the street, people my age shout and smoke and laugh and drink. I rub my hands onto my jeans. My car may be where I belong, but I don\u2019t belong here.</p><p>My throat tightens and I ignore the sensation. Nausea is not welcomed in my car. Nor are shallow breaths and sweaty palms and disoriented thoughts. This is my car\u2014my world.</p><p>Announcing its presence with an angry growl, the black Mustang joins me at the line. Isaiah and I glance over at the same time, and I immediately look away, busying myself with knobs and buttons. I take a deep breath and try to suppress the panic.</p><p>Logic. I need to focus on logic. Turn off the heater fan, the radio, the nonessentials. Don\u2019t rob the engine of power.</p><p>West\u2019s friends park their car next to Eric and hand him money. I wonder if they\u2019re betting on me or Isaiah. Losing confidence in myself, I think fatalistically that I\u2019d place my money on Isaiah.</p><p>Eric and West\u2019s friends stare at me.</p><p>In fact, they\u2019re all staring at me.</p><p>Every single person standing along the road has their eyes fixed on me.</p><p>My heart beats twice and I wait for the familiar heat to explode upon my face, but nothing happens. I grip the steering wheel tighter as one single thought blankets my brain: this is my car and this is my race.</p><p>Two thumps on the hood and my eyes narrow at a boy with blond dreads motioning for me to inch closer to the line. What the hell? Why do people think they can manhandle my baby? With the press of a button, I lower both of my windows. \u201cDon\u2019t touch my car!\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cDid you hear that, Isaiah? The rich bitch doesn\u2019t want me touching her car.\u201d</p><p>With a grumble, Isaiah\u2019s Mustang lurches forward then stops just short of hitting the guy. In front of Isaiah\u2019s fender, he holds his hands in the air toward Isaiah. \u201cYou need to smoke something to chill.\u201d</p><p>I move my car to mirror Isaiah\u2019s. My right hand strangles the stick shift as I place my foot on the clutch. Isaiah\u2019s car roars next to me as he stays in Neutral and hits the gas. My 300 horsepower with 320 pounds of torque against his 215 horsepower and 285 pounds of torque.</p><p>This race is mine.</p><p>Adrenaline hammers my bloodstream as I feel the power of my car begging to be unleashed. The guy with dreads throws both of his arms into the air. I\u2019ve never done anything like this before. I\u2019ve only built up to fast speeds, never taken off from them, but it can\u2019t be that difficult. Lift the clutch at the exact same time I press the gas while shoving the car into gear.</p><p>This is what my Mustang was made to do.</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s engine roars again and the sound vibrates between the layers of my skin and muscle. The guy with dreads looks at me once. Then at Isaiah. In a heartbeat, his arms rush down to the ground.</p><p>My right foot hits the gas, the other slips off the clutch. Isaiah\u2019s Mustang\u2019s front end rises into the air as I shift into First. His car lunges forward and I\u2019m preparing for the whiplash of speed when my car shudders once and stalls out into silence.</p><p>No.</p><p>This isn\u2019t happening.</p><p>No.</p><p>I took my foot off the clutch too quickly.</p><p>No.</p><p>I didn\u2019t gun the engine in time.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>I never had a shot.</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s already past the halfway point. I turn over the engine, ignore my instincts for a full-on start and focus on getting the car into gear. I\u2019m finishing this race, even though it\u2019s obvious who won. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 7</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR, I watch as the angel restarts her car and floors it. Seconds ago, I had my doubts about whether I\u2019d win, but my instincts were right on\u2014she didn\u2019t have the reaction needed to pull off a start at the flag. I won a whopping twenty dollars from the straight bet on this race, but I\u2019m hoping for at least a grand once Eric gives me my take from his winnings.</p><p>My lips turn up as I pass the stop sign. My piece of crap beat an \u201905 GT. That feat alone deserves a trip to the tattoo parlor. That is if I had money.</p> <p>I ease off the gas and check the angel\u2019s status. Damn, that car\u2019s fast. I slow to a stop and wait for her to join me. The crowd gathered at the quarter mile calls out smack. A huge part of me wants her to cruise past and head straight home. Girls like her shouldn\u2019t hear the words being tossed into the night. A small part of me wants her to stop so I can see her cute-pissed expression when she realizes that a street punk beat her and her expensive car.</p><p>The angel finally catches up and I lose the smirk as I examine her. The streetlamp above us creates a glow around the mess of hair angling her face. She shouldn\u2019t be here. In fact, there\u2019s nothing right about this situation.</p><p>My throat moves as I swallow and, suddenly, my skin feels too tight on my body. Instinct? A sixth sense? I learned early in life to never discount the sensation. The noise of the onlookers becomes a shallow buzz as I glance at my side mirrors for the oncoming danger.</p><p>That\u2019s when I see it\u2014a faint strobe of light. I ignore all other sounds and strain to hear the one that can ruin my world: a distant wail.</p><p>\u201cCops!\u201d I yell.</p> <p>Blue and red lights blaze in the distance. Chaos erupts as the bystanders scurry to their cars. Doors slam shut and anxious motors rumble to life. Feet pound against pavement as voices call for others to head into the dark alleys between the warehouses.</p><p>I shift my car into First and stomp on the gas. My tires squeal as I peel out. A curse leaves my mouth when I throw the car into Second. Eric has my money and collecting what I fully earned will be a lot more difficult without a crowd to verify the bets made.</p><p>No matter how fucking hard I try, I always come out on the bottom.</p><p>I check my mirrors to see the direction of the invasion. There\u2019re three ways out of this labyrinth of warehouses and the cops know one, maybe two, but the third will be a hell of a drive.</p><p>A solitary white barrier in the middle of the street causes me to hit the brakes. \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s still sitting there\u2014the angel\u2014like a damn sacrifice nailed to the ground. I yank on the steering wheel and one-eighty it back to where I started seconds before. What the hell is wrong with her?</p> <p>My driver\u2019s side mirror barely misses hers as I stop next to her open window. \u201cGet out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d Red flushes brightly on her cheeks, in stark contrast to the pale white skin surrounding her eyes. Eyes that are wide and wild with fear.</p><p>My grip on the steering wheel tightens. Fuck. Just fuck. Losing the cops in one car is hard enough. Having a tail will only complicate things, but I can\u2019t leave her. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Rachel</p><p>ISAIAH CIRCLES MY CAR AND speeds off the way he originally came. I chase after him and do my best to shift with arms and legs that no longer want to accept orders. The speedometer climbs in my race to not fall behind.</p><p>The police.</p><p>Air catches in my lungs and throat, causing me to choke. My brothers are going to murder me. Kill me. Crucify me. And never let this screwup go. My hand slips off the gearshift to press against the nausea eating at my stomach.</p> <p>My father will take away my car. My baby. He never would have bought it for me if he knew I had an addiction to speed.</p><p>And my mother...</p><p>How do I explain any of this? Why I\u2019m out past curfew? Why I\u2019m on the south side? Why I\u2019m drag racing? Even worse, how do I explain why I wanted to be drag racing?</p><p>Isaiah turns sharply to the left. His brake lights never appear. I reach for the gearshift and switch pedals in order to make the turn. My back wheels slide out from under me and both hands struggle with the wheel as I fight to keep the car from spinning into a Dumpster.</p><p>Claustrophobia consumes me as the buildings gradually close in, making the road narrower and almost impossible to navigate. Garbage covers the roadway, and my stomach sinks as I realize there\u2019s no way to avoid the debris. Isaiah runs over it and so must I.</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s lights flash off and I follow his lead. The glow of the full moon is the only pathetic light leading us. His Mustang pulls farther away from mine, and I shift into Fourth. We\u2019re going too fast. Too fast on a too-narrow road. I shudder as the wheels roll over trash and a clink from under my car makes me cringe. Did something hit the gas tank? The transmission?</p><p>My heart pounds out of my chest when my car becomes airborne through an intersection. From the corner of my eye, I spot police cars running parallel to us on a street much wider than ours. Sirens scream into the night and as my car hammers back into the ground, I wait for that sound to shriek from right behind me.</p><p>Darkness envelops me again and I drop gear as Isaiah takes a last-second right. He\u2019s too fast, which is impossible because my car is better than his. I shake my head as I understand the difference: he\u2019s a better driver. It\u2019s not hard to imagine. I\u2019m not good at anything.</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s car fishtails and I slam on my brakes to keep from crashing into his rear end. My breath leaves my body in a hiss. On either side of my car, metal warehouse walls threaten to scratch my side mirrors. He slows, and thanks to the dim security light hanging over a bay door, I see the reason for the reduced speed: shredded rubber spikes out from his front driver-side wheel. Isaiah destroyed the tire.</p><p>Crap. I\u2019m going to jail and my mother is going to freak. She\u2019ll cry and then she\u2019ll know I\u2019m nothing like the daughter she really loves\u2014that I\u2019m nothing like Colleen.</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s arm extends from his window, waving me on as he eases his car into a space between Dumpsters. I pull alongside of him and he hops out. \u201cTwo rights. One left. Then hit the freeway. Watch the cops. They\u2019re running on the streets to the left and right of us.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightens. To the left and the right? \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah places his hands on the top of my car and leans over so that his head is level with mine. The strong scent of dark spices tickles my nose and I inhale deeply. A brief calm washes through me and somehow I know Isaiah will get me out of this.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pressing hard to find the racers, meaning us. If they pull you over\u2014\u201d his eyes trail over my hair then over my clothes \u201c\u2014they\u2019ll probably let you go, but not if you\u2019re with me. Especially if you\u2019re with me. Go. Now.\u201d</p><p>I nod and stare at the road in front of me. Two rights. One left. And if I get caught, they\u2019ll probably let me go. I glance at Isaiah. He\u2019s touching my car and I don\u2019t even care. Which tells me I\u2019m either beyond freaked or I like him. I flex my hands, which are sweating on the steering wheel. I pick the first option. I\u2019m definitely freaking. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWalk.\u201d His silver hoops glint in the moonlight as he performs a half shrug. \u201cGo. I can take care of myself.\u201d Isaiah steps away from the car, taking the dark scent of calm with him.</p><p>I put the car into First, and a fresh wave of adrenaline floods my bloodstream when a cop car speeds across an intersection two warehouses ahead. Isaiah falls into the shadows with his back against the warehouse wall. His eyes travel back and forth down the alleyway. An hour ago, I never would have thought that someone like him would be my savior, but he is. What type of person would I be if I left my savior behind? \u201cI\u2019m not leaving without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d He rubs a hand over his shaved head. \u201cJust leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise you won\u2019t get caught. Promise you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>He freezes midrub and shoots me a chilling look. \u201cI won\u2019t rat you out.\u201d</p><p>Rat me out? My forehead scrunches. To who? A siren wails, the sound much closer than I\u2019d prefer. I blink rapidly as the answer dawns along with a sinking feeling. The police. Isaiah knows he\u2019s going to be caught. \u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m not worried about that. I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>He mumbles a word that begins with F and stalks toward me. \u201cI\u2019m driving.\u201d</p><p>Driving? No way. No one drives my car. \u201cI don\u2019t think...\u201d</p><p>Isaiah opens the door and stares me down with his hard gray eyes. \u201cPassenger side. Now.\u201d</p><p>Passenger side. Right now. On it. I slide over the console and grasp the side of the seat when Isaiah simultaneously shuts his door and guns the engine. I click my seat belt in place as he takes a sharp left. The speedometer continues to climb.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said two rights.\u201d</p><p>His restless eyes check the rearview mirror. \u201cThe cop we saw took that route. I\u2019m not interested in chasing him. Are you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, but I doubt he sees it. He keeps his eyes trained on the ever-constricting slender space. It\u2019s like we\u2019re not even on a road anymore, but a sidewalk. My stomach cramps. Holy freaking crap. This is a walkway. The deep sound of the engine pushing out revolutions increases until Isaiah shifts into Fourth. Oh, hell, I\u2019m gonna puke. We\u2019re doing sixty. \u201cSlow down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down?\u201d He smiles. I\u2019m seconds away from a full-on panic attack and the guy actually smiles. \u201cYour car can do over double what I\u2019m asking it. In fact, it was built to be let loose. You should try it sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do let it loose. Garbage can!\u201d I close my eyes and bite back a scream when the car swerves to the left. Breathe, Rachel, breathe. Going mental is not going to help this situation. \u201cI mean, slow down.\u201d I reopen my eyes only to wish I hadn\u2019t. Dumpster. Big Dumpster. Big freaking, going-to-wreck-my-car Dumpster. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it. You can\u2019t, you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t....\u201d</p><p>And he swings the car to the right and into an actual alleyway. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt her. Just don\u2019t hurt her. Okay?\u201d Tears prick my eyes and the breathing thing isn\u2019t working and everything feels out of control. \u201cShe\u2019s mine. This is mine. I don\u2019t have much that\u2019s mine. So you can\u2019t destroy her, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asks in the calmest, deepest tone I\u2019ve ever heard.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour name. I want your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d I squeak.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d he says with a long drawl. I glance over at him when he says nothing else. His eyes flicker between me and the road. \u201cI\u2019m Isaiah, and I swear I\u2019ll take care of you and your car.\u201d</p><p>Breathing becomes a little easier. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I smell it again, his scent. The calming aroma. The one that\u2019s become my new favorite. I take a deeper breath.</p><p>Isaiah drops gears and for the first time hits the brake. \u201cAs soon as I stop, get out.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have time to ask what he means. Isaiah slams the car into Park, hops out and punches buttons on a security keypad. I do what he said and rub my arms as he eases my car into the garage, turns her off and relocks the garage door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask.</p><p>We both jerk our heads to the right when a siren cries on the other side of the warehouse. Flashing blue lights reflect against the wall. Isaiah grabs my hand and leads me away from the police. \u201cI can\u2019t get busted here.\u201d</p><p>My heart stutters. He\u2019s holding my hand. A guy is holding my hand. Touching it. Like his fingers entwined with mine. I\u2019ve never held a guy\u2019s hand before and it feels good. So good. Warm. Strong. Awesome. And it would only be a million times better if the guy holding my hand liked me.</p><p>Or if I liked him.</p> <p>Isaiah and I step out onto a bustling sidewalk. Fear slams into my body, and if it weren\u2019t for his sturdy hand wrapped around mine, urging me forward, I would have stopped dead.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>Oh, holy hell with lettuce on top.</p><p>I\u2019m on the strip. This isn\u2019t the place you go when you\u2019re seventeen. No. This is the place you go when you\u2019re twenty-one. Or the place you go when you\u2019re pretending you\u2019re twenty-one. And in college. And want to get drunk. Or pretending to be in college. And want to get drunk. Or you own a motorcycle. And want to get drunk. Or you\u2019re a prostitute. And want to get drunk. Or you\u2019re a slimy guy. And want to get drunk.</p> <p>My brother West comes here.</p><p>But me? I don\u2019t.</p><p>Neon lights hang over bars and burly men guard the entrances. Long lines weave along the sidewalk as people wait for admittance. Guys loom over barely clothed girls. Most of the people on the sidewalks laugh. Some of them make out. All of them are sloshed.</p><p>Isaiah tugs on my hand, guiding me closer to him. Our arms touch and I shiver as if I was zapped by lightning.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods yet,\u201d he says. \u201cCop cars are everywhere.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head to the street and stop when Isaiah squeezes my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t look. We\u2019ve got to blend in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I say in a hushed voice. \u201cWe\u2019re not in our cars. How would they know?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah keeps his eyes straight ahead. \u201cI only said I wouldn\u2019t rat. I didn\u2019t say anything about anyone else.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dries out\u2014West\u2019s friends. Did they escape or are they telling the cops my phone number and address? Can this get any worse?</p><p>Isaiah lets go of my hand and in a blur, pushes my back against a cold brick wall. His body becomes a hot, thick blanket over mine. The fine hair on my neck stands on end and my eyes close at the sensation of his warm breath on the skin behind my ear.</p><p>I\u2019m absolutely terrified, but at the same time my body tingles with a weird anticipation.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s two cops walking the street,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>Peeking beyond his biceps, I see the two blue uniforms stalking in our direction. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d I barely breathe out.</p><p>His hands go to my waist\u2014my waist! And they feel so right. I like this closeness. Maybe I like it too much. A guy has never been this close to me. Never. And I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening, even if it is to keep from being arrested.</p> <p>My heart beats frantically. Isaiah is hot and scary and hot. Why on earth would a guy like him want to be anywhere near a girl like me?</p><p>It\u2019s the adrenaline rush. That\u2019s what it is. I like how he feels because I\u2019m still experiencing the adrenaline rush from Isaiah\u2019s NASCAR driving skills. His arm shifts, and I love how that movement causes his muscles to flex.</p><p>Stop it, Rachel. It\u2019s not real. Focus.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he whispers. \u201cIf you kiss me we\u2019ll blend in.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open as if to make a sound, but nothing comes out. How do I say the words...I don\u2019t know how to kiss.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>RACHEL\u2019S BODY STIFFENS AGAINST MINE. I\u2019ve scared her. Of course I have. I\u2019ve thrown an angel against a wall, into darkness, and asked her to do something unthinkable.</p><p>The area between my shoulder blades itches as if I\u2019ve got a bull\u2019s-eye painted on my back. The cops must be scanning us.</p><p>She places her soft hands on my bare forearms and whispers my name with an edge of panic. \u201cIsaiah, they\u2019re looking at us.\u201d</p><p>Girls like her never notice guys like me and damn me to hell for enjoying her touch and the sound of my name on her lips. I may be a lot of things, but naive isn\u2019t one of them. Her dependence on me is because she\u2019s terrified of the cops. \u201cTell me how close they are,\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d she breathes out.</p><p>\u201cAre they still looking at us?\u201d</p><p>She nods. Fuck.</p><p>Kissing would be better, but I won\u2019t drag her further into hell by forcing her to be physical with me. I lower my head away from hers and hover my lips near her neck. Rachel\u2019s chest moves as she sucks in air. God forgive me for scaring her. \u201cAngle your head to mine to hide your face,\u201d I whisper. \u201cIt\u2019ll just appear like we\u2019re hooking up.\u201d</p><p>She does, and her forehead brushes against my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says.</p><p>My eyebrows furrow. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor...for...messing this up. You would be safe if it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d I turn my head in her direction. Her face is centimeters from mine, and she looks up at me with wide, beautiful blue eyes. Above us, a security light flickers on, then off. I\u2019m wrong. They aren\u2019t blue. Those eyes are so dark they\u2019re violet. \u201cYou could have left me behind.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll never forget that. Never. Only one other person in my life would risk everything for me. That\u2019s Noah. Our bond is one forged through the blood of battles won and lost in the system. We understand each other. Get each other. Have each other\u2019s backs. We\u2019re surviving warriors.</p><p>But this girl...she owed me nothing. Yeah, I turned back for her, but when I did, I knew I would still make it out. Her scenario was different. When I blew a tire, Satan was breathing down our necks and she stood against the flame. Hell, without batting an eyelash, she\u2019s still standing in the inferno.</p><p>I owe her.</p><p>She lets out an unsteady breath. Her eyes fixate on the Brothers of the Arrow Knot tattooed on my left forearm then follow the flaming tail of the dragon that winds up my biceps and disappears from view at my short sleeve. I know what she sees: a punk.</p><p>Without moving her head, Rachel glances to the right and sucks in her lower lip. I\u2019ve seen roses the color of her lips. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone across the street.\u201d</p><p>The tension eases from my muscles. I slide my fingers through hers again and pull her in the opposite direction of the cops. We need to get inside so I don\u2019t have to keep tossing the girl against buildings. She deserves better than that. My apartment is close, but not close enough. Rachel and I need walls between us and the streets.</p><p>Rachel obviously said a prayer to her God, because a few feet down the sidewalk, beneath a neon sign, is our answer: a guy who owes me for fixing his car. The line into the club stretches beyond the plastic ropes and wraps around the building, but we won\u2019t have to wait.</p><p>Jerry lifts his chin in acknowledgment the moment he sees me. \u201cIsaiah, what\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not twenty-one,\u201d Rachel whispers. Neither am I, but we can hide here.</p><p>The rolls on the fat son of a bitch shake as he eyes me then Rachel. She fastens her other hand securely on my wrist and moves so that she\u2019s behind me. Good job, angel. Let him know that I\u2019m your man. At least you\u2019re a fast learner.</p><p>I rub my thumb over her smooth skin in approval, then stop. She doesn\u2019t need my approval. I\u2019m not her man, but, for now, I am her protector.</p><p>Two guys in the middle of the line shout, asking what the holdup is, and Jerry informs them where to shove their complaints. He lights a cigarette and inclines his head to the police scanner sitting on the small table next to the door. \u201cSomeone called in a street race and the cops are all over it. First solid tip they\u2019ve had in months. They\u2019re pulling people in left and right. Not part of that action, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it matter?\u201d</p><p>Jerry grins with the cigarette still dangling from his bottom lip. \u201cNo.\u201d He lifts the rope and takes a step to create a path. \u201cImpressed you got out.\u201d</p><p>With Rachel on my heels, we brush past Jerry. I pause in the door frame, half of me heated from the warmth of the club, the other half freezing from the night air. Jerry said the cops had a tip, not a report. A dangerous anger curls up my spine. \u201cDid you say someone informed?\u201d</p><p>He draws in smoke, then releases it. \u201cYeah. Tell Eric he\u2019s got a snitch.\u201d</p><p>A snitch. Fuck. Not what anyone needs. Eric\u2019s a mean asshole already, and he\u2019ll go insane if he thinks someone turned his business over to the police. A gentle tug on my hand coaxes my attention back to Rachel. \u201cIsaiah, let\u2019s get inside.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Inside.</p><p>The door closes behind me and I wait for Rachel to drop her hand. Instead, she inches closer to me when she surveys the narrow room. The chipped, worn wooden bar stretches the length of the left wall and in a nook on the opposite wall sits a stage.</p><p>The throb of an electric guitar playing Southern rock pulses against my skin. I place a hand on the nape of Rachel\u2019s neck and guide her through the thick crowd so we can find a booth in the back. Even if the cops come in, they\u2019ll give up before they maneuver past the groupies.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go first,\u201d she yells as I push her forward.</p><p>I lean down to say in her ear, \u201cAnd take a chance on some drunk asshole grabbing your ass? I\u2019m not interested in getting into a fight.\u201d</p><p>Her head whips back to see if I mean what I say. I nod for her to keep moving. A crowd this packed? They\u2019d also try to cop a second-base feel, but no need to tell her that. The music becomes muffled as we continue toward the back. She pauses to take a seat at a table in the wide-open. I shake my head and point to the corner booth. \u201cThat one.\u201d</p><p>Preferring a view of the room, I motion for her to claim the space across from me as I settle on the bench against the wall. Rachel takes off her coat, sags in her seat and hides her face in her hands. \u201cMy parents are going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why her statement hits me the way it does, yet it happens. For the first time in months, I laugh.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Rachel</p><p>I SPLIT MY FINGERS APART and peek at Isaiah between the gaps. He\u2019s laughing at me. It\u2019s not loud or boisterous. At first his eyes hold a bit of humor, but slowly the humor dies and his laughter becomes bitter.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he says while scanning the crowd.</p><p>Feeling very self-conscious, I sit straighter and shove a hand through my hair. I\u2019m probably a mess. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an entire task force against street racing hunting us and you\u2019re concerned about getting grounded.\u201d Isaiah leans forward. His arms cover most of his side of the table, plus a little of mine. I place my hands in my lap and move my feet as he sprawls his legs underneath. The funny thing is, he appears relaxed, but his eyes keep searching the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cTrouble,\u201d he says without glancing at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I swallow and grab a paper napkin out of the dispenser on the table. My heart beats faster as I let the events of the past hour register. \u201cAre the police here?\u201d</p><p>He says nothing and my hands start to sweat. I smooth the napkin flat, then begin to fold. \u201cShould we leave? Or stay?\u201d Panic stabs my chest. My car. Oh, crap, my baby. \u201cWhat about my car? Is it safe? Will they find it? Will someone else take it? And your car? What do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d Isaiah says in a low, calm tone that makes me meet his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re good. We lost the police. Your car\u2019s in the garage where I work. And someone has to be damn desperate to jack my piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>My muscles still, including my heart. Did he just say... \u201cYour car is not a piece of shit.\u201d I flinch at using the word shit and the right side of his mouth turns up in response. I stare at the napkin my hands continually fold and refold. I don\u2019t like that he reads me so clearly.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s...she\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d I stammer. \u201cYour car, I mean. My favorite is the \u201904 Cobra.\u201d</p><p>My parents bought me and my siblings the car of our choice for our sixteenth birthday. I asked for a 2004 Mustang Cobra, the last year that model was made, but Dad didn\u2019t think I\u2019d notice the difference and got me my baby. I love my baby, but I knew the difference, even though I pretended I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a \u201994 GT up close before,\u201d I continue, hoping for a spark of conversation.</p><p>No response. His eyes become restless again even as his body stays completely motionless. Fold. Refold. Fold until the napkin\u2019s so thick I can\u2019t fold anymore. My fingers release the napkin and the folds tumble out. I smooth out the paper and begin again.</p><p>I don\u2019t know this guy and he doesn\u2019t know me. He hates me. He has to. I\u2019m weighing him down, and I\u2019ve noticed how he\u2019s looked at my clothes, my diamond earrings, the gold bracelets on my wrist, my car. He can tell I\u2019m not from this part of town\u2014that I don\u2019t belong. Not that I belong at home, either. But he told me before the race to leave. I didn\u2019t. And now I\u2019m a burden he\u2019s dragging around.</p> <p>My lower lip trembles and I suck it in. First that horrid speech. Now this. I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m seconds from a panic attack and I want to go home.</p><p>I try to breathe deeply. It\u2019s what my middle school therapist told me to do. That and to think of other things. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk about your car that way.\u201d And I don\u2019t know why I can\u2019t stop talking, but his car is a gem, he should know it, and cars are the only things that don\u2019t make me cry. \u201cIt won Motor Trend\u2019s car of the year in \u201994.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he responds in a bored voice.</p><p>\u201cThat was the year they put the pony emblem back on the car\u2019s grill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has a V-8.\u201d And I\u2019ve run out of good things to say about the car. \u201cBut what I don\u2019t get is how Ford was okay with producing the thirtieth anniversary car using the same engine as the \u201993 and losing 10 horses off the power.\u201d And I\u2019m rambling. I press my mouth shut and sigh heavily. Not that he\u2019s listening anyhow. As I said before, guys don\u2019t like girls who talk cars.</p> <p>He surprises me by answering. \u201cI don\u2019t have the original motor in my car.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snap to his. \u201cFor real? I know it probably sounds like I\u2019m talking bad about your car, but really, the engine rocked. I mean, add a different air filter, or pulleys, or, I don\u2019t know, some other mods and bam, your pony\u2019s flying.\u201d</p><p>Lines bunch between his eyebrows as they move closer together. He opens his mouth. Closes it. Tugs on the bottom loop of his right ear and relaxes back into his seat. \u201cHow do you know so much about cars?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI read.\u201d</p><p>His eyes mock me with amusement. \u201cYou read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read,\u201d I repeat. A moment of silence stretches between us, and the band begins to play Jason Aldean. \u201cThank you for coming back for me.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s his turn to shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Thanks for not leaving me back at the warehouses. I owe you.\u201d</p><p>I owe you.</p> <p>A tiny whisper of wings tickles the inside of my chest as he says those last three words. Or maybe it\u2019s the way his gray eyes become charcoal as if he\u2019s swearing a pact. Either way, the moment is heavy, and I can\u2019t help but look away in response. \u201cAnyone would have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could have gotten away clean without me. I can\u2019t be arrested, Rachel, and I owe you big.\u201d</p><p>The cuticles on my fingernails have never been so interesting. \u201cSo I\u2019m assuming I also owe you, since you came back for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says automatically. \u201cYou sacrificed a hell of a lot more for me.\u201d</p><p>I bite the inside of my lip to conceal the smile forming. All right, so this is cool. Very cool. I\u2019m well aware that I\u2019m barely seventeen and in a bar because I\u2019m hiding from the police, and the guy across from me is my opposite in more ways than I can calculate, but I can\u2019t help but feel like a princess who has a knight pledging his loyalty.</p><p>And because this moment is so intense, and there\u2019s no way it\u2019s as powerful for him as it is for me, I clear my throat and force a change of subject. \u201cSo, does that make us friends?\u201d</p><p>Okay, last-minute game changer. I know, I know, any self-respecting girl would have let the subject drop, but I need to know. I don\u2019t have that many friends, and I like the idea of having a friend who isn\u2019t one of my brothers.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He taps his finger against the table. \u201cI guess it does.\u201d</p><p>Cool. I release the napkin and turn my head toward the stage. The drummer wraps up \u201cMy Kinda Party\u201d and the guitar player rips right into \u201cSweet Home Alabama.\u201d \u201cI like this song.\u201d</p><p>The people crowded near the stage throw their arms in the air and sway with the beat that vibrates not only the floor beneath me, but also the table and my seat. So much so that my entire body trembles with the sound. There\u2019s an energy surrounding the stage that illuminates the once-dark bar. What was moments ago brooding and overwhelming now appears light and hypnotic.</p><p>\u201cDo you dance?\u201d I ask, with a smile on my face that even surprises me.</p><p>Isaiah stares at me for a second, appearing as still as a statue. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a fan of crowds.\u201d</p><p>No one would call me a crowd enthusiast, yet I glance over my shoulder again at the swarm of bodies rocking their fists in time with the lead singer as everyone belts out the chorus. \u201cIt looks like fun. As long as you\u2019re not onstage no one would be watching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many variables in a crowd that size.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m lost. \u201cWhat do you mean by variables?\u201d</p><p>As if searching for patience, he releases a small frustrated breath. \u201cDrunk assholes looking for a fight. Sober assholes looking for a fight. Pickpockets. I can\u2019t control what goes on out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would mess with you.\u201d And my stomach automatically sinks. That was a crappy thing to say. \u201cNot that you\u2019re scary or anything.\u201d</p><p>He raises an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say quickly, and grow hesitant as I spy a playful spark in his eyes. Even though every sane part of me screams to drop the conversation, I decide to follow the small amount of amusement in his face. \u201cNow if you drove a Camaro, I\u2019d have to reevaluate the situation.\u201d</p><p>And he laughs. Not the heavy laughter from before. It\u2019s a great laugh. A deep laugh. One that makes my lips lift. Isaiah, the guy who an hour ago carried himself like a jungle predator, now has the content aura of a lazy cat bathing in the sun.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cJust turned seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSenior?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m a junior at Worthington Private.\u201d</p><p>Reminding me he\u2019s still lethal, a hint of the panther reappears when he pops his neck to the right. Guess he\u2019s heard of my school.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>Air catches in my throat and I choke, coughing into my hand like I\u2019m dying of the plague. Not that I thought he was ancient, but how he acts, talks and moves...I thought he had to be older than... \u201cYou\u2019re seventeen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>For a brief, startling few seconds, his forever-roaming gray eyes meet mine and I see it\u2014seventeen. Within them is a small shred of the same vulnerability that consumes and strangles me. Just as fast as it appears, it\u2019s gone, and he\u2019s searching once again for some unseen threat.</p><p>I like that we\u2019re the same age, at least physically. Something tells me his soul is much older.</p><p>The lack of conversation creates awkwardness so I force us forward. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a...\u201d Is he going to make me draw every answer out of him? I motion with my hand in the air for him to continue. \u201cThis is where you fill in the blank with your year in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSenior,\u201d he finishes. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t go to Worthington Private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d I let the sarcasm flow. \u201cI thought for sure you had run for student body president last year.\u201d</p><p>He scratches the stubble on his jaw and I swear he\u2019s covering a grin. \u201cYou\u2019re too brave for your own good.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen. Did he call me brave?</p><p>Isaiah leans in my direction, laces his hands together on the table and does that thing again where he stares straight into my eyes. I want to break the hypnotic trance, but it\u2019s honestly as if his gaze imprisons me. \u201cWas one of those college boys with you your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>A slight bit of heat creeps onto my cheeks. Not from panic this time, but from...from... \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>And the answer makes me shy, and the shyness gives me the power to look away. To think he called me brave. I wish I was brave. I wish that every person I\u2019d meet would think of me that way. Not as the coward I really am.</p><p>\u201cGood. Those guys were losers. Stay clear of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sort of bossy.\u201d I\u2019m teasing. Isaiah\u2019s way too serious to find time to be bossy. But the main point is that he\u2019s totally unlike my brothers, who demand everything from me by plain bullying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bossy,\u201d he says and I get a little thrill that he\u2019s playing along.</p><p>This isn\u2019t me. In my day-to-day life, I could never find the courage to talk to guys, much less tease them, yet here I am. \u201cNo, I have four older brothers. Technically three older brothers and a twin, but Ethan claims he\u2019s older by a minute. The point is I know what bossy is\u2014and you\u2019re it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of it as strongly encouraged tips for survival.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, and the dark shadow on his face moves as he cracks a grin. Even though this isn\u2019t his first smile tonight, it\u2019s the first one to touch his eyes, and from the wary way the smile flickers on and off his face, it appears to surprise him. Maybe he\u2019s out of practice, which is a shame. He has a drop-dead stunning smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t want the game to end. I don\u2019t want this rush to end. I want to stay right here in this booth for as long as possible. \u201cSo, my first tip is to stay away from my brother\u2019s friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your first tip is to stay the hell away from street racing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo become better aware of your surroundings. You focus too much on what\u2019s in front of you and not what\u2019s lurking on the sides. Avoiding your brother\u2019s friends is the third. And if your brother\u2019s anything like them, avoid him, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re up to four tips. Any more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay them on me.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s only then that I realize that we\u2019re both angled across the table. We\u2019re mirrors of each other and we are shockingly close. So close our foreheads almost touch and I can feel the heat radiating from his body. Our heads tilt in the same direction and, in the center of the table, our hands are a breath\u2019s distance from a caress.</p><p>The energy and the warmth surrounding us...butterflies swarm in my stomach and take flight. This isn\u2019t me. None of it. I\u2019m not the girl who hangs in a bar. I\u2019m not the girl who is comfortable talking to guys. And I\u2019m sure not the girl who leans over the table to be close to anyone.</p> <p>Yet I\u2019m doing all those things and I\u2019m loving every freaking second.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>A LOCK OF HER LONG golden bangs falls forward and highlights the sexy curve of her chin and her thick eyelashes. I\u2019ll do anything to keep her talking as the sound of her voice creates a contact high. Rachel\u2019s this brilliant flame blazing in the darkness. I don\u2019t know what the hell is going on, but I\u2019ve always been the kind of guy that likes a fire.</p><p>She asked for another tip for survival. Like at the end of any good buzz, I experience the first drop into reality. If I were honest with her, I\u2019d inform her the next tip is to stay clear of me. A punk who could never fit into the world of a girl who wears the type of jewelry she does, drives her car or goes to her school. A punk raised by the system, by the streets.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d she says with a dazzling smile, \u201care you going to tell me the next tip, or what?\u201d</p> <p>Be a man. Tell her you\u2019re bad news.</p><p>Or take her home and enjoy the night.</p><p>I could, but maybe I shouldn\u2019t. While I have undressed her several times in my head, each time slowly and methodically, and imagined that blond hair sprawled out over the pillow in my bed, the girl\u2019s naive.</p><p>But naive about the streets doesn\u2019t mean naive about the world. Beautiful girl, confident enough to tease me...she\u2019s probably played her share of games. After all, she was the one looking for the drag race\u2014a thrill.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, don\u2019t get?\u201d Rachel cocks her head to the side like a puppy and she\u2019s so damn cute that I have to fight the urge not to smile at her again. This playful thing going on between us, it\u2019s new, and I\u2019m not a fan of new.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you out on the streets tonight?\u201d I ignore her question by asking one of my own.</p><p>\u201cThe race tonight was a fluke. I typically just drive around.\u201d Rachel fiddles with one of the solid gold bracelets on her wrist. I could probably pay rent for a year if I pawned that. A shadow descends onto her face and steals some of her light, which is a fucking shame. \u201cBeing in my car, letting her run...it\u2019s one of the few moments I feel like me.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel withdraws onto the bench, looking a little lost. I don\u2019t care for how her outside reflects my inside. It\u2019s too much of a reminder of the things I try to shove away.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow.\u201d Rachel mock-rolls her eyes, downplaying her statement. \u201cI drive for fun. I know it sounds stupid, but driving my car\u2014it\u2019s just me being me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound stupid.\u201d It\u2019s how I feel when I\u2019m behind the wheel of my Mustang.</p><p>\u201cReally? You really don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A shy smile tugs at Rachel\u2019s lips and while she keeps her focus on the bracelet, she flips it around with a renewed energy. I kick back and rest against the seat. What the fuck is wrong with me that I like that I made a rich girl feel better? Damn, I need a beer.</p><p>A crash of glass rips my attention away from Rachel and jolts me to my feet. A mad flurry of arms and fists beating the hell out of each other causes my instincts to flare. The two college guys going at it collapse onto a nearby table. In fight-or-flight mode, I gear up to fight. Rachel, on the other hand, does neither\u2014she freezes.</p><p>\u201cStand up on the bench!\u201d I yell at her. \u201cGet against the wall.\u201d</p><p>The guys roll to their feet and before Rachel can process my words, the asshole with blond hair rams into the dark-haired guy struggling to stay upright. Jumping onto her bench, I haul Rachel to her feet, press her against the wall and shield her with my body.</p><p>Wrapped in a fighting hug, the two guys slam into our table. It flips and the edge breezes against my arm and leg. I lean to the right to keep it from tearing into my thigh. The table completes a one-eighty and lands where I sat moments before.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she whispers. In the same exact instant, wetness spreads down my T-shirt and a drop of liquid trickles along my arm.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Standing on the bench beside us, a man taller than Rachel holds an empty beer bottle tipped in our direction. \u201cGot caught watching the fight.\u201d</p><p>He moves to touch her, possibly to wipe off the beer, but the ice forming in my eyes must have stopped the son of a bitch. That\u2019s right, place your hand back at your side. Touch her and die.</p><p>The sounds of the scuffle disappear.</p><p>\u201cFight\u2019s over!\u201d The easily two-hundred-and-fifty-pound bouncer dares anyone to tell him differently as he straightens and clenches his fists. Two other bouncers return from the front. They\u2019ve already thrown the troublemakers outside.</p><p>The bitter scent of alcohol burns my nose and as I glance at Rachel, I close my eyes. Beer soaks her hair and shirt. Shit. \u201cRachel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get into a car like this.\u201d The edge of panic is clear in her voice. \u201cIf I get pulled over, the police will think that I drink and I don\u2019t drink. Ever.\u201d</p><p>I take a step back as she shakes her arms like a kitten coming in from a rainstorm. A few drops of beer cascade off her onto the bench. I run my hand over my head. If this were any other girl, I\u2019d give her a hard time for being overly dramatic, but the way the color drains from her face and how her body begins to tremble tells me she\u2019s not being dramatic. She\u2019s terrified.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if I make it home? What am I going to do?\u201d She shakes her arms again. Her voice rises higher in pitch and the words tumble out on top of each other. \u201cI can\u2019t go home like this. I can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel.\u201d I need her to focus. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>Her body goes still as her eyes immediately dart over me. \u201cAre you okay? They were closer to you. Oh, my God, Isaiah. Do you need to go to the hospital? Oh, hell, you\u2019re bleeding. You\u2019re bleeding! Oh, my God!\u201d Her hand flutters near her mouth.</p><p>I follow her intense gaze to my elbow. Fuck me, I am bleeding. The edge of the table must have struck me. I turn my elbow up and use the hem of my T-shirt to remove the small pool of blood. \u201cIt\u2019s barely a scrape.\u201d</p><p>Soft fingers grip my wrist and forearm. My eyes shoot to hers, but she\u2019s too busy fussing over the noncut to notice how her caress is turning me inside out. In a good way. In a strange way. In a way I haven\u2019t felt since...Beth.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s blood.\u201d Her chest expands and deflates faster than it should, and she sucks in too much air. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt. We need to make sure you\u2019re okay. Can you move your arm? Is it broken? Oh, crap, what if you broke your arm?\u201d</p><p>A bead of liquid appears at her hairline and slides down her face. When it hits her cheek, I can\u2019t tell if the drop is from the beer or from her eyes. My hand moves, the need to touch her more powerful than thought. Before I know what I\u2019m doing, I wipe away the wetness.</p><p>Aw, dammit, no. I don\u2019t want to be the fucking guy that wipes anything away. I tried this merry-go-round with Beth once, and the moment she saw a life other than what she had known with me, she threw me into the gears of the ride. Pull back, man. Pull back.</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019ve done for me already tonight,\u201d Rachel continues, \u201cand what you just did for me, and you\u2019re bleeding!\u201d</p><p>Take the hand away. Take the fucking hand away from her face.</p><p>But I don\u2019t. Instead, my thumb moves again to capture one more drop. It\u2019s as if she doesn\u2019t notice my touch, which is annoying because my fingers are memorizing every curve of her face.</p><p>In one long, run-on sentence, she continues, \u201cIt could be a hairline fracture or a sprain and you\u2019re bleeding and I don\u2019t know how deep a cut should be in order to need stitches. Oh, hell, oh, hell. Staples. What if you need...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaples! That can be serious!\u201d</p><p>The honest to God worry she feels is over me. Something solid in my chest shifts, and it shoots a warning tremor though my system. Whatever the fuck is going on inside me has to stop. \u201cRachel!\u201d</p><p>Her violet eyes, full of hysteria, finally meet mine. Since entering the system, I\u2019ve never met anyone who cared enough about me to freak out over a cut. She\u2019s not just worried. She\u2019s panicked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Take a deep breath before you pass out.\u201d I\u2019m kidding, and I\u2019m not.</p><p>She nods as if I\u2019m dispensing quality advice, and she does exactly what I said. Her small amount of cleavage moves up with the inhale, then slowly down. Rachel performs the exercise one more time, her hands tightening around my arm as if she\u2019s leaning on me for support.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good now. I am. Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Because I want to, I keep my hand against her face. Rachel\u2019s cheek is warm and smooth. I like touching her and, even more, I like her touching me. This angel has blown my every idea of what a rich, private school girl should be. No drinking, no boyfriend, likes fast cars\u2014hell, knows fast cars\u2014and is concerned over me.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I mumble. Another drop of beer descends from her hairline and I move my thumb against her skin a third time in order to catch it.</p><p>She blinks. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I lower my hand and snag her fingers. I should take her straight to the garage and send her home, but, because I\u2019m a bad son of a bitch, I won\u2019t. The dickhead who spilled his beer has given me an excuse to enjoy her for a little while longer. \u201cLet\u2019s get you cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>I jump off the bench and keep her hand to \u201csteady\u201d her as she also hops to the floor. The bar\u2019s employees hastily pick up the broken tables and chairs. The bouncer with the dustpan and broom looks at us. \u201cYou two okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, can we go out the alley entrance?\u201d</p><p>Giving me the green light, he tilts his head toward the back door. Knowing I no longer have a reason to hold Rachel\u2019s hand, I let her go and snatch her jacket off the broken table. But I do place my hand on the small of her back to lead her out into the alley. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As we step outside, I regretfully remove my hand, then lift her jacket to my nose. The jacket has a sweet scent that reminds me of the ocean. It\u2019s a bittersweet smell for me. I shove the memories away and focus. I can\u2019t detect the scent of beer, but then again, we\u2019re covered in it. \u201cI know it\u2019s cold, but if you can keep your jacket off, it would be better. It\u2019ll keep the smell of beer off of it.\u201d</p><p>From behind us, a garbage can clanks against the asphalt. I quicken my pace and Rachel has to double her steps in order to match my stride. I should slow, but I don\u2019t like the idea of being in dark alleys with her. Too many things there go bump and jackass crazy in the night.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the police?\u201d she asks. \u201cWon\u2019t they still be looking for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live a few blocks over. They\u2019ve probably caught everyone they think they can catch, but I still want to stay off the main streets.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to your house?\u201d I hear the hint of relief.</p><p>\u201cApartment.\u201d She probably lives in a huge house full of nice shit. I lower my head. Damn. Suddenly, this no longer seems like a good idea. She\u2019ll be shocked when she sees my place. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Are you sure you want to take me there? It\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>Noah won\u2019t care. \u201cWhat time is your curfew?\u201d Because girls like her have those.</p><p>The only sound besides the honking coming from the main street behind us is of our shoes hitting the pavement. She\u2019s silent, which, from the short time I\u2019ve known her, strikes me as odd.</p> <p>We turn into another alley and I breathe easier when I spot the fire escape to my unit. Home sweet fucking home. Hopefully before Noah left, he emptied the rat traps.</p><p>Rachel\u2019s arm brushes against mine, and I flinch from how cold it is. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there. You can take a shower if you want to wash off the beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen,\u201d she says in a small voice. \u201cMy curfew is ten.\u201d</p><p>I hike one eyebrow, and when I glance at her she quickly looks away.</p><p>\u201cLittle late, aren\u2019t you?\u201d By two and a half hours.</p><p>She twists a strand of her hair around her finger. \u201cMy twin brother and I have an agreement. We cover for each other when\u2014well, when we want to be out past curfew.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t get her. Not at all. \u201cSo you don\u2019t drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She releases her hair and raises her chin. Guess I should keep my mouth shut about how I do drink and how I\u2019ve been known to get high.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>The chin drops. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The answer may bother her, but it\u2019s the best news I\u2019ve heard in days. Though it shouldn\u2019t matter, I don\u2019t like the idea of another guy kissing her. My stomach twists with the thought of the hundreds of guys that must be following her around, waiting for her to take notice.</p><p>I rub at my neck. What the hell is wrong with my thought process tonight? She\u2019s not my problem. What\u2019s between us is just for tonight. \u201cAnd you like to drag race.\u201d</p><p>Becoming more thoughtful, her forehead relaxes. \u201cNot really. That sort of sucked. Drag racing is a lot different than when I push my car to see how fast it can go. I do like to let her loose. She can hit sixty in five seconds.\u201d</p><p>Her excited eyes seek validation. She hesitates, and I nod for her to continue. As if my approval rocks her world, an extra spring appears in her step.</p> <p>\u201cIt was cool, though. I had this huge adrenaline rush when I heard your car take off. But I got sort of frazzled. Like my arms and my legs started working separately. And by the time I got my act together, you were done.\u201d</p><p>We reach the old Victorian house my landlord left to rot once he converted it into four separate apartments. I hold the front door open for her, then lead the way up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWatch the third and sixth steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where you live?\u201d Rachel wraps her hands around her stomach and peers over the railing to the floor below. The light over the stairwell flickers.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I unlock the dead bolt then switch keys to unlock the actual knob. \u201cIt\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s home.\u201d The hint of pride in my voice surprises me.</p><p>I open the door, switch on the light and motion for Rachel to enter. With her arms still clinging to her sides, she slowly shuffles into the apartment. As soon as she\u2019s in, I shut the door, rebolt and head to the bathroom. She\u2019ll want to clean up and the water takes at least five minutes before it\u2019ll be lukewarm.</p><p>The water pipes groan as I spin the knobs. \u201cI\u2019ll put a towel out for you. You\u2019ll need to crouch to use the shower\u2014or maybe not. You\u2019re shorter than me,\u201d I say over the water pouring into the old claw-foot tub. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one of my shirts to change into. Your jeans should be fine.\u201d</p><p>I walk out and go for the bedroom to find her a T-shirt, but stop short. Rachel stares at the dead bolt on the door with one hand still clutching her stomach, the other pressed to her throat.</p><p>\u201cRachel? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are...where are your parents?\u201d</p><p>The air rushes out of my lungs, and I scratch the stubble on my chin to hide the horror. I\u2019m so used to people knowing...or assuming...or flat out accepting that people where I come from don\u2019t have them...or if they did have them, that they weren\u2019t any good. \u201cI\u2019m a foster kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says slowly, obviously not okay. \u201cSo what about them? Your foster parents. Where are they?\u201d</p><p>I shift my footing and clear my throat as I come to terms with the situation I\u2019ve put her in without knowing. All right, I knew. Fifteen minutes ago I contemplated bringing her home for the night. But that was before I realized how pure she was. Still, I brought her here, even if my intentions changed.</p><p>I force out the words. \u201cI moved out of my foster parents\u2019 home a couple of months ago with my best friend, Noah.\u201d</p><p>She glances quickly around the room, searching for the threat. \u201cAnd he is\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut her off. \u201cA good guy who\u2019s probably staying the night with his girl. He goes to college and so does Echo. She came from a real good neighborhood, like you. Middleheights, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in Summitview,\u201d she says softly while staring at the empty rat trap in the middle of the kitchen floor.</p><p>Of course she does. That\u2019s the damn Beverly Hills of Louisville. It\u2019s gated. With guards. And she\u2019s probably wondering if I\u2019ve got body parts in the freezer.</p><p>The shower continues to pound against the porcelain tub and the damn insomniac old lady downstairs begins to play Elvis. Except this time, it\u2019s one of his depressing songs.</p><p>\u201cRachel, I swear, my intentions are good. I won\u2019t touch you. I\u2019ll stay on the other side of the room from you at all times.\u201d And why the fuck should she believe me? \u201cYou looked so damned scared at the thought of going home smelling like beer. I don\u2019t know what shit you\u2019ve got going down in your house, but I\u2019ve been around enough to understand. Look, honestly, I\u2019m just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>She nibbles on a fingernail. \u201cSo you still go to high school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Eastwick.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Her leather boots squeak as she adjusts her weight. The water still crashes against the tub. Elvis sings about rain.</p><p>\u201cEastwick\u2019s a good school.\u201d She drops her hand and peeks at me from below her eyelashes.</p><p>Finally, I\u2019m getting someplace. \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d No need to mention that my foster parents live right on the line between Eastwick, a good high school, and the one school in the county that is a step above a detention center. \u201cI\u2019m in the Automotive Accelerated Program. I\u2019ve been the highest-ranking student in the program for the past two years.\u201d</p><p>Past four actually, but I never tell people that I received that honor, let alone how many years I\u2019ve earned it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about that program. I read the brochures when I was in eighth grade, but...\u201d Rachel puts a hand over her mouth as if to prevent herself from saying anymore. \u201cAnyhow, do you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d I did it, I talked her down. The relief running through me is like a chaser after a shot. I push away the instincts that I\u2019m playing with an unpinned grenade. People like her, nights like this, they don\u2019t come around, and I just want to hold on to this flame for a little longer. Guys like me, we don\u2019t make girls like her smile. \u201cIt\u2019s where I learned to rebuild the engine in my Mustang.\u201d</p><p>A spark ignites in her violet eyes. \u201cYou rebuilt your own engine? That\u2019s sweet. I\u2019ve played with the idea of adding some modifications to mine to increase the horsepower.\u201d</p><p>I flinch at the thought. \u201cWhy? Your car is a perfect virgin. Never touched and in great shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I haven\u2019t, but between you and me\u2014\u201d Rachel leans her body in my direction as if she\u2019s revealing a highly guarded secret \u201c\u2014I really wanted an \u201904 Cobra.\u201d</p><p>That damn smile she\u2019s already brought out in me once tonight crosses my face again. \u201cAn \u201904 Cobra. That would be...\u201d And I steal one of her words. \u201cSweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It would, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Rachel rocks onto her toes and slides her long, beer-drenched hair behind her ear. \u201cSo, do you have a hair dryer?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Rachel</p><p>I PLACE THE DRYER ON the sink and run my fingers through my hair again. There\u2014dry and officially beer-free. The edge of Isaiah\u2019s dark blue T-shirt ends an inch short of my knees and I catch my silly smile in the blurry mirror. I\u2019m wearing a guy\u2019s shirt. Too freaking awesome.</p><p>I lower my chin to smell the shirt again. I want to wear this forever, without washing it. His dark, spicy aroma consumes the material. I peek at him from the corner of my eye, wondering if he spots me catching a whiff or if he knows how addicting his scent is to girls.</p><p>A knot forms in my throat. Does he have many girls?</p><p>As promised, Isaiah sits on the kitchen counter on the other side of the room from me. He leans forward, his legs lazily stretched apart with his joined hands resting between them as he watches me.</p><p>He\u2019s observant. Overly so. I think he could tell me more about my actions than I could. A huge part of me doesn\u2019t like it. In order for me to fit in at home, people can\u2019t notice me. It\u2019s harder to pull off being someone else when you\u2019re the center of attention. But I\u2019m not home. I\u2019m miles from there. And here, in this room, I like how Isaiah looks at me as if I\u2019m the only girl in the world.</p><p>Or like an antelope he\u2019s going to pounce on.</p><p>My heart patters faster at the thought of him pouncing on me.</p><p>I fiddle with my hair for a few more seconds to buy time. What do you say to a totally hot guy when you\u2019re alone with him in his apartment?</p><p>Alone.</p><p>A thrill of tickles moves in the center of my chest, and I think of the way his strong hand caressed my face at the bar. The tickles explode into my bloodstream as an adrenaline rush and I release a long steady breath to keep myself calm.</p><p>I really, really want him to touch me again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One more tuck behind the ear, and I step out of the bathroom. \u201cThanks for the shirt.\u201d I fuss with the ends again.</p><p>\u201cIt looks good on you,\u201d he says as his eyes settle on the curve of my hips. Holy hell, it got hot in here.</p><p>My jacket lies over the arm of the couch. I walk over to it and fish my cell phone out of the pocket. One a.m. and one text from Ethan: where r u?</p><p>Isaiah shifts uneasily as I text Ethan back. I glance at him while typing a reply. He changed while I was in the shower, switching a black T-shirt with wording for another with different wording. Isaiah keeps surveying the apartment, and I finally get it. He\u2019s wondering how to keep a safe distance from me.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay so far from me,\u201d I say. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lying by typing still driving, I push Send and put the phone back in my coat pocket. \u201cIf you were going to hurt me you wouldn\u2019t have saved me from that fight or brought me home to use your shower. You also wouldn\u2019t be standing all the way over there, so I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s just bad for both of us,\u201d he mumbles and then speaks to me in a normal tone. \u201cAre you in trouble at home?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNot yet. My brother is good at distracting my parents.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean,\u201d he says. \u201cYou were seriously trippin\u2019 when you thought you had to go home with beer on you. Your parents\u2014how hard-core are they?\u201d</p><p>I swipe at my forehead as if there\u2019s a stray hair to be restyled and feel naked when I don\u2019t find one. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah hops off the counter, and I\u2019m mesmerized by the fluid way he walks: a sleek predator on the move. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I get it. Sometimes things are...\u201d And he\u2019s near me. Close enough that I have to lift my head to see his face. \u201cRough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...ah...it\u2019s...\u201d I love his eyes, and my skin tingles with the thought of his hands on me again. \u201cAh...\u201d What were we discussing? Parents. Right. My parents. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>Complicated as in I\u2019ve been failing miserably at replacing my mother\u2019s dead daughter. My parents and oldest brothers have told me enough Colleen stories for me to be well aware that she would never have broken curfew, participated in a drag race or been alone with a guy.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he says so slowly that the word sounds unbelievably sexy. \u201cComplicated. So.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAre you ready for me to take you back to your car?\u201d</p> <p>Yes. No. Yes. Maybe not. Oh, crap. It\u2019s ending too soon and I don\u2019t want it to. I\u2019m not good at this. I\u2019m not smooth or good with words or good with guys or good with people. I\u2019m silent. I blend in. How do I make this not go away?</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d I whisper and immediately stare at my shoes. Of all the things I could have said, that shouldn\u2019t have been it. I. Am. An. Idiot.</p><p>A gentle tug on my hair sends goose bumps raining down my arms. I close my eyes and relish the sweet brush of his knuckles against my neck as he flips my hair over my shoulder. \u201cRachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I say so softly he may not have heard me.</p><p>His hand caresses the sensitive spot right below my chin, and with a gentle pressure, Isaiah raises my head until I look into those warm silver eyes. \u201cI like you, too.\u201d</p><p>The right side of my mouth quirks and a spring of hope bubbles up inside me. He likes me. A really hot, really awesome guy likes me.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say a little breathlessly. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d More than good. It\u2019s great.</p><p>Chapter 13</p> <p>Isaiah</p><p>I GLANCE DOWN AT RACHEL\u2019S mouth and feel the urge to press my lips to hers. I\u2019m a fucking jackass. I suck in a breath through my mouth to avoid her scent and step back, dropping my arm to my side. I did not bring her back here to have sex.</p><p>Hell yes, she\u2019s hot and my mind won\u2019t stop replaying the twelve different ways I could possibly do her, but she\u2019s not that type of girl.</p><p>I rub my eyes. I haven\u2019t touched anyone since Beth, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have the right to come on to a girl that\u2019s too good for me. I slump onto the couch and notice how Rachel shifts uncomfortably. Dammit, she shouldn\u2019t have to put up with my mood swings.</p><p>\u201cI do like you,\u201d I repeat. \u201cThere\u2019s only one other person who\u2019d stick their neck out for me. If there\u2019s anything I can do for you, name it and it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>The chaos in my mind begins to clear as I start to understand why I\u2019m acting like a maniac. Beth\u2019s been the only girl to mean something to me, and I generally don\u2019t give a shit about people. I\u2019m confusing lust and friendship and creating crap that\u2019s not there. Fuck yeah, I\u2019m attracted to Rachel, but the emotions going on...it\u2019s because I owe her.</p><p>\u201cWill you let me clean up your cut?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I check out the small hunk of skin missing from my forearm, having forgotten about the wound. \u201cIt\u2019s all good. I\u2019ve had worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you said that if you could do something for me, you would, so let me do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If I can do something for you. Not have you do something for me.\u201d</p><p>Rachel clasps her hands behind her back like she doesn\u2019t know what else to do with them. \u201cI want to do this, and I\u2019d like you to let me.\u201d</p><p>Keeping my hands off her and being respectful are going to be hard as hell if she continues to put herself within arm\u2019s reach. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>I stand and spend more time than needed rifling through the cabinet beneath the sink to find Band-Aids, rubbing alcohol and a towel. Echo bought this stuff for us when we first moved in, and neither Noah nor I have touched it since. As I set it all on the floor in front of the couch, Rachel motions for me to sit and when I do, she joins me with her knee grazing my thigh.</p><p>Fuck me, she\u2019s warm.</p><p>Rachel opens the box of Band-Aids and searches through it as if she\u2019s an actual doctor picking a scalpel. The scent of the ocean enters my nose and my jeans tighten. \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about modifying your car, I\u2019ll do it if you get the parts. No cost.\u201d</p><p>That can be the way I repay this debt and stop thinking about letting my fingers drift up her shirt to caress what would probably be the softest skin on the planet.</p><p>She peels back the paper to reveal the Band-Aid and balances it on her knee. \u201cIf I do make modifications, I think I\u2019d like to do them myself. I don\u2019t get to work with cars that often, and I sort of get a rush when I do.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve met my twin. One glance at her slim figure and I erase that thought. I wouldn\u2019t be attracted to someone I was related to. \u201cThen think about what you want and I\u2019ll score you the parts.\u201d I\u2019ve got favors I\u2019d call in for her.</p><p>\u201cHold out your arm,\u201d she instructs and though it makes me feel like a damn fool, I obey.</p><p>Rachel pours alcohol onto the towel and begins to dab it on the cut. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take you up on that, but I\u2019m not sure I want to mess with her. My real dream is to find an old Mustang and supe her up. Kind of like what you\u2019re doing with yours. That would be awesome.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the slight sting on my arm, I turn my head to survey her. This girl is too good to be true. \u201cThen I\u2019ll help you with that.\u201d</p><p>Rachel holds the towel to my skin. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you.\u201d</p><p>Her nose wrinkles as if she\u2019s thinking something she believes is not worth saying. I have to keep myself from asking what.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d she asks. \u201cBecause sometimes I blow on my cuts when I put alcohol on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019m a wuss. I would have thought the alcohol would sting. You\u2019re missing the top layer of skin.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she places the towel on the floor, takes the plastic off the Band-Aid and presses it to my skin. I haven\u2019t worn one of these since I was five. Earlier tonight, everything felt hopeless after I talked to Noah, but being around her erases bad thoughts.</p><p>Rachel raises her head and her forehead scrunches. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Under the dim lighting, parts of her hair shine and I crave to run my fingers through it. Fuck it. Once she goes home, she\u2019ll never come back. If Beth taught me anything, it\u2019s to grab hold of what\u2019s in front of me while I can. \u201cWhat would you do if I kissed you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Rachel</p><p>MY MOUTH FALLS OPEN, AND only when it starts to get dry do I close it. What would I do if he kissed me? Go into shock? Have multiple seizures? Jump up and down? I take in a shaky breath. Isaiah called me brave so I rush out the words. \u201cKiss you back?\u201d</p><p>His gray eyes soften as if I gave an acceptable answer, but then he studies my face with a sober expression. \u201cHow many boyfriends have you had?\u201d</p><p>My entire body sags, and I lace my fingers together, unlace them and lace them again. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d His hand covers mine to halt my serial lacing. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you. I\u2019m...trying to understand you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to answer. I like the idea of him thinking of me as brave, as the girl who teases him in a bar. I don\u2019t want him to see me as I really am\u2014the tongue-twisted \u2019fraidy cat who\u2019s never dated a guy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what the answer is,\u201d he prods. \u201cBut I need to know.\u201d</p><p>There is no way I can admit this and meet his eyes, so I focus on our combined hands. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>I take a quick peek and Isaiah nods once, as if he already knew what I would say. He raises his hand to my face again and I allow the touch. His fingers slide along my jawline and the warmth of his caresses radiates past my skin and into my bloodstream. Pleasing goose bumps rise on my neck.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll come back sometime?\u201d he asks. \u201cAnd let me help you with your car?\u201d</p><p>My ears ring with the staccato thrum, thrum, thrum of my heart. Holy crap, I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it work. I swear.\u201d The words tumble out of my mouth without thought. That\u2019s not true. Actually, they tumble out with a lot of thought of how my parents won\u2019t approve, of how my brothers will kill Isaiah, then possibly kill me. But in this moment, I don\u2019t care what any of them think.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you,\u201d Isaiah says.</p><p>A rush of terror and excitement floods my body. \u201cIsaiah, I\u2019ve never...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Oh, God, his voice is dark and smooth and hypnotic.</p><p>I suck in air and sort of clumsily move my head so he knows this is what I want. \u201cWhat do I do? I mean, how do I...\u201d</p><p>And he doesn\u2019t let me finish. Isaiah lazily yet deliberately tilts his head as he stares into my eyes. My entire body hums and a fuzzy sensation fills my head, making it hard to focus. My mouth opens then closes. And as he slowly bends down, my tongue quickly licks my dry lips.</p><p>I hope I\u2019m doing this right. I want to do this right.</p><p>Isaiah slips his hand from my chin to cradle my head. His fingers tunnel through my hair, making the back of my neck tingle with anticipation as the pad of his thumb whispers gently against my cheek. His lips hover right next to mine and his warm breath heats my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The blood pounds so wildly in my veins that he has to sense the vibration. There\u2019s a magnetic pull taking over the small distance between our lips. An energy I can\u2019t resist. My head inclines opposite his and the moment I close my eyes, his mouth brushes mine.</p><p>Soft. Warm. Gentle. His lips move slowly, exerting pressure. And I feel like I can\u2019t breathe, yet like I\u2019m flying. The pressure ends, but his mouth stays near mine. His hand grips my waist and my spine gives at the shockingly right pleasure of his touch.</p><p>Isaiah senses my weakness and his hand snakes its way around my waist, his strong arm holds me up. And he explores again. A little pressure on my lower lip. A little pressure on the top. And then I remember that I\u2019m supposed to kiss him back.</p><p>Nerves send small shock waves through my chest, and my hand trembles as I raise it to his shoulders. I press both my lips into his lower one right as my fingers caress the side of his neck. Isaiah shivers. In a good way, I think.</p> <p>I open my mouth to ask when his lips move fast against mine, sucking in my lower one, causing warmth and excitement to explode in my body, the aftermath of that divine encounter melting every piece of me.</p><p>I moan, and Isaiah\u2019s arm tightens, bringing my body closer to his. My lips maneuver against his in response. A yes to his pulling me closer. A yes to his lips taking in mine. A yes to the fact that he allows me to perform the same succulent kiss on him.</p><p>I can\u2019t help it. I permit the tip of my tongue to barely brush his lower lip. Isaiah curls my hair into his fist and I love how my touch affects him, affects me. Wrapping my other arm around his neck, I lose all sense of independence with his sweet taste.</p><p>I like this. I like this a lot.</p><p>Isaiah takes over again and kisses me gently once more. Twice. The third time a little longer. And then his lips let me go.</p> <p>Chapter 15</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>RACHEL SMILES.</p><p>It\u2019s a beautiful smile. One that brightens the rat-infested attic room. No one has ever smiled like that at me. No one. Everything inside me twists with the need to keep her close.</p><p>I should be pissed. Who knows if I\u2019ll ever see the money from Eric. Who knows if Noah and I will lose the lease, sending me back into the system. Right now, I don\u2019t fucking care. I\u2019m touching an angel.</p><p>My spine prickles as the window near the fire escape groans. My grip on Rachel tightens, and I bring her up with me as I stand. A leg pokes through the widening gap, and I shove Rachel behind me. Every instinct screams to protect her, to fight. I automatically widen my stance and hold my arms out at my sides, willing to take whatever bullet is coming our way, willing to run right into the bastard the moment he\u2019s through.</p> <p>With half of his body in, Noah halts in the window frame. His muscles tense as he warily sizes me up. \u201cRough night, bro?\u201d</p><p>I lower my arms. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fucking door, man.\u201d</p><p>Noah shuts the window and attempts to lock it, only to curse as he remembers that the latch is still broken. \u201cForgot my key at Echo\u2019s. Your car\u2019s not out there so I assumed you weren\u2019t home.\u201d</p><p>He walks to the bedroom and stops as his gaze shifts to what I\u2019m assuming is Rachel. \u201cMy bad.\u201d Noah pivots on his heel and heads for the door.</p><p>\u201cNoah, wait.\u201d Locking my arm around her shoulder, I bring Rachel to my side. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d He reaches for the doorknob with one hand and rubs his eyes with the other. \u201cI forgot something in my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d I glance at the clock. It\u2019s after one. He\u2019s been pulling morning shifts at his job and will need to be awake in a few hours. The guy\u2019s wiped with black circles under his eyes, but has my back because he thinks I\u2019m trying to score. \u201cI was going to walk Rachel to her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d He jacks his thumb in the direction of the stairwell.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t sweat it. Rachel\u2014Noah. Noah, this is Rachel.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows slowly rise so that they disappear beneath his hair. He and I, we don\u2019t introduce each other to the girls we bring home. In the past, sometimes the one-nighters became clingy and neither one of us wanted the other dealing with that situation. Of course, Noah\u2019s not like that anymore. Now that he has Echo.</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes sway between me and her. \u201cS\u2019up, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she says as if wondering if her response is correct. Rachel leans closer to me and I stroke her shoulder in an act of comfort and in the hopes Noah sees that Rachel is more than a fuck.</p><p>\u201cI think I left my bracelets in the bathroom.\u201d Like a small bird in flight, Rachel flits across the room and abruptly closes the bathroom door behind her. Drywall drops from the ceiling and scatters across the kitchen floor.</p><p>Noah\u2019s mouth tugs up. \u201cGuess that means we\u2019re losing our security deposit.\u201d</p><p>I spread my arms out and half whisper, half yell, \u201cWhat the hell? She\u2019s not a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever said she was.\u201d He crosses the room and opens the fridge. \u201cWant a beer?\u201d</p><p>Sure. Why don\u2019t I go ahead and light a joint while I\u2019m at it? I follow him and place my hand on the open door of the fridge to get his attention while still whispering. \u201cI\u2019m serious. She\u2019s not like that. Treat her with some respect.\u201d</p><p>Noah twists off the top of an MGD and surveys me while he swallows. \u201cI thought I was treating you both with respect.\u201d He also lowers his voice when I gesture at the bathroom to indicate I don\u2019t need her overhearing this conversation. \u201cI tried to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made her think she was a one-night stand.\u201d I slam the refrigerator door shut.</p><p>\u201cExcuse the shit out of me. I thought she was.\u201d He points his beer at me. \u201cYou\u2019re not dating. The last girl you touched was Beth.\u201d</p><p>My fists ball at the mention of her name, and Noah waves me off. \u201cAnd don\u2019t start on that shit. She\u2019s gone, she\u2019s happy and she ain\u2019t coming back. And, yeah, I still talk to her because she\u2019s the closest thing I\u2019ve got to a sister, so I can say her damned name if I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d I say as a warning.</p><p>\u201cBeth,\u201d he tauntingly whispers. \u201cBeth, Beth, Beth, Beth, Beth. If you\u2019re going to take a swing at me, bro, do it, because I\u2019m damn tired of walking on eggshells because of that girl.\u201d</p><p>My heart rips open again with every acknowledgment of her existence. He needs to stop and he needs to stop now. Especially with Rachel here. I like her and I don\u2019t need Noah ruining it with her by reminding me of a past that will never change. \u201cYou\u2019re a cranky son of a bitch when you\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><p>The tension between us drains when Noah chuckles and swigs the beer. I\u2019m not good at much, but I\u2019m good at deflecting. He kneads his eyes with his fists again and releases a long breath. \u201cLook, I walk in at 1:00 a.m. to find you holding a pretty girl wearing your shirt.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. I overreacted. \u201cNoah,\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>\u201cDo I sound like I\u2019m done talking? It looked like you were hooking up so I assumed you were hooking up. My apologies. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m the asshole. It\u2019s done so get the fuck over it. As for making her feel like a one-night stand, last time I checked, saying \u2018s\u2019up\u2019 doesn\u2019t translate to \u2018thanks for banging my best friend.\u2019 And do you want to tell me why the hell I\u2019m whispering in my own apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I like her.\u201d</p><p>Noah blinks because words like that don\u2019t come easily from me. He tilts up the bottle, finishes the rest and places the empty container on the counter. \u201cThat changes things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a friend,\u201d I add quickly but then realize friends don\u2019t kiss. Shit, I\u2019ve messed this up.</p><p>The door to the bathroom opens and we both stare at Rachel. She plays with the gold bracelets on her wrist. \u201cSorry it took so long. My bracelets fell and rolled behind the sink and...it took a bit to get them out.\u201d</p><p>Even Noah visibly cringes at the thought of anyone putting their hand in the two-inch gap behind the sink. \u201cYou should have called me,\u201d I say. \u201cI would have gotten them.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze switches between me and Noah. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I got them. So\u2014\u201d she rocks on her toes \u201c\u2014are you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s roll.\u201d</p><p>Rachel gathers her coat from the couch and pauses when Noah says her name. Damn, Noah, don\u2019t screw this up.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d he repeats, obviously searching for something good to say. \u201cIt was nice to meet you. You should come back. Meet my girl, Echo. We\u2019ll hang out or some shit like that.\u201d</p><p>Or some shit like that. I want to slam his head and my own into the wall.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She has that what-the-hell look people get when they watch reality TV. \u201cIt was nice to meet you, too.\u201d</p><p>When her back\u2019s to us both, I mouth at Noah, Or some shit like that?</p><p>He mouths back, I\u2019m trying.</p><p>I unbolt the door and when she steps into the hallway, I whisper to him, \u201cReal elegant, man. And the girls thought you were fucking smooth.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughs. \u201cI am smooth, bro. But now I\u2019m only smooth with Echo.\u201d</p><p>Right before I shut the door, I flip Noah off. His laughter rings through the hallway.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs, Rachel waits for me to open the door. I\u2019ve never seen a girl wait like that before or known a girl who\u2019d make the assumption that a guy would open it for her. Rachel was probably raised to expect guys to open doors, and she\u2019s probably around enough guys who were taught to do it.</p><p>I like that she waits, and I like opening it for her. When I was a kid, I preferred the guys my mom dated who did crazy stuff like that.</p><p>The cold air clings to my bare arms as we walk out onto the sidewalk. The temperature has dropped dramatically since we first met at the drag race. A moment that feels like lifetimes ago.</p><p>Rachel shivers and places her hands in her coat pockets, leaving me unsure of what to do. Is she cold and I should put my arm around her shoulder, or is she telling me to stay clear? The muscles tighten in my neck and I shake my head to clear the chaos. Get a grip, man. How can I be confused over a girl?</p><p>\u201cYour roommate seems nice,\u201d she says with forced lightness.</p><p>Her attempt to make us okay rattles me\u2014in a good way. I can\u2019t think of many people who have ever tried to make things work with me. \u201cNoah\u2019s great, but he was off tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure it was weird to see a girl in his apartment.\u201d</p><p>I pull at my bottom earring. I\u2019ve been with other girls. The ones who were interested in being with the guy with the tattoos and earrings for a night. I\u2019ve never minded being used. But with Rachel, there\u2019s a softness that hits her eyes when she looks in my direction, and it\u2019s messing with me.</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019m sorry I was there so late,\u201d she continues. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to think badly of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...ah...\u201d Didn\u2019t pick up that he thought you were a one-night stand? \u201cWeren\u2019t scared of Noah?\u201d</p><p>Rachel sort of laughs, \u201cNo.\u201d She pauses. \u201cShould I be? He seemed friendly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s cool. You bolted into the bathroom and...\u201d</p><p>She dips her head, and as we pass a streetlight, I catch the red invading her cheeks. \u201cSorry about that. I did forget my bracelets and I did drop them, but it was weird, you know, meeting someone at 1:00 a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Weirder than that? She was there at one in the morning and I hadn\u2019t slept with her. I shove my hands into my jeans pockets and silently curse myself.</p><p>I glance at Rachel, and she quickly averts her eyes when I spot her spying on me. What the fuck does she see when she looks at me? If she saw what was inside, she\u2019d be screaming. The outside is modest projection.</p> <p>Rachel can\u2019t like me because she doesn\u2019t know me. The real me. For Rachel, life is still sunshine, rainbows and pink fucking fuzzy unicorns. I\u2019m nothing but darkness, clouds and rats.</p><p>I should never have kissed her or brought her home. She deserves better than the brokenness inside me. I\u2019ll hold on to tonight. Burn the memory of the way she\u2019s looked at me into my mind because that\u2019s as close as I\u2019ll ever get to something like this again. Besides, if she saw me in daylight, away from the filth that I live in, she\u2019d change her mind.</p><p>Just like Beth did the moment she left town.</p><p>Faster than I would have preferred, we reach the parking lot of the auto shop.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your car?\u201d she asks as I enter the security code.</p> <p>The motor whines as the garage door lifts. \u201cI\u2019ll head over and fix the tire now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want help? I\u2019m pretty crafty with a jack and a tire iron.\u201d</p><p>I turn to tell her no and stop when I see her face. I swear, she glows. Her eyes shine like stars, and her smile radiates with a light all its own. My throat swells. I don\u2019t want to give her up. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want you getting into trouble at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, you are bossy.\u201d She finally takes her hands out of her pockets and nudges my biceps with one delicate finger.</p><p>My heart stutters with her caress, and as she drops her arm, I quickly reach out and snake my fingers through hers. So close to letting her go, I shouldn\u2019t touch her, but in my defense, she touched me first. \u201cNot bossy. Concerned. Truth, Rachel, I want to know if you feel safe going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Ethan would have texted me if there were problems. Mom and Dad probably haven\u2019t even come home for the night.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah. I knew all about guardians who stayed out late to party. I guess having money changes nothing in the realm of shitty parenting. \u201cTell me your brothers protect you.\u201d Because if not, I\u2019d have to meet them in a dark alley sometime and school them on how to treat their sister.</p><p>\u201cMore like they\u2019re overprotective.\u201d</p><p>I savor the feel of the smooth skin of her hand. No girl I have ever touched has had hands this soft. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>Rachel releases a frustrated sigh. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m starting to think I misjudged you. You sound annoyingly like my brothers.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right on one thing: she has misjudged me, but not in the way she thinks. \u201cGood. I\u2019m all for overprotection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle, and the sound makes her smile. I\u2019m going to miss that smile. Tell her it\u2019s over, asshole. Tell her that you come from two different worlds and that it would never work. Tell her that kiss meant more to you than she could ever imagine. Tell her that you\u2019ll dream about her and think about her, but that\u2019s where it ends.</p><p>The color drains from her face and her hand goes limp in mine. Did she figure out I\u2019m bad news on her own? She heads for her car. \u201cDo you have my keys?\u201d</p> <p>I fish them out of my pocket and toss them to her. With the click of a button, the car unlocks and she opens the passenger door. She keeps her back to me for a second then turns with a piece of paper in her hand. \u201cHere\u2019s my number. I almost forgot to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>I swallow as I stare at the number. Tell her. Just fucking tell her. \u201cRachel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call, right?\u201d And the small amount of hurt in her voice stabs my heart.</p><p>I envelop Rachel in my arms and cup her head to my chest. She smells good. Like the ocean. Like her jacket. I try to memorize the feel of her body against mine: all soft and warm and curves. The paper in her hand crinkles as she links one arm, then another around my waist. Leaning into me, she lets out a contented sigh and I close my eyes with the sound.</p><p>Ten seconds. I\u2019ll keep her for ten more seconds.</p><p>I want to keep her.</p><p>Two.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Four.</p><p>Maybe she can see past what I am. We don\u2019t have to be more. We can be friends.</p><p>Seven.</p><p>I can fix this.</p><p>Nine.</p><p>I can make anything work.</p><p>Ten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call.\u201d</p><p>With bright eyes, she shoves the number into my hand. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>I nod, and without another word, Rachel slips into the driver\u2019s seat, turns over the engine and glides her Mustang out of the auto shop. Grasping my lifeline to her, I watch as her red taillights fade into the distance.</p><p>I smile, then groan as I inhale.</p><p>I can recognize three girls by their scent. Tonight I learned that Rachel smells like the ocean. Beth reminded me of crushed roses. And this girl\u2014wild honey. I may not see her, but she\u2019s there. Every ounce of happiness flees with the realization that my life can\u2019t be changed. \u201cWhat do you want, Abby?\u201d</p><p>The shadow of a slim figure ghosts its way toward me from the side of the shop. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard that you found a new plaything.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She steps into the streetlight, brushing her long, dark brown hair over the shoulder of her tightly fitted hoodie. \u201cWhy so testy, Isaiah? She seemed cute. Spunky. I like cute and spunky. I had a bunny like that once, one of those large fluffy ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem like the bunny type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Her dark eyes wickedly flash over me. \u201cHence the word once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I repeat, glancing at the nonexistent watch on my arm. \u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>Abby and I have a weird friendship, which is odd since Abby doesn\u2019t do relationships. The sarcastic curve of her lips indicates that, in this moment, she\u2019s temporarily placed our friendship on the back burner. \u201cMy, my. We are emotional tonight. But to answer your question, I was on my way to your apartment because we have business to take care of, and I decided to stall our plans when I saw cute and spunky.\u201d</p><p>She pauses, waiting for me to fill her in on Rachel. The only answer she receives is the buzzing from the overhead streetlight. \u201cSo does this mean you\u2019re finally over Beth?\u201d</p><p>If Abby were acting as my friend, I might tell her. But life for Abby, especially here recently, is all about business. Even though she\u2019s only on the verge of turning seventeen. \u201cCut to the chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are no fun,\u201d she says as she reaches into the back pocket of her practically painted-on jeans and pulls out a wad of cash. \u201cI saw Eric tonight. Well, I hid Eric tonight.\u201d</p><p>That catches my attention. \u201cYou hate Eric.\u201d And Eric hates her. Their \u201cbusinesses\u201d often collide on the streets.</p><p>\u201cI like the idea of Eric owing me a favor.\u201d Figures. Abby is always working an angle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>Like a five-year-old on a playground, Abby grabs on to the metal utility pole with her outstretched hand and walks in a slow circle. \u201cWe had time to kill so we chatted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou chatted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sticks her tongue out at me. \u201cI\u2019m capable of conversation at times. You know, will U of K make it to the final four this year, will the original Guns N\u2019 Roses ever get back together, will I graduate from high school, and what people we know in common. Guess who came up in our chat?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and fake an innocent expression. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>She scrunches her pixie face. \u201cSmart guys make me so hot, but unfortunately, you do nothing for me. I\u2019ve known you too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby,\u201d I say with a bit of impatience. \u201cAre we gonna wrap this up or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric said he owed you, so I volunteered to play mule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was extremely generous of you.\u201d My instincts flare. She wants something.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. But that is beside the point because now, sir, you owe me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head before she finishes talking. \u201cWrong. You volunteered to mule my money. I don\u2019t owe you shit.\u201d</p><p>Abby laughs and my mouth dries out. Where the hell is she heading? \u201cWe didn\u2019t only talk about you, silly. Eric had a lot to say about two college kids who tipped off the police in order to create chaos so they could pull a gun on Eric and jack him.\u201d</p><p>I focus on keeping my expression from changing. Abby doesn\u2019t give info because she likes to talk. She\u2019s fishing.</p><p>\u201cHow much did he lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive thousand dollars, and let me tell you, Eric is not happy.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not. Jacked in his own territory and he lost money. I\u2019m sure Eric is on the warpath. \u201cSo if Eric got jacked then why is he willing to pay me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Eric\u2014he doesn\u2019t believe in banks or investing, which is a shame with the amount of money he brings in. One of these days someone\u2019s going to shoot him in the head and find his secret cubbyhole full of cash.\u201d</p><p>Part of me wonders if Abby will be the one to do it. I let out a sigh. I took it too far. Abby\u2019s all business with selling drugs, but she\u2019s not a killer. At least not yet.</p><p>Abby continues, \u201cYou saved some of his guys tonight by spotting the cops. He wanted to make sure he paid his debt to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I don\u2019t find you interesting, but give me my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you better when you\u2019re around cars. You\u2019re less tense then. Anyhow.\u201d She rubs the wad of cash between her fingers. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to hold on to this cash as a reward for keeping my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me my fucking money, Abby.\u201d I\u2019m tired of her games.</p><p>\u201cAll right, but you should know that Eric was not only interested in the whereabouts of those two college boys, but also in a particular blonde we both just saw leave. You looked cute together\u2014you and the blonde. I\u2019m sure Eric would pay royally to know you were up on the girl.\u201d</p><p>A roar fills my ears as every muscle tenses. No one is going anywhere near Rachel.</p><p>No one.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Rachel</p><p>HE NEVER CALLED. I WAITED. And he still never called. What I have a hard time comprehending is why I grieve for something that obviously was never mine to begin with.</p><p>A few tables away, my brothers laugh. Each of them holds a bottled beer. In order to hide our youngest brothers\u2019 involvement in underage drinking, Gavin and Jack stand in front of West and Ethan. Cold air drifts into the bottom of the large white tent housing the hundreds of guests and chills my ankles. The overhead heaters keep me warm, but the alcohol keeps my brothers warmer.</p><p>A votive candle floats in a crystal bowl full of water and translucent rocks. My hand hovers over the single flickering flame. Every white-cloth-covered table contains one of these centerpieces. I\u2019d bet I\u2019m the only guest wondering how close I can place my hand to the flame before I get burned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seated at the table farthest from the couples slow-dancing in front of the stage, I cross one leg over the other. It\u2019s a continual fidget meant to keep my limbs from falling asleep, and each time I move, I smooth out the material of my golden gown as if wrinkles will be the death of me. I think I look kinda pretty tonight, which is why every time I glimpse my reflection in the mirror my eyes water. I wanted Isaiah to see me this way.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d</p><p>My heart beats twice and I glance up, hoping and praying that somehow Isaiah has found me, even though I\u2019m at an exclusive New Year\u2019s Eve party at the Lieutenant Mayor\u2019s house. I mean, it\u2019s possible. At least it\u2019s possible in the daydreams I\u2019ve had since I sat at this corner table over an hour ago. I force a wannabe smile when I find Brian Toddsworth staring down at me. A month ago, I would have loved for him to ask me to dance. Today... Why didn\u2019t Isaiah call?</p><p>I shrug my bare shoulders while shaking my head. Heat flushes my face when I realize I have yet to answer and that I\u2019m conveying so many different body language signs that it probably appears I\u2019m having a seizure. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I barely whisper.</p> <p>Brian belongs in a different realm of popular than me, and the thought of saying the wrong thing and becoming a laughingstock makes my insides squirm. As if he\u2019s shocked by the response, Brian\u2019s head rears back. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice party, Brian.\u201d My twin, Ethan, moseys over from his seat with my brothers. All of whom are watching Brian and me closely. Sort of like how vultures watch the last twitch of roadkill.</p><p>Brian extends his fist to Ethan and they knuckle bump. They\u2019ve been friends since kindergarten. Brian and I\u2019ve been friends since never.</p><p>\u201cThe party\u2019s awful,\u201d says Brian. \u201cEveryone from school is at Sarah\u2019s. Spending New Year\u2019s schmoozing for my parents blows. Part of me hopes Dad loses the primary next spring.\u201d</p><p>Ethan jerks his head in my direction as if I\u2019m a five-year-old who can\u2019t follow a conversation. \u201cWhatcha doing with Rachel?\u201d</p> <p>Brian\u2019s cheeks redden. \u201cYour mom mentioned to my mom that no one was talking to Rachel, and you know what happened last weekend, so I\u2019m not in a position to disagree.\u201d</p><p>Wow, Brian didn\u2019t even try to pretend I wasn\u2019t a pity dance. When my heels click on the temporary wooden floor of the tent, the pair evidently remembers my existence.</p><p>Ethan gestures at Brian then to me with his beer. \u201cCan you try to have some tact when it comes to Rach? She is my sister.\u201d</p><p>Twin. I prefer the word twin. Gavin, Jack and West are my brothers. I feel a special connection with Ethan. Brian acknowledges me with a glance. \u201cI meant no disrespect. My parents grounded me when they found my pot, and if I do what Mom wants she\u2019ll back off.\u201d</p><p>I stare at my hands laced in my lap. I\u2019ve always wanted to be told that dancing with me is a punishment reserved for the severest of offenders. Brian, I guess, rethinks his words and backtracks. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you aren\u2019t pretty or anything. You are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d asks Ethan. I bite my lower lip. Shut up, Ethan. Because my twin and I can\u2019t speak telepathically, Ethan continues, \u201cAre you into Rachel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>Awesome. What girl doesn\u2019t want to hear that?</p><p>\u201cYou said she\u2019s pretty,\u201d Ethan spits out as if that comment is an insult.</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d says Brian. \u201cBut I\u2019m not into her.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s shoulders sag with relief. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Great. I think I\u2019m going to drive a fork into my brother\u2019s abdomen.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d Brian turns to face me. \u201cYou\u2019re nice, but you\u2019re Rachel, you know?\u201d</p><p>Yes, I\u2019m well aware of who I am: the obsessively shy and anxious girl who stumbles over her own name. The one with the ridiculously protective brothers. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not. But what am I going to do? The only guy who has ever shown the least bit of interest in me never called, so why should anything else in my life be different?</p><p>\u201cApologize to my sister,\u201d says Ethan.</p><p>Brian\u2019s forehead furrows. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor existing.\u201d</p><p>Brian laughs and bumps Ethan\u2019s fist again. \u201cSorry I exist, Rachel. And Ethan, I\u2019ll catch you at Sarah\u2019s party later.\u201d</p><p>Later? With the self-proclaimed pot smoker? I tilt my head while Ethan briefly closes his eyes. I straighten my back, tap the seat next to me, then fold my hands daintily over my knees. \u201cSooo? How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Ethan collapses in the seat and rests his beer on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Let it go.\u201d</p><p>I bat my eyelashes and smile like a stupid Southern belle because he must think I\u2019m a moron if he believes I\u2019m buying that. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian experimented with pot. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you experimented with pot?\u201d</p><p>He stretches out his legs and remains silent. I drop the Southern belle act and lean into him. \u201cIf that conversation took place between West and any of his friends, I\u2019d let it go. West does stupid things. It\u2019s what West was born to do. But you\u2014you don\u2019t do stupid things.\u201d</p><p>Ethan turns his head toward me, and all I see is dark eyes and dark hair\u2014a reminder that he\u2019s my opposite. \u201cI was with him, but I didn\u2019t do it, okay?\u201d He holds out his pinkie. \u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>I press his pinkie down and pat his knee. The offer of a pinkie has always been enough for the two of us. If he swears it, I believe it.</p><p>Ethan regards my cell on the table. \u201cAre you expecting a call?\u201d</p><p>The disbelief in his voice stings. \u201cNo.\u201d Unfortunately. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Yet it doesn\u2019t stop me from looking at the wretched device. Because staring at it for ten hours straight will magically remind Isaiah that I gave him my number.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d says Ethan.</p><p>\u201cWhich is never a good thing,\u201d I cut him off. \u201cIt will only strain the brain cells that actually function and those two deserve a break.\u201d</p><p>He smirks. \u201cYou know, if you\u2019d crawl out of your shell and be yourself around everyone else, then that phone would be ringing nonstop, you might attend an occasional nonadult party and you wouldn\u2019t have to rely on Brian for a pity dance.\u201d</p><p>Once more, I focus on my lap and again smooth out my dress. I was myself with Isaiah, and look where that got me. \u201cThis is me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hate attention...I get it. But I hate how everyone sees you. If it bothers me then I know it\u2019s got to bother you.\u201d</p><p>The back of my neck bristles and my spine straightens. Ethan\u2019s never been so blunt and I don\u2019t care for it. \u201cSorry I can\u2019t be perfect like you.\u201d Lead scorer on the lacrosse team, voted onto the student council, popular...not me. Just like the rest of my fabulous brothers.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t be like that. I\u2019m only pointing out what you already know. Everyone thinks you\u2019re quiet, shy, a little off because of your anxiety attacks in middle school and...\u201d He trails off and picks at the label on his beer. \u201cAnd they think you\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p>My gaze jumps to his. \u201cI am not sick.\u201d I am not Colleen.</p><p>There\u2019s an anger building in his eyes that I\u2019m unfamiliar with. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t either, but then I was the one holding your hair back a few days ago when you vomited in a toilet. So if you weren\u2019t sick, what were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you claim you\u2019re over the panic attacks. So which rumor is true? Are you the girl who spent time in the hospital our freshman year because you\u2019re sickly, or are you the girl who spent time in the hospital because you had panic attacks?\u201d</p><p>I hate that word: sick. I also hate the words panic, fear and coward. A lump forms in my throat, and I can\u2019t decide if I\u2019m angry or hurt or both. \u201cThat is low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLying to me is low.\u201d</p><p>My mouth pops open and no words come out. Part of me is dying to tell him. To let someone into my personal nightmare, but I\u2019ve gone this long hiding my secret and if he knows, will he tell Mom? \u201cOne panic attack. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He leans forward. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>Because of our relationship, he can read my poker face like no one else. What\u2019s surprising is that, after two years, he\u2019s just catching on to the lie.</p><p>\u201cYou can convince Mom that you aren\u2019t the girl who obsesses over Cobras, reads Motor Trend, sneaks out after dinner to bathe in axle grease and skips curfew so she can drive her car. If you can do that, I think you\u2019re capable of lying to me about being over the panic attacks.\u201d</p><p>I slam my hand on the table and people at a nearby table gawk. Ethan waves at them while I lower my head, embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cYou really want the truth?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rachel. I never knew the two of us stopped telling each other the truth.\u201d</p><p>Hypocrite. \u201cWhat do you do on twin amnesty night?\u201d</p><p>A muscle near his eye flinches. \u201cLying and withholding information are different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Truth? You and I both know that I can\u2019t be me. She isn\u2019t who Mom wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Mom,\u201d he harshly whispers back. \u201cThis is about you and me.\u201d</p><p>My lower lip trembles. I made my brother, my best friend, my only friend, mad at me. Ethan squeezes my hand, then lets me and the subject go. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. I hate it when you cry.\u201d</p><p>He finishes his beer in two gulps. \u201cDo you ever wonder what it would have been like if we\u2019d been born to anyone else?\u201d</p><p>My stomach aches from the raw truth of his question. \u201cAll the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel!\u201d my mother calls. When she\u2019s sure she\u2019s caught my attention, she motions for me to join her.</p><p>I force my practiced smile on my lips. \u201cThis is why I can\u2019t be me. Can you imagine how her friends would react if I discussed air shifters and turbochargers? These events...this is why she had another daughter. This is why I\u2019m alive.\u201d</p><p>Gathering my gown, I stand. Ethan pulls on my hand and I know he wants me to look at him, but I refuse. \u201cYou make her happy, Rach. And we thank you for that. No one likes it when Mom\u2019s sad.\u201d</p><p>I release a breath, searching for my nonexistent happy place. \u201cI get tired of playing the role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He tugs on my hand again, and this time I give in. He flashes his playful smile. \u201cEven I don\u2019t know what an air shifter is.\u201d</p><p>I smack his arm, and my smile becomes relaxed as I hear his laughter.</p><p>My mother is gorgeous in her slim-fitting red sequined dress and slicked-back blond hair. Like always, Mom is the center of a group. People are naturally drawn to her, and she naturally loves the attention.</p><p>The band has progressed onto jazz, and my mother\u2019s movements seem to flow with the beat. I need to go to the bathroom, and I\u2019ve waited too long in the hopes Mom would maneuver her social networking away from the front of the tent. It never happened, so here I am\u2014standing with a full bladder, in a golden gown, being gawked at by a group of aging women. The smile becomes harder to hold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d I half whisper, half choke. There are way too many eyes on me.</p><p>\u201cThese are the ladies from the Leukemia Foundation. Ladies, you remember my youngest daughter, Rachel.\u201d My mother graces me with a smile I thought was reserved only for my brothers: one of pride.</p><p>They all comment on how it\u2019s nice to see me and how beautiful I look and ask Mom where we bought my dress. I move like a bobblehead while my clammy fingers twist behind my back.</p><p>\u201cI loved the speech you gave the other night,\u201d says an elderly woman to my right. Her pungent perfume hits me wrong, and I concentrate on not gagging. I nod, and the gesture only encourages her to speak more.</p> <p>To the left and a bit across from me, I catch sight of a lady my mother\u2019s age touching Mom\u2019s arm. Mom introduced us earlier\u2014Meg is her name, I think. She was Colleen\u2019s private nurse. They both stare at me, and my heart sinks with the knowledge that I must be their topic of conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Meg says to Mom. \u201cShe does resemble Colleen.\u201d</p><p>The woman to my right continues to talk about the speech I made at Colleen\u2019s event. I make fleeting eye contact because I\u2019m more interested in overhearing my mother.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not as outgoing as Colleen,\u201d Meg adds.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mom responds with a hint of sadness. \u201cRachel\u2019s a little quieter.\u201d A very dramatic pause. \u201cBut her father and I are helping her with that. She\u2019s made huge improvements over the last two years. All on her own.\u201d I hear the pride. \u201cAll without therapy.\u201d</p> <p>I miss therapy. I miss having someone to talk to, someone who can empathize with what it feels like to walk into a room and have fear and anxiety consume you to the point that you can\u2019t breathe. But what I don\u2019t miss about therapy is how my family regarded me as if I was breakable, as if I was weak.</p><p>\u201cWith each day, she reminds me a little more of her sister,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>I remind her of Colleen. I should be happy. I\u2019m becoming what my mother wants. But right now, I want to cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I interrupt the older woman, who\u2019s still droning on. \u201cI need to excuse myself.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Isaiah</p> <p>I STAND ON THE EDGE of the crumbling brick wall built to protect people from the thirty-foot drop. In the distance, high-rises glimmer and thousands of white twinkling lights circle the city. Each light represents a neighborhood, a house, a home, a family, a person\u2014people who are wanted. It\u2019s the last night of December and it\u2019s fifty degrees. Great for a guy who doesn\u2019t own a jacket.</p><p>Forty-eight hours have officially passed since I met Rachel. I\u2019ve thought about her; her beauty, her laughter, that shy smile, our kiss. She discovered a deep hole in my chest and somehow filled it with her existence. Now she\u2019s gone, leaving me alone, leaving me hollow.</p><p>Glancing around the panoramic scene, I know I would have brought her here. This place has been abandoned for decades, and few care that you can still drive up the steep hill as long as you move the flimsy wooden barricades.</p><p>Sixty years ago, teenagers made out here. Legend says the braver ones drag raced the winding mile road and played chicken at the top where no wall exists. When I teeter on this ledge, I wonder if the drivers who flew over the drop tried to stop or if they were begging for an excuse to end it all.</p><p>I would have loved to see Rachel\u2019s expression when she saw the city like this. But Eric and his crew are watching everyone closely as they search for her and the two college boys. I refuse to be the link between Eric and Rachel. She\u2019s safer without me. She\u2019s better off without me. Besides, it\u2019s not like anything would have happened between us.</p><p>Movement in the brush catches my attention, and I turn to see a shadow emerge.</p><p>\u201cYou are so damn predictable,\u201d says Abby. I finally discern her features as she joins me on the wall. Like always, she wears a fitted blue hoodie and even tighter blue jeans.</p><p>I have a million questions, but stick with the important one. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTradition, jackass.\u201d Not caring that thirty feet below is nothing but sharp rocks, she sits on the wall and dangles her legs over the edge. \u201cI have a gift for you.\u201d</p><p>Still mad over losing my rent money, I angle my body away from her. \u201cLeave, Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the attitude. That was business. This is friends. Do you want your gift or not?\u201d</p><p>The two of us have an odd relationship. We met when we were ten. My then foster father used to take me to the auto shop I work at now, and she used to play in the alley behind the garage. We struck up a friendship that never went away and never stopped being odd. Abby is the longest steady relationship I\u2019ve had with one person, which makes her special.</p><p>Special means I\u2019ll put up with her shit. With a sigh, I sit, leaving several feet between us. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d</p><p>She reaches into her hoodie. \u201cAsked a client to drop me off and then hiked.\u201d</p><p>A client, meaning a buyer, because she\u2019s a seller. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t get in cars with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Dad. I typically don\u2019t. But this guy is clean-cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means you should definitely watch your back. Image means nothing.\u201d What people project to the world never shows what\u2019s lurking on the inside.</p><p>\u201cYou liked her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asks, ignoring what I said. \u201cThe cute, fuzzy bunny?\u201d</p><p>I say nothing and survey the northeast side of town. She\u2019s over there somewhere. Is Rachel happy I never called, or did I break her heart? As much as I hate the idea of it, I hope she\u2019s relieved. She deserved better than me.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I find interesting?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you still lie to Noah about where you go for New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy business. Not his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also find it curious that Fuzzy Bunny isn\u2019t here with you if you liked her so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never brought Beth here,\u201d I say in defense.</p><p>\u201cYou never smiled at Beth like I saw you smile at her.\u201d</p><p>I shift, uncomfortable that Abby saw something so intimate between me and Rachel. \u201cYou said you had a gift.\u201d</p><p>I hear plastic rubbing together in her hand and, because Abby carries very little on her, it has to be a baggy. \u201cPatience, Grasshopper. If I\u2019m giving this type of gift then I want to know it\u2019s for a good cause. Answer me about the girl.\u201d</p><p>Flooded with the urge to tell someone, I pull on my bottom earring. \u201cYeah. I liked her.\u201d Because saying it makes it real, and it was real. \u201cBut we would have only been friends.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s silent except for the sound of her heel occasionally hitting the brick wall. \u201cI liked this guy last year, but I blew him off after a couple of days. He came from a good home and was a good guy. Sometimes it\u2019s better that we let the good catches go, you know?\u201d</p><p>Her feet continue to kick against the wall. Abby\u2019s not one to share, so that statement had to take a lot out of her. \u201cYeah. I do know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you need money,\u201d she says.</p><p>That grabs my attention. \u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d Abby smirks. \u201cYou don\u2019t street race and you did. The only reason I could come up with is that you\u2019re low on funds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna give me my money back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>Gotta respect her for that.</p><p>\u201cI know someone that\u2019s interested in your skills with cars, Isaiah. He\u2019s been watching you for a while and he\u2019ll pay well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your friend give out W-2 forms?\u201d</p><p>Abby chuckles. \u201cOne thousand in cash for every car you jack. All you need is a lot full of empty cars and your hotwiring capabilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you change your mind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m not interested in becoming a criminal. Once you enter the land of illegal, someone, somewhere owns you.</p><p>She withdraws a joint from the baggie. \u201cThis is the last of my supply. Once this is gone, I swear not to sell again for the rest of this year.\u201d</p><p>Easy promise, since there are only minutes left until the new year begins. Abby\u2019s not a fan of what she does, but she\u2019s good at business and at selling. If she could ever get the hell off the streets she\u2019d probably become someone. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sell,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to street race.\u201d</p><p>Point taken.</p><p>Abby stares out over the blinking lights of the city. \u201cI saw my dad today.\u201d I hear the hurt in her voice.</p><p>My heart aches for her. Before I can think of something to say to help her feel better, she continues, \u201cI was going to share this with you, but now I don\u2019t think I want to.\u201d Abby extends the joint to me. \u201cYou can have it.\u201d</p><p>I roll the joint in my hand: two inches long and thin. I first smoked up in eighth grade and hated the loss of control. But hanging with the people I knew, surviving in the homes I lived in, I learned quick how to blend in and conform. It\u2019s amazing what you can convince people of just by touching a joint to your lips. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want it?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. I place the joint between my thumb and forefinger and snap it over the thirty-foot drop. Abby claps. \u201cWell played.\u201d She hoots, then yells, \u201cHappy fucking New Year, nature. You can have your shit back.\u201d</p><p>Abby lapses into silence. Somewhere in the distance below, glass shatters. Most likely a home invasion. The sad part is, neither one of us flinch.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d gone straight,\u201d Abby says. \u201cI take that back\u2014not gone straight, but that you weren\u2019t as hard-core as everyone thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I respond. Abby is the one person who has always known. When everyone else was higher than kites, she\u2019d look over and realize that I was sober\u2014because she was, too.</p><p>\u201cIf I had asked, you would have smoked it with me,\u201d she says.</p><p>I nod. Because she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to do it alone, and because the only reason she would have done it is because it hurt her so much to see her dad. \u201cI would have taken a hit.\u201d One. Because that\u2019s the most I\u2019d ever take with anyone.</p><p>Her phone beeps. \u201cOne minute to the New Year.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in shock. \u201cYou set your alarm?\u201d</p><p>Abby raises her face to the sky. \u201cMaybe next year will be better.\u201d She\u2019s been saying that forever. I reach into my jacket and extract a lighter. Abby smiles because she knows what I\u2019m about to do. \u201cDo you want me to count it down?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cUp to you.\u201d</p><p>Abby watches her phone and counts from ten to two. The moment she says one I flick my lighter and hold the single flame into the night.</p><p>That\u2019s right, world: one more year has passed and I\u2019m still fucking here.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Rachel</p><p>I OVERSLEPT. LAST NIGHT, I had a hard time falling asleep as my mind replayed the events of winter break. I worried over Isaiah and Ethan and school and Mom and lies and...Isaiah. Like always, sleep eventually came, but not without consequences.</p><p>I\u2019m late. Not really late as in school-will-start-soon late. But late as in I-have-a-routine-and-I\u2019m-not-keeping-it late. West calls it superstition. I call him an idiot. My days, they go better if I follow the tradition: an apple and one slice of toast for breakfast, watch the first few minutes of the morning news, double-check my backpack, drive the long way to school and sit in my car for five minutes before walking into the school building. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mom stopped me yesterday and I missed breakfast. That one deviation created a snowball effect that ended with me having to read a poem aloud in class. I barely hid the panic overtaking me, and I hated how Ethan\u2019s now-observant eyes noted the way the heat flushed up my neck.</p><p>Pulling a sweater over my school uniform, I bolt out of my bathroom, gather my scattered books off my bed and try to stuff them into my backpack as I race down the winding staircase.</p><p>Loud voices echoing from my father\u2019s office cause me to skid to a halt halfway down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d my father yells, and my stomach drops. It\u2019s West. Dad only shouts like this at West. \u201cFour fights alone since the school year began. When is it going to end?\u201d</p> <p>The fights. The chink in my brother\u2019s perfect armor. Honestly, West has gotten into more than four fights at school this year, but those were the ones broken up by some authority figure. God only knows how many he\u2019s been in outside of school walls. West is an easygoing enough guy, but when someone pushes him too far, West always pushes back. Part of me envies him that fearlessness.</p><p>\u201cThe fight happened last week,\u201d West replies in a low tone. \u201cDid your secretary just now get around to telling you about it or was this the first time you could fit me into your schedule?\u201d Mom must be gone if they\u2019re arguing so openly.</p><p>One of the books I had been shoving into my pack slips out of my hand and in slow motion, it bobbles on my fingertips. Instead of falling in the direction of the bag, it inclines away from me, drops and begins its rapid descent down the stairs, one loud thud at a time, until the book announces its grand entrance onto the foyer with a resounding BAM!</p><p>My spine straightens with the unusually still silence, and I know I\u2019ve undoubtedly gained my father and West\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cRach?\u201d Dad calls from his office at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p> <p>I suck in a breath to steady myself. He doesn\u2019t even have to look to know it\u2019s me. No one else in this family would ever make such an awkward mistake. I rush down the stairs and pause in the large entryway of his office. \u201cJust clumsy.\u201d</p><p>My father\u2019s lips quiver as if he wants to laugh like I\u2019m a clown in a show. How he turns his emotions around so quickly, I\u2019ll never know, and I enviously wish he would share his secret. It\u2019s probably why he\u2019s never understood why I couldn\u2019t control the panic attacks.</p><p>When I fidget, the quivering stops. He remembers I hate being laughed at\u2014and I hate that he remembers.</p><p>I steal a glance at West, who shoves his hands in his pockets and stares at the floor. Mom doesn\u2019t know about the times West\u2019s temper has gotten the best of him. West can fake perfection, where I always fall excruciatingly short.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should try out for the circus,\u201d I say to lighten the mood. \u201cI\u2019d be a whiz at juggling china.\u201d</p><p>And it works. Dad laughs...at me. \u201cGood thing Grace isn\u2019t your middle name.\u201d</p> <p>With a glare between West and Dad, West leaves the room and I watch him go.</p><p>Dad pushes away from the massive oak desk, stands to his full six feet and gestures for me to join him. This is what Ethan will look like someday: tall, dark chestnut hair, even darker brown eyes and full of confidence. Mom said she fell in love with Dad the moment she saw him at college orientation.</p><p>Dad sits in one of the two chairs in front of his desk and indicates that I should take the other. I rotate the gold bracelet on my wrist one time. I have a routine and he\u2019s ruining it.</p><p>\u201cThe guy provoked West.\u201d It had to be said. \u201cI heard about it at school and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about West.\u201d</p><p>One more rotation of the bracelet. West and my impending lateness are warring for attention in my mind. \u201cMom\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left early this morning for a breakfast.\u201d</p><p>I should be eating breakfast. Why can\u2019t he let me continue with my routine?</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to tell you that I\u2019m proud of you,\u201d he says.</p><p>Despite the tension of the morning, everything inside of me explodes with joy.</p><p>\u201cWhat you did last week at the charity event was mind-blowing. If you had told me two years ago that you would make a speech in public, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you. You surprised me, Rachel, and you made me proud.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll be wearing this smile for a week. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Dad leans forward, rests his arms on his knees and combines his hands. \u201cYou know how hard it was for your mother and me to lose Colleen.\u201d</p><p>My joy drains, leaving me feeling cold. How could I expect anything different? I\u2019m here so he can recite the same January speech. I glance over at the framed pictures on the table behind his desk. There are more of Colleen than of anyone else. I should know. I\u2019ve counted them since I was six. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know how hard this time of year is on your mother.\u201d</p><p>I nod. Colleen\u2019s birthday was the twenty-eighth of December. The charity ball and assorted holiday parties keep Mom afloat, but after the Christmas decorations are boxed away and the donations are counted, she spirals into a month-long depression.</p><p>\u201cAfter Colleen passed, I had no idea how your mother was going to continue, but then she found out she was having you\u2014a girl. The day of your ultrasound was the first time I had seen your mother smile in months. You\u2019ve always given your mom that extra push.\u201d</p><p>I blink twice so my father won\u2019t see tears. Does he have any idea how much I hate this lecture and the role I play in the family? I\u2019m so sick of being Colleen\u2019s replacement.</p><p>Dad flashes a surprise smirk. \u201cYou remind me a lot of your mother.\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head, shocked by this new twist on the old speech. \u201cReally?\u201d I\u2019d give anything to be like her. She\u2019s beautiful and poised and brave. My heart stalls with a twinge of pain. Isaiah called me brave.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says as his smile grows. \u201cAnd Colleen, too.\u201d</p><p>I rub my forehead so he doesn\u2019t see the hurt clawing at my face. What will happen if they ever find out I\u2019m nothing like Colleen?</p><p>\u201cAll girl from head to toe. I couldn\u2019t keep Colleen away from makeup, and your mother enjoys being a woman more than anyone I know.\u201d</p><p>And Dad loves treating Mom like a princess. My eyes drift to the picture of Colleen at the age of eight, dressed as Cinderella and posing near the castle in Disney World. When I was eight, I brought tears to Mom\u2019s eyes when I yearned to go with my brothers to Space Mountain instead of pretending to be a stupid princess. To this day, I hate the happiest place on earth.</p><p>Dad continues, \u201cDespite it being your sister\u2019s birthday, your mom had a wonderful day last week. She enjoyed spending time with you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s referring to the hours we spent at the spa in preparation for the charity ball. This isn\u2019t a new twist to the story after all, just a new way of saying the same old thing. To help Mom through her upcoming slump, Dad will excuse me from school, like he\u2019s done every January since I was ten, and send me and Mom on a week-long, all expenses paid shopping and spa spree in New York City.</p><p>I\u2019m not a fan of shopping. I\u2019d rather have spikes embedded in my head than have anyone file my toenails. I could care less what designer made what outfit. Faking that I\u2019m having a fabulous time in an environment that feels as foreign to me as living on Mars is exhausting, but our time together always cheers up Mom. That alone is worth the trip and sometimes there\u2019s a perk for me. Last year, I got to touch a Ferrari.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, taking the preemptive strike. \u201cWhen do we leave?\u201d</p><p>Dad winks. \u201cSorry, no trip to the Big Apple this year.\u201d</p><p>Yes! \u201cWhat about Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve been handling your mother wrong. The charity ball keeps her busy in December, but she needs that feeling year-round. At the New Year\u2019s Eve party, I talked to the head of the Leukemia Foundation and they agreed to offer your mom a fundraising position.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like someone shoved a hundred-pound weight off my chest. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d He points at me. \u201cBut your mother will only take the position if you do it with her. You opened a lot of checkbooks with your speech last week. She wants to raise more money to fund research for the illness that took your sister, and she wants you to give the speeches.\u201d</p><p>The weight returns with a crushing blow to my head. This is an excellent example of why I should never deviate from routine.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>AS I WAIT IN THE school parking lot, my fingers glide over the pony embossed on the steering wheel and my thoughts return to Rachel. Three hours\u2014the time I spent with her. It wasn\u2019t much, but there was something about her, a spark that made her...unforgettable.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand why I still think about her. Three hours with someone isn\u2019t enough to know them, but she didn\u2019t fit into any clich\u00e9 or box. It\u2019s like she was a mystery I was in the middle of solving and then I was yanked from the case.</p><p>The damn sun hasn\u2019t even risen, and school starts soon. Seven hours of torture lie ahead of me. I\u2019d rather be in the garage working on the Chevelle some guy brought in last night. Hell, I\u2019d rather work on a Ford Focus. I\u2019d rather be with Rachel.</p><p>My eyes drift to her number, which rests in the drink holder. She writes exactly like I\u2019d expect from a girl like her: feminine with loops and pink ink. I shake my head. Who the fuck keeps a pink pen nearby? Rachel. She did. She would, and I liked that about her.</p><p>A muscle in my jaw tics and my left hand grips the steering wheel. Everyone on the street is aware that Eric\u2019s looking for her and those two loser college boys. No one but Abby knows that I left the race with Rachel, and the money I gave Abby bought her silence. As long as I stay clear of Rachel, she\u2019ll never be found.</p><p>My car door groans as I open it, and I make a mental note to oil the son of a bitch when I get to work later.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah!\u201d</p><p>A nervous adrenaline rush flows into my veins when I hear Echo\u2019s voice. Sliding out of the passenger side of Noah\u2019s car, Echo calls to me again. I immediately walk in their direction. Screw school. Echo and Noah\u2014they\u2019re my family.</p><p>With her arms wrapped around her stomach and red curls blowing across her face, Echo places one foot in front of the other in a hesitant motion toward me. Noah stays next to his car. I glance at him, hoping for a clue as to what the hell is going on, but he gives me nothing as he leans against the fender. His gaze flickers to Echo and, for a second, concern flashes on his face.</p><p>\u201cEcho,\u201d I say as soon as she\u2019s close. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>My mind races through the possibilities. She mentioned her baby brother showed some signs of allergies. Is he sick? Is it her fucked-up mom? Did she try to hurt Echo again?</p><p>Echo brushes her hair away and exposes bloodshot eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to reach you since last night. Why didn\u2019t you go home?\u201d</p><p>I look at Noah again. My staying out all night has never been an issue. Noah\u2019s my best friend, not my babysitter. \u201cI worked late then crashed at the garage.\u201d All in a vain effort to drain Rachel from my mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Echo\u2019s foot taps the blacktop as she runs her hands over her arms. \u201cI tried your cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dead.\u201d Because I wanted to kill the temptation of calling Rachel.</p><p>Echo\u2019s head falls back and she sucks in a deep breath. \u201cI screwed up and I\u2019m sorry. So sorry. But she can\u2019t tell anyone. I made sure of it. I slipped during my session yesterday, and what\u2019s said during a session is privileged. I threatened her\u2014if she tells anyone I\u2019ll turn her in.\u201d</p><p>My stomach begins a downward spiral. I hate where this is heading. \u201cTold who what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI accidently told Mrs. Collins that you\u2019re living with Noah. I\u2019m so sorry, Isaiah.\u201d</p><p>The slap of her words makes me take a step back. Fuck. Echo told her therapist, a guidance counselor at my school, that I don\u2019t live with my assigned foster family. Every muscle I possess seizes with anger.</p><p>Her voice breaks and she wipes a hand over her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I swear to God I\u2019ll turn her in if she says one word. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Another tear rolls down her face. Echo means what she says even though Mrs. Collins is the one person who can help her deal with her issues. I\u2019m pissed. No doubt. But families have each other\u2019s backs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll work out,\u201d I tell her, though I have no idea if that statement is true. Forgiving her doesn\u2019t erase the fact that she may have ruined my life. \u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t, then I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p> <p>Because Echo is a touchy-feely girl, she hugs me. I hug her back while meeting Noah\u2019s stare. He gets that his girl and I love each other in a brother-sister type of way. Noah nods his appreciation and I nod back. How the hell am I going to get out of this?</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Rachel</p><p>\u201cYOU KNOW WHAT I NEED?\u201d I lean away from the hood of West\u2019s SUV and wipe my greasy fingers on a rag, careful not to touch my clothing. West snuck me out here to the massive \u201cchildren\u2019s\u201d garage after dinner, claiming a near-death emergency.</p><p>\u201cA life?\u201d West, my older brother by less than a year, slouches against my Mustang. With his baggy jeans and designer black T-shirt, he fits suburban ghetto wannabe to a T.</p><p>\u201cGet off my baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a car, Freak-a-sauraus. You realize most dudes aren\u2019t as obsessed as you are.\u201d Because he knows I\u2019m serious, West moves away from her.</p><p>I drop the rag and slam his hood. \u201cI didn\u2019t come out here to be insulted. Go inside, crawl to Dad, and tell him you forgot to change your oil again and let\u2019s see how this plays out.\u201d</p><p>West pulls his baseball cap off his head and pounds it against his leg. \u201cShit. The oil. I forgot to change the oil. That\u2019s why the light came on.\u201d</p><p>I snatch my jacket and am reaching to open the door when West steps in my path. \u201cI was playing. You know it. I tease, you take it. It\u2019s the game we play.\u201d</p><p>I slide to the right. \u201cI\u2019m done playing.\u201d</p><p>He mirrors me. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t leave. Dad will be pissed if he finds out I didn\u2019t change the oil again. You\u2019ve seen how he is with me. Come on, Rach. Have a heart. You know you\u2019re my favorite sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your only sister.\u201d Well, the only one alive, that is.</p><p>\u201cGavin\u2019s a little girly.\u201d</p> <p>I laugh. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>West releases a sly grin. I laughed, therefore he knows he\u2019s winning. \u201cCome on, have you seen the dude\u2019s eyebrows? Unnatural for a guy. I\u2019ll bet you ten dollars he has them waxed.\u201d</p><p>Not quite willing to bend, I sigh and cross my arms over my chest.</p><p>West drops to one knee. \u201cPlease, Rach. Please. I\u2019m begging here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He hops up, steals my coat from me and slips his hat on his head backward.</p><p>\u201cOn one condition,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cName it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange the oil. Regularly. You don\u2019t wait until a light flashes on your console and you don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re near bone-dry. It\u2019s not that complicated. Every three thousand miles or every three months. They put a reminder sticker at the top of your windshield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Whatever.\u201d And we\u2019re both aware we\u2019ll be having this same conversation again in a couple of months.</p><p>I open the cabinet and shuffle through some boxes to find the extra oil filters I bought for West\u2019s SUV. \u201cIf I had a diagnostic code scanner I could tell you if there\u2019s another reason why the maintenance light came on.\u201d</p><p>West seats himself on the hood of my car and I throw a rag at him. \u201cFor the love of God, get off my car. Touch it again and I\u2019ll crack the head of your engine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Repentant, West heads to the other side of the garage Mom and Dad built to house my brothers\u2019 and my cars. Our parents are the only ones allowed to use the garage actually connected to the house. \u201cI thought you said I just need oil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you need oil, but you could have seriously damaged other things because the car needed oil a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>West slumps against the wall, and I throw him a bone. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Hope creeps along his face. \u201cYou can fix it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can fix it.\u201d With new filter in hand, I repop the hood and begin the task of salvaging West\u2019s SUV. \u201cBut the scanner would be nice for when it\u2019s something more than a missed oil change.\u201d</p><p>West\u2019s cell phone chimes, and he pulls it out to read a text message. \u201cYou should have asked for it for your birthday or Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I mutter, but West is too caught up in whatever he\u2019s texting to hear. I asked for the scanner along with a few \u201cgirly\u201d things, hoping my parents wouldn\u2019t notice and would just check the item off the list as they went on their shopping spree, but that didn\u2019t happen. They bought me a new ebook reader and jewelry. No scanner.</p><p>The tick, tick, tick of West tapping on his cell continues to my right. \u201cHeard Dad asked you to work with Mom and the Leukemia Foundation.\u201d</p><p>Is anything in my life not a topic for discussion in this family? \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know she\u2019ll only accept the position if you agree to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say more softly. I hate the guilt festering on my insides.</p><p>\u201cAnd you also know,\u201d he says in a way-too-happy voice, \u201cif she takes on the position, she\u2019ll have that I\u2019m-planning-something manic high all the time.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019ll constantly be on the verge of a panic attack and I\u2019ll have to constantly hide it. With those types of attacks, I vomit. Vomiting is what once led me to the hospital.</p><p>When I say nothing, West continues, \u201cShe\u2019ll be happy.\u201d He pauses. \u201cJust saying.\u201d</p><p>I inhale deeply. Why does my mother\u2019s happiness always depend on me?</p><p>\u201cHave you given Dad an answer yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d I wanted to say no, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. I couldn\u2019t say yes, either. Like a coward, I escaped when Dad\u2019s phone unexpectedly rang. Dad mentioned later that he was okay with giving me until Friday to think it over. It\u2019s Wednesday night, so I have one more day before the answer is due. Both Gavin and Jack hunted me down to tell me their opinion on the subject, which is to get over my fear of public speaking and work with Mom.</p><p>\u201cYou should do it, Rach,\u201d West says with his fingers still moving on his phone.</p><p>I lift my head and toss my hair to clear my ear. \u201cWhat? What was that? Did I hear Dad calling for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Consider me backed off.\u201d West shoves his cell into his jeans pocket. \u201cWill my car be ready by Saturday? I have a date.\u201d</p><p>When doesn\u2019t West have a date? \u201cWith who?\u201d</p><p>My brother picks up one of my ratchets and spins it so that it makes the winding noise. \u201cSome girl I met in French.\u201d</p><p>Surely he knows her name. I mean, he did ask her out, and I assume that was her he was just texting. I place the strap wrench on the filter and hesitate. \u201cDo the girls you date ever mean something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean something?\u201d He stares into space for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess. Some I like more than others.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks burn and I need to rub my eyes, but if I do I\u2019ll smear grease on my face, and then Mom will know I\u2019ve been out \u201ctinkering with those cars again.\u201d She tries to understand my fascination, but I always see the disappointment in her eyes. So I hide my passion from her and discuss whatever I had read in one of her fashion magazines. Mom loves fashion.</p><p>I ask so softly that if West doesn\u2019t hear my question, I\u2019ll know it means he wasn\u2019t meant to answer, \u201cDid you ever tell a girl that you\u2019d call, and you never did?\u201d</p><p>The winding sound of the ratchet stops, and the heaviness of the silence cause me to look up. Uncharacteristically solemn, he stares straight at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>I refocus on the filter. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d West\u2019s sneakers squeak against the concrete floor as he walks over to me. \u201cThis is something. You\u2019ve been carrying your phone around like...like a normal teenage girl would, instead of leaving it in your room like you usually do. And you\u2019ve been acting off since the charity ball. Did you meet some guy? Did he not call?\u201d</p><p>I yank hard on the wrench, but the oil on the filter created a slick surface. \u201cMake yourself useful and grab that oil pan. Oil\u2019s going to drip when I get this loosened.\u201d</p><p>With a huff, West does what I ask and hovers over the engine next to me. \u201cWho is it, Rach? Who\u2019s the asshole who didn\u2019t call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d Just some really hot guy who I shared my first kiss with. I grit my teeth and put all of my strength into the wrench.</p><p>\u201cTell me who it is. His ass is mine.\u201d The pure malice in his tone gives me chills. West has a flash-fire temper when pushed too far, and he can kick ass when the line is crossed. But I\u2019ve never believed he\u2019d hurt a guy in my honor...until now.</p><p>\u201cIs it Brian?\u201d The anger within him builds like a snowball. The pan trembles in his hand. \u201cI saw him talking to you at the party. If it is, stay away from him. The guy\u2019s a prick.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to tell him what type of friends he has, since they were the ones who took me to the drag race and left me to fend for myself. But then I remember that he\u2019d crucify me if he knew that I hung out with them, participated in a drag race, ran from the police and then kissed a guy while alone in his apartment.</p><p>West moves the pan to catch the leaking oil as I remove the old filter. \u201cThere\u2019s no guy, okay? I\u2019m curious. You date a lot of girls, and I was wondering if you call every single one of them.\u201d I wipe off the filter mount and finish the rest of what I have to say. \u201cAnd what it means if you don\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>My brother stays unusually quiet while I finish replacing the old filter with the new one and add new oil. When I motion with my head that he can pull the pan away, West finally answers, \u201cThe ones I don\u2019t like, I don\u2019t call back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My lips turn down and an ache ripples through my chest. I toss the old filter into the garbage, snatch West\u2019s keys from the tool bench and open the driver\u2019s-side door so I can start the engine to check for leaks. I wish I were alone. \u201cThat\u2019s all I needed to know.\u201d</p><p>West begins to say something else, but I flip the keys in the ignition and apply the gas so that the loud revving noise of the engine will drown him out. West\u2019s words confirmed what I already knew from the silence: Isaiah never liked me.</p><p>I reach into my pocket and power off my phone. Why continue to wait for a call that will never come?</p><p>Chapter 21</p> <p>Isaiah</p><p>MRS. COLLINS WAITED UNTIL THURSDAY to yank me from class. While not surprised by the summons, the delay did catch me off guard. I walk into the main office and freeze when I see the person sitting in Mrs. Collins\u2019s office. My heart stalls. The bitch called my fucking social worker.</p><p>In midsentence, Courtney notices me and immediately yells, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare bolt, Isaiah.\u201d Her swinging blond hair gives her that pissed-off-racehorse effect again.</p><p>I give her credit. She knows what I\u2019m thinking. I toss my books onto the row of chairs lining the wall and head for Mrs. Collins\u2019s office. Odds are I won\u2019t need that shit anymore. A screwup like this will mean a group home. Not that I\u2019d let it get that far. I\u2019ll run before anyone forces me to set foot into that hell.</p><p>Once inside, I lean against the wall next to the door. Mrs. Collins, a middle-aged version of Courtney, swivels back and forth in her oversize business chair. Tilting stacks of papers clutter the desk and look close to tipping. This lady has the organizational skills of a hoarder.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to take a seat?\u201d Mrs. Collins asks with a sweet smile.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I cross my arms over my chest. The only chair available is the one that would trap me in the room. I\u2019m only interested in easy outs.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah, you should sit...\u201d Courtney starts, but Echo\u2019s head-shrinker cuts her off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re free to stand.\u201d</p><p>Damn straight I am. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Courtney rocks on the edge of her seat, as if contemplating joining me against the wall. She hates it when I stand and she sits. \u201cYou haven\u2019t returned any of my phone calls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? My job is to keep tabs on you. I want to make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found me.\u201d I snap a ta-da movement with my hands. \u201cI\u2019m alive. Can I go?\u201d</p><p>Courtney\u2019s a tiny thing. She shifts in her seat so that her knees are angled in my direction. \u201cYour mom still wants to talk.\u201d</p><p>My arms fall to my sides and I push off the wall. \u201cMy mom can kiss my ass.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Collins\u2019s chair squeaks when it rolls toward her desk. \u201cIsaiah, Courtney is here because I requested her presence on a school matter. If you don\u2019t want to discuss your mother, then you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Courtney shoots a confused glance at Mrs. Collins, and even I catch the subtle shake of the shrink\u2019s head.</p><p>Mrs. Collins overpronounces her next words in a sweet tone. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>And I won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI asked Mr. Holden to join us,\u201d Mrs. Collins continues. \u201cHe should be here soon.\u201d</p><p>Trying not to show that I\u2019m insanely curious about why Mrs. Collins is involving my automotive instructor, I retake my position against the wall.</p><p>Mrs. Collins taps a pencil against her desk. \u201cHow was your winter break, Isaiah?\u201d</p><p>Noah warned me about this woman. When he was blackmailed into counseling last year, he said she enjoyed torturing him with questions. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d The pencil keeps knocking against the desk. \u201cHow\u2019s Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic. And have you seen him recently?\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when it hits me\u2014Mrs. Collins hasn\u2019t told a soul that I\u2019m living with Noah. This entire meeting is a bluff. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes light up. \u201cYou saw Noah this early in the morning? Were you at his place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I was at our place. \u201cI saw Echo, too.\u201d</p><p>The pencil stops tapping. \u201cHow is Echo? Did she have anything interesting to say?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNothing really. Other than she doesn\u2019t like a snitch.\u201d</p><p>A shadow crosses her face, but damn if she doesn\u2019t make a good recovery.</p><p>Courtney slicks back her ponytail. \u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019m missing something here?\u201d</p><p>The gravelly sound of a pencil sharpener from the main office fills the silence as Mrs. Collins and I stare at each other. This is too much fun. \u201cBecause you are,\u201d I answer.</p><p>Courtney shuffles her feet. She\u2019s young, new and hates being the low man on the totem pole. Mrs. Collins rests her elbows on her desk. If she had big guns, she\u2019d be whipping them out now. \u201cHow are your foster parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Haven\u2019t heard that they died, so I assume that statement\u2019s true.</p><p>\u201cAnd Christmas with them was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I enjoyed not seeing their faces.</p><p>\u201cAnd they got you a...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuppy.\u201d Now I\u2019m just messing with her.</p><p>Her mouth twitches. Is it possible she also enjoys the game? \u201cThey got you a puppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mutt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you named it...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIwin.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Collins brushes her fingers over her mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s a strange name for a puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But I like the words coming out of my mouth\u2014I win.\u201d Because I have.</p><p>Courtney clears her throat. \u201cYour foster parents bought you a puppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me screwing it up,\u201d I say without looking at her. \u201cIt ran away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Isaiah.\u201d She places a hand over her heart. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Christ, I hate people that obsess over animals. The world that bleeds for a malnourished dog is more than happy to fuck over people like me. \u201cThings leave. It\u2019s the way of the world.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Holden walks in, twirling his safety glasses in his hand. \u201cMrs. Collins,\u201d he says as a hello. He nods at me. I nod back. Wearing his typical blue mechanic\u2019s coveralls, my favorite instructor regards Courtney as if she were a hybrid in the presence of gas guzzlers.</p><p>\u201cMr. Holden,\u201d says Mrs. Collins. \u201cThis is Isaiah\u2019s social worker, Courtney Blevins.\u201d</p><p>Courtney moves as if she\u2019s going to extend her hand, but withdraws it when Mr. Holden gives her a curt nod. \u201cI\u2019m between classes, Mrs. Collins.\u201d</p><p>She flips open a laptop and scrolls down the screen. \u201cI appreciate you joining us, Mr. Holden. Give me a second while I access Isaiah\u2019s file.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Holden chuckles. \u201cHow\u2019s going paperless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTedious, but I like password protection. Finally...Mr. Walker. Currently living with...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirley and Dale Easum.\u201d I finish for her.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what it says.\u201d She glances up from her computer. \u201cMr. Holden, were you able to work out what we discussed last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had a problem,\u201d he answers. \u201cIsaiah\u2019s talent made it easy.\u201d</p><p>My head whirls in his direction. He\u2019s not a man to give praise lightly.</p><p>\u201cI talked to the owner of Pro Performance.\u201d Mr. Holden speaks directly to me now. \u201cHe\u2019ll give you a shot at a full-time job when you graduate.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Holden and I have talked over this possibility several times. Pro Performance deals with high-end cars and suped-up dragsters. It\u2019s my dream job, but the business has one request that I can\u2019t grant. \u201cWhat about the internship?\u201d</p><p>To earn the full-time job, I\u2019d have to intern with them this semester. Being an intern means no cash, and I need money.</p><p>\u201cYou can work at Pro Performance on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons when you\u2019d typically be taking my classes. You can keep your job at Tom\u2019s shop in the evenings and complete the internship during the day. The guy at Pro Performance will give us a grade on the work you do there. Mrs. Collins is calling it an outside classroom experience.\u201d</p><p>My mind goes blank. There\u2019s no way this is happening to me. I can make money and I have a shot at my dream: working on cars that go fast\u2014very fast. \u201cAre you fucking with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The only other requirement is to become ASE certified by graduation, which should be a breeze for you.\u201d</p><p>The ASE\u2014the Automotive Service Excellence certification. I\u2019ve been studying for that exam and earning hours in the garage toward the certification for over two years.</p><p>Mrs. Collins raises her hand in the air. \u201cActually, there\u2019s another requirement. The business in question called me to verify Isaiah\u2019s credits and grades. They mentioned something about needing three letters of recommendation.\u201d</p><p>The back of my head hits the wall. I can come up with two letters. One from Mr. Holden. Another from my current place of employment. A third? Adults tend to avoid me. I never should have allowed hope.</p><p>Mr. Holden knows me better than most. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one. Tom will, too,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you think of one more?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Collins mutters, \u201cWho is a responsible adult who knows what Isaiah is capable of?\u201d</p><p>I hate that woman. I really do. How can Echo and Noah stomach her?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Courtney has been so silent that I forgot about her. \u201cOne condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d I rub my neck to relieve the building pressure.</p><p>\u201cYou answer my phone calls and you meet with me when I ask.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Collins barely contains her excitement. This meeting was never a bluff. The head-shrinker held a full house the entire time.</p><p>With her hands in her lap, Courtney waits patiently for my answer. I hate being on a leash. All I want is freedom\u2014to be out from underneath everything that holds me down. With Courtney, I won\u2019t just be on a damn leash; she\u2019ll keep me on a choke collar. But this opportunity is a once-in-a-lifetime shot. The money Pro Performance pays their mechanics is sweet. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Courtney flashes a smile that\u2019s all teeth. \u201cExcellent. Our first meeting will be next Thursday. Right after school.\u201d</p><p>Feeling the grip of a leash choking my neck, I grab at the collar of my T-shirt. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Courtney stands. \u201cMrs. Collins, thank you for the invite. I need to run, though. Staff meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk again soon,\u201d answers Mrs. Collins as Courtney goes out the door.</p><p>Mr. Holden leaves without acknowledging anyone. The sound of the second hand ticking is the only noise in the room. Mrs. Collins relaxes back in her chair and folds her hands over her lap. \u201cNow that we\u2019re alone, is there anything you\u2019d like to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything about your foster parents or Noah or where you\u2019ve been staying the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drift to the tricked-out compass tattooed on the inside of my right arm. \u201cWhat does your tattoo mean?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing that concerns you.\u201d She needs to steer clear of what\u2019s personal. \u201cYou think you\u2019re slick setting me up so that Courtney can keep tabs on me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A satisfied smile crosses her lips. \u201cOccasionally I can be crafty. Regardless of how you see yourself, you\u2019re still a minor. The system may not be perfect, but it exists to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Spoken by a lady who wasn\u2019t raised in the nonperfect system since she was six. The clock ticks. She breaks the silence. \u201cIt was interesting what you said earlier.\u201d</p><p>My muscles tense. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said everything leaves.\u201d</p><p>Not interested in being analyzed, I switch the topic. \u201cCan I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d she says in a soothing voice that probably puts insomniacs to sleep. \u201cEcho trusts me and so does Noah.\u201d</p><p>Echo and Noah needed help. Hell, they had problems that could be fixed. \u201cI ain\u2019t them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes bore into mine. \u201cYou\u2019re not, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t help.\u201d</p> <p>I push off the wall. \u201cActually, that\u2019s exactly what it means.\u201d And I leave.</p><p>Irritated, I punch a streamer hanging from the ceiling. I\u2019m late for sixth period. Mrs. Collins would have written me a note, but I\u2019d rather risk detention than stay in the same room with her. I turn the corner and skid to a halt when I spot Abby on the floor next to my locker.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you showed,\u201d I say. She already skipped two days this week. Her head jerks up and her wide eyes freak me out. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Abby quickly stands. \u201cIt\u2019s Eric. He found Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>Rachel</p> <p>WORTHINGTON PRIVATE HAS A HUGE parking lot, and because of the sheer number of students that own cars, the administration permits overflow parking near the football stadium. This is where I park every morning\u2014a few feet from the ticket booth. My brothers, on the other hand, who drive separately because of their millions of after-school activities, park as close as they can to the front doors without a handicap sticker.</p><p>By parking here, I don\u2019t have to worry about some idiot with a driver\u2019s permit hitting my car or some overzealous door opener scratching my paint. I can also sit by myself without people gawking at the lone Young sibling who doesn\u2019t have their act together.</p><p>The last number on the clock radio changes and my mouth dries out. Today\u2019s going to be awful. I grab my backpack off the passenger seat, slide out the door and shiver against the January air. The first rays of dawn glimmer against the frost on the grass.</p><p>The pressure inside me feels like an elevator filled with sludge slowly rising to the top floor. The doors are begging to be opened so everything can spill out.</p><p>Jack and Gavin have been relentless about me helping Mom with the charity. Dad reminded me this morning that my answer is due to him this afternoon and said he knew I\u2019d make the right decision. The overpowering combination of my two oldest brothers\u2019 pressure and West and Ethan urging me to accept Dad\u2019s offer edges me toward insanity. All of it is a perfect recipe for a panic attack, and I can\u2019t have another one with Ethan watching me like a hawk.</p><p>\u201cRachel Young,\u201d says a voice behind me.</p><p>I don\u2019t know this voice. Scanning the overflow lot, I realize how alone I am. Rays of the sun peek around the school, but darkness still owns most of the sky. I slowly turn and suck in a breath when I recognize a face I never thought I would see again. It\u2019s the guy from the drag race. The one that scared me. It\u2019s Eric.</p><p>A flood of adrenaline flows through my body. For some, adrenaline makes them stronger and sharpens their reactions. The rush causes me to freeze. I consider screaming, but even if I regained control of the muscles in my throat, would anyone hear me? From the main parking lot, bass lines pound from several expensive cars with even more expensive sound systems.</p> <p>It\u2019s frightening seeing Eric. At the drag race he fit in, but here, among guys who wear white shirts and ties to school, he looks...terrifying. He\u2019s tall, blond, and his body is more bones than muscle, like this skinny man I saw once in a drug prevention video. My heart quickens its pace. Why is he here? How does he know my name?</p><p>\u201cRachel Young,\u201d he says again. \u201cYou have something of mine.\u201d</p><p>My head shakes back and forth and then I wonder if it\u2019s my body shaking. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything of yours.\u201d</p><p>He tips a hand to his ear. \u201cWhat was that? I didn\u2019t hear you. You should speak up.\u201d</p><p>The smile on his face says he\u2019s mocking me, but I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve done nothing to him.</p><p>Eric invades my personal space and I beg my feet to move. Instead, I become stone embedded in the ground. My breath comes out faster and I can\u2019t draw in enough air to compensate for the loss. He reaches in my direction and touches my hair. His hand is ashy, cracked in spots, and I want so badly for him to disappear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty,\u201d he says. My gold hair falls from his fingers like rain. \u201cAnd you played the innocent act well. I bought it then, but I won\u2019t buy it now. Give me my fucking money or I\u2019ll have my boys put you in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>My voice trembles. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d he snaps. His anger gives me the courage to stumble back.</p><p>He advances on me with his hand waving in the air. \u201cThe cops can\u2019t touch me. Your parents can\u2019t touch me. But I can touch you. The only thing that will stop that from happening is if you give me my money.\u201d</p><p>The world spins and all the thoughts in my head jumble together. I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t. Instinctively, my arms wrap around my stomach as I sway.</p><p>Rough hands grab my face and all I see are eyes with no soul. \u201cHell no. You\u2019re not going down. Give me my money or tell me where it is.\u201d</p><p>My stomach lurches and a high-pitched buzzing washes away his voice. I can\u2019t think. I can\u2019t breathe. Eric tightens his hold on my chin, creating pain, making me unable to open my mouth for air. He\u2019s going to crush my skull.</p><p>My airways no longer work. Small lights flutter in the periphery, and Eric\u2019s mouth moves as if he\u2019s yelling. I can\u2019t hear him over the loud humming in my head. I close my eyes. A hand clamps on my shoulder and shakes me as if I\u2019m a doll. The buzzing shifts into roaring.</p><p>The pressure on my chin, on my shoulder, disappears\u2014leaving me floating in nothing until gravity forces me to the ground. I crumple\u2014gasping. I convulse with the dry heaves. Blood pounds at every pressure point. I retch forward and place my hands on the cold blacktop to keep my face from hitting the loose rocks.</p><p>I suck in air and the sound is a wheeze. I draw air in again, lift my head, and through disoriented tunnel vision I spot a shadow throwing Eric against my car. Someone has come for me. A savior.</p><p>He turns and I know those eyes. Isaiah. \u201cRachel!\u201d</p><p>I sit back on my knees and waver when a fresh flash of dizziness disorients me.</p><p>With a fist curled into the material of Eric\u2019s coat and an arm shoved into his windpipe, Isaiah slams Eric into my car. \u201cWhat the fuck did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>Eric speaks as if he, too, is having trouble breathing. \u201cMake your move, my brother. But if you do, you better kill me because you will not like my retaliation.\u201d</p><p>Lifetimes stretch as Isaiah stares into Eric\u2019s eyes. With a final push, Isaiah releases him. \u201cStay away from her.\u201d</p><p>Eric smooths out his shirt and readjusts his coat. He leans into Isaiah. \u201cI am not your enemy. That girl\u2014\u201d he points at me \u201c\u2014stole what\u2019s mine. Stop thinking with your dick and get your head in the game. That was your money, too.\u201d</p><p>The staring continues and Eric glances away first. Isaiah rounds on me, and I fall back onto my bottom in terror. This isn\u2019t the guy who protected me in the bar and kissed me in his apartment. Like a thundercloud racing across the sky, he\u2019s massive, strong, and he\u2019s moving my way. The muscles in his arms ripple as he stalks.</p><p>My breath continues to pump in and out in shallow intervals. Isaiah crouches next to me. His eyes a gray storm; his expression cold, flat. \u201cRachel.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t remember his voice sounding gruff. I don\u2019t remember him being this frightening.</p><p>He lifts his hand and hesitates when I shudder. His lips press together in a line. \u201cHe will pay for touching you.\u201d</p><p>Several feet behind Isaiah, Eric calls out, \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready to discuss this situation, I\u2019ll be standing right here.\u201d</p><p>My eyes dart behind Isaiah\u2019s shoulder, but Isaiah shifts so that he fills my line of sight. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, Rachel. You need to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Trust him. His eyes soften to liquid silver, and for the first time I can inhale a lungful of air. And I smell him: his calming scent of spices. Isaiah did scare me before\u2014when I first met him, but then he saved me, like he\u2019s doing now.</p><p>I nod and Isaiah caresses my cheek. His fingers are warm against my freezing skin.</p><p>\u201cI need you strong, okay?\u201d he whispers. \u201cEric thrives off of weakness. I need you to stand and let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>I lick my dry lips and test my voice. \u201cHe said I have his money.\u201d He said he\u2019s going to hurt me. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah places his finger over my lips. My heart stutters. It\u2019s a calming touch, yet equally strong. \u201cI know. I\u2019ll fix everything.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t call. It\u2019s what I want to say, but for now, I accept Isaiah\u2019s offered hand and rise on trembling legs.</p><p>Isaiah partially obstructs Eric\u2019s view of me and crosses his arms over his chest. I let the fingers of my right hand rest on his left shoulder blade. Isaiah peeks at me and tilts his head to let me know that my touch is welcomed. I exhale in relief. I need this connection. I need his strength.</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk, Eric,\u201d says Isaiah. \u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>In a sloppy posture, Eric leans to the left with his hands in his jeans pockets. \u201cHer boys fingered her yesterday. They said she was involved in the robbery and that she has my money.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to protest, but a glare from Isaiah instills silence. \u201cThose weren\u2019t her boys and she wasn\u2019t involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe showed with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they abandoned her when the cops came. Rachel and I had to fly through the back alleys to keep from getting caught. She stuck her neck out for me. I owe her a debt.\u201d</p><p>That obviously wasn\u2019t news Eric was prepared to hear. He scratches his jaw. \u201cYou owe her a debt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Isaiah simply.</p><p>A wan smile slants Eric\u2019s lips. \u201cYou never owe people.\u201d</p><p>Becoming a statue, Isaiah says nothing in return. My fingers relax so that my palm connects with his back. Even through his shirt, my hand soaks in his warmth and energy. I focus on the steady movement of his breathing. In...and out. In...and out. A rhythm that shows no fear.</p><p>\u201cThey stole five thousand dollars from me,\u201d says Eric. \u201cAnd I want it back. I don\u2019t care who pays for it or how. No one steals from me, and that message needs to be public.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSend a message all you want, but leave Rachel out of it.\u201d</p><p>Eric advances on Isaiah.

No one makes me look like a fool!\u201d</p><p>The finger slowly descends, but Eric stays in Isaiah\u2019s face.

No one doubts your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d Eric snarls.</p> <p>\u201cI think tire irons and baseball bats against skin is convincing to everyone.\u201d</p><p>Eric backs away from Isaiah and glances at me. \u201cIs she yours?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah remains silent.</p><p>Eric slides to the side, acting as if he\u2019ll skirt around Isaiah in order to be close to me, but he halts the moment Isaiah speaks. \u201cGo near her and you\u2019ll join those boys in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Dangerous\u2014both of them are. But Isaiah would scare me more if he wasn\u2019t protecting me. My eyes dart between them. The two males before me are barely civilized animals fighting for dominance and control.</p> <p>Eric regards Isaiah. \u201cShe showed with them so people think she was involved. If I don\u2019t act on her then people will believe that I have a weakness. She won\u2019t go unpunished. If she gives me my money, I\u2019ll wipe her slate clean. My decision is made. Short of killing me, Isaiah, you aren\u2019t changing my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t pay?\u201d asks Isaiah.</p><p>Eric flashes a smile full of teeth. \u201cShe is pretty.\u201d</p><p>I swallow a dry heave and slap a hand over my mouth.</p><p>A muscle in Isaiah\u2019s jaw tics. \u201cI\u2019ll take on her debt.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p> <p>Isaiah</p><p>MY STOMACH BOTTOMS OUT WITH the last words I said: I\u2019ll take on her debt. Five thousand dollars or Eric will own me for life. Hell, with those words, he owns me now.</p><p>I risk breaking eye contact with Eric for a brief second to observe my surroundings. His threat to me earlier, that I either kill him or walk away, indicated he wasn\u2019t alone. Sure enough, back in the main parking lot, two of his most trusted guards watch.</p><p>Eric laughs, yet I find nothing funny. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a strange turn of events. Isaiah Walker, the guy who owes nobody nothing, takes on a debt for a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes at the sound of my name from Rachel\u2019s mouth. She wants reassurance, and I can\u2019t console her. Not with Eric inspecting my every movement. He already knows I care about Rachel, and that\u2019s bad for both of us. She just became a liability.</p><p>I try to repress any thoughts of Rachel: her beauty, her kindness, how frightened she was when I found her. Emotions are evil. Ice water needs to flow in my veins. \u201cNo girl should face your wrath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eric says in mock disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re selling yourself to me so I won\u2019t hit a girl. Sell your shit someplace else.\u201d</p> <p>This situation hovers between dangerous and deadly. Eric will use her against me if he realizes Rachel\u2019s more than someone I owe. He\u2019ll keep me as a dog on a chain, wielding her as a weapon. I can\u2019t do that to myself. Dammit. I can\u2019t do that to her. Because, God help us both, I do care. \u201cShe means nothing. I owe her a debt for saving me, and like you said yourself, I don\u2019t owe debts.\u201d</p><p>Her hand drops from my back and I hear her sharp intake of air. Eric\u2019s observant eyes catch her reaction, and he\u2019s discovered a new person to toy with. \u201cSo she was a fuck.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve had enough of this. \u201cWhen\u2019s the money due?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Even if Rachel did have five thousand dollars, which I doubt, she wouldn\u2019t have it in her pocket. \u201cI need longer.\u201d</p><p>Eric rolls one shoulder as if we\u2019re debating the cost of an item at a yard sale instead of my life and her safety. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve always liked you, two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix. And if she doesn\u2019t pay I take her car and I own you. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Crystal. Because, for Eric and his crew, the beating is the payment. The taking of the car is for kicks. \u201cNo one touches her, Eric.\u201d</p><p>Having accomplished what he came for, Eric pulls his keys out of his pocket and strolls toward the main parking lot. \u201cAs long as someone pays. But if you don\u2019t...\u201d He looks over his shoulder and slides his eyes over Rachel. My fingers curl with the thoughts of strangling him. \u201cFor you, pretty girl, I promise there won\u2019t be baseball bats involved.\u201d</p><p>I watch him until he drives off, then examine Rachel. She\u2019s so beautiful it hurts. Golden blond hair flows past her shoulders. Those gorgeous violet eyes shouldn\u2019t be so wide with fear. I\u2019ve dreamed of being this close to her again. I ache to gather her in my arms and keep her safe from the world...to be her protector, but I can\u2019t be that man.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Rachel moves her head as a yes, but the answer\u2019s no. After being touched by Eric, how can she be fine? I run my hand over my head. Just fuck. \u201cGet in the car.\u201d</p><p>Rachel fidgets with the oversize buttons on her black coat, then readjusts her skirt, drawing my attention to her bare legs. Her warm breaths billow out into the air as white fog. \u201cI\u2019m late for school.\u201d</p><p>So am I. \u201cYou and I need to skip today.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s difficult to discern her head shaking no as her body shudders from the cold. \u201cMy parents will kill me.\u201d</p><p>I rub my eyes with both hands. \u201cEric will actually kill us both. My car\u2014now.\u201d</p><p>Without looking at me, Rachel retrieves her backpack and heads to the passenger side of my black Mustang. The driver\u2019s side door hangs open and the engine still purrs. When I cut into the overflow lot, I saw his hands on her and my whole world went red.</p><p>She slams her door shut before I have a chance to go around and close it for her. I don\u2019t want her to hate me. I don\u2019t want her to fear me. But she witnessed who I really am, and now there\u2019s no avoiding reality.</p><p>I slide into my seat and put my car into First. \u201cCan your brother cover for you at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she barely whispers. \u201cMaybe.\u201d Rachel pulls a phone out of her pack. The screen brightens as she powers it on, and I notice her go completely still. \u201cYou called.\u201d</p><p>A lot. Every half hour since Abby told me that Eric had found her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI turned my phone off.\u201d An edge of hurt creeps into her tone. I want to reassure her that we\u2019ll be okay. But I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Rachel types into her cell. We drive in silence as she stares at the phone, possibly waiting for a reply. It chirps and she sighs with relief. \u201cMy twin, Ethan, says he\u2019ll cover for me, but he wants to know why I\u2019m ditching.\u201d</p><p>Tell him I\u2019m saving your life. I shift gears as I hit the freeway heading downtown. There\u2019s only one place I can think to take her to guarantee her safety.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I tug at my bottom loop earring. \u201cTo the police station.\u201d</p><p>Her hair flies as she whips her head to face me. \u201cTo the... Where? No!\u201d she screeches. \u201cNo. We can\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><p>Time to be honest with her. \u201cWe aren\u2019t. You are. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><p>One of her hands grips the edge of her seat. The other holds on to the door. The knuckles on both her hands fade to white. \u201cThere has to be another way. The police will call my parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter grounded than in the hospital,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah...\u201d</p><p>I cut her off. \u201cDo you have five thousand dollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says quickly.</p><p>\u201cDo you own the papers to your car?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head this time.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d I force calm even though everything inside me writhes in rage. I want to fix this. Dammit, I want to fix us. \u201cGo to the police. Tell them you made a mistake and street raced once. Tell them that the guy who took the bets threatened you if you don\u2019t race for him again. And for Christ\u2019s sake, don\u2019t name names. Tell them you never learned anyone\u2019s name. Tell them you were scared to death.\u201d</p><p>We breeze by a row of tractor trailers, and I press harder on the gas. We\u2019re cruising at seventy. My eyes narrow on the road. I itch to hit eighty and then ninety. I crave speed.</p><p>Her hands flutter in the air, signaling impending hysterics. \u201cWhat will that accomplish, besides upsetting my parents?\u201d</p><p>I shift down and reluctantly reduce my speed when I spot the exit. \u201cThe police have been after Eric for a year. They know who he is and what he\u2019s capable of. The moment you say drag racing and threatened, they\u2019ll put the pieces together. They\u2019ll protect you in ways I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She draws in several quick breaths. \u201cHe threatened you, too. Why aren\u2019t you going to come with me?\u201d</p><p>I flex my fingers then grip the wheel again. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not a snitch.\u201d</p><p>Rachel straightens in her seat and the spark of attitude that I remember from the night we met flashes. \u201cAnd I am?\u201d</p><p>Off the freeway, I turn the wheel sharply to the left, coast into an abandoned parking lot and cut the engine. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to live by the rules I live by. Those streets you played in one time are my home. I don\u2019t get to go back to a gated community when I decide I\u2019m done slumming. You street raced and you got burned. I\u2019m trying to make sure you don\u2019t die from your mistakes. So what if you don\u2019t get to go to a dance because you\u2019re grounded. You\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes brim with tears. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. This will crush my mom. It\u2019s my job to make everything in her life all right. She can\u2019t know. This would destroy her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Rachel,\u201d I yell. \u201cYou can\u2019t be this fucking dense!\u201d</p><p>Her door opens and she darts out of the car. I slam my hand on the steering wheel and bolt after her. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchool!\u201d she shouts. With one foot in front of the other, she heads across the lot\u2014in the wrong direction.</p><p>\u201cGet back in the fucking car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019ll figure this out. It\u2019s not your debt, it\u2019s mine. Leave me alone!\u201d</p><p>I stalk after her, grab her arm and swing her around. My face lowers to her. \u201cDo you think this is a game? Do you think that you can ignore this and it will go away? It won\u2019t, Rachel. He knows who you are and where you go to school. Eric will never stop tracking you until he gets what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop swearing at me!\u201d Her entire body trembles. Back is the terrified girl from the bar after she got pegged by the beer. Maybe her life is more complicated than I thought.</p><p>Rachel jerks her arm in a pathetic attempt at freedom, but I hold tight. She has to understand the dangers of this situation.</p><p>\u201cTake your hands off of me,\u201d she yells. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t live near you, but that doesn\u2019t make me stupid. He threatened me. Not you. You want me to go the police and I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll do this on my own.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On her own? She\u2019ll get herself killed, and that\u2019ll take my already-serious problems with Eric into the realm of lethal. If he hurts her, he\u2019ll die. And then his boys will hunt me like a dog and take me down. My goal is to get us the fuck out of this situation without all that Romeo and Juliet bullshit.</p><p>Both of my hands slide up to her shoulders. \u201cDo you know what some of the gangs in town do for initiation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The hysteria leaves for a second as she tries to understand my question.</p><p>\u201cThey have to rape someone.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes study my face. \u201cWhat does that have to do with Eric? With me?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate, the words frozen on my tongue. His boys could rape you, Rachel. I brought this up on purpose\u2014so that she\u2019ll understand the lethal reality of Eric. To push her away from me, toward the cops. But the innocence and terror in her eyes stop me. Is it possible to spook an angel to death?</p><p>I should resist, but it\u2019s like I\u2019m physically drawn to her. I loosen my grip and allow one hand to caress her cheek. Her skin burns under my touch. \u201cYou\u2019re in danger, and without five thousand dollars, I can\u2019t protect you from my world.\u201d</p><p>Beneath me, Rachel\u2019s body crumples in defeat. She sways, and I wrap an arm around her to keep her from collapsing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give him my car,\u201d she whispers. \u201cIt\u2019s worth three times that amount.\u201d</p> <p>My thumb traces the path of her cheekbone. I\u2019ve missed her. I\u2019ll miss her again when she sees I\u2019m right about the police. \u201cIf Eric wanted your car, he would have taken your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he said...\u201d she starts with a mixture of exhaustion and frustration.</p><p>She\u2019s searching for hope, and I have none to offer. There\u2019s no pot at the end of the rainbow. No spell that will undo what\u2019s been done. This isn\u2019t a fairy tale, but a nightmare. \u201cHe said he\u2019d take your car if you don\u2019t pay the debt. He meant after he beats the life out of me and\u2014\u201d rapes \u201c\u2014hurts you. This isn\u2019t about the money. This is about control.\u201d</p><p>Her body presses against my arm for release, and I let her go. She stumbles back and I silently curse myself. I gave her the truth, but it\u2019s a truth a girl like her should\u2019ve never heard. Her chest moves rapidly, and she claws at the material of her sweater as if she\u2019s choking. I understand. With each passing second, I feel the noose Eric placed on me tightening.</p><p>Rachel\u2019s lower lip quivers and the words tumble out. \u201cI can\u2019t go to the police.\u201d Her eyes snap shut and the way she fights to keep tears from falling rips me in half. \u201cMy family will hate me and I\u2019ll destroy her. Making her happy is the only reason I\u2019m alive.\u201d</p><p>Her words make no sense, but the pure agony underlying her tone tells me she means them. She yanks again at her sweater, threatening to tear it. \u201cWhy is this happening?\u201d</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter why. It\u2019s happening. I close the distance between us and fold her smaller body into mine. She fights me at first\u2014her fists knock against my chest. Each swipe stings, but it\u2019s nothing like the hurt beating at me because of her pain. Eventually, she stops hitting and rests her forehead on my chest. Her body quakes with sobs.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I kiss the top of her head. The early-morning sun warms her hair and I linger so I can inhale the delicious scent of jasmine mixed with salty waves. I gave her up once and touching her like this again... I refuse to abandon her again. She needs me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix this.\u201d I have no idea how, but I can\u2019t stomach her tears. \u201cGive me twenty-four hours and I\u2019ll have a way to fix this.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Rachel</p><p>STANDING IN THE GARAGE AT home, I stare at Isaiah\u2019s phone number programmed into my cell. Isaiah said that he\u2019ll fix things with Eric, but what does that mean for us? For our relationship? Or our lack of a relationship? If he had given me his number last week I would have been full of joy. Now\u2014I feel tired.</p><p>Isaiah told Eric I was a debt.</p> <p>Eric called me a fuck.</p><p>I close my eyes and cringe at that last word. Was Isaiah right? He called me dense. I have to be, because I honestly believed that the kiss in his apartment meant something to him. That our moment together, that my first kiss, was more than a lead-in to...to...sex.</p><p>With a sigh, I swing my pack over my shoulder and head to the house. It\u2019s early. Not even ten yet. There\u2019s no way I can return to school, not when my mind\u2019s a turbulent mess over Eric and Isaiah and five thousand dollars. It all seems overwhelming and impossible. It probably is, but Isaiah told me not to worry. He told me to have hope. I\u2019m torn between the two emotions.</p><p>The same words circle in my head: I\u2019m a debt. I. Am. A. Debt.</p><p>I unlock the back door, enter the kitchen and disable the alarm. Dad\u2019s at work, West and Ethan are at school, Mom is...who knows where. My fingers brush where Isaiah stroked my cheek before we parted ways. My heart flutters and then crashes to a halt. I\u2019m a debt. A debt.</p><p>Eric pops into my mind and my skin crawls because he touched my hair. My head starts to ache. What I need is a hot, pounding shower and a new train of thought.</p><p>I\u2019m a debt.</p><p>\u201cRach? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>A jolt of shock causes me to drop my backpack and turn. My oldest brother, Gavin, stands next to the pantry, a bag of chips in his hand. It\u2019s just Gavin! I scream in my mind, but after Eric, everything seems like a threat. Especially Gavin. My brother is huge: played football in college and was good at it, too. He\u2019s smart and opinionated and he just plain intimidates me.</p><p>\u201cI asked what you were doing here,\u201d he demands.</p><p>My fingers twine and untwine. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel good so I came home.\u201d The lie comes easily. Guilt follows.</p><p>His eyes lower to my pack on the floor by my feet. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to sign yourself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never made it into school. I sat in the parking lot until I felt well enough to come home.\u201d Please believe me. Please believe me.</p><p>\u201cDoes Mom know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Crap. Mom. I\u2019m not ready to face Mom. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell her. Is she here?\u201d</p><p>Gavin scratches the back of his head, and the chip bag crackles in his hand. I glance around the kitchen and realize that everything about this moment is wrong. \u201cWhere\u2019s the staff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom gives them Friday mornings off,\u201d he says.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know that. \u201cAnd Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should go upstairs if you aren\u2019t feeling good.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, because Gavin always looks out for my best interests\u2014and by always I mean never. \u201cWhat are you doing here? Don\u2019t you have a job?\u201d</p><p>The bag crackles again, and that\u2019s when I notice a gym bag full of food on the floor. And the jeans he\u2019s wearing...and T-shirt. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Gavin drops the chips and steps in my direction. Remembering Eric, I stumble back. I\u2019ve already been threatened by one guy today. I don\u2019t want to be threatened by another. Faster than me, because let\u2019s face it, who isn\u2019t, Gavin grabs my wrist to steady me as I ram into the fridge.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Rach. What\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d He doesn\u2019t wait for my response as he continues, \u201cI lost my job.\u201d</p><p>All of me sinks. \u201cOh, Gavin. I\u2019m sorry. When?\u201d Gavin became an energy broker after college. Mom and Dad were so proud. As Mom announced at parties: one in medical school\u2014referencing Jack\u2014and one moving straight to the top in business.</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks ago,\u201d he rushes out. \u201cI\u2019ll find something else soon.\u201d</p><p>My head tilts as I understand. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told Mom and Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad knows.\u201d He omits that Mom doesn\u2019t and frees my wrist. \u201cHe wants to tell Mom after you agree to speak at the fundraisers. That way she\u2019ll be in a good place, not a bad one.\u201d</p><p>I try to rub away the worry lines forming on my forehead. Why is it always on me to fix everything? \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s not fair,\u201d he snaps. \u201cWhen are you going to grow up and accept that?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s too much. All of it. Eric and money and Isaiah and now Gavin. \u201cI never asked for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I did?\u201d Gavin says. \u201cDo you think this is the life that Jack and I wanted? To watch our sister die? To watch Mom\u2019s soul die? But it\u2019s what we got. We all have roles to play, Rachel, and I\u2019m tired of having to remind you of yours.\u201d</p><p>His hands go to his hips, a certain sign of an impending lecture, but at least he softens his tone. \u201cLook, we all know you\u2019re the best of us. You\u2019re sweet, kind, possibly the only one of us who has the natural ability to stay out of trouble. So why are you being so selfish? You can make Mom happy and you\u2019re choosing not to. You\u2019re a better person than that.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not. My arm brushes against the handle of the fridge as I withdraw farther from him.</p><p>My fingers massage the painful pulse that\u2019s penetrated the frontal lobe of my brain. Gavin dips his head to look me in the eye. I\u2019m not afraid he\u2019ll see a lie. I really do feel awful. My stomach gurgles with distress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not looking good, kid,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you want me to stick around? Watch some movies with you?\u201d</p><p>My lips fall into a frown and tremble. Gavin loves me and all I do is lie.</p><p>\u201cAh, Rach. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He envelops me in a bone-breaking bear hug. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I yelled and I\u2019m sorry that you don\u2019t feel good. I\u2019ve just got a lot on my plate right now.\u201d</p><p>I rest my head on his shoulder. Gavin loves me. He always has, just in his big-brother way. Would Eric hurt them, my family? Or would Gavin be able to scare off this threat if I told him? \u201cHave you ever been in trouble?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Gavin releases me. \u201cAre you scared Mom\u2019s going to be upset that you came home from school without asking? Rach, I swear, you look like shit. She\u2019s not going to care. Well, she\u2019ll care, but in the obsessive way and not the pissed way.\u201d</p><p>And I\u2019m reminded that once more everything is about Mom\u2019s reaction and that my brothers could never imagine me in trouble. \u201cI\u2019m going to go lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay if you want,\u201d he says as I pick up my pack and turn for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not sure anything will be okay again. I\u2019m slow on my way up the stairs. I\u2019ve run this staircase a million times. Slid down the banister until Mom caught me at the age of seven. Today, my legs throb as if I\u2019m climbing a mountain.</p><p>Five thousand dollars. How will Isaiah and I find five thousand dollars?</p><p>At the top of the stairs, I take a left, away from the four rooms that currently house West and Ethan and the two other rooms where Jack and Gavin used to live. I pass one of the guest bedrooms and a sickening nausea claws through my bloodstream at the sight of the cracked door of the room across from mine. There\u2019s only one person who goes into Colleen\u2019s room\u2014Mom.</p><p>Leaving my backpack leaning against my door frame, I inhale slowly and peek into the room I wish would disappear. The walls are pink, Colleen\u2019s favorite color. The canopy bed is perfectly made. One doll and one stuffed bear still wait on the pillow for their owner to return. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A dollhouse-sized perfect replica of our house sits on the floor. Like always, within the dollhouse, the figure meant to represent Mom lies next to the figurine meant to represent Colleen. My brothers told me that Mom slept with Colleen during the last weeks of her life and that Mom never stopped praying for a miracle.</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d a small voice that hardly sounds like my mother whispers from the room. Gavin must not have realized she\u2019d come home. I swallow to calm my nerves. I hate this room, and I hate entering it even more.</p><p>I nudge the door open and the hinges squeak painfully. With her legs curled underneath her, Mom slides her hand against the soft, shaggy white throw rug lying near the dollhouse. In her other hand, she clutches a baby-pink fleece blanket just the right size for a newborn. Her blue eyes are hollow as she regards me. \u201cWhat are you doing home?\u201d</p><p>The thumb of my left hand pushes against the sweating palm of my right. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well.\u201d</p> <p>Worry consumes her face, and I force myself to enter the room to keep her from bolting off the floor. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say. \u201cJust a headache.\u201d</p><p>She gets on her knees. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had a migraine in years.\u201d Because a migraine is typically the aftermath of a panic attack.</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d Bold-faced lie. I step closer to the rug and flutter my hands in a downward movement to indicate she should stay where she is. \u201cIt\u2019s a fluke. Probably my period.\u201d</p><p>The conflict of whether to overanalyze my health or to stay where she feels a connection with Colleen wages war on her face. What I dread the most happens. Mom decides she can\u2019t choose and wants both. She extends her hand to me and I notice that her long fingernails are a freshly painted pink. I kick off my shoes, accept her hand and join her on the rug. Does Mom know she still holds the blanket she brought Colleen home from the hospital in?</p><p>Mom surveys the room. Porcelain dolls perfectly dressed in ruffles and lace line several shelves. The only indication that Colleen made it anywhere near thirteen is the ancient Discman with headphones resting on the bedside table alongside of her diary and a book opened to the last page Colleen read.</p> <p>\u201cI dreamed of her last night.\u201d Mom squeezes my hand. \u201cShe was calling to me and no matter how hard I tried, I could never find her.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m here. Right beside you. Look at me. See me. I exert pressure back. The gesture does nothing to rip her away from the nightmare imprisoning her mind.</p><p>\u201cI always wonder if Colleen\u2019s death was a punishment for my past sins,\u201d she says.</p><p>My muscles tense with edginess, the same feeling as if I\u2019m teetering on a ledge. Mom behaves like this sometimes. Her body here, but her mind far-off. She says things that make me unable to breathe. Mom\u2019s hand tightens around mine and I suddenly feel claustrophobic.</p><p>\u201cI made mistakes,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I was younger. Before I met your father. Colleen was such a good girl. So good...\u201d</p><p>Look at me, Mom. I\u2019m your daughter and I\u2019m right here. \u201cMom?\u201d</p> <p>She blinks and turns her head, the glow of life back in her blue eyes. I suck in a relieved breath. Mom tucks my hair over my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re such a good girl, too.\u201d</p><p>My eyes shut. I\u2019m not. I defied curfew, drag raced and now owe five thousand dollars to a guy my mother would faint at the sight of. I\u2019m in danger, I\u2019m putting Isaiah in danger and I\u2019m risking my mother\u2019s\u2014my family\u2019s\u2014happiness because I am not a good girl. I\u2019m exactly who Gavin described: I\u2019m selfish.</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d A lump forms in my throat. \u201cDad told me about the amazing opportunity to help with the Leukemia Foundation. I...I want to speak on Colleen\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s face explodes into a smile. Her blue eyes glitter like light dancing on the ocean. She abandons the blanket and hugs me. Reactions like this from Mom are, in theory, what I live for, but I can\u2019t enjoy it. Being in Colleen\u2019s room, understanding what I just agreed to, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve agreed to a death sentence and I\u2019ve become numb.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>I PACE OUTSIDE THE SHOP, feeling restless, a little wild.</p><p>Eric.</p> <p>Rachel.</p><p>Five thousand dollars.</p><p>I slide my hand over the tiger tattooed over my right biceps. Eric\u2019s not the first predator I\u2019ve been up against.</p><p>I went to the zoo once in elementary school on a field trip. Being the smallest kid in the class, I never saw much other than the back of someone\u2019s head. The zoo had built a towering three-story glass house over the tiger\u2019s habitat. Everyone else in class ran to the top to watch the tiger cub playing with a ball in the roughage. I stayed where I knew I belonged: on the bottom.</p><p>I leaned against the glass to stare at the worn mud tracks. This was where the tiger no one was interested in would wander. A raggedy thing, his skin hung from his body, his coat was devoid of any shine, his ear half-chewed-off\u2014he was a pathetic creature. A rescued animal, my teacher had said, that would die in the wild.</p><p>From out of nowhere, the old tiger pounced from the right, slammed both massive paws against the glass and roared. My heart tripped out of my chest; my body shook from head to toe, but I never moved and I never stopped making eye contact. The tiger paced in front of me, its head whipping with every turn, never letting me out of his turbulent gaze.</p><p>I knew in that moment, without a doubt, that I no longer wanted to be the smallest in my class, the smallest in my group home. I yearned to be this badass tiger that no one messed with. My teacher, like all adults, was dead wrong: this tiger would have ruled the wild.</p><p>I don\u2019t rule the streets. That title can belong to someone else, but no one messes with me. Eric knows this, and he\u2019s spent years trying to place me under his thumb. I won\u2019t allow that to happen, and I won\u2019t allow him to hurt Rachel.</p><p>In order to protect her, I have a plan to set in motion. A plan that hinges on the following yes. I take a deep breath and enter the shop.</p><p>The heaters in the old garage are so jacked up that it may be warmer outside. With no car on the lift and none in the parking lot, Tom, the owner of the auto shop that employs me, is short on work and long on stories. He and the full-time auto mechanic, Mack, sit in his cramped office and laugh over a shared bottle of whiskey.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah.\u201d Tom grabs his cane as if he\u2019s going to stand. Everything in the shop is old, out-of-date and paid off. Since he makes only enough to pay Mack and, occasionally, me, Tom\u2019s sole reason for keeping the place open is that his wife died a few years ago and he hates to be alone. \u201cHow was the first week back at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I wonder if he\u2019s aware that this is Saturday morning and that when I saw him yesterday I had told him the news. His mind drifts more in the past than it does the present. \u201cEastwick is going to let me intern on Tuesday and Thursdays at Pro Performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me that,\u201d he murmurs.</p><p>Tom smooths his thinning white hair and shifts back in his seat. He pats the pocket of his red flannel shirt, no doubt searching for a pack of Marlboros and a lighter even though the doctor told him to quit over a year ago. His kind light blue eyes dart as his mind sorts through the memory and the present. Today is a good day as his face brightens with the rare retained knowledge. \u201cYou told me that. They\u2019re going to give you a job when you graduate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d My gut untwists with his words. I dread the day he does forget.</p><p>The old man and Mack have been good to me. A friend of theirs fostered me for a while. Then the one good family I had left town, the system moved me to Shirley and Dale\u2019s and these two old guys got it in their head to hire me at the raw age of thirteen.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Tom says to himself and then stares at Mack. \u201cIsn\u2019t that good.\u201d</p><p>A thirty-years-served retired vet, Mack tips his Marine Corps baseball cap once in my direction. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot planning on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Mack reiterates Tom\u2019s sentiments. \u201cThat job will take you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>I glance around the sparse garage. \u201cNo work?\u201d</p><p>Mack shakes his head. Tom may own the shop, but Mack manages it. Like Tom, Mack has no need to work. He prefers the garage over his empty apartment. \u201cI finished the Chevelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I work on some side business during the day? Assuming there\u2019s nothing coming in?\u201d I doubt Rachel will be able to stay late.</p><p>Since I was fourteen, I\u2019ve done side work for friends. They find the parts; I do the manual labor in exchange for a fee, parts to supe up my own Mustang, or a debt they owe me to be paid later. The side work typically waits until the garage is officially closed at night, but with business being slow maybe they\u2019ll give on the timing.</p><p>Mack sips the whiskey from the bottle. \u201cNo problem. What are you working on?\u201d</p><p>Anything I can scavenge in order to make extra money. \u201cMy car.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cAnd a 2005 Mustang GT.\u201d</p><p>A ghost of a smile plays on Mack\u2019s lips, creating deep crevices around his mouth. \u201cFinally save enough to supe your car?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cCalling in favors.\u201d</p><p>More like I\u2019m calling in debts owed to me. Debts I saved for times when I would need help\u2014like bail. Some of those people will pay in cash. Others who don\u2019t have a cash flow can supply parts. I hate that I\u2019m using my rainy-day fund, but owing Eric could be worse than jail.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s why I\u2019m here?\u201d asks Abby from behind me.</p><p>Mack, Tom and I turn our heads. She nods at me, acknowledges Tom, and like always, ignores Mack. Mack finishes the whiskey, throws the empty bottle into the trash and leaves the office. He\u2019ll be MIA for the rest of the day. Abby\u2019s never told me why the two stare at each other from opposite sides of a battlefield, and because I respect her, I never ask.</p><p>Tom pats his pocket again, still searching for his cigarettes. \u201cKeep your politics out of my garage, Miss Abby.\u201d</p><p>Politics as in her drugs. Tom\u2019s the only person I\u2019ve seen Abby cave to. \u201cI always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d By the way Tom\u2019s eyes glaze over I can tell we\u2019ve lost him to a memory.</p><p>I head to the other side of the garage and Abby follows.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows about the deal you made with Eric,\u201d she says. \u201cHe means business, Isaiah, and he wants your head and Fuzzy Bunny\u2019s on a platter. Eric\u2019s threatened to retaliate against anyone who helps you raise the money.\u201d</p><p>Shit. That complicates things. I had hoped to raise half of the five thousand from collecting on debts. Now I\u2019ll have to rely solely on the parts. \u201cI\u2019ll respect whatever decision you make as long as you make it now. What side are you playing, Abby? Are you my friend in this or my enemy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help,\u201d she says.</p><p>I place my hands on the tool bench and lean into it. Not what I wished to hear. \u201cAbby...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you money.\u201d Her eyes flash to mine. \u201cWhat I make, I need. Eric may own some of the streets, but he doesn\u2019t own me. I\u2019ll help in what ways I can, but I still have to watch my own back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because nobody else will. She doesn\u2019t have to say that part. Because life is like that for me, too. I straighten. It\u2019s her response and I have to accept it. \u201cI have favors to call in, and I\u2019d like some help doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game.\u201d With a tilt of her chin, she falls into business mode. I hate that deadpan look, but that expression is the reason I\u2019m asking for her help. The amount of work to be accomplished would normally take weeks. I don\u2019t have weeks. I\u2019m allowing days on a job that needed to be done last night.</p><p>I snag a list from my back pocket and tell her the names of the people to visit. As she listens, her only change in expression is one eyebrow that slowly lifts and then just as slowly eases down. She shoves the list into her jeans. \u201cYou\u2019ve been busy playing Boy Scout to a lot of resourceful people.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I have. \u201cI like knowing there\u2019s help when I need it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr you could save your full house for another play and take the offer of jacking the cars. With your car knowledge you could easily steal five in a night. You\u2019d have Eric off your back and Fuzzy Bunny on your arm by the time the church doors open tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head before she finishes. \u201cI\u2019m doing this clean.\u201d Illegally street racing got me in this mess and I don\u2019t want to take the chance of screwing things up more.</p><p>\u201cClean?\u201d Her mouth flattens into a thin line. \u201cHow do you think these people are going to supply the car parts you\u2019re asking for as payment? You honestly think they\u2019re going to waltz into a store and buy them?\u201d</p><p>No. I don\u2019t. But I\u2019m all for claiming denial. \u201cLast time I\u2019m saying it. Choose now if you\u2019re going to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re cranky. What does that girl see in you?\u201d</p> <p>I have no idea. \u201cShe likes my tats.\u201d</p><p>The deadpan look washes away and she laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re a crazy son of a bitch. Fine, waste a good list like this on car parts. I\u2019ll check in later.\u201d Without another word, Abby walks out of the garage.</p><p>I run a hand over my head and contemplate calling Rachel. I crave hearing her voice again, but she\u2019ll expect answers and I only have theories. After I talk to my list of people, I\u2019ll know more and then I can tell her to come.</p><p>I\u2019m still not good enough for a girl like her, but she\u2019s back in my life and she needs someone to protect her. I\u2019ll fill the role and absorb as much of her light as I can before she leaves me behind in the darkness.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>Rachel</p> <p>WHEN I WAS FOUR I had an infatuation with electrical outlets. Dark holes that led into the wall and if I plugged something in, the machine would spring to life. Electricity! What would electricity look like? Feel like? Submitting to temptation, I stuck my finger into the socket at the moment someone turned on the vacuum. My body jolted with the shock. I learned two lessons that day. One: don\u2019t stick your finger into the socket. Two: I liked the rush.</p><p>Closing the door to my Mustang, I fumble with the buttons of my black winter coat. My blood pulses with the same buzz of electrical energy. I\u2019m going to see Isaiah.</p><p>He never called, I remind myself. Isaiah never called and he looked me square in the eye at the bar and told me he owed me a debt. The same words he said to Eric in my school\u2019s parking lot. Stop any silly daydreams that he cares. He doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m a debt to be paid. Nothing more.</p><p>The small sickly garage appears different during the day. Oddly enough, that night, this place became a beacon of light, a haven. Now, with the gray clouds hovering low in the sky and the cracks in the exterior wall, I\u2019m reminded that I\u2019m out of my element.</p><p>I pull on the heavy door and enter. Heat belonging to a jungle suffocates me and defrosts my cold fingers. My hair blows across my face as a surge of cold air encircles me when the door shuts. A radio plays music that is loud and angry and full of electric guitars. With no shirt on, Isaiah hovers over the open hood of his Mustang. Both of his hands deep within her body.</p><p>The flaming tail of the dragon I noticed on his biceps the night I first met him continues up his shoulder and curls around to his back. The green eyes of the wicked red creature peer at me like a sentry protecting his master. Near Isaiah\u2019s shoulder blade, fire snakes out of the dragon\u2019s mouth. With a socket in his hand, Isaiah works on the car in a fluid motion. The broad strong muscles in his back become more pronounced the faster he labors.</p><p>Isaiah shifts, getting a better grip on whatever he\u2019s working on. My mouth goes dry and alien sensations warm my body. Isaiah is absolutely beautiful.</p><p>My purse slips out of my hand and lands on the floor in an embarrassing thump. His head jerks up and he spots me gaping. A knowing smile slides across his lips, causing heat to creep along my cheeks. If only I could die.</p> <p>He straightens, and I try not to stare at the liquid way he moves. I grab my purse, drop it again, then snag it back off the floor. Why am I always such a mess?</p><p>\u201cHey, Rachel,\u201d he says easily in that deep voice that causes my heart to skip more beats than it should. He didn\u2019t call. He didn\u2019t call, I repeat. He doesn\u2019t want me. I\u2019m a debt.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I respond, proud I didn\u2019t stutter the small word.</p><p>Snatching his black T-shirt off the bench, Isaiah shrugs it on and indicates that I should walk in farther. \u201cSorry about the heat. It\u2019s either the tropics or the arctic. Take your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTropics,\u201d I say. \u201cI hate the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he agrees. So we have at least one thing in common, besides cars and the drag race and Eric....</p><p>I pause on the other side of the open hood and openly appreciate the machinery embedded in the frame. He was right on one thing: that\u2019s not the original engine of a \u201994 Mustang GT. \u201cYou upgraded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebuilt.\u201d Isaiah studies the car with an intensity that suggests deep thought. \u201cFound the trashed body in a junkyard when I was fourteen then spent the past couple of years smoothing out the frame and piecing together parts until I could make her run. On paper, I should be running more torque and horsepower, but too many of the parts are past their prime.\u201d</p><p>My hands sweat, not from the heat, and I clutch the strap of my purse. I swing it a little so that it hits my knees. I miss the way the two of us acted that night. I miss the idea of him liking me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say.</p><p>His eyes snap to mine. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>For not being someone you could really like. \u201cFor all of it.\u201d I lower my head and watch my purse smack my legs over and over again. \u201cI know you think you owe me, but you don\u2019t. This is my problem. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d Though I have no idea how.</p><p>His eyes darken back into the serious charcoal I remember when he swore his promise to me. \u201cThis is our problem.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a debt. He said I meant nothing. I gave Isaiah my first kiss, he never called and I\u2019m a debt. Eric called me a fuck and Isaiah silently agreed. I\u2019ve got lots of problems, and the last thing I want is to force a guy to help me because he thinks he owes me something. Not when I have feelings for him and he has none for me. Not when seeing him will continue to crush my soul. \u201cIsaiah...\u201d</p><p>He cuts me off. \u201cOne thing you should learn about me\u2014I don\u2019t argue.\u201d</p><p>The purse stops swinging. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His eyes fade into a beautiful shade of silver. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your problem. It\u2019s our problem. And I know how we\u2019re going to solve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d I ask a little breathlessly. Oh, those eyes are gorgeous. Too much heat curls along my body and with one finger, I tug at the collar of my coat.</p><p>His eyes follow the movement. \u201cYou should take off your coat,\u201d he says and my heart jumps in my chest at the thought of taking anything off in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s warm in here.\u201d</p><p>Warm. The screwed-up heater. Right. Clearing my throat, I unbutton my jacket and slide it off. Isaiah takes it from me and I feel suddenly alone and naked as he crosses the room to place it on a hook on the wall. \u201cWe\u2019re going to drag race,\u201d he announces.</p><p>I snort. \u201cBecause that worked out so well the first time.\u201d</p><p>He flashes that breathtaking smile, then it disappears so quickly I\u2019m not sure it was there to begin with. \u201cStreet racing was a mistake I don\u2019t plan on repeating, and neither will you.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah pauses as if he\u2019s waiting for me to protest. I\u2019m not. Lesson learned: no street racing. He continues, \u201cHave you ever heard of The Motor Yard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a one-eighth of a mile dragway in the southwestern part of the county.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it legal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to win us the money we need to pay off Eric.\u201d Standing in the middle of the garage, Isaiah radiates confidence. I envy him.</p><p>\u201cHow is racing there going to be any different from the streets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the place is legit and family-oriented. The guys racing there are generational\u2014dads, uncles, grandpas, great-grandpas. I\u2019ll make the money off side bets. The money per bet won\u2019t be large, but I hope to win enough to compensate.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already shaking my head. It doesn\u2019t sound like much of a plan. \u201cSo the two of us are going to race and hope to win some side bets along the way and all of this will hopefully total five thousand dollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the two of us,\u201d he says with no apology. \u201cI\u2019ll be racing and winning with your car.\u201d</p><p>I blink. \u201cMy car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says with absolutely no hesitation. \u201cYour car.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no way he can do it\u2014make that much money in races he hopes to win. My lips shift to the right as I mull over what he said. He believes, but I...can\u2019t.</p><p>Isaiah focuses on my mouth. In two easy strides, he crosses the distance between us and places his fingers under my chin. His warm thumb sweeps across the edge of my lips and my heart flutters. He performs the enticing movement one more time...but slower and my mouth responds by relaxing. I quit breathing and thinking. I have so missed his touch.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to worry,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I choke on the sarcastic laugh and turn my head to breathe in air that\u2019s free of his scent. Worrying is all I\u2019m good at. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he responds quickly. \u201cWhen I say I\u2019m going to do something, I do it.\u201d</p><p>Not true\u2014he said he\u2019d call and he didn\u2019t. I fiddle with a wayward thread on the cuff of my sleeve as my heart sinks. What do I do if he bails on me? What do I do if I don\u2019t work with him? Maybe I could ask West and Ethan for help. Maybe they have money.</p><p>I lift my head to find him staring at me. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Rachel.\u201d He slides his fingers around my wrist and the brush of his skin against mine melts my muscles like hot dripping butter.</p><p>Disgust immediately weaves through me. I\u2019m so pathetic. He never called. Isaiah never freaking called, and with a few words and a few caresses I fall right back to where I started: as a stupid naive girl.</p><p>I step away and push my bangs from my face. I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t let him toy with me. I\u2019ve got a couple hundred dollars saved from my birthday and Christmas. I\u2019ll pawn some of my jewelry. I\u2019ll beg Eric for more time. Anything other than having my heart ripped out. \u201cThis is a mistake. I\u2019ll figure it out on my own.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I walk past him, toward my coat, toward the door, Isaiah grabs my hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d It\u2019s not a question. It\u2019s a demand.</p><p>\u201cYou said I was a one-night stand.\u201d I jerk my hand, but he doesn\u2019t give. Anger flares through me and I jerk harder. \u201cYou said I meant nothing!\u201d</p><p>His hand slips away. \u201cI never said you were a one-night stand. Rachel...I could never think of you as a fuck.\u201d</p><p>I wince from the word leaving his mouth and hate how he inclines his head in pity as he notices the weakness.</p> <p>\u201cBut Eric did,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t argue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says simply as if that will wash away a week\u2019s worth of ignoring me.</p><p>My throat burns as tears threaten my eyes. I should keep my mouth shut and bolt. Instead, I stay and say the stupid words. \u201cI waited for you to call. You said you would. You said you liked me. And then you tell Eric I meant nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI showed for you.\u201d A bit of irritation leaks into his voice. \u201cI got into Eric\u2019s face for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you owe me! Because I stopped my car and let you drive it until we ditched the police.\u201d</p> <p>His expression becomes a brewing storm. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>I throw my arms out in a mock parody of not caring, but the truth is I do. I care so much about this guy that he\u2019s tearing me to shreds. \u201cSo you don\u2019t owe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he mutters as his hands fist at his sides. \u201cI do owe you.\u201d</p><p>He wants to say more, but I can\u2019t listen to lies. \u201cJust say it, Isaiah. Cut the crap and say that I was a game. Tell me how I was the stupid, pathetic rich girl you tried to sleep with. Just say it and then we\u2019ll figure a way out of this mess without you having to charm me into doing what you want.\u201d Without you breaking what\u2019s left of my soul. \u201cJust say it!\u201d</p><p>But before he can say anything, the door to the garage creaks open. I turn my head reluctantly in time to catch two people who look roughly our age shuffling in. The guy is tall, looming over the girl who, if it\u2019s possible, is shorter than me. Her eyes dart between me and Isaiah and finally settle on him. \u201cHello, Isaiah,\u201d she says.</p><p>Her ripped blue jeans and blond hair with black streaks scream that she\u2019s fine with danger. She\u2019s beautiful, and by the way she holds herself, she\u2019s confident\u2014strong. I wipe at my eyes and angle my body in the opposite direction of her. My chest moves with the heavy beating of my heart and a moronic, traitorous tear falls.</p> <p>Isaiah lowers his head and utters a curse. I can tell by how he tries not to look at her, yet keeps doing so that this girl means something to him. Guess he just got busted for cheating on her\u2014with me.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>\u201cHELLO, ISAIAH.\u201d MY NAME ON the lips of few can cause my world to stall. As if in slow motion, I turn my head and watch her sweep into my life as if she never left.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I mumble. Would it be so damn difficult for the universe to give me a break? Rachel flips her golden hair over her shoulder to prevent me from examining her face.</p><p>\u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d Beth asks as she glides farther into the garage. A million questions form, but the return of the dull ache in my body deters me from voicing any of them. She\u2019s still gorgeous: a tiny pissed-off fairy, but her hair is different. She wears it chin-length now and blond has replaced the black except for two stripes of the color I knew.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say with way too much anger. Beth notices and mockingly raises one brow.</p><p>A guy I don\u2019t know strolls in. I straighten and feel my muscles flex. What the hell? Has she already run through the guy she chose over me and come here to show off another? Beth glances behind her before squaring her gaze back on me. \u201cIsaiah, this is Logan. He\u2019s a friend of mine...and Ryan\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Dressed in a jock jacket with a big letter B on the front and his name embroidered underneath it, the kid nods at me. On the white arm of the coat, two baseball bats cross over each other. The guy Beth fell for, Ryan, was also a baseball-playing jock.</p><p>I roll my shoulders. I don\u2019t want to hand Beth the opportunity to rip me into pieces again. Not now. Not when everything has gone to shit. Not with Rachel in my life. \u201cYou need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried calling you,\u201d she says, ignoring me and the fact that Rachel stands completely broken not two feet away. \u201cAnd texting.\u201d</p><p>She has. Since Thanksgiving, but I\u2019m not ready to forgive her. \u201cLeave.\u201d</p><p>Beth stops in front of Rachel and gives her a once-over. \u201cI\u2019m Beth,\u201d she says. \u201cSince Isaiah has lost his manners.\u201d</p><p>Rachel lifts her chin in the air. A surge of pride courses through my blood. Damn if she\u2019ll permit Beth to get the better of her. \u201cI\u2019m Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with me,\u201d I say, causing Rachel to meet my eyes. Come on, angel, I know we\u2019ve got stuff to work out, but stay with me. Beth is the one who doesn\u2019t belong here.</p><p>Beth clears her throat. She wants my attention, but she\u2019s not receiving it. \u201cLogan inherited a car, and I told him you could help him fix it. I told him you were the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only do favors for friends,\u201d I respond while holding Rachel\u2019s gaze. That\u2019s right. Keep those gorgeous violet eyes on me. Instinctively, you trust me. Keep on doing it.</p><p>I need time with Rachel: time to explain why I never called, time to explain that our one night together meant something and time to explain why I said those words to Eric that hurt her so badly. Time to understand why the hell I care so much that Rachel\u2019s mad at me. Because the world never works in my favor, I have no time.</p><p>\u201cI used to be your best friend,\u201d Beth sneers. \u201cIs she your friend now?\u201d</p><p>Clearly curious for the answer, Rachel pushes her hair behind her ear as if to hear me better. I don\u2019t want Beth involved in my life anymore, plus I don\u2019t know what to say about me and Rachel. I like her. She\u2019s a mystery. And I\u2019m seriously attracted to her. I guess we\u2019re friends, but something stops me from saying that aloud. \u201cShop\u2019s closed, Beth.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s eyes shut, and when she opens them, she looks at Beth. \u201cHe owes me a favor.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s shoulders visibly relax, and I wonder why she cares who I\u2019m spending time with. Beth left me. \u201cSo, Isaiah, what type of favor do you owe her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need money,\u201d Rachel answers with a boldness few have used with Beth. Anger shoots through me. That\u2019s business strictly between me and Rachel. Not information for Beth. \u201cAnd Isaiah is going to drag race my car in order to help me get it. So when I\u2019m finished with him, you can have your friend back.\u201d</p><p>The sadistic smile I remember so well from when Beth feels threatened slides across her face. \u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t need your permission.\u201d</p><p>Rachel swings her purse onto her shoulder and cocks her head at me. \u201cYou want to race my car, fine. You can race my car. Text me the when and where and I\u2019ll be there. And don\u2019t worry about coming up with the full amount. I can come up with some of it on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel...\u201d I start.</p><p>But she\u2019s already across the garage. Her coat falls off the hook when she slams the door.</p><p>Just fuck. I stalk past Beth and glance out the door\u2019s small window. The engine of her Mustang growls as it pulls out of the lot. I pick up her coat. It smells like her\u2014like the ocean. I gently place it back on the hook. \u201cGet out of my life, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth,\u201d says jock boy. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, that you\u2019ve decided to speak up,\u201d I say to him, \u201ctake Beth and get the fuck out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Logan,\u201d Beth interjects. \u201cGive me a few minutes with Isaiah.\u201d</p><p>The guy with dark hair releases a frustrated breath. \u201cI promised Ryan I wouldn\u2019t let you out of my sight, so whatever you have to say or do...\u201d He shrugs his shoulders.</p><p>I wait for Beth to tell the guy\u2014Logan\u2014where to shove what he said. She only crosses her arms over her chest. I let out a sarcastic chuckle. The girl\u2019s been domesticated. I head back to my Mustang, deciding it\u2019s best to ignore them both.</p><p>Beth follows and stands a foot from me. \u201cNoah and I talk,\u201d she says.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cYou and I were friends before, and we can be friends again.\u201d</p><p>More silence.</p><p>\u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>And she went too far. I turn to the jock. \u201cWhat type of work are we talking?\u201d I\u2019m desperate for additional sources of income and maybe he can pay.</p><p>Logan moves his head in a who-knows fashion. \u201cIt runs, but makes strange noises when it hits forty. I\u2019d like it to not explode on the freeway and for it to run faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Beth knew I could help. \u201cBring the car in sometime. Without her.\u201d</p><p>He jerks his thumb behind him. \u201cI got it out in the parking lot.\u201d</p><p>It. As if the car means nothing. I remind myself he can pay. \u201cSlide her in.\u201d</p><p>Logan assesses Beth in a way that says he\u2019s put up with her antics before. \u201cCan I leave you for two seconds without you starting a world war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to like you,\u201d she says to Logan.</p><p>He leaves and Beth stays. Why did she return? To screw with me? To rub it in that she\u2019s happy? I glance at her from the corner of my eye. She touches the pink ribbons on her wrist that that asshole Ryan gave her. He makes her happy. I hate the guy.</p><p>\u201cSo are you into her?\u201d Beth asks.</p><p>\u201cDoes your uncle know you\u2019re here?\u201d I push the button to open the bay and then busy myself with some wrenches. Rachel is the opposite of Beth with her brilliant smile and joyous laughter. A beam of light. Even when I was into her, Beth was nothing but darkness.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answers immediately.</p><p>A muffled humph leaves my throat because I don\u2019t buy that.</p><p>\u201cFine. No, he doesn\u2019t. And before you ask, Ryan does.\u201d</p><p>I move onto the screwdrivers. \u201cWhen did you become a dog on a leash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d she growls then sighs. \u201cI\u2019m not. Ryan knows I miss you and he knows I love him. He\u2019s okay with you and me being friends.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Right. I\u2019m sure he prefers not to be the prick who said no, so he\u2019s depending on me to tell her to go. At least the asshole called that move correctly. I turn my head to the sound of an engine rumbling and briefly smile when I see a red \u201957 Chevy roll into the bay.</p><p>Beth walks up beside me. \u201cI knew you\u2019d like her.\u201d</p><p>Her. Because Beth knows I love cars. In fact, she knows too much about me. Beth is like a bad trip. She always has been, and I don\u2019t want to be on a ride with her anymore. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not until we\u2019re friends again.\u201d</p><p>Logan cuts the engine, gets out and pops the hood. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I think I could get a hard-on with a car like this. \u201cThis car was made to race.\u201d</p><p>Logan snaps to attention. \u201cYou think you could get the car to go fast?\u201d</p><p>I pause while assessing the kid. It was there in his voice and still present in the expectant way he holds his body. Speed. He craves it. Wants it. Maybe the jock\u2019s not so bad. \u201cAre you interested in keeping her street legal?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMore interested in speed.

It opens next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you race there?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And I plan on spending a lot of time there over the next six weeks.</p> <p>\u201cIsaiah.\u201d Beth attempts to step in between us, but Logan angles himself so that she can\u2019t. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I brought him here.\u201d</p><p>An insane glint strikes the guy\u2019s eyes and all of a sudden, I feel a connection to him. A twitch of his lips shows he might be my kind of crazy. \u201cHow fast do the cars there go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome guys hit speeds of 120 mph in an eighth mile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Beth stomps her foot. \u201cNo. I promised Ryan nothing crazy would happen. Logan, this is not why I brought you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you hit those speeds?\u201d He swats his hand at Beth as if she\u2019s a fly, earning my respect. Most guys would be terrified of having their balls ripped off and handed to them for dismissing Beth like that.</p> <p>\u201cNot driving my car, I haven\u2019t,\u201d I answer honestly. But I hope to with Rachel\u2019s car, and with mine, after a few modifications. \u201cSpeed can be bought.

THE walls, the throw rug over the white carpet, my comforter, my pillows, the floor-to-ceiling curtains\u2014purple. Lavender really, but that\u2019s just another way to say the word purple. I hate purple, but Mom doesn\u2019t like green.</p><p>I sit in the middle of my four-poster bed and recount the money. Five hundred dollars. That\u2019s what I have. Several pieces of jewelry rest on the pillow beside me. Those four pieces are the only ones I don\u2019t think Mom would notice missing.</p><p>If my gowns weren\u2019t in Mom\u2019s closet, I could try selling those. While my mother can\u2019t scrape up the ability to see who I am on the inside, she watches the outside like a hawk.</p><p>Someone knocks. I flip the pillow over to hide the jewelry and wad the cash. The door opens and Ethan catches sight of the money right as I slam it into my jewelry box. He strides into my room and plops on the bed. The pillow shifts and I glance over to confirm the jewelry is still hidden.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha doing?\u201d he asks as he stares at the box full of cash.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuying a new part for your car?\u201d Because in Ethan\u2019s mind, it\u2019s the only thing I would need cash for. After a lecture from my dad, Ethan knows I won\u2019t put my car parts on the credit card.</p><p>No. I\u2019m paying off a psychopath. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>Me and my brothers, we\u2019re spoiled. Each of us has a credit card so we can buy whatever we desire, but that financial freedom also carries a burden. Dad meets with us each month and reviews our spending. Two years ago, when I\u2019d spent too much on parts for my car, I wondered if the women tried in Salem for witchcraft sweated as much as I had. This afternoon, for a brief thirty seconds, I considered a cash advance on the card, but West had done that once and Dad was on his case within twenty-four hours. Turns out, Dad set certain alerts.</p><p>\u201cI need amnesty,\u201d Ethan says.</p><p>Of course he does. \u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A burst of air rushes out of my mouth and moves my hair. \u201cWhat if I have plans? It is Saturday night.\u201d He and West always assume the social worst of me.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s face pales. \u201cDo you? And if so, with who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want to drive my car.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cYou can drive whenever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Ethan swings his feet off my bed. \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d He pauses at the door frame. \u201cBy the way, what would you think of extending twin amnesty?\u201d</p><p>I pick at the lint on my bed. \u201cTo how many?\u201d</p><p>My brother bobs his head as if he hasn\u2019t already chosen a number. \u201cLimitless.\u201d</p><p>Dread weighs on my chest. Ethan and West sometimes can be out all night and I\u2019m not always that creative in the lies I spin to cover for them. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep on it. And Rach.\u201d The way he focuses on his sneakers makes the silence uncomfortable. Something that rarely happens between us. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re helping Mom.\u201d</p><p>I rub the skin between my eyebrows, fighting any thoughts that could lead to anxiety. On the corner of my dresser, taunting me, is a speech I have to memorize by next week.</p><p>\u201cWill...\u201d He closes the door to my room and leans his back against it as if to lock everyone out or imprison me. \u201cWill you tell Mom if you get sick?\u201d</p><p>I clutch a pillow to my chest. \u201cJust leave me alone, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should talk to Mom and Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d I fling the pillow off the bed. \u201cMom freaks? Dad\u2019s disappointed? You and West and Gavin and Jack get on me for being weak? No, thanks. Where was your pity when Jack laid into me the other night because I hadn\u2019t said yes yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have asked if they knew you still had panic attacks.\u201d</p><p>Disgust weaves into my voice. \u201cLook me in the eye and tell me that this family isn\u2019t happier because I\u2019m hiding what they can\u2019t handle.\u201d What I can\u2019t handle.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should tell them.\u201d There\u2019s an edge of seriousness to his tone that creates horror movie fear.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d I search for words. \u201cYou want Mom happy, just like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I keep thinking of you on that damn bathroom floor puking up your guts....\u201d</p><p>My phone vibrates, and my stupid heart stutters because there\u2019s only one person who would call or text me\u2014Isaiah.</p><p>Ethan eyes my cell. \u201cWho\u2019s texting you?\u201d</p><p>I grab my phone and try not to shake when I see Isaiah\u2019s name. \u201cWest,\u201d I lie. \u201cHe\u2019s been having problems with his SUV because he forgot to change the oil again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoron,\u201d Ethan mutters then looks at me again. \u201cThink about what I said. At least about the amnesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I struggle to keep my focus on my brother and not on the phone as Ethan leaves. If I don\u2019t find a way to control my crazy emotions, Isaiah will only hurt me worse in six weeks when we pay Eric.</p><p>Meet me at the dragway at 7. My phone vibrates again with directions.</p><p>I toss my cell across the bed and fall back onto my pillows with a loud huff. A demand. Not a request or even a please. A demand. Like he knows he\u2019s all hot and mysterious and how I can\u2019t stop obsessing over him. I shouldn\u2019t go. I shouldn\u2019t answer. I should stand my ground.</p><p>The phone vibrates again. With a sigh too dramatic to use without an audience, I kick the phone toward me. I read the words then smother a pillow over my face: bring your car gassed</p><p>Because I\u2019m nothing more than a debt. Stupid, stupid me.</p><p>My headlights flash across Isaiah as I park next to his black Mustang. With his back resting against his passenger door and his arms folded across his chest, he waits in the parking lot just like his texts said he would. The gravel beneath my tires cracks, and I hate the thought of rocks kicking up and hitting the paint.</p><p>I inhale, then slowly release the air. I\u2019m a debt. I mean nothing to him. I will not lose it. I will not yell. I will be calm and collected and everything other than the crashing emotions and anxiety brewing inside of me. He will not know that he hurt me. I may be weak, but I\u2019m good at hiding how I really feel. Pretending he didn\u2019t break my heart should be easy.</p><p>I almost tumble out of the car when the door swings open without my assistance. Isaiah offers a hand as if I need help. Because it\u2019s a strange gesture and one that catches me off guard, I accept and then internally curse myself once his strong hand wraps around mine. Crap. I still like his hands on me.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says.</p><p>He closes my door, and the two of us stand there, holding hands, staring in silence. Well, almost silence; the sound of two engines simultaneously revving gains my attention. Isaiah smirks when I lean to the left to glimpse what\u2019s behind the metal bleachers.</p><p>His finger performs this swipe on the back of my hand that sends an electric shock through my body. The blaring lights from the dragway cast a shadow across Isaiah, and I shiver at how comfortable he appears in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sweet sound,\u201d he says referring to the engines, but all I hear is his deep voice.</p><p>I shrug as if I don\u2019t care, but yeah...that sound rocks, the engines and his voice. Take your hand back, Rach. He\u2019s playing you. One of his fingers moves slowly against my skin again, and goose bumps rise on my arms. The annoying voice in my head repeats the warning, but I don\u2019t listen.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you were coming.\u201d He sounds both a little hurt and relieved. Good. I can\u2019t contain the slight curve of my lips. I showed, but I also stood my ground by refusing to text back.</p><p>\u201cYou left your jacket at the garage. I\u2019ve got it in the car, but it looks like you found another.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that is sweet, but I\u2019m still standing my ground.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rachel,\u201d he says with a smoothness that reminds me of silk. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>I shrug again. Okay, I know, completely immature. I haven\u2019t even played this game with my brothers in years, but Isaiah so deserves it. We\u2019re business, he and I. I\u2019m a debt. He wants to use my car so we can pay off Eric. Nowhere in that agreement does it indicate I have to speak.</p><p>In one swift motion, I find the courage to remove my hand and shove it into my coat pocket so Isaiah knows touching me is off-limits. It\u2019s a warm night for January, upper fifties, yet I use my jacket as a shield.</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d He pulls on his bottom earring. \u201cLet me show you the place.\u201d</p><p>I fall in step with him, and my eyes widen when I see the rows of cars looping around the metal bleachers, each waiting for their turn on the dragway. Mustangs, Camaros, Chargers, Novas, Chevelles, Corvettes. Oh, holy mother of God, the list is endless. All beautiful. All painted in reds or yellows or blacks or whites or blues or oranges\u2014a glorious rainbow. All grumbling with the sounds of fantastic fast engines.</p><p>Gathered under smaller streetlights, guys lean against their cars or stand in small groups and call out to Isaiah. He nods or says something in greeting. My world freezes when I notice the gorgeous black beauty near the front of the pack.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a 2004 Mustang Cobra,\u201d I say. My head snaps to Isaiah, and I repeat what I said, emphasizing each word. \u201cThat is a 2004 Mustang Cobra.\u201d</p><p>He licks his lips in a pathetic effort to conceal his smile. Yeah, whatever, I\u2019m talking so he won, but who cares. That\u2019s a 2004 Mustang Cobra. That is the car I have always dreamed of owning.</p><p>\u201cI know the guy who owns it,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you want a closer look?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I ask with a bounce that I\u2019m sure makes me look like a five-year-old. \u201cI sort of want to lie on the hood and hug it.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah laughs the same laugh as the night in the bar. The one that creates an energized rush. The one that messes with my head and warms my blood. My excitement fades as I remember\u2014Isaiah doesn\u2019t want me.</p><p>Over the loudspeaker, the announcer calls the race. The groups quickly disintegrate and the drivers return to their cars.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll introduce you later,\u201d Isaiah says. \u201cLet\u2019s go watch.\u201d</p> <p>We weave through the cars, past the bleachers, and stand at the fence near the starting line. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before: a flat stretch of road with concrete barricades following the eighth-mile course. Toward the end, two large electronic boards loom on both sides of the track. One set of numbers on top, another on the bottom.</p><p>The roar of an engine causes me to return my attention to the starting line. Guys walk alongside a red Camaro. One waves his hand in the air, indicating the driver should inch closer. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Isaiah props his arms on the fence. \u201cThey spray water at the start of the track for the burnout. It\u2019s better to get your tires right on the edge of the water.\u201d</p><p>Holy freaking crap\u2014a burnout. I\u2019ve seen this hundreds of times on TV, but never in person. On cue, the back tires of the Camaro explode to life, spinning, sending heavy white smoke into the air as the driver heats his tires so he can gain better traction on the track. The sweet smoldering smell of burning rubber fills my nose. Finally, the tires catch and the car jerks forward.</p><p>The driver opens the door and fans it repeatedly to rid the interior of the smoke. Once clear, he shuts it and obeys the hand signals of his friend to move to the starting line.</p> <p>\u201cHow do they know where to place their car to start the race?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s done by lasers,\u201d Isaiah explains. \u201cYou need to hit the first laser without going too far. That guy doing all the hand motions is guiding the driver to the line. When he\u2019s at the laser, a light over there will turn on.\u201d</p><p>The competing car completes his burnout and thrusts to the line without help and without smoke infiltrating the car. \u201cWhy does the other driver need help and he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the speeds some of these cars go, you can\u2019t use regular seat belts. If we can get your engine to sing, we\u2019ll have to install a safety harness in your car. Sometimes the harness keeps you so pinned in you can\u2019t see the line. Sometimes the helmet keeps you from seeing it. Sometimes your friends want to help.\u201d</p><p>He lost me at installing a safety harness in my car. Panic eats at my insides. \u201cYou\u2019re going to change my car?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah watches the cars at the line. \u201cFirst they have to hit the line for prestaging. See that thing in the middle between the cars? That thing that looks like a traffic light?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d No. Not really. I mean, I see it. For both racers, the \u201ctraffic light\u201d tower has two rows of white lights at the top, three rows of yellow lights, a single row of green and finally a single row of red. But what I really see is Isaiah missing the point. \u201cAs in you\u2019re going to physically make a change to my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answers calmly, as if he didn\u2019t just announce he\u2019s going to take the one thing in my life I love and ruin it. \u201cIt\u2019s called a Christmas Tree. The white lights on top are prestage for the start of the race. They light up when the front of the car hits the first beam. When you hit the second beam, then the second row of lights glow to let you know that you\u2019re ready to race. When both cars are staged, you have seconds before the lights on the tree drop.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Sure. Whatever. \u201cWhat else are you planning to do to my car?\u201d I grip the fence as a fresh wave of dizziness makes me light-headed. My car. I don\u2019t want anyone messing with my car.</p><p>Either he\u2019s ignoring me or he\u2019s seriously into the race. \u201cThe yellow lights drop in descending order in .5 second intervals. If you leave before the green light, then the red light flashes.\u201d</p><p>That snaps me out of near hysteria. \u201cWhat does it mean if you get a red light?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah glances at me. \u201cIt means you lost.\u201d</p><p>Understanding socks me in the stomach. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not racing\u2014I stalled at the line on the street and if I panic, I\u2019ll possibly stall again. If I get overexcited and leave before the light turns green\u2014and let\u2019s admit it, I would\u2014then I\u2019ll lose the race before I even hit twenty miles per hour. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust my reaction at the line.\u201d</p><p>He kicks at the bottom of the fence, and I can tell he doesn\u2019t want to answer. \u201cWe need a fast car, Rachel. Speed still means something, but out here at the dragway, whoever catches the light first is typically the winner.\u201d</p> <p>The cars in front of us roar. Torque causes the front end of the Camaro to pull up into the air, and I step back, half expecting the car to flip completely backward. It doesn\u2019t. The front tires slam back down onto the asphalt. The Camaro races past the Mustang at a blinding speed. The sign at the end flashes. In an eighth mile the Camaro hits ninety-six miles per hour in 6.94 seconds.</p><p>My eyes widen and my heart beats hard in my chest. \u201cI so want to do that.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>WITH MY ARMS TIGHTLY CROSSED over my chest and my feet spread apart, I watch from a distance as Rachel chats animatedly with Zach, the owner of the Mustang Cobra. Her hair cascades down her back like a waterfall and her hands move gracefully in the air as she relays some story involving her Mustang on a country road.</p><p>Zach touches her arm right above her elbow and says something that incites her laughter. A muscle in my jaw jumps. I\u2019ve known Zach since freshman year. We\u2019ve taken every automotive course together, and I was there when he bought the Cobra for dirt cheap. If the boy keeps flirting with Rachel, he and I may not be friends by the end of the night.</p><p>\u201cHey, Isaiah.\u201d</p><p>I tear my eyes off of Rachel for a second to greet Logan. \u201cS\u2019up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d check out the action,\u201d he says, following my gaze to Rachel.</p><p>In a motion I\u2019ve memorized, Rachel shyly bites her bottom lip. Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t look at Zach with those gorgeous eyes searching for him to be your answer like you did with me.</p><p>The muscles in my neck relax when she brushes her hair over her shoulder and steps back, causing him to remove his hand. Distracting Zach, she points to the Cobra and moves closer to the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d I ask Logan, hoping to distract myself. Watching Rachel laugh with another guy twists knots in my gut.</p><p>\u201cThat was some insane shit.\u201d A jean jacket replaces Logan\u2019s school one, and he almost fits in with a T-shirt and jeans, but his black hair still has that straitlaced gel-style.</p><p>\u201cThink you can handle a car going that fast, man?\u201d</p><p>A lunatic smile crosses his face. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Before Beth fell for Logan\u2019s friend, Ryan, she had told me stories involving this kid. She said his only fuel was adrenaline. \u201cYou\u2019re a crazy son of a bitch, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answers immediately. \u201cGot a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I reply. \u201cBut I do have a problem with Beth. You want me to work on your car, then I\u2019m fine with that, but keep her out of my garage.\u201d And out of my life.</p><p>Zach opens his car door for Rachel and she trembles with excitement as she slides into the driver\u2019s seat. Part of me loves seeing her happy. The other part yearns to shove Zach in a body bag.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d says Logan. \u201cI\u2019m a couple of weeks away from earning enough to buy a used supercharger from a friend, and I have a feeling we\u2019ll need to replace some of the exhaust.\u201d</p><p>Several parts of his statement catch me off guard. \u201cYou already know cars, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I do?\u201d</p><p>What if he does? When I say nothing, he continues, \u201cBeth heard about the car and went nuts, knowing it gave her an excuse to see you. She misses you, but she\u2019s with Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Logan waits for his words to sink in. Yeah, I got it. Beth\u2019s in love with his best friend. \u201cRyan\u2019s got nothing to fear from me.\u201d And that\u2019s the damn truth. There\u2019s no part of me that wants Beth anymore.</p><p>She\u2019s in love with someone else and having my heart ripped out and burnt to ashes keeps me from wanting to replay the game with her.</p><p>\u201cBeth\u2019s my friend so I played car idiot. She needed an excuse to see you, and we wanted an excuse for someone to come with her.\u201d</p><p>Because Beth is a fucking hurricane and would have blown into town regardless of what anyone else thought or desired. Yeah, I understood that, too. I may not like what happened between me and Beth, but I can respect the guy for being loyal to her.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest,\u201d says Logan. \u201cI could use your help.\u201d He gestures at the dragway. \u201cAnd nothing in Groveton can offer me that type of rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you pay me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNot if I buy the supercharger. But if you agree to help me put the charger in and help make some other modifications, then I\u2019ll give you anything I win at the dragway.\u201d</p><p>I had planned to ask Noah to help drag race my way out of the debt, but he\u2019s been slammed with his own problems. \u201cHave you drag raced before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIllegally, on backcountry roads and with other guys\u2019 cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you any good?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. I can tell by the cocky way his shoulders flex that the kid\u2019s an ace. Or at least he\u2019s won against his redneck friends. \u201cI\u2019ve won a few.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to explain this or that I\u2019m making the offer. No one other than me drives my car, but desperate times... \u201cRachel and I are in some bad shit. I\u2019ll be racing her car to win money. If you want, you can race mine.\u201d</p><p>The parts I intend to add to her car will mean speeds that will put me against better racers. Better racers translates to bigger bets.</p><p>\u201cYou owe money,\u201d Logan says\u2014a statement, not a question.</p><p>\u201cTo the wrong people, and they won\u2019t take kindly to anyone helping us.\u201d</p><p>His smile widens, proving the kid is bat-shit crazy. \u201cA debt, a villain, speed and bad odds. This is something I definitely want to be a part of.\u201d</p><p>Amused, I shake my head. I\u2019m joining forces with a fucking country-jock. I extend my hand. \u201cWe got a deal.\u201d</p><p>He has a strong grip and doesn\u2019t fear eye contact. I already like the son of a bitch. Logan jerks his thumb at Rachel. \u201cIs she your girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>My eyes shoot to his, and he immediately holds up his hands. \u201cBeth\u2019s my friend, and with that handshake, you are, too. I am neutral territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends,\u201d I answer in regards to Rachel.</p><p>She spent the first part of the evening trying to ignore me. Eventually, she broke down and talked cars, but it\u2019s obvious she meant what she said to me in the garage: that she and I would work together and nothing more.</p><p>Zach rests his hands on the roof of his car and leans down to put his head closer to Rachel\u2019s. She still sits in the driver\u2019s seat with both hands on the wheel. Because fate has taken pity on me, she\u2019s totally absorbed with the machinery and not with Zach. It\u2019s like he knows nothing about personal space. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou look like the two of you are just friends,\u201d says Logan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just watching her back.\u201d I promised Rachel and myself that I\u2019d protect her\u2014from Eric, from the world.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re into delusional shit?\u201d</p><p>My spine straightens. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p> <p>Not giving a damn that I\u2019m two seconds away from throwing a fist into his face, Logan lazily hooks his thumbs into his pockets and slouches to the side. \u201cI got this friend Chris, right? He fell for another friend of ours, Lacy, but he didn\u2019t want to admit it. Claimed the friend card, just like you, but for six months he looked at Lacy just like you\u2019re looking at Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she amputated part of you and took it with her the last time she walked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, you have it wrong.\u201d But as my gaze switches to Rachel again there\u2019s an ache growing in my chest. \u201cRachel and I are complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your homeboy know you\u2019re in a \u2018complicated\u2019 relationship with her?\u201d asks Logan.</p> <p>Since I\u2019ve never brought a girl to the track before, you\u2019d think my \u201chomeboy\u201d would be reserved. \u201cNot sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re standing thirty feet away because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to see that car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have gone over to see it with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould\u2019ve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealousy\u2019s a bitch,\u201d taunts Logan. \u201cAnd a symptom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d I pop my neck to the side. If I look too close at the reason why I chose to keep distance between me and Zach, it\u2019s because Zach\u2019s a player and if I were any closer, I\u2019d kick his ass and then Rachel would never see that car.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he answers. \u201cFor some reason I\u2019ve got a thing with stating the obvious. So you\u2019re into her. If this shit you\u2019re in is that bad, you might want to figure out what\u2019s going on with the two of you first. Save yourself the drama of a breakdown in the middle, you know?\u201d</p><p>I rub my hands over my face and feel as if my knees are about to give out. Fuck me, I am jealous and that is bad news. Wanting her is one thing, kissing her once in a moment of weakness is another. But having feelings for her? This is the type of shit that almost killed me with Beth.</p><p>\u201cThe look on your face is why I\u2019m never falling,\u201d Logan says. \u201cI\u2019ll swing my car by this week.\u201d</p><p>I nod my goodbye and search for calm before I head over to the Cobra. The car may be named after a reptile, but its owner is the damned snake.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you mess with the original engine, though?\u201d Rachel slides her fingers over the steering wheel as if she\u2019s in mourning. \u201cShe was beautiful just the way she was born.\u201d</p><p>Zach finally acknowledges me when my elbow smacks against his side as I shove my way between him and Rachel. He straightens and mumbles so only I can hear, \u201cDamn, she gives me a hard-on. Gorgeous, and she knows cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you back the fuck off,\u201d I mutter.</p> <p>Zach smirks. \u201cHey, you\u2019re the one that left her here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you guys talking about?\u201d Rachel asks.</p><p>\u201cCars,\u201d I say. \u201cYou said you needed to be home by ten. It\u2019s nine-thirty.\u201d</p><p>She blinks as if she just woke up. \u201cCrap. Already?\u201d</p><p>I step aside so Rachel can exit the driver\u2019s seat. Because Rachel is every guy\u2019s fantasy, Zach begs her to stay: she should see the engine, she can ride in his car, she can drive his car. Each of his attempts to lure her to stay causes me to think of one more way to hide the body parts after I kill him. Rachel laughs him off and thankfully follows me to the parking lot.</p><p>The gravel crunches beneath our feet, and I envision a million different ways to wipe that conceited smirk off Zach\u2019s face as she describes, in detail, every inch of the Cobra. A continual pressure builds with each word out of her mouth. I remind myself I was the one who introduced her to the dick.</p><p>\u201c...and the inside was perfect.\u201d Rachel rambles with a level of excitement I only thought possible in four-year-olds. \u201cLike it just rolled off the lot. Well, not really, but you can tell he\u2019s done a great job trying to re-create the feel...\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s impressed with him. Impressed with his car. Just impressed. And it\u2019s not with me. We reach our cars, and the pressure rises to the level of explosion. \u201cDo you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She half chokes.</p><p>\u201cZach. He asked you out. Do you want to date him?\u201d</p><p>Rachel grimaces. \u201cHe did not ask me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He did. He asked you to take a ride with him next weekend and you blew past the question. Did you want to say yes, but didn\u2019t because I was there?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opens and closes several times. \u201cHe didn\u2019t... It\u2019s me, so he wouldn\u2019t... Why do you care?\u201d</p><p>Fuck it. \u201cBecause I do.\u201d</p><p>Adrenaline pours into my bloodstream with the words, and my eyes dart around her face hoping to see some sort of a sign that what I said mattered. That I matter.</p><p>\u201cGive me something, Rachel.\u201d A word. A knowing glance. Anything.</p><p>Her beautiful eyes widen and because she must be the type that enjoys playing with fire her gaze falls to my lips. \u201cGive you what?\u201d</p><p>My heart rate increases. I\u2019d give anything to kiss her again. Without realizing it, I step forward and Rachel retreats, backing into the car. Keeping her eyes locked with mine, I slowly reach out and cradle the slender curve of her waist, and when she says or does nothing to stop me, I step closer, letting my body slide against hers.</p><p>She sucks in air, and I love the soft sound. Her body heat reaches out and warms me and I wish I could wrap my arms fully around her. I crave to lose myself in the crook of her neck and be surrounded by her silky hair. Rachel tries to lower her head, but I reach up and touch her chin. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I tilt her head up, engulfing her line of vision. She\u2019s going to see me and me alone. No cars, no Zach, none of the other assholes trying to win her eye during the night. The sweet scent of jasmine entwining with the salty smell of the beach rushes into my lungs. I lick my lips, wanting to kiss her, but I\u2019m too full of energy to dare let my lips brush hers.</p><p>Beneath my fingertips, her pulse beats wildly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you, Isaiah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we have something in common, because I don\u2019t get you at all.\u201d Nor do I understand the edge of anger and confusion beginning to roll in my veins.</p><p>Rachel was supposed to be a memory burned into my brain. The girl that I kissed, the girl that left me wanting more. But she\u2019s delved deeper than physical, become embedded, and I don\u2019t know how to dig her out. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>She blinks several times as her eyes get glossy, but the tears I expect never come. Instead she jerks her chin and I drop my hand. \u201cI think that\u2019s clear. You kissed me then you never called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Eric knew I care for you, he\u2019d use that against me.\u201d Tons of people Eric know could be watching us, calling him, telling him that I\u2019m close to the girl he felt betrayed him. It\u2019ll give him an advantage over me. It\u2019ll let him know my weaknesses, but the thought of Rachel accepting a date from another guy overpowers any logical thought.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a convenient excuse.\u201d She wraps her arms around her waist, but she doesn\u2019t push me away. Part of her wants me. A part she doesn\u2019t understand, probably just like the part I can\u2019t control. We\u2019re at a tipping point. Both of us teetering one way or the other. I need the right words.</p><p>\u201cI found out that night from a friend that you were in danger. I couldn\u2019t let Eric think I liked you, not when your life was on the line. You were never going to be a fuck and I never called because I couldn\u2019t be the link that led Eric to you.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head as I talk. \u201cYou told Eric I meant nothing!\u201d</p><p>My voice rises to her level. What doesn\u2019t she understand? \u201cI was protecting you!\u201d</p><p>Rachel presses both of her hands against my chest and forces me away. \u201cI gave you my first kiss! I deserved better than to be left hanging. I deserved better than to be treated like I was nothing! Then I deserved better than to have your girlfriend thrown in my face!\u201d</p><p>Girlfriend? \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth,\u201d she says as a slur.</p><p>\u201cBeth is not my girlfriend!\u201d I yell and the sound of any conversation around us ceases. Both of us are breathing hard, as if we\u2019ve run miles. She\u2019s right. She deserved better then and deserves better now. She blinks and I hate that I can\u2019t read her expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d I demand. I\u2019ve tried to explain. I\u2019ve tried to make nice and it\u2019s not enough. Just like with Beth, nothing I do will be enough.</p><p>Rachel turns her head away and stares out into the dark night. No response. No words. Withdrawn into her head.</p><p>Fuck this. I\u2019m standing here bleeding, and she doesn\u2019t give a damn. \u201cYou can ignore me, Rachel, and you can try to treat me as a friend, but none of that will erase the fact that I think about kissing you every second I\u2019m awake and dream at night of my hands on your body. And it sure as hell won\u2019t erase that I\u2019m terrified by how much I like you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trembling, and my instincts scream at me to run. I said too much and feel things that are too dangerous. Her eyes snap to mine, but she says nothing. Does nothing. My heart drops as I realize what a fool I am. I\u2019m just a guy who injured her pride. I mean nothing to her.</p><p>It\u2019s too much. All of it.</p><p>\u201cForget about it,\u201d I mutter as I wheel away and avoid eye contact.</p><p>I stalk off, unable to look back. Logan\u2019s several spots down, talking to someone, and I point to where I left Rachel. \u201cMake sure she gets in her car and leaves.\u201d</p><p>Logan grins because I proved him right. \u201cSure. Where are you headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dragway.\u201d I need speed.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>Rachel</p><p>WITH A HUFF, I FLIP over in my bed again. It\u2019s Sunday night, I have hours \u2019til school, and I can\u2019t sleep. This does not bode well for me keeping my routine in the morning. The same thought circles my brain like one of those news tickers at the bottom of a TV screen: Isaiah.</p><p>He said he liked me. And the way he said it, the way his body was pressed against mine and how his hands held my body...that\u2019s not the I-like-you-as-a-friend kind of like. It\u2019s possibly the same like I feel for him. The type of like where I go sort of crazy when I don\u2019t see him and then go crazier when I do. The type where he consumes my thoughts and then I can\u2019t sleep.</p><p>Like now.</p><p>Isaiah said he liked me, and I didn\u2019t say a word back.</p><p>The hurt in his eyes; the way his shoulders crumpled as he turned away from me...I am an awful person. I pull the covers over my head. What is wrong with me? A really great, really hot guy tells me that he cares for me, and I freeze. And to make it worse, the courage to contact him completely eludes me.</p><p>I now understand why so many deer are hit by cars. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I emerge from the covers and reach for my phone. The screen lights up the moment I swipe at it. One in the morning. Who else in the world would be awake at one in the morning? No one. The rest of the world knows how to sleep. The rest of the world wouldn\u2019t blow the biggest moment of their lives.</p><p>I scroll through my contacts until I find Isaiah. Underneath his picture is his name and number. My mouth dries out as I ponder the possibility. I could text him.</p><p>Nerves cause my heart to beat faster. What if I text him and he doesn\u2019t text back? But what if I text him and he does text back?</p><p>Not allowing time to overanalyze the decision, I quickly type and hit Send.</p> <p>Chapter 31</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>THE STREETLIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE slats of the blinds, creating a light ladder on the wooden floor. I fell into bed an hour ago, and at one in the morning I still can\u2019t sleep.</p><p>Noah\u2019s mattress creaks as he rolls and throws his arms out as if he\u2019s searching for something. More like someone. When he comes up empty, his eyes crack open into slits. Echo\u2019s staying at the dorms tonight, and he\u2019s here because he\u2019s pulling an early shift this morning. Noah messes his hands through his hair then lets out a disgruntled sigh as he resettles.</p><p>I swing my legs off the bed and my bare feet hit the cold subfloor. I rub at my bare chest, hoping to wake the rest of me up. My body\u2019s tired, but my mind won\u2019t shut off. I want to chase after the girl, but I don\u2019t know how. Short of going to her house and scaling the walls like a punked-out Romeo, I\u2019ve got no idea how to win Rachel. Besides, that Romeo shit is not my style.</p> <p>Maybe a drive will clear my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s eating you?\u201d Noah asks with his eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>Except for the fact he said something, Noah appears asleep. He\u2019s been working his ass off between school, studying, seeing his brothers and Echo, then squeezing in as many hours as he can flipping burgers to keep us afloat. The most I see him is when he sleeps at night. The kid is almost a walking corpse.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about the money for rent, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Noah mutters.</p> <p>Fuck me. I slide both hands over my face then cup my mouth and my nose. On top of owing Eric, I owe Noah money for rent. I can\u2019t believe I forgot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the one that\u2019s sorry. I don\u2019t want to fail you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. You aren\u2019t.\u201d My shoulders roll forward like I\u2019ve got a damn aircraft carrier on my back. I\u2019ve thought time and time again about telling Noah the truth, but I haven\u2019t. Only because there never seems to be a good time, but now I can\u2019t tell him. I can\u2019t let him shoulder this burden. Not when he already has too much riding on him. \u201cIt\u2019ll work out.\u201d</p><p>Noah opens his eyes and examines me. \u201cYeah, it will, so don\u2019t do anything fucked-up over it.\u201d</p><p>Pressure builds in my neck because I already know what he\u2019s referring to. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike street racing. Seeing Beth in handcuffs gave me my fill of police stations for a lifetime. I don\u2019t need you to be joining the ranks.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzes in the back pocket of my jeans on the floor. I close my eyes. It\u2019s gotta be Beth. She\u2019s the only one who\u2019d text this late.</p><p>Noah throws his arm back over his face. \u201cAnswer her, Isaiah. Beth\u2019s going nuts over your silence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot interested in making her feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s some crazy shit\u2014maybe I\u2019m more interested in you feeling better. If you could find a way to let her go maybe I\u2019d see you happy again. Like you were the night you brought Rachel home.\u201d</p><p>Anger twists in my body. Noah\u2019s talking about stuff he should stay away from. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Noah raises his hand and flashes me the finger.</p><p>I grab my shirt and start to lift off the bed, but when my eyes drift to my jeans my ass hits the mattress again. To hell with this. To hell with her. Beth fell in love with Ryan. For weeks she acted like she couldn\u2019t stand him, but knowing her like I do...like I did...Beth didn\u2019t like people who made her feel.</p><p>And damn me to hell, she felt something for him.</p><p>Without thinking too much about it, I snatch the phone out of my jeans. If Beth wants to talk, we\u2019ll talk. I\u2019ll tell her everything I think about her and Ryan and her idea that we can be friends.</p><p>The phone springs to life and my heart stalls out. It wasn\u2019t Beth.</p><p>It\u2019s weird how the anger and tension recedes. What rattles me the most is the flood of anticipation and nerves. Like swaying right on the edge of being high or drunk. The message from Rachel is simple, but the olive branch extended is weighted: Hi</p><p>I stare at it like it\u2019s the answer to life after death. Shit, in my case it probably is: Hey</p><p>Can\u2019t sleep?</p><p>No. You?</p><p>I can feel my pulse at every pressure point in my body. Seconds pass, and there\u2019s a longer pause as I wait for her next message. Come on, angel. Don\u2019t leave me hanging like you did on Saturday night.</p><p>At the dragway you said you liked me.</p><p>I lower my head. She\u2019s going to make me put it in writing. I\u2019ve never felt so much like a sideshow monkey as I do now: Yeah, I like you. A lot.</p><p>I pop my neck to the side. How fucking long does it take to write a response?</p><p>I like you too and I\u2019m also scared.</p><p>I inhale air and release it like a man who\u2019s been pulled from the bottom of a lake. She likes me. I want to see you tomorrow morning.</p><p>I have school.</p><p>I\u2019ll meet you there.</p><p>You have school. Rachel texts back immediately. And your school starts before mine.</p><p>I chuckle. How have I ended up pursuing a girl as naive as her? It\u2019s called skipping. What time do you get to school?</p><p>Isaiah!</p><p>I chuckle again as I imagine those beautiful violet eyes widening and her cheeks turning red at the thought of doing something wrong. I\u2019m skipping. You\u2019re not.</p><p>Noah turns over in bed to face me. \u201cDid you just laugh, bro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I swing by the Malt and Burger tomorrow can you score me breakfast?\u201d</p><p>He assesses me and the cell. \u201cIf it\u2019ll get you to shut up and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>A smile forms on my lips. \u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOriginal, man. Think I said that earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Rachel I said hi.\u201d My best friend knows me.</p><p>My phone vibrates again. I can be there by 8.</p><p>I roll onto my back and hold the phone up as I text back: See you then.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>Rachel</p><p>I RELEASE A SHAKY BREATH as I pull into my school\u2019s parking lot. One hour before the first bell, Worthington resembles a dystopian ghost town. I\u2019ve trashed my morning routine, but it\u2019ll either be really worth it or the resulting aftermath will send me into a panic attack never before seen by man. Only time will tell, but the mere thought of meeting with Isaiah is enough to force me out of my shell.</p><p>Bypassing every open spot, I turn down the one-lane road to the overflow lot and millions of butterflies spring to life in my stomach when I spot Isaiah leaning against his black Mustang. It\u2019s seven-fifty in the morning. He\u2019s early and he\u2019s waiting for me. This is totally unreal.</p><p>I ease my car beside him and my hands tremble when I shift into Park and pull the keys out of the ignition.</p><p>Breathe. Air in. Air out.</p><p>Breathe.</p><p>Keeping the flow of air going, I fiddle with the keys in my lap. Driving here was the simple part. Simple. I wish I could make Isaiah and me simple.</p><p>I glance up, and he watches me through the windshield. The moment our eyes meet he holds up a white bag. The door feels heavy as I open it, and the cool morning air nips at my legs. As I approach Isaiah, I smooth out a lock of my hair and flatten my hands against my coat, then my skirt. I like him. He says he likes me. For the first time in my life, I really want to look my best for someone because...well, because I want him to see me as special.</p><p>In his worn blue jeans and a black T-shirt, the early-morning sun hits Isaiah just right, highlighting him like he\u2019s a relaxed tiger bathing in the warmth. The light glints off his double rows of hoop earrings and there\u2019s a twinkle in his eyes that makes me feel like he has a secret, but not the type kept from me. No, it\u2019s the type that suggests I\u2019m in on it, and that it involves a lack of my clothes.</p><p>And maybe some of his.</p><p>As if I spoke the thought instead of keeping it internal, Isaiah lifts his shirt to scratch at a spot right above his hip bone. Good Lord, he\u2019s pretty. I soak in the sight of the muscles in his abdomen like I\u2019m a plant in the Sahara Desert, except it doesn\u2019t quench my thirst. It only causes my mouth to run dry.</p><p>Isaiah smiles like he knows what I\u2019m thinking, and heat licks up my body and pools in my cheeks. What really causes my blood to curve into itself is the wicked gleam in his eye. It\u2019s a spark that says he\u2019s done very naughty things I\u2019ve never even heard about.</p><p>\u201cI brought food,\u201d he says.</p><p>My stomach growls at the words and my head falls back because he had to hear it. God, why am I always a walking disaster? \u201cI missed breakfast.\u201d And the rest of my morning routine. \u201cSo this is awesome.\u201d</p><p>The bag crunches in his hand when he holds it out and I step close enough to take it from him. My mouth waters as the scent of bacon, toasted carbs and sausage wafts into the air. I peek inside. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of food. Do you also eat small children as appetizers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what you liked so...\u201d He trails off and takes a sudden interest in the nearby football field.</p><p>I brush my bangs away from my face and have to force myself not to bounce. He bought me breakfast. I bite my lip to stop the smile, but then let it go. I\u2019m happy and I don\u2019t care if he knows. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019all good.\u201d</p><p>In the middle of the bag is a half-wrapped bagel with cream cheese oozing down the sides. It\u2019s like I died and went to heaven. I pull it out and hand the bag to Isaiah while motioning at him with the bagel. \u201cDo you want some of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bagel guy.\u201d Isaiah chooses a breakfast sandwich that\u2019s more meat than biscuit. I break off parts of the bagel and eat them while he bites into his. Everything about us is different, yet from what little I know there are some things that are the same\u2014like how we love cars.</p><p>But that\u2019s probably the problem. I don\u2019t know him. He doesn\u2019t know me. I like what I\u2019ve seen. I like most of what I\u2019ve experienced with him, but is it enough? Halfway through one side of the bagel, I lick my fingers and wrap it back up. \u201cI\u2019m sort of a mess.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah slows down his chewing, and I watch as he swallows. \u201cI have to say that is the first time a girl has used that as a come-on line.\u201d</p><p>I laugh without thinking then slam my hand over my mouth because it shocks me that it popped out. \u201cI wasn\u2019t coming on to you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes linger way too long where my uniform skirt ends above my knees. \u201cYou sure about that? Because those legs are telling me something different.\u201d</p><p>My knees rub together as I shift. I have never been as aware of my body as when I\u2019m around Isaiah. My outside, my insides, everywhere\u2014even places I never thought much about before. Places that sort of wake up in his presence. \u201cI was trying to tell you something. Something important.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Isaiah tucks the rest of his sandwich in the bag and places it on the hood of the car. I still hold the bagel and it becomes that obvious thing in my hand that I don\u2019t know what to do with. Nerves have tightened my throat, making finishing it impossible, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m trashing it. Isaiah brought it for me.</p><p>Playing mind reader, Isaiah holds out his hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll stay warm in the bag.\u201d I hand the bagel to him and he asks, \u201cSo what are you trying to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t I have just been happy eating the bagel? \u201cI\u2019m complicated.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs like it\u2019s no big thing. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d My fingers close into a fist. \u201cMy family is really, really...\u201d Messed up. \u201cComplicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me that,\u201d he says. \u201cAt my apartment.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I did.</p><p>\u201cAre you in danger at home?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I answer immediately. \u201cThey just expect a lot...from me.\u201d</p> <p>He nods like he gets it. \u201cWill seeing me be a problem?\u201d</p><p>While there\u2019s this overwhelming voice screaming yes in the back of my mind, there\u2019s a smile twisting on my face and I bring my hands together in front of me, feeling suddenly shy. Did he just say...? \u201cSo we\u2019re seeing each other?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah touches an earring. \u201cYeah. I guess we are.\u201d</p><p>My head bobs back and forth because I so need more. \u201cLike more than friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can be friends if you want. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d My stomach begins to plummet. Did I misread all of this?</p> <p>His gray eyes bore into mine with an intensity I\u2019ve never seen from anyone before. \u201cBut I want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you again.\u201d</p><p>A heat wave crashes into my body and I tug at the collar of my winter coat. I could take this thing off and probably still sweat. The memories of his mouth moving against mine and how his hands pressed into my body flood my brain. I lick my lips in anticipation. I crave for him to kiss me again, but... \u201cAre you going to call me after?\u201d</p><p>A small grin plays on his lips. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to cut me any slack, are you?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like he\u2019s begging me to tease him, and without thought, I slide back to the braver girl at the bar. \u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNot from you.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah pushes off his car and invades my personal space. His dark scent envelops me and my heart literally trips several times as it tries to continue to beat. Even though he doesn\u2019t touch me, it\u2019s like Isaiah is everywhere. Only centimeters separate us, but his warmth surrounds me like a bubble.</p> <p>I have to force myself to lift my chin to look at him. His gray eyes soften, and there\u2019s this playful aura to him, accompanied by a devious tilt of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a mouse with you,\u201d I whisper. \u201cThe one that\u2019s already been caught by the cat.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when he touches me. Isaiah runs his hand through my hair, and every cell in my body vibrates with the gentle pull. \u201cRachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It\u2019s hard to breathe.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah doesn\u2019t wait for my answer. Instead his lips meet mine and his arms wrap around my body. All the hesitancy I felt the first night we kissed evaporates like mist on the heels of a summer storm. Within seconds, our mouths open, and Isaiah slips his tongue against mine. I get lost, liking the way my body curves around his, liking the way my hands explore as if they have a mind of their own, and loving how Isaiah grips my hair while tracing my spine.</p><p>Tingles and shock waves and earthquakes and hurricanes. All of it takes place at the same time as our mouths move not nearly fast enough. Nothing seems fast enough. The closer I become, the closer Isaiah presses, and the more he presses, the more I want to crawl inside and live in this delicious world of warmth and fantastic hunger.</p><p>Isaiah hooks an arm around my waist, and I suck in a breath when he turns us and shifts me up against the door to his Mustang. My eyes widen and I stare up at him as he stares down at me. Our chests move in unison, as do our breaths. My fingers curl into the muscles of his arms, and I briefly close my eyes, loving how his body fits into mine.</p><p>As much as I love it...this is so, so new. \u201cThat was a pretty awesome second kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. How about a third?\u201d</p><p>I giggle, and that rare genuine smile spreads across his face.</p><p>\u201cHow about we try out our third kiss somewhere other than my school\u2019s parking lot?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah rubs that sensitive spot on my shoulder right near the curve of my neck. \u201cI think that sounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>I glance over at the main parking lot and note that cars have begun to fill the first few rows. As much as I wish this moment could last forever, it can\u2019t. Especially when I have two brothers who would lose their minds if they caught me like this with Isaiah. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do about my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like me, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all that matters. Let\u2019s figure this out, pay off Eric, and then we\u2019ll tackle the rest.\u201d</p><p>The blood drains from my face at the mention of Eric and I slip my hands down from his shoulders to wrap around his stomach.</p><p>As if knowing that Eric haunts me, Isaiah brings his arms around me, creating this protective blanket. I rest my head on his solid chest and listen to the sound of his heart. I could get very used to this.</p><p>After a few seconds, Isaiah kisses the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you.\u201d I regretfully slide away. \u201cYou\u2019re going back to school, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Isaiah pulls out the bagel and I take it as the need to bounce again returns. \u201cGo on to class, Rachel. One of us shouldn\u2019t break all the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m a rule breaker,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, I did drag race.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah chuckles. \u201cYou\u2019re gangster for sure.\u201d</p><p>With a silly smile plastered on my face, I retrieve my backpack from the passenger side of my car and wave at Isaiah before walking away.</p><p>Midway across the student lot, my phone rings, and I have to juggle the bagel in order to reach it before the call goes to voice mail. Quickly swallowing a piece, I answer. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Rachel?\u201d Isaiah says.</p><p>I spin around and in the distance I can spot him leaning against his car again. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called.\u201d</p><p>Joy blossoms through me, from my toes up into the rest of my body to the point that I look down to see if I\u2019m flying. \u201cYeah, you did.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>I LEAN AGAINST THE FRAME of a \u201976 Nova and listen as the guys from class shoot the shit during the last remaining minutes of school. Today, some other guys from class and I taught the freshmen how to strip the paint. With the paint job done, they continue their jacked-up conversation about some jock from school caught juicing. Life must suck when you have parents and money to blow on steroids.</p><p>I pull out my phone and reread last night\u2019s conversation with Rachel. The two of us text. Sometimes we talk on the phone. Because of her parents and brothers, it\u2019s hard for her to get out to see me, and I don\u2019t want her taking a risk that\u2019ll raise flags when we have other days that require her being out of the house.</p><p>I try not to overanalyze what\u2019s going on with Rachel. I like her. She likes me. At some point, she\u2019ll change her mind, but for now I\u2019ll enjoy the ride.</p><p>In another world, she would have been the kind of girl I would have taken to dinner and a movie. I would have knocked on her front door, met her father, charmed her mother, brought flowers and done all that wooing shit that guys are supposed to do when trying to win the girl.</p><p>But all that crap means I would have lived another life. One with parents who gave a damn. One where I had a home and maybe a bed frame, maybe a room. In the span of one week, I\u2019ve done the two things the system taught me never to do: felt too much and dreamed of a different life. Wandering thoughts and feelings lead to an impending wreck.</p><p>I shove it all away. I\u2019ve had a past that promises no future so it\u2019s better to stick with the present.</p><p>Last night, my remaining favors came in. I bring up Rachel\u2019s name in a text message. It\u2019s time for me and her to meet again.</p><p>Me: where r u</p><p>The right side of my mouth tilts up with Rachel\u2019s immediate reply: intern in library 4 last period</p><p>Me: got the parts I need 4 your car. Come tomorrow.</p><p>Rachel: Thursday w Mom, remember?</p><p>She mentioned earlier in the week that she had plans with her mom that night.</p><p>Me: Friday, right after school.</p><p>Her: K</p><p>Because I don\u2019t want to let her go yet: Saturday we race.</p><p>Her: :)</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d says Zach from the middle of the group. \u201cYou smiling?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, guess I am. I slide my phone back into my pocket and the smile off my face. My image has kept me alive, and I play the part to perfection: badass, loyal, ready for a fight. \u201cYou staring, man?\u201d</p><p>He raises a hand. \u201cNo offense meant. Are you taking the ASE certification next week?\u201d</p><p>I nod and watch the second hand of the clock. Only a few more seconds until the bell.</p><p>\u201cSome of us are worried,\u201d Zach says. \u201cAbout passing.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve failed a lot of tests in my life, but this is the one I know I can kill. The ten guys I\u2019ve gone through the program with since my freshman year focus on me. For most of these guys, myself included, the ASE is our key to avoid becoming minimum-wage car-wash attendants. \u201cHolden gave us a study guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all know you\u2019re gonna pass,\u201d says Zach. That humming sensation that informs me something\u2019s not right vibrates below my skin. Several of the guys glance cautiously at each other.</p><p>As if preparing for a fight, I widen my stance. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>Most look away or shuffle back. Zach also averts his gaze, but he keeps talking. \u201cYou know it\u2019s computerized, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll all be in the same room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we could find a way where you could offer us assistance during the test?\u201d</p><p>The muscles in my shoulders flex, and the guys closest to me take an interest in the equipment behind them. \u201cI\u2019ve carried your ass for four years, showing you the same shit with cars over and over again. I think that\u2019s been enough assistance.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings and everyone bolts for the door\u2014everyone but me and Zach. Cheating on this test could cost me my certification, and I will not permit anyone to fuck up my future. His shoulders slump and I head for the exit.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d he says as my arm smacks into his. \u201cI hear you\u2019re in debt to Eric.\u201d</p><p>I freeze, our arms still touching. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, but he\u2019s anything but uncaring. \u201cJust repeating what I heard. Wouldn\u2019t want things to become worse.\u201d</p><p>I shift so that we\u2019re chest to chest and tilt my head so that I\u2019m in his face. \u201cIs that a threat?\u201d</p><p>Zach wilts because the ass has always been a coward. \u201cNot if you remember who your friends are.\u201d He slinks toward the hallway and turns at the last minute. \u201cAnd if the person you were texting was Rachel, tell her I said hi.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Certain truths are always self-evident: on the streets there is no such thing as a friend. Zach could be playing odds right now, knowing I\u2019m in debt to Eric and trying to ride the coattails of my fears, but Zach\u2019s never been the creative sort.</p><p>That sick sixth sense continues to rattle around in my brain. If Zach\u2019s become Eric\u2019s lapdog then my life and Rachel\u2019s life just entered another realm of complicated, because that means Eric has upped the stakes of the game.</p><p>Twenty buck says that while Rachel and I have been moving pawns, Eric just moved his rook.</p><p>Chapter 34</p> <p>Rachel</p><p>IN THE SMALLEST CONFERENCE ROOM in Dad\u2019s office, eleven women in various colored business suits and dresses fill the high-backed cushioned chairs. Mom sits at the head of the table, chatting gaily with the woman on her right. To Mom\u2019s left, I continue to push the catered chicken Caesar salad around on my plate so Mom will believe I ate.</p><p>Dad closed the blinds\u2014one solace in the midst of the storm. At least the employees working won\u2019t gawk as they pass by. Mom signed me out of school for this travesty. I call it a speech. Mom calls it an introduction. Really, the few paragraphs are lies.</p><p>The women gathered around the table are the chosen few of Mom\u2019s friends invited to help with her new volunteer position of fundraising coordinator for the Leukemia Foundation. Mom explained last night that they\u2019ll start off with small teas, then lunches, and in a few weeks they\u2019ll move on to a dinner. All of which she has planned for me to attend...and speak at.</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d Mom says. \u201cLet\u2019s take a twenty-minute break before we start the meeting. That will give the caterers time to clean and us time to check on our families.\u201d</p> <p>They giggle, but I\u2019m not sure over what. Some women break off into groups of two or three and whisper private gossip. Some head into the hallway to use their cells or the restroom. I stare at a crouton in my salad.</p><p>Still sitting, Mom pats my hand. \u201cAre you ready, sweetheart? You\u2019ll speak first.\u201d</p><p>My lungs constrict. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I memorized what she wants me to say, but the words have become a jumbled mess in my mind. Sort of like a crossword puzzle completed by someone with dyslexia.</p><p>\u201cMeredith,\u201d one of Mom\u2019s friends calls from the opposite side of the room. \u201cYou have to come look at this.\u201d</p><p>Mom flashes me a smile that reminds me why I\u2019m torturing myself and leaves. I ate two bites of salad and the lettuce and the chicken are not agreeing in my stomach. In fact, I think they\u2019ve declared war.</p> <p>I suck in a breath to calm myself. Only eleven people. Twenty-two eyes. My heart rate increases and I lick my suddenly dry lips. A jabbing pain hits my stomach, and I tug at the collar of my blouse as it becomes hard to breathe. It\u2019s hot in here. Too hot. Hot enough that if I stand I\u2019ll faint, hit my head and bleed all over Dad\u2019s new carpet.</p><p>And then he\u2019ll be disappointed in me.</p><p>And then Mom will be disappointed in me.</p><p>And then my brothers will find out and they\u2019ll blow a freaking head gasket.</p><p>My hands sweat and I rub my palms against my black skirt. What did Mom want me to say? I see the words. They drift in my mind, but not in order. I\u2019m going to fail.</p><p>I stand abruptly, startling the ladies huddled in conversation behind me. Forcing a smile, I nod toward the door, hoping they understand I\u2019m excusing myself. I half trip on the way out as my stomach cramps.</p><p>Mom\u2019s best friend touches my arm as I turn left. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathroom. I mean, I\u2019m trying to find the...\u201d And I ran out of air.</p> <p>\u201cThe bathroom is that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I have no idea why I\u2019m thanking her and by the strained lines on her forehead, she doesn\u2019t, either. This is my father\u2019s office, and one would think I would already know where the bathroom is. I go in the direction she said, praying she doesn\u2019t mention my odd behavior to my mother. Before I hit the bathroom, I take a left through the cubicles and run for my father\u2019s office.</p><p>Please don\u2019t let him be there. Please don\u2019t let him be there. Please. Please. Please.</p><p>I almost cry when I see the light off and the empty chair. Pictures of me and my brothers rest on the table near the window. The only picture on his desk is of Mom and Colleen. It\u2019s always been about her: Colleen. Her name floats in my head as I try to breathe past the first dry heave. In one motion, I flip the switch to his private bathroom and slam the door shut.</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>BECAUSE I WAS BLACKMAILED INTO giving my word to Courtney, I force myself into the Social Services building and grimace at the sight of the messed-up people in the waiting area. Kids cry. Moms scream. Each sound a razor against my skin. It\u2019s so damn clich\u00e9 my fingers twitch; there isn\u2019t a man in sight. Of course there isn\u2019t\u2014men are notorious family leavers.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d Courtney says from behind the receptionist window. Her hesitant smile is too hopeful. \u201cCome on back.\u201d</p><p>The door buzzes open, and I slink past two toddlers on the floor pulling at an already-damaged stuffed zebra. When the door shuts behind me the noise fades, but my skin still crawls.</p><p>Today Courtney wears a blue bow in her ponytail. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought it wasn\u2019t optional.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widens. \u201cIt\u2019s not, but I like to pretend that you want to be here. It makes my day go smoother. Let\u2019s go.\u201d She nods to the right and when I don\u2019t move, she heads down the hallway, looking back to make sure I follow.</p><p>I can almost feel the tug of the leash around my neck. \u201cDo the other hostages you torture tear you apart for wearing a bow in your hair?\u201d</p><p>She stops at a cubicle and grabs a manila file folder. \u201cClients, not hostages. Help, not torture. And you\u2019re my only teenager. The little ones love my bows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should transfer me.\u201d To someone who doesn\u2019t give a shit and will leave me the fuck alone. \u201cYou could pick a hostage you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClient.\u201d Courtney pauses outside a closed door. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>That brings me up short. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says slowly, as if my response surprises her, \u201cI do. Isaiah, I requested to be your social worker.\u201d</p><p>I glance behind me, half expecting a smaller child also named Isaiah to be there. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She knocks lightly on the door. \u201cBecause.\u201d Courtney\u2019s hand rests on the knob. \u201cYou and I agreed on thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve wasted five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent the letter of recommendation in. I kept my part of the bargain, I expect you to keep yours. I call\u2014you answer. I schedule a meeting\u2014you come and stay for thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike rubbing it in, don\u2019t you?\u201d But I\u2019ll show because I gave her my word.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now that we\u2019re firm on the agreement, I should tell you that your mom is here.\u201d</p><p>I tower over Courtney. \u201cFuck no.\u201d</p><p>She never flinches. Instead she tilts her head, causing her ponytail to slide over her shoulder. \u201cAre you keeping your word or not?\u201d</p><p>The muscles in my body turn to lead. I want more than anything to run; to get behind the wheel of my car and gun the engine. The little bitch in front of me has backed me into a corner. I rub at my neck, feeling as if the collar she placed there has spikes.</p><p>Courtney opens the door and anger races like venom in my veins. I stalk into the room and slam my ass into the chair farthest from the woman already sitting at the table. \u201cTwenty-two fucking minutes, Courtney. And if I were you, I\u2019d get the hell out of here because you are the last person I want to see...besides that thing over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d Courtney says apologetically. \u201cI can\u2019t leave the two of you alone with you so angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she says from across the room. I lower my head into my hands. The sound of the soft voice I remember as a child resurrects too many memories\u2014too many emotions. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ll be fine. The same three words she said to me before my entire life went to hell.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise,\u201d says Courtney. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him this upset before.\u201d</p><p>The chair beside me moves and I smell Courtney\u2019s faint perfume. \u201cYour mom just wants to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not my mom.\u201d My voice trembles and a fresh wave of rage washes over me. My mother will not hurt me again. I lift my head and fight for control. \u201cI don\u2019t have a mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen call me Melanie,\u201d she says with the same damn soothing voice that used to sing me to sleep. \u201cWe are strangers.\u201d</p><p>I glance at her and immediately look away because the sight of her causes strangling pain. My head hits the back of the wall and I cross my arms over my chest. \u201cHow many more fucking minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look good, Isaiah,\u201d she tells me. And because I can\u2019t help it, I peer at her again. Her lips are pressed into a thin line and her forehead buckles with anxiety as she stares at me. The thoughts in her head and the words she says are not in agreement. She doesn\u2019t like what she sees: a punk.</p><p>The piercings, the tattoos, yeah, I think the shit\u2019s cool, but what I really like is how they tell people to stay the fuck away. From the way her eyes travel over my arms, \u201cMelanie\u201d reads the signals loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cYou look old,\u201d I say with as much menace as I can muster. She doesn\u2019t look old\u2014just middle-aged. She had me young, barely out of high school. I never knew her age. What six-year-old would? I don\u2019t even know her birthdate.</p><p>Her dark brown hair is cut short at her shoulders. She\u2019s thin, but not drug-addict thin. Her oversize hoop earrings sway when she tucks her hair behind her ear. The blue jean jacket matches her pants and underneath the jacket I spot a gray tank. The worn brown cowboy boots on her feet make me consider a maternity test.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Melanie asks.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean how have I been for the last eleven years?\u201d</p><p>She scratches her forehead. Good, I drew blood. \u201cYeah. And that.\u201d</p><p>I stretch my legs out, kicking one scratched-up combat booted foot over the other. \u201cLet\u2019s see. Years six through eight blew. Found out Santa didn\u2019t exist. I\u2019m pretty sure foster father number two shot the Easter bunny with his sawed-off shotgun during one of his backyard hunting escapades. Foster mom one liked to slap me until I stopped crying. She\u2019d quote Bible verses while she did it because Jesus was obviously about tough love.\u201d</p><p>Melanie shuts her eyes. Attempting to redirect my attention, Courtney nudges her chair closer to mine. \u201cIsaiah, maybe we should take a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, Courtney,\u201d I say with a mock smile. \u201cYou just don\u2019t want me to tell her about the group home I lived in between eight and ten and how the bigger boys used to beat the shit out of me for kicks.\u201d</p><p>I hold my hand out to Melanie. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. They\u2019d punish the other boys and document my bruises in their nice files. Get me a doctor. Maybe a therapist, but it never stopped the new boys from pushing around the smallest kid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Melanie says in a tiny voice.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cYou should be. And what really fucking sucks is to find out that the woman who gave birth to you was released from prison two years ago and never cared to see what happened to her son. That...\u201d I lean forward. \u201cThat is what really blows.\u201d</p><p>Melanie goes dead-person-white, and her hands tremble as she touches her cheeks. \u201cI can explain.\u201d</p><p>And I don\u2019t want to hear it. I stand. \u201cI\u2019ve got to take a piss. Where\u2019s the fucking bathroom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDown the hall.\u201d Courtney massages her temples. \u201cOn the left.\u201d</p><p>I tear out of the room and the door bangs against the wall. From their safe, tidy cubicles, several people gape at me. I ram my hand against the bathroom door and slam it shut, locking it behind me.</p><p>With my palms flat against the door, I suck in deep breaths and swallow the lump in my throat. My mom. My mom. My fucking mother.</p><p>I want to go back and tell her that I still love her\u2014so time can unwind and she can hold me like she did when I was six. I yearn for her to tell me that everything is going to be okay. But all of it is lies. My entire life is one big fucking lie. A strange wounded sound escapes my lips as my body shakes. Every part of me begs to cry and that\u2019s just too damn sad.</p><p>I open the bathroom door to find Courtney waiting on the other side. \u201cShe left.\u201d</p> <p>Good. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s her specialty.\u201d</p><p>Courtney has lost her enthusiasm and part of me hates it. \u201cI learned my lesson,\u201d she says. \u201cI won\u2019t force this again. I thought...I thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat if you could throw us in the same room we\u2019d make up and live happily-ever-after?\u201d</p><p>She releases a loud, pathetic sigh. \u201cActually, no. Look, I know this is the last thing you want to hear, but you should give her another shot.\u201d</p><p>Hell... \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it, and if you change your mind I\u2019ll schedule another meeting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre we done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Next time it\u2019ll be just you and me. I\u2019ll buy ice cream.\u201d</p><p>I blink. \u201cDo I look five?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and almost smiles. \u201cSometimes you act five.\u201d</p><p>And I almost crack my own smile. Did she just joke at my expense? \u201cFunny.\u201d I head for the exit, and when I glance back, I see her smile has grown.</p><p>The gray clouds hang low in the sky. I heard last night that the rest of the winter will be mild. I sure as hell hope so. The track will only stay open if it\u2019s warm. As I approach my car, I spot a woman with short brown hair and a blue jean jacket. I quicken my pace.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d she calls out and walks toward me.</p><p>Is this lady a damn masochist? \u201cMaybe I was too subtle in there, so I\u2019ll make it clear. Fuck off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she says. \u201cPlease, wait.\u201d</p><p>With keys in hand, I point at her. \u201cEven I know you don\u2019t have permission to see me without one of those crazy people inside near us. In case you don\u2019t know, because let\u2019s face it, you wouldn\u2019t, I\u2019m seventeen and their ward. You are on parole, so step back.\u201d</p><p>I could give a fuck if she breaks rules and returns to prison, but I\u2019ll use those laws to keep her from me. She doesn\u2019t stop her advance. \u201cI want to see you again. Promise you\u2019ll let Courtney schedule another meeting. I\u2019ll do anything for the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>With my key in the lock, I freeze. \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>Too much hope floods her face. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred dollars in cash for each visit. Courtney never knows about the money.\u201d</p><p>Melanie blinks as the hope fades. She doesn\u2019t have it. I know she doesn\u2019t have it. It\u2019s why I made the demand. \u201cWhy do you need the money? Are you using drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m a junkie. Are you paying or not?\u201d</p><p>She brushes her hair from her face. \u201cI\u2019ll pay.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>Rachel</p><p>IT\u2019S A PAINFUL PULSE BENEATH my skull and above my brain. It radiates down from my forehead to wrap around my temples, my cheeks and my nose. Light makes the pain worse. Sound nearly kills me. This is the aftermath of my panic attack.</p><p>All off at some important meeting or game or social life event, my family is missing from the house. My lights are on, and my iPod plays softly next to the closed door of my room on the off chance someone does return home before their curfew of eleven\u2014the boys, as sexist as it is, get an hour later than me.</p><p>The goal is to appear normal so I can cover up the migraine. That leaves me lying in bed with a pillow over my head and praying for the pain to cease.</p><p>After vomiting in my father\u2019s bathroom at work, I cleaned myself up and returned to the conference room. Eleven pairs of eyes watched as I stood at the front, beside my mother, and announced how honored I was to speak on Colleen\u2019s behalf.</p><p>My phone rings and the sound echoes violently in my head, yet at the same time a rush of adrenaline hits me. Isaiah is the only person who would call. I adjust the pillow so I can check the caller ID. My lips lift at the sight of his name. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d There is major question in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Just me, my painful migraine and my sensitivity to light and sound.</p><p>\u201cYou sound off.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cI was resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can let you go.\u201d</p><p>Anxiety shoots through my bloodstream at the thought. \u201cNo. I\u2019m glad you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to hear your voice.\u201d</p><p>I wake up when I notice the strained tone in his voice. Suddenly my head doesn\u2019t hurt so bad, and I edge the pillow onto the bed and off my face. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d A car honks. \u201cTell me how the thing with your mom went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say, and place the pillow back over my head. Every part of me flounders. I don\u2019t want to lie to him, too. But if I tell him about my attacks then he\u2019ll view me as weak, and that\u2019ll mess up what\u2019s between us. Maybe I don\u2019t have to lie. I can leave some things out\u2014just like Ethan does to me when he uses twin amnesty. \u201cActually, horrible.\u201d</p><p>I hear a car door close. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can meet someplace and talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Tell me where.\u201d</p><p>I swing my legs off the bed to stand, but the headache hammers my head hard and fast. A sound of pain escapes my lips, and I wince because Isaiah had to hear it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Rachel?\u201d Isaiah became very serious, very fast.</p><p>\u201cJust a headache, I swear. So I was thinking we could meet at this coffee shop\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cuts me off. \u201cYou\u2019re not driving if you\u2019re hurting.\u201d</p><p>I lie back down as my eyesight doubles. With a touch to my iPod, music stops playing from the speakers. I strain to listen for any sound, and all that comes back is glorious silence.</p><p>What I\u2019m about to do is wrong. So wrong. The exact opposite of everything my parents expect from me, and for that reason alone it feels right. \u201cWould you like to come over?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>THE GUARD LEANS OUT OF his little boxed-in brick house at the entrance to Rachel\u2019s neighborhood and assesses me like I\u2019m a serial killer broken out of death row. \u201cWho did you say you want to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel Young.\u201d</p><p>His hand falls to his hip as if he\u2019s packing, but both the rent-a-cop and I know that the only thing he\u2019s carrying is thirty additional pounds of beer and nachos in his stomach. \u201cI think you have the wrong neighborhood, son.\u201d</p><p>Not in the mood for his games, I push redial on my cell and Rachel immediately answers, \u201cAre you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the gate. Do you mind informing your militia that I\u2019m not here to rape and pillage?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cPut Rick on.\u201d</p><p>With his mouth set into a pissed-off line he takes my cell and turns his back to me. His whispered words have an edge to them and after a few seconds he hands me the phone back. The gate lifts in front of me, but my car remains idling next to him.</p><p>I glance at him from the corner of my eye. \u201cDon\u2019t tell her parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cOr what is right.\u201d I place my foot on the clutch and shift into gear. It\u2019s not a threat I\u2019ll carry out, but it\u2019s an empty one worth issuing to keep Rachel safe and happy.</p><p>Following the directions she texted, I wind my way past mansions the size of miniature castles with far more land between them than needed for a single family.</p><p>At the end of its very own road, Rachel\u2019s house sits entirely illuminated against the night sky. It has white columns and white marble steps and what the fuck is she doing with me?</p><p>I drive around the front loop and kill the engine. Therapists, social workers, teachers...they\u2019ve spent years looking down their noses at me, but they were hard-pressed to make me feel smaller than shit. Being here in front of Rachel\u2019s, that\u2019s accomplished what very few have been able to do.</p><p>I force myself out of the car, up the steps, and before I can ring the bell, the door swings open and Rachel greets me with a smile. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s in sweatpants, a T-shirt, and her hair\u2019s pulled up on top of her head with loose pieces falling around her face. Not an ounce of makeup covers her face and she\u2019s barefoot. Each toe painted a mild form of red. Except for the dark circles under her eyes, I\u2019ve never seen something so gorgeous in my life. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Rachel sweeps her hand for me to enter, and I shove my hands into the pockets of my jeans when I step in. People have a fancy-ass name for this type of area of the house and because I\u2019m not fancy-ass, I don\u2019t know it. It\u2019s a hallway that\u2019s a room but is bigger than some of the foster homes I\u2019ve lived in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone will be home before eleven, but if you don\u2019t mind, I think I\u2019d like you to only stay an hour just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing gangster with boundaries. I like it.\u201d The tease is there in my voice, but I can\u2019t stop the sweep of the place. Huge-ass winding stairs. A skylight above me. Several double-doored rooms off to the sides and probably a whole other wing down that hallway straight in front of us.</p><p>Rachel tries to smooth out her hair, but the pieces only fall back to her shoulders. \u201cSorry about this. I know I should have tried to change, but...\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I notice how pale she is, how sick she looks, and a warning sensation crawls along my spine. Something\u2019s wrong. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Rachel lowers her head, but I can tell she liked the compliment. \u201cWe can watch a movie or listen to music or\u2014\u201d She closes her eyes and goes from pale to drained of blood. Her forehead scrunches like she\u2019s in pain, and I reach out to snatch her as she leans to the left.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no fucking headache,\u201d I growl.</p><p>She sucks in air through her nose. \u201cMigraine. I get them occasionally, but I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>Fuck this. I bend my knees and have Rachel up in my arms before she can protest. \u201cWhere\u2019s your bedroom?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mouth falls completely open.</p><p>\u201cYou need sleep. I can come with you or I can put you down and I\u2019ll leave. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d she protests.</p><p>\u201cRachel.\u201d I use the same tone back.</p> <p>\u201cFine. Upstairs on the left.\u201d Giving in, she weaves her arms around my neck and rests her head on my shoulder. I can\u2019t help but note that she fits perfectly.</p><p>Taking two steps at a time, I climb the stairs, cut to the left and pause when I come to two open doors. One room is painted pink. The other purple. Both look very girly and very perfect. The pink room looks younger, but neither fit my image of Rachel. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>She points to the purple room. \u201cThat\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>I do a double take at the pink room before entering Rachel\u2019s and gently place her on the mattress of the four-poster bed. The sheets and blanket are twisted in ways that suggest a restless sleep. Five pillows lie on the floor and three remain on the bed. Rachel eases over and pats the empty space beside her. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>The question is, does she mind? I look over my shoulder, half expecting her father or the cops to show and when I spot nothing, I sit on the bed beside her, leaving my booted feet hanging off. If I keep my shoes on, I\u2019ll remember not to go too far with a girl I\u2019ve only kissed twice and who\u2019s in pain with a migraine.</p> <p>Rachel messes with her fingernail and steals glances at me every few seconds. Girls are normally forward with me. The type that mess with me know what they want, what I\u2019ll give, and they\u2019re prepared to act so they can get it. This change of pace makes me almost as nervous as her.</p><p>I stretch my arm so that it goes around her back, but leave my hand extended so that she knows if she wants me to hold her, she\u2019s going to have to move in my direction. Rachel immediately slides over, places her head on my chest and wraps herself around me. I tuck her closer and nuzzle the top of her head.</p><p>Everything inside of me relaxes, and I didn\u2019t even know I was tense. Remembering she has a headache, my hand drifts up and I begin to rub her temple. I don\u2019t like the idea of her being in pain.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a younger sister,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. That\u2019s Colleen\u2019s room. She died before I was born.\u201d</p><p>My fingers freeze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I know it\u2019s going to sound like an awful thing, but it doesn\u2019t bother me. I mean, it does, because my parents and my oldest brothers are seriously torn up about it, but I didn\u2019t know her. Mom wants me to miss her, but I can\u2019t. Especially not when Mom\u2019s shoving her in my face every five minutes.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an edge in Rachel\u2019s tone I\u2019ve never heard before. \u201cWhat happened with your mom today?\u201d</p><p>Rachel picks lint off my T-shirt and the small pinches of her nails nip my stomach. I close my eyes and slightly shift to keep from thinking about the fact that she\u2019s touching my stomach, even though it\u2019s through a thin piece of material.</p><p>After she\u2019s found every fuzz ball of avoidance, Rachel finally answers, \u201cMy sister died of cancer so my mom raises money for the Leukemia Foundation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmirable.\u201d Though I feel an impending derailment to the good deed. I\u2019ve seen that shit plenty of times with rich people. They sweep in, do their one good deed for the year to cleanse their soul of all the fucked-up things they do the other three hundred and sixty-four days. And most of the time, they jack up that one day, as well. \u201cBut you still haven\u2019t told me what happened with your mom today.\u201d</p><p>Rachel releases a strangled \u201cHumph.\u201d</p><p>I begin to massage her head again, except this time I give in to temptation and run my hand through her hair between rubs. Rachel\u2019s shoulders relax and she melts further against me. The sweet scent of jasmine reaches my nose, and I only want to lie like this forever.</p><p>\u201cWaiting, Rachel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mom has me make speeches on Colleen\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p><p>Rachel gets uncomfortable if I stare at her longer than ten seconds. I can\u2019t imagine her in front of a crowd. \u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>Her head rocks a no against my chest.</p><p>\u201cThey why do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to make her happy.\u201d</p><p>Not having had a mom to want to make happy since I was six, I\u2019m at a loss over what to say so instead I run my hand up and down her spine. I may not understand, but I care.</p><p>\u201cCan I tell you a secret?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>A weighted silence builds between us, and I begin to count the unspoken beats. One. Two. Three. Four.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I hate Colleen,\u201d she whispers like she\u2019s in a confessional. \u201cDoes that make me an awful person?\u201d</p><p>I think of seeing my mom today and of the anger still festering deep inside. If someone had told me she died four years ago when she was in prison, would I have honestly missed her? If someone told me the dad I never knew croaked, I could guarantee there wouldn\u2019t be any tears. If Rachel\u2019s an awful person then I must be related to Satan. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Rachel pulls her head off my chest, and her violet eyes have a glaze that shows the extent of her headache. \u201cAre you just saying that?\u201d</p><p>I brush my fingers under the dark circles of her eyes, wishing my touch could make her better. \u201cI saw my mom today.\u201d</p><p>She blinks and an ache fills my chest. When I opened my mouth, that wasn\u2019t what I thought I would say.</p><p>\u201cDo you see her often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen her since I was six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Isaiah.\u201d Rachel grips the fingers of my right hand and rests our joined hands on my stomach. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I start to say yes, but then think about Rachel telling me about her mom and Colleen. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She squeezes my hand and I squeeze back, grateful that she doesn\u2019t say a thing. There are no words for what happened today. For neither me nor Rachel. Being born into the world is the greatest crapshoot there is. Some are born lucky, others aren\u2019t. For the first time, I see that this rule transcends money.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could make you feel better.\u201d Rachel places her chin back on my chest and flutters her eyelids like it\u2019s a struggle to keep them open. She\u2019s in pain, and she wants to take on mine.</p><p>Not sure how to handle her statement, I rub her temple again while gently guiding her head so that she rests her cheek against me once more. \u201cThis makes me better.\u201d</p><p>Rachel shifts her mouth to the side, clearly not buying it.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I ask to deflect.</p><p>\u201cTired,\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>So am I, but when I\u2019m with her, the weight of my problems doesn\u2019t feel as draining. \u201cGo to sleep. I promise I\u2019ll be gone before anyone knows I was here. Remember, be at the garage tomorrow after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter school,\u201d she repeats.</p><p>Rachel snuggles close, and I tighten my hold. I have a feeling tonight I\u2019ll roll over in bed searching for Rachel, because this moment right here is the closest I\u2019ve come to having peace in a long time.</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>Rachel</p><p>THE ENGINE SWITCHES FROM A growl to a purr as I shift down and ease into the bay of Isaiah\u2019s garage. My heart does that nauseating skip, squeeze, beat once combination the moment I spot Isaiah. His eyes go right to mine, and the slight slant of his mouth gives me flutters.</p><p>Unable to hold his gaze, I stare at the console as I place her in Park. Oh, God, he is happy to see me. At least I think he is. My insides explode at the sight of him striding over. Last night, I fell asleep in his arms and woke up this morning to find my cell on the pillow beside me with the message Tomorrow typed into an open window.</p><p>I thought school was never going to end.</p><p>Isaiah opens my car door and his warm silver eyes smile at me. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I sweep my bangs from my eyes. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>He offers his hand and I accept. His fingers wrap around mine and heat surges up my arm, flushes my neck and settles into a blush on my face. He tugs gently and I slip out. I\u2019m not sure if my body vibrates from the rumbling of the garage door closing or from the blood pounding in my veins.</p><p>Our fingers lace together, and his other hand smoothly cups my hip. I suck in a breath, surprised that someone touches me so easily and with such care.</p><p>\u201cYou look nice,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in my school uniform.\u201d White button-down blouse, maroon-and-black plaid skirt, and a pair of white Keds. Nothing spectacular.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The seductive slide in his voice causes the back of my neck to tickle.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>We snap our heads to the right, and if it weren\u2019t for Isaiah\u2019s hold, I would have stumbled back. Practically on top of us is a girl with long brown hair, a black hoodie and the tightest jeans I have ever seen. I automatically hate her because those jeans make her look good.</p><p>Isaiah sighs loudly. \u201cRachel, this is my friend, Abby. Abby this is my girlfriend, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>I have to restrain from dancing. He called me his girlfriend. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d asks Abby.</p><p>\u201cGreen?\u201d That is a beyond odd question\u2014I mean it\u2019s normal, yet not.</p><p>\u201cTacos or spaghetti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTacos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisney World or Disneyland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRolling Stones or Beatles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeatles.\u201d</p><p>She squishes her lips to the left. \u201cOh, so close, but I can let the last one go.\u201d Abby regards Isaiah with the same familiarity I have with my brothers. \u201cWe should keep her, but we may have to set up a visitation schedule. You know, control issues and all.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows rise. \u201cKeep me?\u201d Abby\u2019s words crash in my mind. \u201cControl issues?\u201d</p><p>She pokes a finger at her chest. \u201cMy issues. Not his. You and I are going to be friends, and I don\u2019t do friendships. Well, I obviously do,\u201d she adds as her finger lazily points to Isaiah. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t count. See, we met inside of a Dumpster when we were ten.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen to the point I start to wonder if I\u2019ll ever blink again.</p><p>\u201cAbby,\u201d says Isaiah, interrupting her before she can continue. \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cMiss You\u201d plays from her phone. \u201cShit,\u201d she says. \u201cHold on a sec.\u201d She answers and heads outside.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d It\u2019s the only response I can think of.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way to describe her. Look, if you don\u2019t want to deal with her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cShe\u2019s your friend...\u201d</p><p>And he interrupts me. \u201cBut if she makes you uncomfortable...\u201d</p><p>My turn. \u201cI like her.\u201d From the moment she said that we\u2019d be friends, I liked her.</p><p>I walk away from Isaiah and stand near the open hood of his car. Holy hell, he\u2019s been busy. \u201cYou installed a cold air intake.\u201d That will help increase the horsepower in his car.</p><p>Isaiah runs a hand over his freshly buzzed dark brown hair. He kept the shadowed stubble on his jaw. If it\u2019s possible, the combination makes him so much sexier and more dangerous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious about Abby. She\u2019s different. I put up with her because I\u2019ve known her longer than anyone else. That type of stuff is important to me, but if Abby bothers you, then I\u2019ll make sure she keeps her distance.\u201d</p><p>I touch the curved piece he added to the engine. \u201cDid you really meet her inside a Dumpster?\u201d</p><p>When he doesn\u2019t answer immediately, I sneak a peek out of the corner of my eye. His hands are on his hips as he stares at the floor. \u201cYeah. We were both looking for food.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes as my heart aches. I can\u2019t imagine what his life has been like.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your pity,\u201d he says with a mix of hurt and pride.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not offering you pity.\u201d Understanding hopefully, not pity. It\u2019s not much, and it\u2019s not nearly on the same level, but it still causes me enough pain that I can\u2019t face him. \u201cI don\u2019t have friends. I have my brothers, and there are some girls at school that I can sit with at lunch if I want to, but they don\u2019t get bent out of shape if I don\u2019t show. I\u2019m...I\u2019m weird.\u201d</p><p>His boots tap against the floor as he moves in my direction. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>I stiffen, irritated and tired of everyone telling me what I am. \u201cHow many girls do you know who work on cars, like speed and can happily tell you what a cold air intake looks like?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah places his fingers underneath my chin and tilts my head in his direction. \u201cOnly one, and she\u2019s my type of girl.\u201d</p> <p>A flurry of rose petals swirls in my chest. I swallow and remind myself to breathe. He lowers his head as I lick my lips. His warm breath mingles with mine and right as our lips come close to connecting, the garage door squeaks open.</p><p>I flinch as if jolted with electricity and immediately slide a foot away from Isaiah. He softly chuckles. An audience obviously wouldn\u2019t bother him. I toss him a dirty look that only makes him chuckle more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got company,\u201d says Abby. Right behind her is the guy that showed with that girl Beth. My hand goes to my stomach as it cramps. Isaiah and the guy share a short shake. \u201cLogan, remember Rachel?\u201d</p><p>He nods at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d My eyes flicker from him to the door as I keep waiting for her to show. A strange uneasiness curls between my skin and bones. Beautiful, confident, mysterious Beth: the antithesis of me and everything a guy like Isaiah should want.</p><p>This week, Isaiah explained how Logan will race his car while Isaiah drives my car at the dragway. The better parts will go into my car since it\u2019s in better condition.</p> <p>Isaiah never mentioned anything about Beth helping, and I never asked. After Isaiah announced that she wasn\u2019t his girlfriend, I thought I could let her go, but the uncertainty of what his relationship was with her before I crashed into his life gnaws at my soul.</p><p>Isaiah claps his hands then rubs them together. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a turbocharger, a cold air intake, an exhaust cutout to install and a girl with a curfew. Let\u2019s move.\u201d</p><p>With anxiety coiled and poised to spring on a moment\u2019s notice, I digress to a bad habit: nibbling on my nails. I used to bite, but then my mother would have an aneurysm when she\u2019d see what I\u2019d done to my manicure.</p><p>I should be right beside Isaiah and Logan as they work on my car, but I can\u2019t. Being in the same room is bad enough. How can anyone watch surgery being performed on a loved one, much less hold the scalpel? Isaiah pushes a button and the lift\u2019s ear-crushing whine accompanies the sight of my car floating into the air. The turbocharger is in. Now he\u2019s installing the cutout to the muffler. Once this is done, my baby will never sound the same again.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Abby. \u201cWhat do best friends do?\u201d</p><p>Kind of like a cartoon character, I whip my head back and forth from Abby to the lift. She\u2019s been next to me during the whole ordeal, sharing strange broken conversations about nothing. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d By best friends?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to the mall.\u201d</p><p>And she gained my full attention. \u201cNever?\u201d</p> <p>Abby twirls the string attached to her hoodie. \u201cWell, yeah, I\u2019ve gone for work, but never to hang. Are you one of those girls? The ones that go to the mall? I think I could do it. Wander the mall for no reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you?\u201d I don\u2019t feel like answering that I don\u2019t hang at malls. Most of the girls I know think my hatred of all things retail is weird.</p><p>She wraps the string tightly around her finger three times. \u201cMalls are expensive, and as I said before, I don\u2019t do friendships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides Isaiah,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cBesides him,\u201d she agrees. \u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d It\u2019s a bold question to ask, but everything about this girl is bold.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she answers. When neither one of us say anything for a while she finally continues, \u201cBecause you like Isaiah. If you like him, then maybe you can like me. Besides, I like bunnies.\u201d</p><p>I try not to smile. A strange answer, yet normal for her. We watch as the two guys tinker with the underside of my car. Actually, Abby observes, I avoid looking. \u201cWhere do you work?\u201d</p><p>Abby pulls hard on her string, causing it to become uneven. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the mall,\u201d I prompt.</p><p>She scratches her mouth as if attempting to hide the uneven smirk. \u201cI don\u2019t work at the mall.\u201d</p><p>I mull over what she said earlier. No, she said...</p><p>\u201cI make deliveries to people at the mall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She must sell cosmetics or something like that. \u201cSo you have a home business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the guy with Isaiah? Is he a friend of yours? He\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s Beth\u2019s friend.\u201d A twinge of jealousy rattles my bones. Abby\u2019s sneakers squeak when she kicks at a nonexistent spot on the floor. While I\u2019ve never asked Isaiah about Beth, Isaiah\u2019s also never offered information. Maybe Abby can fill me in on Beth since Isaiah is closemouthed. \u201cDo you know Beth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says.</p><p>Not helpful. \u201cWere you friends with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. She twisted Isaiah so damn tight even I couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p><p>The overhead heater clicks three times as we all groan. Isaiah turned it off earlier, but we all began to freeze. Cold fingers aren\u2019t good for my baby so he powered it back on. Isaiah swears as he yanks off his T-shirt.</p><p>My heart trips. Last night, I dreamed of touching his body. \u201cHe has a lot of tattoos,\u201d I say, hoping Abby doesn\u2019t notice how I stare at Isaiah.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she replies. \u201cHe got his first one, the tiger, when we were fourteen.\u201d</p><p>Huh. \u201cDoes it mean something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Isaiah won\u2019t discuss his tattoos. He gets them and moves on.\u201d \u201cPaint It Black\u201d plays from her cell. Abby presses a hand to her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta split.\u201d And she disappears, leaving me alone with my thoughts.</p><p>She had Isaiah twisted so damn tight even I couldn\u2019t breathe. Abby\u2019s words circle in my mind. What was an attempt to make me feel better has progressed to nausea tearing at my throat.</p><p>A whistle draws my attention. Isaiah flashes the craziest smile I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cAlmost done, angel. You\u2019re going to love how she\u2019ll sing for you.\u201d</p><p>This time when I smile, I have to force the muscles to comply. How can I compete with Beth\u2014the girl who kept, possibly still keeps, him twisted?</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>THE GODS ARE ON OUR side. The weather\u2019s warm\u2014upper fifties\u2014with clear skies predicted for this Saturday night. With my hip cocked against Rachel\u2019s car, I assess the Camaro pulling beside me in the waiting lane behind the grandstand. The big-ass dragsters are having their turn in the lanes. Next will be the street cars.</p><p>Rachel stands near the hood petting her car like the pony it is. \u201cPromise you won\u2019t wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah, I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>About me? My heart stalls in my chest. Rachel, Logan and I checked out a few races before we signed in and unfortunately, we witnessed a wreck. No one hurt, but it totaled the cars. Rachel\u2019s face faded into an unnatural shade of white when an older guy mumbled how the rules enforced at the track were written by the blood of other generations. Since then, when Rachel\u2019s watched the races, I think all she sees are ghosts.</p><p>I meet her violet eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>She lowers her head, raises it, then lets it fall back. I can\u2019t read her very well and I wish I could. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in your head?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Rachel sucks in a breath to answer right as the driver of the Camaro slides out. Doing what I asked of her earlier when a possible bet came into the picture, she walks straight for the grandstands. Her long hair swings forward, hiding her face. My legs twitch with the desire to follow her, kiss her and ask what\u2019s wrong.</p><p>When Rachel arrived at the garage yesterday, she was one hundred percent with me, but by the time I finished her car, she became distant again. I\u2019ll dig for the issues tonight. Now I need to focus and win us money.</p><p>I glance behind me at Logan. He\u2019s already deep in conversation with his competition: a Dodge Charger. That\u2019ll be a nice race for Logan. That driver always jumps the green light.</p><p>The Camaro driver appreciates Rachel\u2019s car. \u201cWhen did you upgrade?\u201d</p><p>He may not know my name, but he recognizes me by my old car. I\u2019m the same with him. \u201cThis week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill think you can take me?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cEasily.\u201d</p><p>He nods to his car. \u201cI\u2019ve made some updates, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot concerned.\u201d</p><p>Just as I hoped, he produces a wad of cash from his pocket. \u201cThen you won\u2019t mind putting money on the table.\u201d</p><p>No. I wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>Rachel</p><p>MY FINGERS KNOT AROUND THE cold metal fence as I watch Isaiah drive my car to the burnout area. The accident we saw occurred a second after the race began. A tire blew, causing the driver to lose control and ram into the side of a Chevy Comet.</p><p>It scared the crap out of me\u2014especially when a burst of flame shot out one of the cars. Men scrambled over the barricades, hauling the drivers to safety, spraying fire extinguishers at the hood. Isaiah went to launch himself over the fence to help, but my grip on his arm stopped him.</p><p>I looked up at him. He looked down at me. And when my body began to tremble, he placed an arm around me.</p><p>Isaiah drives past the waterline, jerking me back to the present, and he immediately heads to the staging area. The unexpected move paralyzes the anxiety spiders crawling in my stomach. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he doing a burnout?\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cBecause the car doesn\u2019t have slicks,\u201d says Zach as he approaches me and leans an arm on the fence. His blond hair shags over his face. \u201cStreet cars typically avoid burnouts.\u201d</p><p>Right. Slicks are a type of tire that sticks better to the tracks. Zach was nice last weekend, but he reminds me of the guys from my school\u2014how he speaks, knows everyone, and how he has plenty of the girls vying for him. So, in other words, he puts me on edge, and I slip back into Rachel mode. I step away from him when he invades my personal space. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The driver competing against Isaiah spins his tires at the waterline, creating a haze of white smoke. Because the Camaro has slicks, will it have an advantage? Isaiah bet everything he had against this guy: fifty dollars. If we don\u2019t win, we go home.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you race,\u201d I say to Zach when I think of something coherent.</p><p>\u201cThe Cobra sounded funny so I\u2019m sitting her out.\u201d</p><p>I nod to let him know that I heard him, but keep my eyes on Isaiah. Please, please, please God, take care of Isaiah.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s your car, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I wish he\u2019d be silent. If he talks then I can\u2019t concentrate, and if I can\u2019t concentrate then God will stop listening to my prayers.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you driving?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s competition hits the second staging line. The yellow lights flash down and right; as the light turns green, my car lurches with a power I never believed possible, lifting the front wheels. Isaiah rushes forward, with the Camaro following less than a second behind. Both cars fly by me, with Isaiah easily in the lead.</p><p>Come on, come on, come on... Yes! Isaiah crosses the finish line first. I lower my head and suck in a breath. Thank You, God, for keeping him safe.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d asks Zach.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d This is awkward. \u201cNo. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that I want to race against you.\u201d</p><p>The red lights of my car glow in the distance as Isaiah leaves the track. My body automatically angles toward the exit, as if a gravitational pull exists between Isaiah and me. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Isaiah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Rachel.\u201d Zach places a hand on my arm and his unwanted touch feels foreign against my skin. \u201cI want to race you when you drive your car.\u201d</p><p>I move my arm, pretending to itch my shoulder. \u201cI won\u2019t be racing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d I don\u2019t know how to explain in a way that doesn\u2019t make me appear weak.</p><p>\u201cBecause Isaiah\u2019s one of those guys that doesn\u2019t think that a girl should be behind a wheel.\u201d</p><p>I huff. \u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got money.\u201d Zach smirks. \u201cAnd I hear he needs it. Tell him I\u2019ll race, but only against you. He knows my stakes.\u201d</p><p>Something deep inside of me shifts, and it\u2019s not the good type of stirring.</p><p>\u201cAnd Rachel?\u201d Zach begins to slowly walk backward. \u201cIf you were my girl, I\u2019d let you race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not like that,\u201d I say, but Zach already turned his back to me and is too far away to hear.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not,\u201d I repeat. At least I don\u2019t think he is.</p><p>Isaiah permitted Logan to drive his car without seeing how he would do behind the wheel. Yes, I messed up once, but why hasn\u2019t Isaiah granted me another chance?</p><p>Maybe because he\u2019s discovered my secret. Maybe he already knows that I\u2019m weak.</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>HITTING EIGHTY-NINE, I SHIFT DOWN and slam my hand onto the steering wheel. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m fucking talking about!\u201d</p><p>The surge of adrenaline rushing through my veins makes me feel like I\u2019m flying high without the loss of control that drugs or alcohol brings. This is the only time I feel truly alive. I turn left at the end of the drag strip and pause for my competition to catch up: a Nova with sweet upgrades.</p><p>This is my last race for the night and damn, I feel good. My competition, a guy ten years older than me, shakes his head as he gets out of the car with a hundred in his hand. \u201cI should have smoked you, kid. What\u2019s under my hood is ten times what you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. His upgrades should have kicked my ass. I take the money and resist the urge to kiss it. \u201cGood race, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour reaction time at the light is insane,\u201d he says. \u201cI want a rematch Friday night.\u201d</p><p>My luck must be changing. \u201cBring cash and I\u2019ll race you all night.\u201d</p><p>We share a short nod, and I drive Rachel\u2019s car to where Logan and Rachel wait for me. I\u2019ve won every race tonight. After getting his feet wet, Logan won more than he lost, bringing money to the table.</p><p>In the darkness, Rachel shines as bright as the sun. Her hair a halo framing her face, her eyes stars. \u201cThat was awesome!\u201d</p><p>In two easy strides, I reach her, weave my arms around her waist and lift her feet off the ground. My angel is so light she practically floats. \u201cIsaiah! You\u2019re crazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cInsane,\u201d I answer.</p><p>She rests her forehead against mine and braids her hands tightly on my neck. \u201cThat was close. He almost got you in the end.\u201d</p><p>I love the sensation of her body against mine. Tonight, I\u2019m going to kiss her again and, if she\u2019ll let me, I\u2019ll explore a little further. \u201cWere you doubting me?\u201d</p><p>She smiles when she notices the lightness in my voice. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right, angel. I\u2019ll never let you down.</p><p>Rachel wiggles in my hold. \u201cYou\u2019re strong.\u201d</p><p>My lips twitch. \u201cPure steel.\u201d Strong enough to protect you.</p><p>\u201cHate to break in here,\u201d says Logan, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got a game tomorrow and a full pocket.\u201d</p><p>I set Rachel on her feet while keeping her tucked beneath my shoulder. \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Though I consider The Motor Yard safe, it\u2019s still not a good idea to flash money\u2014especially the type of money Logan and I banked tonight. Logan follows me back to my apartment, where we had left his car.</p><p>Logan hands me his wad of cash. \u201cHave you ever thought of adding a nitro system? Those cars were flying.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019ll put us against a different class of cars, and in order to compete in that we\u2019ll have to go bracket racing. Plus, nitro\u2019s some crazy-ass shit. A lot can go wrong.\u201d</p><p>Logan flashes his not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity grin. \u201cAll the more reason to do it. What\u2019s bracket racing?\u201d</p><p>Leaning against her car, Rachel tunnels her hands into the sleeves of her black coat. She\u2019s cold, and I crave to make her warm. \u201cI\u2019ll explain it later.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s eyes shift to Rachel. \u201cGot it. See you.\u201d</p><p>He drives away and I head over to my angel. \u201cWant to see how much we made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Rachel allows me to open the door for her in the entrance and to my apartment. Once inside, she slides off her coat and rests it on the kitchen table. In a nervous gesture, she laces her fingers together and glances around the room. \u201cIs your roommate home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s staying with Echo tonight. You sure your brother will cover curfew?\u201d</p><p>She stares at her fingers. \u201cI covered for him last night so he agreed to tonight.\u201d</p><p>Giving her space, I sit at the card table and begin counting cash. She sinks into the other folding chair and counts the other pile. For a brief few seconds, the only sound in the room is the scratching of dollars moving against each other, and thanks to the crazy bat downstairs, we get to listen to Elvis singing about shoes.</p><p>\u201cSix hundred,\u201d she says in awe. That would be my winnings.</p><p>\u201cFour hundred and forty,\u201d I tell her, holding Logan\u2019s stash.</p><p>Rachel slumps in her seat as if in shock. \u201cOff of your fifty and Logan\u2019s twenty we made one thousand and forty dollars.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Has it not hit her that in one race on the streets the pot was five thousand dollars? And that was a slow night.</p><p>She leaves the table and begins to pace. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this, aren\u2019t we? We\u2019re going to pay Eric off and be free of him, and my parents will never know what I did. I mean, we have over two-thousand dollars already.\u201d</p><p>My mind clears with that info. \u201cHow are you coming up with two thousand?\u201d</p><p>Rachel repeats the endless loop she\u2019s created from one corner of the couch to another. \u201cI have a thousand. A little over five hundred in birthday and Christmas money. I pawned some jewelry for another five hundred. Oh, Isaiah.\u201d Her face flushes. \u201cWe\u2019re close to halfway there. We could pay Eric back before the six weeks.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s a mixture of anxious and excited, and those feelings become contagious. Knots form in my stomach and I think of the million ways I want to touch her and kiss her and let her know that she\u2019s the only one in my life.</p><p>What I should tell her is that tonight will be our only money rush. Now that people know how Logan and I race, they\u2019ll either avoid us or not wager as much. I have no doubt we\u2019ll raise the amount we need, but it could still be a struggle.</p><p>I also decide to keep it to myself that Eric has eyes on us and that he\u2019ll be unhappy we\u2019re making money.</p><p>Rachel finally stops the frantic path she\u2019s wearing onto the subflooring. Her face beams. She\u2019s light in a world full of darkness. Rachel is happy and that\u2019s all I desire.</p><p>\u201cWe could be together, Isaiah. With no worrying over Eric or debts or anything. We could be happy.\u201d</p><p>Electricity shoots into my veins and shocks me as if I\u2019ve never been alive. I stand abruptly, knocking over the folding chair. My heart races and this surge is something unknown. Something I don\u2019t understand. Something that fosters confusion, panic.</p><p>Her eyes glimmer with too much adoration; with too much of an emotion I\u2019ve only seen people give to anyone other than me. I see love in her eyes and it scares the hell out of me.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go,\u201d I say. My voice is deeper than normal and a tremor courses through my body. My eyes burn as a shadow crosses her face, snuffing out all the light. Damn me to hell. I\u2019m the one who created that sorrow. If I stay with her, she\u2019ll never know light and happiness.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d she says carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home.\u201d I swipe the money off the table and stalk into the bedroom. With three steps, I circle the room and perform the act again. My thinking is messed up, as if I\u2019m high or took a severe blow to the head. My thoughts detach from my mind, away from my body.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d comes a soft voice from behind me.</p><p>Why hasn\u2019t she left? \u201cNothing. I\u2019m looking for a place to hide the money. This is a shitty place, Rachel, and awful things happen here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike people breaking in,\u201d she says.</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what can happen. \u201cJust go.\u201d</p><p>Rachel looks small and defenseless as she rests her temple against the door frame. The dim light of the kitchen silhouettes her frame. Obscured by blackness, I can\u2019t see her face.</p><p>\u201cYou could give the money to me.\u201d Her voice is so soothing that part of me clings to the sound. \u201cWhere I live is safe.\u201d</p><p>My thoughts collide into one another. The back of my legs hit the bed and I sink onto it. My entire life is one long thick rope full of knots and kinks where people have twisted me inside and out. Nothing about me is solid or sturdy. I\u2019m frayed and tattered. \u201cI\u2019m no good, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the cash in my hands. My fingers clench and the money crackles. I won\u2019t lead Rachel further into the abyss. This ends here. It ends tonight. \u201cYou need to leave and never come back. I\u2019ll race my car. I\u2019ll pay off the debt. Leave and know I\u2019ll always keep you safe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence.

A touch so light I almost believe I\u2019m imagining it presses on my shoulder. \u201cI think I\u2019m falling for you, Isaiah.\u201d</p><p>My head dips. I think I\u2019m falling for you, too, and it terrifies me.</p> <p>The pressure remains on my shoulder as the fingers of her other hand trace the compass tattooed on my forearm. \u201cI don\u2019t know what love is or how it should feel, but I know that when I\u2019m with you I like who I am, and that\u2019s never happened to me before.\u201d</p><p>I like who I am when I\u2019m with her. The music below us is soft, lyrical with a steady beat. Elvis\u2019s deep voice sings about suspicious minds.</p><p>\u201cI like who you are, Isaiah, and I like how you look at me. But what I really like is the rush that hits me when you\u2019re in the room.\u201d</p><p>Because Rachel has always been magic, she gives words to the emotion tearing at my soul. \u201cPeople don\u2019t attach themselves to me, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>She kisses my shoulder, and a shudder runs through my body, igniting every cell. \u201cThen maybe they don\u2019t know you like I do.\u201d</p> <p>The finger tracing the tattoo slides down to my hands. \u201cGive me the money, Isaiah. Trust me to keep it safe.\u201d</p><p>I clutch the money tighter, but as her hands weave around mine, my grip loosens. \u201cDo you understand the trouble, the danger, you\u2019re taking on?\u201d</p><p>With her fingers holding on to the cash she whispers, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I place my hand over hers. \u201cPut it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Isaiah...\u201d</p><p>I lift my head. \u201cIf you say you\u2019re going to keep it safe, I believe you, but right now, I want you to put it on the floor.\u201d</p> <p>She half smirks with a twinkle in her eye. \u201cYou\u2019re bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I admit. Hear what I\u2019m saying, Rachel. Listen to what a controlling mess you\u2019re falling for. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>The money hits the floor, and my hands immediately frame her face. She has skin so soft that I worry about damaging her with a gentle touch. Her breathing hitches as my lips come close to hers. I\u2019m going to kiss her. \u201cTell me I\u2019m who you want.\u201d So I know there are no mistakes.</p><p>Her nose slides against mine as she slowly nods. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone else.\u201d</p><p>God help us both for her allowing the devil permission.</p><p>Chapter 42</p><p>Rachel</p><p>THE KISS COMES HOTTER AND faster than before. Our lips move quickly, a hunger grows between us that can\u2019t seem to be quenched. There\u2019s a rhythm, a dance, and somehow, I know the steps. An instinct tells me to follow his lead, to explore even further, to touch.</p> <p>My hands drift down his back and when I feel scorching skin near the hem of his shirt, I gasp for air. Isaiah moans, and his lips leave mine to travel along my throat. My heart picks up speed as my entire body becomes one live electrical current.</p><p>His tongue swirls against the sensitive skin right where my jaw meets my neck. I shiver and press my body closer to his. When he meets my lips again, Isaiah loops his arm around my waist and pulls me farther onto the bed. On our sides, his body heat penetrates past my clothes, past my skin, creating an inferno in my blood.</p><p>A sudden coldness causes my eyes to flash open. Kneeling beside me, Isaiah\u2019s hands go behind his head and he yanks off his shirt, tossing it to the floor. A flutter of excitement and nerves trembles in my stomach. I swallow and stare at the golden tiger rippling with the muscle in his arm. Biting my lip, I dig deep for courage. My hand reaches out. Stops. And I curl my fingers in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Rachel. Go ahead.\u201d He angles so that the tiger is closer to me.</p><p>I outline the tattoo, enjoying its beauty. \u201cI love this one.\u201d</p><p>In the beams of street light scattered into the dark bedroom by the slatted blinds, I watch as Isaiah\u2019s eyes melt into silver. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite,\u201d he says. \u201cOne day I\u2019ll get a tattoo for you.\u201d</p><p>Warmth explodes in my chest, in awe that he would mark himself for me. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d His fingers trace my cheek and chills of pleasure run down my spine. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do. Each tattoo represents the only happy memories I\u2019ve had. And you, Rachel, you\u2019re the happiest.\u201d</p><p>My lips move up, and his fingers brush them in response.</p><p>\u201cI dream of your smile.\u201d He follows the curve as if he\u2019s an artist. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about you every night since the first night we met.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a power I only feel when I\u2019m with Isaiah. A boldness I\u2019ve never possessed in my life. Never in a million years would I have imagined I\u2019d be the girl who\u2019d say she was falling fast for a boy before he did. Never in a million years did I think I\u2019d be lying in bed with a totally ripped guy that has his shirt off. But Isaiah has this effect on me. He makes me feel stronger than I really am.</p><p>There\u2019s a pulse in my body, vibrating every pressure point. \u201cI like kissing you.\u201d</p><p>His hand lowers to my waist. \u201cI could kiss you forever.\u201d</p><p>I lazily glance at him from under my eyelashes. \u201cJust kissing.\u201d Because I think I\u2019ll combust if we do more.</p><p>The right side of his mouth quirks. \u201cJust kissing. And some touching.\u201d To prove his point Isaiah\u2019s hands caress my back, weave into my hair and slide against the dip of my waist.</p><p>Yes, definitely some touching. I inhale deeply, reminding myself that breathing is still a requirement. \u201cI agree. Some touching. No new clothes off.\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019d probably pass out at the thought of his jeans off. They already hang low on his hips. Too low. Very low. Low enough that I start to imagine what more there is to him.</p><p>Isaiah wraps his hand around the back of my neck and performs this deep massage that makes my eyes roll into my head in ecstasy. \u201cI\u2019ll put my shirt back on if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I breathe out. \u201cI\u2019m fine with it off.\u201d More than fine.</p><p>I lick my lips as his teeth nibble on my earlobe. Between my muscles melting under his touch, my blood tingling with the teasing of my ear and the way my foot rubs against his calf, my thoughts become hazy.</p><p>My shirt rides up and Isaiah rubs his thumb in small circles on the bare skin of my stomach. The sensation causes me to arch my back and Isaiah groans as I kiss his neck. I like these feelings. Actually, I more than like them. They\u2019re addicting, and I love how every little thing I do causes Isaiah to kiss and touch me more.</p><p>He rolls and I move with him. Our tangled legs become unraveled as my thighs fall open, accepting his weight. Isaiah\u2019s body over mine is heavier than I would have imagined, but it\u2019s a weight I craved without knowing it.</p><p>Isaiah kisses up my neck and when his lips meet mine again, he rocks his hips. Suddenly very aware parts of him are touching very aware parts of me, and my head falls to the side as a new sensation spikes through my body. One I\u2019ve never felt before. One I want to feel again. One that...</p><p>My hands slip to Isaiah\u2019s chest and I push. \u201cIsaiah.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah rolls us again, except this time his back is against the mattress and he slides me next to his side. His chest moves up and down at a rapid pace, and that\u2019s when I notice that my breaths match his.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod, unable to think of anything coherent to explain why I did what I did. It was just new and fast and glorious and...</p><p>Isaiah places his fingers under my chin and has me look into his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whisper, but to be honest, I don\u2019t know if it is. I\u2019m seventeen. Everyone else I know has done more...some way more...some into territories beyond way and into lands I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever visit.</p><p>Isaiah has to be more experienced than me. Has probably been with the girls who have no fear of pushing every boundary. Is it really okay for me to be... \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m slow.\u201d</p><p>He brushes my hair over my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not slow.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d When he sees I\u2019m unconvinced, he rubs at his stubble and starts again. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to give any more than you want. What makes this special is that you\u2019re into it. The moment you aren\u2019t, that\u2019s where I become a bastard for asking for more. I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019ve got no problem taking it slow.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. It\u2019s the right words, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop with the analyzing. Rachel, I\u2019ve listened to the same movie bullshit you have about guys wanting to find the right girl and then wanting to take it slow because they believe the girl is worth the wait. I\u2019ll admit, I never believed it, but meeting you...it\u2019s not bullshit anymore.\u201d</p><p>The right side of my mouth curves up. I\u2019m worth waiting for.</p><p>Chapter 43</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>THE CLOCK ON THE SCREEN flashes as it hits the one-minute mark. I finished the test fifteen minutes ago, but I review my answers repeatedly. This is my future, and there is no room for mistakes. In less than sixty seconds, I\u2019ll have earned my ASE certification.</p><p>The computer freezes\u2014time\u2019s up. What had been a silent room becomes noisy as the other guys from class who took the \u201cfield trip\u201d to the testing center relax back in their seats and talk to one another.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d Zach calls. \u201cHow\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I kicked ass.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He leaves his buddies and rests his hip against the half cubicle wall meant to dissuade cheating. \u201cDid Rachel tell you about my proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you need to be proposing anything to my girl.\u201d The area between my skin and muscles vibrates. Rachel didn\u2019t tell me crap, but I won\u2019t let Zach know that. I plaster a deadpan look on my face, stretch out my legs so that Zach has to move and angle my arms so that he sees my tats.</p><p>Zach takes a wise step away. \u201cJust trying to help. Heard you need money and you know I\u2019ll match any wager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to race me, you come to me. Not to Rachel.\u201d</p><p>He becomes a cocky prick when he smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t want to race you. I want to race her.\u201d</p><p>My legs fold in as I lean forward. Zach nearly trips over himself as he stumbles back. \u201cShe\u2019s not racing.\u201d An eerie silence hangs in the room as everyone watches the showdown.</p><p>After a few seconds of me staring and Zach saying nothing, the room returns to normal.</p><p>\u201cMoney is money,\u201d mutters Zach. \u201cWho cares who drives?\u201d</p><p>I whisper so only he can hear, \u201cI\u2019m not racing for ten bucks. I\u2019ve made serious money so I\u2019m betting serious money.\u201d</p><p>He glances around to verify everyone else has returned to their business. \u201cI\u2019m making serious money now. I\u2019ll match whatever you got.\u201d</p><p>I stare straight at him and, like always, Zach averts his eyes. Zach comes from a broken home, and they\u2019ve always lived on the edge of government assistance. There\u2019s no way this asshole fell into money this fast without playing with the devil. \u201cTell me you haven\u2019t become Eric\u2019s bitch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zach nervously laughs, but before he can try to deny it, I hook a foot around the chair next to me and shove it into his legs. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>He looks around, trying to save face, but sits anyway. Once upon a time, he and I could have been considered friends and because of that, I give him this break. \u201cYou and I both know that Eric\u2019s bad shit. If you\u2019ve fallen in, maybe I can help you out.\u201d</p><p>Zach bows his head as he pulls his legs under the chair. \u201cHe just wants Rachel to race me. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Fuck me. My fingers tighten into fists. \u201cHe wants Rachel and me to fail.\u201d</p> <p>His head snaps up. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing this all wrong. Eric wants to help us. He said if the two of us work for him then he can pay us cash. Real cash. Not the minimum wage we\u2019re going to end up with after we graduate. We\u2019ll be kings, Isaiah. Not the trash we are now.\u201d</p><p>I kick the wall between us and the keyboard falls to the floor. \u201cEric owns you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot own. He\u2019s helping me, just like he wants to help you.\u201d</p><p>Before I can ask how the hell he\u2019s become so delusional he believes any of that shit, Mr. Holden enters the room. \u201cTest results are in. I\u2019ll call you out one at a time to go over the results. Isaiah, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>My heart thrashes and I stand, trying to control the anger. I lean down and whisper the threat. \u201cStay the fuck away from Rachel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t touch me,\u201d Zach replies.</p><p>Since he\u2019s under Eric, maybe not, but Eric\u2019s underestimating what I would do to keep Rachel safe.</p><p>Chapter 44</p><p>Rachel</p><p>WITH MY HAND LINGERING OVER the equation, my pencil rocks back and forth. Third-period Physics is torture. Both of my brothers are in here, along with over half of their friends, and the remaining people in the class love to gossip about me. We were supposed to separate into groups of four, but let\u2019s be honest, I don\u2019t like groups.</p><p>The sun filters through the windows and bathes me in warmth. I could probably focus better if I could stop daydreaming about Isaiah. Each time I think of how he rolled us in bed and how his body covered mine, I smile.</p> <p>\u201cHave you figured it out yet, Rach?\u201d West whispers.</p><p>That snaps me out of the daydream. Ethan and West, of course, are in a group together, with two of their buddies. Because the room is uneven, I avoided a group, but I can\u2019t ditch my brothers. They hover next to me.</p><p>\u201cThere are four of you and one of me. I\u2019d say your odds are better than mine,\u201d I answer. The pencil moves faster in my hand.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re good at this shit,\u201d says West.</p><p>With a screech of metal against the linoleum floor, Ethan slides his desk closer to mine. \u201cShe\u2019s got an answer. Give it here.\u201d</p><p>Before I can protest, West grabs my sheet and places it in the middle of his friends. \u201cThank you, baby sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done yet,\u201d I whisper severely. \u201cThat\u2019s only half the equation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than a blank sheet,\u201d mutters Ethan.</p> <p>\u201cBesides.\u201d West winks as he flicks my paper back at me. \u201cIt\u2019s all about family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Young.\u201d Our Physics teacher looms over the group.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d asks West. \u201cThere are two of us and a Miss.\u201d</p><p>Our physics teacher doesn\u2019t like West. He\u2019s a smart-ass. Which means she\u2019s not a big fan of me and Ethan by default. \u201cI don\u2019t remember Rachel being included in your original group.\u201d</p><p>I press my face into my hand and tilt it so that I\u2019m looking out the window and not at the class watching the power trip.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s our sister. Of course she\u2019s included in our group.\u201d</p><p>Paper crinkles, and I peek to see her examining everyone\u2019s sheets. \u201cIt\u2019s the same answer, but half done.\u201d</p><p>West relaxes in his seat, totally unaffected by her accusation of copying. \u201cWe\u2019re a group. I think that\u2019s expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain it,\u201d she says. \u201cExplain how you solved half the answer.\u201d</p><p>West\u2019s mouth pops open, then he shuts it. \u201cRachel was in the process of explaining it to us. See, we were a little lost, and we didn\u2019t want to hold her back so she went ahead with the work and stopped halfway so she could teach us.\u201d</p><p>Our physics teacher\u2019s eyes settle on me. So do West\u2019s and Ethan\u2019s. So do the eyes of their friends and of everyone else who has made fun of me since middle school.</p><p>\u201cWell then, Rachel.\u201d In an overdramatic swooping motion, our teacher gestures me toward the front of the room. \u201cSince you\u2019re so generous, why don\u2019t you go to the board and teach the rest of the class how to complete the first half of the equation?\u201d</p><p>Blood and heat rush to my face. Besides the fact this is one of my worst nightmares, I\u2019m not even sure if I have the equation right. What if I\u2019m wrong? What if I fall apart? At least with the speeches I can prepare for the impending meltdown.</p><p>This...this is out of nowhere. Begging for a way out, I frantically glance at West and Ethan. West locks his eyes on the floor while his fingers drum against his desk in an angry rhythm. \u201cThat is not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is,\u201d says Mrs. Patterson. \u201cUnless you want to explain the work, but keep in mind, what goes on that board is your group\u2019s grade.\u201d</p><p>West jerks in his seat. Ethan leans over and whispers, \u201cHe\u2019s going to blow.\u201d</p><p>West is one detention away from suspension, a fact Ethan and I have helped hide from Mom, and Ethan\u2019s grades have dropped this semester. He can\u2019t risk a bad score. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>West\u2019s head shakes back and forth, heat from his anger creating small red circles on his cheeks. Ethan kicks at our brother from underneath the desks. The two share a look, and both immediately focus on the floor.</p><p>When I reach the board, my body trembles as I grab the dry erase marker. I clear my throat twice and perspiration forms along my hairline. A couple of girls in the corner giggle.</p><p>My voice breaks as I incoherently explain how I solved half the equation. Due to my quaking hand, the numbers barely resemble squiggles. I clear my throat again, this time tasting bile. I inhale, only for the air to stop before reaching my lungs. My palms sweat, and the marker slips from my grasp. It taps the floor twice before rolling under the teacher\u2019s desk. The world becomes a tunnel. Around me, laughter erupts.</p><p>\u201cRachel.\u201d Mrs. Patterson sounds distant, almost like an echo. \u201cI was wrong. As the teacher, I should be showing the class.\u201d</p><p>My breathing is short, shallow, and my head has that floating feeling like when I\u2019m sick with a fever. A buzzing noise fills my ears. Everyone stands and gathers their things. I try to suck in air, but my lungs won\u2019t expand. If I can\u2019t breathe, I\u2019ll die.</p><p>Ethan appears in my line of vision. \u201cShe\u2019s fine, Mrs. Patterson. Aren\u2019t you, Rachel?\u201d</p><p>I nod. No, I\u2019m not fine. Ethan wraps an arm around me and ushers me into the hall. Cold metal supports my back. A hanging lock digs into my kidney.</p><p>West appears in the tunnel. \u201cWhat the hell, Ethan? I thought she was over this shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreak into her locker and get her stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to get her to a bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Lunch is me, West, Ethan and a bottle of Sprite. Because West plays every sport imaginable, he was able to sneak us into the guy\u2019s changing room. Sitting on an old jersey that had been stuffed into the abyss of West\u2019s locker, I glance at the toilet bowl containing the remnants of breakfast.</p><p>Confident I\u2019m going to survive, I flush the toilet and peek at my two brothers, who have hovered over me since the end of third period. \u201cSee,\u201d I say with a raspy voice. \u201cNo blood.\u201d</p><p>But my throat is raw and sore. If I continue to vomit with the attacks, it won\u2019t be long until the blood vessels in my throat crack.</p><p>Holding on to the stall door, West\u2019s knuckles turn white. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>I drink slowly, buying myself not nearly enough time. West\u2019s fingers tap a death march. He isn\u2019t going to let this go. \u201cIt never stopped,\u201d I answer.</p><p>His head whips to Ethan. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been in on this?\u201d</p><p>Ethan won\u2019t stop staring at the toilet. \u201cFor a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>I wince when West slams the door against the neighboring stall. \u201cShe was in the hospital over this shit. Do you want to watch her body waste away again?\u201d</p><p>Tears threaten my eyes, and I rub at my nose. \u201cJust stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d West shouts. \u201cWhy should I stop? You\u2019ve been lying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Ethan spits at West. \u201cYou pretended not to see it. So did I. Look me in the eye...no, look Rachel in the eye and tell her that you haven\u2019t suspected the truth the entire time. She lied to make Mom happy, to make us happy and you\u2019re pissed the dream is over.\u201d</p><p>West takes two steps and stands nose to nose with Ethan. The anger in the air between them is so thick I could gag. They\u2019re the same height, both over six feet. Ethan with dark hair and dark eyes. West with blond hair and blue eyes. Brothers less than a year apart.</p><p>West shoves his finger in Ethan\u2019s chest. \u201cYou should have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you know.\u201d</p><p>After a few more tense seconds, West eases away. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe keep the secret,\u201d says Ethan. \u201cMom\u2019s happy. Jack\u2019s working on Gavin.\u201d</p><p>West becomes a statue. \u201cShe knows about Gavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She knows he\u2019s out of work.\u201d Something in the way Ethan overpronounces the words makes me question their meaning, but West is finally calming down and I don\u2019t want to risk another eruption.</p><p>West\u2019s shoulders visibly relax. \u201cAnd the speeches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe help her. One of us should go with her to the speeches and deflect Mom if she has an attack. And Rachel will tell us if her panic attacks escalate to blood.\u201d</p><p>West picks up the bag I keep in my gym locker with extra clothes. \u201cI got this for you. You\u2019ve got ten minutes to take a shower and make it to fourth period.\u201d</p><p>Both of my brothers stare at me, and I draw my knees to my chest. I hated this feeling back in middle school, and I hate this feeling now. No matter what I do in my life, the two of them will always view me as someone to be controlled.</p><p>By the time sixth period rolls around, the school salivates with the news: recluse Rachel Young is weird again. When I enter the library for my internship, I\u2019m greeted by the sound of giggles. The words whispered between ponytail tosses are not lost on me. \u201cI told you she was strange...\u201d Chuckles and lower whispers. \u201c...completely freaked out in physics.\u201d</p><p>Unable to face anyone, I duck into one of the stacks. I suck in a breath, not for an attack, but to stop the tears. Why? Why am I like this?</p><p>At the back wall, I sink to the ground and my phone vibrates. I pull it out and see the one person who doesn\u2019t treat me as weird or as incompetent. Isaiah: Look out the window.</p><p>My forehead furrows. I grab my pack and walk to the windows overlooking the student parking lot. In the back, Isaiah leans against his black Mustang. My smile automatically appears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Me: See you.</p><p>Isaiah: Skip with me.</p><p>Skip. Besides that day with Eric, I\u2019ve never ditched before. But that day was covered with a sick note from Mom. Leaving today would be different. It would be scandalous. It would be...everything I need.</p><p>Chapter 45</p> <p>Isaiah</p><p>I EASE MY CAR TO the curb, and Rachel dashes out of school like a robber running out of a convenience store, her blond hair trailing behind her in the wind. I chuckle and reach over to open the passenger side. She falls into the car with her cheeks red from the cold. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>Weaving her hand in mine, I kiss her knuckles and place her palm over the stick shift with my hand securely covering hers. I step on the clutch and apply pressure to her hand so that she\u2019ll shift into First. \u201cYou\u2019re letting me drive your car?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cShift,\u201d I correct. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never let a girl shift my car before. Feel honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Rachel leans over and kisses my cheek. The sweet scent of jasmine and the ocean washes over me. On the open road, the rpms build, and like a perfectly synced machine, I step on the clutch right as Rachel shifts to Second.</p> <p>The excitement is hard to contain, but it\u2019s weird. I\u2019ve never been eager to share news with anyone, and I want her to be excited along with me. The engine begins to strain, and in effortless coordination, she shifts to Third while I press the clutch.</p><p>A stirring in my heart overcomes the excitement for a second. Rachel is perfect for me. She never needs words because she understands my rhythm.</p><p>\u201cI passed the ASE certification test,\u201d I say, as if I\u2019m telling her it\u2019s Thursday.</p><p>Rachel doesn\u2019t disappoint as she gasps. \u201cOh, Isaiah! That is amazing. No, fantastic. No...the best news ever. I knew you\u2019d pass. We have to do something to celebrate! What, though? I don\u2019t know. What do you want to do? Whatever it is, it has to be special.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I glance at her. \u201cI\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p><p>A grimace stains her face. \u201cWhat? Driving? You always drive.\u201d</p> <p>How can she not see it? \u201cI\u2019m spending time with you.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Except for the purring of my engine. The floorboard barely vibrates beneath me, and I wonder if she also notices the sensation. I scratch the thought. I don\u2019t have to wonder. Someone like her relishes the feel of a car\u2019s every movement\u2014just like me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d she says as simply as when I announced that I passed. My chest hurts as if she punched through a wall. Taking her hand off the stick shift, I kiss her knuckles again and keep her fingers pressed against my face until I have to place her hand back so she can shift down.</p><p>These feelings inside of me, I don\u2019t understand them, but I do understand Rachel and I know she understands me. I want her in my life in a way no one else has ever been. When I can talk without my voice breaking, I say to her, \u201cI\u2019d like you to come somewhere with me. It\u2019s not special, but I\u2019d like you there.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 46</p><p>Rachel</p><p>AFTER SCHOOL ENDED, ISAIAH DROVE me back to the lot to get my car and then I followed him to the garage to leave it there. Once again in his car he circles a small park east of Tom\u2019s garage. It\u2019s not quite far east enough to hit my area of town, but far enough away from his area that I\u2019m not terrified. Because of the cold, gray day, the park is relatively empty.</p><p>Empty except for the woman with blond hair standing next to a car several spots down from ours. From the moment we pulled in, she\u2019s stared at Isaiah and me. Also in the park is a middle-aged woman with short, dark brown hair. From the bench nearest the swings, she subtly watches us. Isaiah fell into a heavy silence the moment he placed the car into Park.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being stared at,\u201d I say quietly. Isaiah glances at me then to the two women.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mom,\u201d he says with a short gruffness. \u201cThe one next to the car is my social worker.\u201d His fingers tighten into fists as he rests the back of his head against his seat. \u201cI asked to meet with my mom, but now I\u2019m not sure I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see her when you\u2019re ready.\u201d Wrapping my fingers over his, he grasps my hand like I\u2019m a life raft. I shouldn\u2019t revel in this moment, but I do. He\u2019s searching for strength, and I\u2019m more than happy to provide it. In fact, doing so makes me feel stronger. \u201cDo you want me to go with you?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah shakes his head. \u201cNo. But thanks...for being here.\u201d In a swift movement, Isaiah leans over and kisses me. His mouth barely opens so he can tease my bottom lip. A move that causes my heart to stumble.</p><p>Before I can kiss him back, Isaiah breaks away. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 47</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>WITH HER LONG TAN COAT slapping against her knees, Courtney intercepts me before I step onto the grass. \u201cI have a million questions, Isaiah.\u201d</p><p>I shove my hands into my jeans pockets. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t care or none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery possible answer to your millions of questions.\u201d</p><p>She smirks. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t joking.</p><p>Courtney glances at my car with a smug expression. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer number three.\u201d</p><p>My social worker ignores me and continues to evaluate Rachel like she\u2019s a lab rat. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty. Does she go to your school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is and no.\u201d If I don\u2019t give her something she\u2019ll keep digging. \u201cShe goes to Worthington Private.\u201d</p><p>Courtney blinks rapidly. \u201cWow. No kidding. That\u2019s...impressive.\u201d</p><p>I jerk my chin in Melanie\u2019s direction. \u201cI got things to do.\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cI\u2019m here and she\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>Courtney waves me on, and I can feel the heat of her stare burning into my back. Not believing I had a change of heart, she questioned my motivations when I asked her to schedule this meeting. Gotta give Courtney credit...the girl knows her shit.</p><p>Huddled in a jean jacket, Melanie slides from the middle of the bench to create room for me. I perch on the edge farthest from her. Once again, she wears cowboy boots and big hoop earrings. \u201cYou listen to country music, don\u2019t you?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answers. \u201cGarth Brooks used to be your favorite.\u201d</p><p>I rub my forehead, not wanting to hear anything she has to say in regards to me.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes. \u201cDid you bring the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll give it to you when we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>In the distance, a crow caws. How long do the two of us have to sit here to satisfy Courtney\u2019s curiosity over my visitation request? Five minutes? Fifteen? In my head, thirty seconds has been long enough.</p><p>\u201cIs she your girlfriend?\u201d Melanie asks.</p><p>I narrow my eyes at the ground, confused as to why I answer, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I hate myself for wanting to tell her, but what I hate more is the realization that I brought Rachel to show her off to Mom, even at a distance. To prove to her that I didn\u2019t need her for the past eleven years and that I don\u2019t need her now.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to Rachel than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there is.\u201d</p><p>Occasional tufts of green sprout from the dried-up yellow-and-white grass. A large box of brown dirt lines the swing sets. It\u2019s early spring and all I smell is cold and earth.</p><p>\u201cWhy I went to prison...I did it for you,\u201d she says. \u201cTo protect you.\u201d</p><p>A dangerous pulse beats through my veins. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Melanie angles her body toward me and lowers her voice. \u201cYou want your money, then listen. This has to be said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The imaginary collar around my neck tightens, and I tug at my shirt. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t and the deal was that I show. Not listen.\u201d</p><p>She continues as if I never spoke. \u201cLife isn\u2019t made-for-television movies or books with happy-ever-afters. Sometimes the choices we\u2019re presented with are bad or worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I know that? For one year of my life, I had the shit beat out of me by other kids because I was the smallest. Don\u2019t you dare talk to me about choices. You had one and you blew it.\u201d</p><p>Melanie holds her hands out, pleading. I begged those boys to stop. They never did.</p><p>\u201cI had nowhere to go,\u201d she says. \u201cI had no help. It was me and you, Isaiah. We were out of money, and I thought it was the safest way. You were hungry and I lost my job and we were late on rent and they were going to throw us out. The shelter scared you. You were so small for so long. I was the only one around to defend you, so I made the decision....\u201d</p><p>Her words begin to weave past my skin, and I refuse to let her twist and demean me. I stand. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to make yourself feel better. Give me the money.\u201d</p><p>Melanie places her hands over her lips to hide their trembling. I resist the deep-rooted urge to feel sorry for her. \u201cThe fucking money, Melanie.\u201d</p><p>She stands and unexpectedly hugs me. I stiffen, holding my arms at my sides. Pressure at my back pocket tells me she\u2019s giving me the cash. \u201cTwenty-three forty-five Elmont Way. 2345, Isaiah. That\u2019s where I live. You want the money, I\u2019ll keep paying. Courtney can schedule the visitation. But if you need someone, find me. 2345 Elmont.\u201d</p><p>I step away from her and head back to Rachel, knowing I will never need Melanie.</p><p>I pull into the parking lot of Tom\u2019s garage, ease my car next to Rachel\u2019s and cut the engine. Rachel granted me silence and for that I\u2019m grateful. I would have thought spending eleven years without my mother would make me immune to her, but it doesn\u2019t. It just makes old hurts ache more.</p><p>As if sensing the blood oozing from my internal wounds, Rachel places her hand over mine. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cMy mother went to prison when I was six. She was released two years ago and for some reason, she wants back in my life.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t look at Rachel, so I stare out the driver\u2019s-side window. New gang graffiti painted in red marks the warehouse across the street. An old man wearing a knitted cap, Tom\u2019s old overalls and pink mittens pushes a shopping cart loaded down with blankets and clothes. Rachel doesn\u2019t belong here, and she shouldn\u2019t be with me.</p><p>Her hand squeezes mine. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved her.\u201d And everything inside of me burns in pain. Terrified I\u2019ll hurt Rachel, I remove my hand from hers and grip the steering wheel. My hold so tight I\u2019m convinced the leather will buckle. \u201cI defended her for years because I always thought she\u2019d come back for me.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and try to erase the unwanted memories of the group home: how the boys would taunt me over my size and my faith in my mother; the crushing blow to my face and soul when the oldest broke my nose while yelling at me that I was no different from any of them, that I was there because she was never coming back. By the time I left the home, I no longer believed in my mother or love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverything I\u2019ve known has always been twisted,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t want to twist you. I don\u2019t want you to slip into my world and leave everything that\u2019s good about you behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah, look at me.\u201d</p><p>I do. If only because there\u2019s a power in her voice I haven\u2019t heard since she told me to back off her car the first night we met. \u201cThe only way you\u2019d twist me is if you left. You\u2019re a great guy, and someday, I\u2019m going to make you see it.\u201d</p><p>Rachel has hit too close, and I lean away and flip the keys in my hand. \u201cDo you need to go home before the races tonight?\u201d</p> <p>She fiddles with the cuff of her coat, not meeting my eyes. It bothers me that I hurt her by pulling away.</p><p>\u201cNo. Dad\u2019s traveling. Mom\u2019s with the foundation, and West and Ethan have plans, but they said they\u2019d cover for me if I wanted to drive tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll celebrate tonight when we win.\u201d I force the cheer, hoping it\u2019ll bring that spark back in her eye. \u201cI\u2019ll take you someplace special.\u201d Someplace I\u2019ve never invited a girl before.</p><p>She scrunches her face. \u201cYou\u2019re always sure of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am. When I say I\u2019m going to do something I do it.\u201d My word is the only thing I truly own.</p> <p>\u201cSo...where\u2019s your special place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience,\u201d I tell her as I open the door. \u201cYou need some patience.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 48</p><p>Rachel</p><p>WE WON AGAIN TONIGHT, MORE than we lost, and because of that, Isaiah is taking me to his special place to celebrate. Logan and Isaiah didn\u2019t win as much as the weekend before, but Isaiah promised we\u2019d have enough time to make the money needed to pay off the debt.</p><p>The debt. Eric. A shudder runs along my spine and I repress any thought of my nightmares.</p> <p>It\u2019s been a long day: skipping, Isaiah meeting his mom, spending the evening at the dragway and now this. According to Isaiah\u2019s radio, it\u2019s 12:01 which means today is Saturday. I\u2019m pressing my luck being gone so late, but Ethan said he\u2019d cover for me, so he will.</p><p>I watch in the side mirror as Isaiah heaves an aging wooden barricade back over the abandoned road. The forest is thick around us, and I can only see a few feet into the black night. Goose bumps form on my arms, and I run my hands along them in order to ease the chill the shadows create.</p><p>The interior light springs on when Isaiah slips back into the car then fades just as quickly as he shuts the door.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod, but wonder if he misses it in the darkness. Fear of the unknown pushes me to a make-believe edge in my mind and I have to breathe in deeply several times to keep from falling off the ledge. Each time I inhale, Isaiah\u2019s scent fills my nose and I\u2019m reminded that whatever happens, wherever he\u2019s taking me, I\u2019m safe.</p><p>Isaiah would never let anything happen to me.</p><p>The engine growls as Isaiah presses on the gas. It\u2019s an upward path, curving continually higher. Through sporadic breaks in the trees, I can spot lights below us, and because of Isaiah\u2019s speed, they appear like fireflies dancing in the night.</p><p>It\u2019s only then when I realize where we are and what we\u2019re doing. \u201cThis is Lovers\u2019 Leap.\u201d</p> <p>Isaiah\u2019s only answer is the minuscule tilt of his lips. I sit up and my hands press against the dashboard of the car as I try to catch a glimpse of the rocky cliff that has become urban legend from the front windshield. I\u2019ve seen this place safely on the ground as I\u2019ve passed it by on the freeway. My eyes, like everyone else\u2019s, driven to the sky to ogle the place where people years ago drove off a cliff in a drag race and died.</p><p>There\u2019s just something magnetic and curious about the morbid.</p><p>But as Isaiah races around the bends of the road, I lose the sense of somber and replace it with curiosity. \u201cIs it scary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The fir trees and climbing oaks grow so close together and near the road they appear to smother each other until a clearing appears. Isaiah shifts down and eases to a stop. With a flick of his wrist, he turns off the ignition and has the keys in his hands. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s out of the car and around the front to my side before I can slide from the seat. In a slick movement, he closes my door, links our hands together and nudges me ahead. I glance over my shoulder at the thick forest behind me and shiver at what lies in wait there, but Isaiah has no interest in what we\u2019ve already seen. His eyes and body are pointed forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asks.</p><p>My breath catches in my throat when I see the splendor panning before me. Thousands of tiny lights twinkle all around the ground below and in the middle of the panoramic view the skyscrapers of Louisville soar into the air. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d But he\u2019s not looking at the view, but at me. I bite my lip and look away.</p><p>\u201cSo, am I the really the first one you\u2019ve brought here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby\u2019s been here, but I didn\u2019t bring her. She follows.\u201d Isaiah lets go of my hand and jumps onto the only thing separating the two of us from a drop of death\u2014a crumbling stone wall.</p><p>My heart smashes past my rib cage. \u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe.\u201d Isaiah holds his hand out to me. \u201cI won\u2019t let you fall.\u201d</p><p>My eyes drift to the dark hole on the other side of the wall. From the ground, the drop looked staggering, but Isaiah said he wouldn\u2019t let me fall and from the sincerity leaking from his face, he means it more than he means anything else.</p><p>As if in a tunnel, I outstretch my arm, and just as my fingers hover over his, my cell pings. Isaiah\u2019s eyebrows draw together and my blood flow halts. We both know it has to be Ethan.</p><p>Isaiah jumps down and I pull the cell out of my pocket. With one touch, the phone lights up.</p><p>Ethan: you need to come home.</p><p>My pulse quickens. Have I been busted? why?</p><p>Isaiah shifts beside me, but remains patient. He knows my twin typically leaves me alone and that a text from him can mean problems. The seconds stretch into an eternity: come home</p><p>Me: what\u2019s the problem?</p><p>Ethan: I think you\u2019re lying to me. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re driving.</p><p>The entire world sways to the right, then to the left, before refocusing. What does Ethan know? From behind me, Isaiah wraps his arms around my waist, engulfing me in the warmth and strength of his body. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Me: you\u2019re paranoid</p><p>Ethan: r u with the guy you skipped school with?</p><p>Adrenaline shoots down my arms and into my fingers as I break out of Isaiah\u2019s embrace and press buttons on the phone.</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d Isaiah\u2019s eyes become storm clouds as he watches me raise my cell to my ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I glance at the beautiful skyline. Isaiah brought me here to celebrate his and Logan\u2019s wins tonight at the dragway and to celebrate his passing of the ASE. This glorious overlook is Isaiah\u2019s special place, a place he\u2019s never brought anyone else. This moment was huge and Ethan is ruining it.</p><p>Ethan answers on the first ring. \u201cCome home, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Fire rages inside of me as the voice sinks in. It\u2019s not Ethan\u2014it\u2019s West. \u201cGive the phone to Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says West. \u201cYou two have that screwed-up twin thing, and he\u2019ll cover for you.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he will. \u201cThis is between me and Ethan. Not me and you. He covers for me. I cover for him. And in case you never noticed, both of us have been covering for you for years.\u201d</p><p>I hear shifting, a button hit wrong on the phone, then static. \u201cRachel,\u201d says Ethan. My head drops. They put me on speaker. \u201cCome home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a deal!\u201d I kick at a rock and it skips into the brush. \u201cTwin amnesty, remember? How can you sell me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had amnesty when I thought you were going for a drive.\u201d There\u2019s an unfamiliar edge to Ethan\u2019s voice. The same tone Dad used on West when West was caught fighting at school. \u201cGuess what we just heard about at a party? Something about you skipping school with some punk in a black Mustang. I told them they were crazy and then they showed me the damned picture on their cell phone. I\u2019m going to say this one more time. Get home, Rachel, and get home now.\u201d</p><p>I could crush brick with the amount of anger seething in me. \u201cBoth of you are such hypocrites!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d says Ethan. \u201cIt\u2019s like we don\u2019t even know who you are anymore. Running around with some punk, ditching school, lying to us about the panic attacks....\u201d</p><p>Something cracks inside of me. A dam I had created over the years to hold in every emotion unwanted by my family. \u201cYou want me to lie about the panic attacks, remember? Anything to keep Mom happy!\u201d</p><p>On their side, the phone rattles as if someone grabbed it. West lets loose a string of profanities. \u201cRachel!\u201d he shouts. \u201cHere\u2019s the truth, baby sister, you need someone to take care of you. You always have. It\u2019s our job to keep you from making bad decisions and the one you\u2019re making right now is colossal. Your track record proves you need Ethan and me making these decisions for you.\u201d</p><p>I end the call, throw the phone across the crumbled blacktop and shriek at the top of my lungs. West\u2019s words roll in my mind. You need someone to take care of you. You always have.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true!\u201d I yell out into the night. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Tears burn my eyes.</p><p>The warm touch first slides against my hip, followed by a brush on my cheek. My bones become weary, almost too heavy for my skin. Isaiah heard the conversation. He heard me admit my weakness. I said out loud, in front of him, that I suffer from panic attacks.</p><p>\u201cAre you in trouble at home?\u201d The urgency in his tone is clear.</p><p>I nod, then shake my head. \u201cWith my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they going to rat?\u201d</p><p>I tremble at the malice in his tone. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Somebody saw me skip with you. This is bad. So bad. Without them covering for me, I can\u2019t make it out. And if I can\u2019t make it out then you can\u2019t drive my car.\u201d</p><p>And I can\u2019t see you.</p><p>It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been sucked into a tornado and I\u2019m a rag doll being torn apart. My thoughts all twist and my body begins to feel cold and warm all at the same time. \u201cAnd if you can\u2019t drive my car then you can\u2019t race and we can\u2019t make money if you don\u2019t race and then there\u2019s Eric\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Isaiah cups my head and guides me into his chest. His lips graze my forehead as he whispers, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Calm down. It\u2019s okay. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say, and as hard as I try to keep from crying, more tears fill my eyes. I suck in air and each inhale shakes. I sniff and I sniff, but none of my efforts keeps the chaos on the inside from trying to break free to the outside. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to make my family like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if they like me. I only care about you.\u201d Isaiah soothingly rubs my spine and hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A winter wind blows, freezing my cheeks, but a single traitorous hot tear escapes from my eyes and I hold tighter to Isaiah, terrified of becoming unglued. \u201cBut they cover for me. This is how I see you! What if I can\u2019t see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it work.\u201d His words are all low-pitched, all gentle, but the twirling tornado inside of me picks up speed, becomes a monster all its own.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work.\u201d The strangled words emerge between a sob, and I hold my breath to keep any more from bursting free. I can feel my brain tearing away from my sane mind, the sadness and anger spiraling into panicked hysteria. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be without you. I like who I am with you, and I don\u2019t want to go back to who I was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Rachel. So this will work. No matter what or who stands in our way.\u201d</p> <p>My body rocks as if Isaiah used a defibrillator on my chest. He loves me.</p><p>His words gain traction in my head...he loves me. My heart patters faster and faster. Not because of anxiety but because of hope. Gathering air into my lungs, I rest my head against his shirt, which is wet with my tears. His heart has a slow, steady beat. One that never panics. One that is always strong. \u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 49</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>I BUNCH RACHEL\u2019S HAIR IN my fist. The silky strands rub the spot between my fingers and I press my lips to her head. My heart hurts and soars and hurts again, all at the same time. I said I love her. Love her. Each repeat of the words confirms something I didn\u2019t know or want to know and I scramble to figure out if I want to embrace it.</p> <p>Love her.</p><p>Rachel.</p><p>Love has always been a dirty word. My mother said she did what she did because she loved me. Beth took the words I said to her and twisted them into saying it was only friendship. She broke my heart. My mother broke my heart. If I love Rachel she\u2019ll have more power than both of them combined because this overwhelming pulse in my body...this overwhelming need to protect her and hold her close...</p><p>I nuzzle into her hair and close my eyes, inhaling the sweet scent of jasmine. I should let her go, let her go, just let her go. Walk away now. Hang on to what\u2019s left of my sanity.</p><p>But as Rachel presses tighter to me, I know I\u2019m too far gone to stand a chance alone. I\u2019m in love, fucking in love, and I pray to the God that abandoned me years ago that He doesn\u2019t use this to destroy me. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 50</p> <p>Rachel</p><p>ISAIAH TRAPS ME CLOSE TO his body and I press against his arms as I try to raise my head off his chest. He said he loved me. Me. The shy girl. The awkward girl. The one born to replace the girl everyone really wanted. The more I think about it, the harder I press back against his hold. This doesn\u2019t make sense. Any sense. Why would he want to love me?</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d I whisper and push again. When he doesn\u2019t react, I place both of my hands against his chest. \u201cIsaiah!\u201d</p><p>His arms give and I meet his eyes. \u201cI know you heard what I said.\u201d</p><p>He searches my face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe panic attacks.\u201d I grab on to his forearms. \u201cI have panic attacks. Often. You say you love me, but can you? Not when you don\u2019t see me for who I am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you for who you are?\u201d His forehead wrinkles. \u201cI see exactly who you are.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t. It\u2019s a fake. A mirage. What you think you see is a lie!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRachel...\u201d Isaiah\u2019s chest rises as he inhales. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Taking my hand, he grabs a frayed blanket out of the backseat of his car and walks over to an area where the deteriorating wall ends and the ground slopes into nothing. A few feet away from the edge, he releases me, spreads out the blanket and sits with his bent legs spread apart.</p><p>I wipe my still-moist eyes and brush my bangs away, a bit unsure what to do.</p><p>\u201cSit with me,\u201d Isaiah says. As I move to rest next to him, he stops me. \u201cNot there. Here.\u201d He motions to the spot between his legs.</p><p>Awkwardly, I settle in front of him. Isaiah, the king of secure, waves off any distance between us as he gathers me into the safe shelter of his body. The blood pulses faster in my veins. I like being this close to him. Maybe a little too much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d His breath tickles the skin behind my ear, and the small hairs stand on end with the joyous sensation. \u201cYou\u2019re smart and funny. I love how your eyes shine when you laugh.\u201d</p><p>He glides his fingers against my skin causing an addictive tingling. \u201cI love how you lace your fingers and brush your hair from your face when you\u2019re nervous. I love how you offer yourself so completely to me\u2014no fear. You\u2019re loyal and strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not strong.\u201d I cut him off. The panic attacks confirm that. Unable to be near him anymore, I attempt to untangle myself from him, but Isaiah becomes a solid wall around me and I jerk in his arms in protest.</p><p>His tender hold tightens, and the words feel like poetry because of the deep, soothing way he speaks. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I see you exactly as you are.\u201d</p><p>The anger loses its stronghold as his lips tease the sensitive curve of my ear. I swallow, thinking about the night in his room. Of how his body felt heavy over mine and how I loved feeling smaller under his touch. \u201cYou\u2019re just repeating what I said to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he says in a breath that was barely words.</p><p>I shiver with pleasure. My thoughts become fragments, and I struggle to retain composure. \u201cI told you that you don\u2019t see yourself as you really are. You\u2019re manipulating my words.\u201d Words not meant for me.</p><p>He tucks his head next to mine. The rough stubble on his jaw seductively scratches my cheek, heightening my senses. I don\u2019t want this feeling to go away: being completely immersed in Isaiah\u2019s strength, his body, his love.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m with you, even my past seems like a bad dream,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve sat on this hill a hundred times, and all I used to see were lights that represented places where I wasn\u2019t wanted, where I never belonged. Now, when you aren\u2019t with me, I look east and know that one of those lights represents you, and I don\u2019t feel alone anymore.\u201d</p><p>I stare out onto the east side of town. The sparkling lights in that area are more spread out than on the south side. \u201cWhere is your light, Isaiah?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah shifts as his hand goes into his pocket and extracts a lighter. In one smooth motion, he flicks the wheel against the flint and a single flame bursts into the darkness. The small wild flame licks against the night and fights to stay alive as the wind blows over the top of the hill. Like a moth, my hand slides over the flame\u2014craving the warmth, daring to be burned.</p><p>Maybe this is what happens when you fall in love. On the outside a lighter is nothing amazing, but it holds all the ingredients that can create something wonderful. With a few pushes in the right direction, you can inspire something so brilliant that it pushes back the darkness.</p><p>As Isaiah holds the light close enough to warm me, but far enough away to keep me safe, I wonder if this is the reason why I\u2019ve always been drawn to a flame. I\u2019ve been hoping to be burned. I\u2019ve been hoping to be loved.</p><p>I turn my head toward Isaiah. His silver eyes glow as he stares at me with the same intensity as the first night in his apartment. That night, his gaze frightened me. Tonight, I know that it means love.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first person to ever see me,\u201d whispers Isaiah as he releases the lighter. He flips the top back on and in a swift motion he presses the still-warm metal into my hand. \u201cI want you to keep it.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops open. He\u2019s protective of that lighter. I\u2019ve seen how he holds it, how he looks at it, and now understanding what it means, it would be like me giving him my car. \u201cIsaiah...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know I\u2019m with you. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to give, so please, take it.\u201d</p><p>I touch the double row of silver hoop earrings hanging from his left ear, trail along his jawline, his neck, down his shoulder, to the flaming tail of the dragon on his arm. He leans into the caress, and my own body feels on fire with the continued way his eyes gaze upon me. The first moment I saw him, the night people clamored over each other to step out of his way, I was frightened. The guy with earrings and tattoos and an energy radiating danger. Now\u2014inside and out\u2014all I see is beauty.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah...I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 51</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>A NORTHERN GUST HEAVY WITH moisture sweeps across the hill, and Rachel shivers. Cold water droplets hit my bare skin. There\u2019s a chance we could lose our mild winter tonight to snow.</p><p>I stand, snatch the blanket off the ground and love how Rachel automatically accepts my offered hand as I guide her to my car. She hesitates as I open the passenger-side door. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home yet.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s innocence in her eyes, an innocence I lost years ago, so I know there\u2019s no underlying meaning in her statement. I move the seat and Rachel slides into the back. Freezing rain pelts like bullets as I follow. I shut the door and rain patters against the car.</p><p>\u201cDid you get wet?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>Rachel shakes her head as she grabs for the blanket. I lean into the front, turn the engine over, crank the heat and click on the parking lights to illuminate the console. I slip back beside Rachel and wonder how the two of us ended up like this. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a girl in the backseat of my car.\u201d</p><p>The wrinkles in her forehead scream disbelief. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Isaiah. I know I\u2019m not your first kiss or...you know.\u201d</p><p>No, she\u2019s not. \u201cSounds awful, but I respected my car too much to bring girls...\u201d I\u2019m right. It does sound awful.</p><p>Rachel grows quiet. The rain drives harder against the windshield and even with the heater running, the temperature plummets. \u201cHonestly, do you not want me in your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel, you\u2019re the only girl I\u2019ve wanted in this car.\u201d</p><p>Her body trembles as if she\u2019s having a seizure. \u201cAr-re y-you s-sure?\u201d</p><p>I wedge my hands beneath her legs and lift her onto my lap. Rachel relaxes her head into the crook of my neck as I bundle us in the blanket. \u201cNever been more sure of anything.\u201d</p><p>Resting my cheek against her, I inhale her sweet scent. \u201cYou remind me of the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my perfume.\u201d I hear the smile in her voice. Her hand peeks out of the blanket and I knot my fingers with hers.</p><p>\u201cMy mom took me to the ocean once,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI think her parents lived in Florida, and she went there for help.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t remember much other than the visit was short, there was a lot of yelling, and the wallpaper in the entryway curled near the floorboards. \u201cWe left and spent the day at the ocean before we drove back to Kentucky.\u201d</p><p>Rachel squeezes my fingers. I like that she doesn\u2019t feel the need to make me better with words when I tell her something from my past. She understands that all I need is the strength in her touch. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered if Mom\u2019s parents didn\u2019t welcome her because of me. They refused to take me in when my mom went to prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your mom go to jail for?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah and Beth were the only people I\u2019d told about where my mom was, and I never discussed the why. \u201cArmed robbery.\u201d Plus child endangerment.</p><p>Her thumb moves against my wrist as a silent acknowledgment of how much it cost me to tell her the truth and that she\u2019s done asking questions. I kiss her forehead, a thank-you for not pushing me to places I can\u2019t visit.</p><p>Rachel shifts forward on my lap, unbuttons her coat and slides it off. \u201cLittle warm.\u201d</p><p>I take the lighter she still grasps in her hand and place it in the cup holder. When I go to move the blanket she stops me by cuddling back into my body. \u201cI chose the blanket over my coat.\u201d</p> <p>Tonight has been a constant give-and-take between us, and I\u2019d like her to give a little more. \u201cDo you see a therapist about your panic attacks?\u201d</p><p>When I\u2019m greeted with the sound of the rain tapping the top of the car, I switch tactics. \u201cNoah\u2019s girlfriend, Echo\u2014she\u2019s had some issues and she sees someone. It helps her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to. In middle school and a little in my freshman year, but then I stopped.\u201d Rachel\u2019s pause highlights her struggle for words. \u201cMy mom worried. Constantly. It wasn\u2019t normal. She wouldn\u2019t let me out of her sight. My older brothers said that she was just as manic as when Colleen had cancer. And then I had several panic attacks in high school.\u201d</p><p>Her breath catches as if the memory causes her physical pain.</p><p>\u201cI had a couple of harsh attacks in a short period of time and ended up in the hospital. I...I...\u201d It\u2019s as if the words are programmed not to leave her body. \u201cI hated it. I hated how Mom hovered. I hated how my oldest two brothers would compare me to Colleen. I hated how West and Ethan would look at me as if I was dying.</p> <p>\u201cSo...when I got out of the hospital...I found a way to hide the attacks...the anxiety...and eventually my family believed I defeated the panic and for the first time in my life they didn\u2019t see me as weak.\u201d</p><p>Weak. I hate the word, especially from her. \u201cIf you still suffer from this, you should get help. Screw your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way for me to get help without them knowing. Isaiah, I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you, you see me, remember? You\u2019re going to have to trust me on this. If you have these attacks then we\u2019ll fix them. I only care about you. Not your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtective,\u201d I counter, and run my hand along the length of her leg.</p> <p>Rachel lets out a contented sigh. \u201cI wish we could be like this forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be.\u201d I break a cardinal rule and dream of the future. Rachel is a future kind of girl, and I\u2019m going to have to work hard to give her a world worth living in. \u201cWith this certification and internship, I\u2019ll have the best jobs. I can\u2019t give you the world, Rachel, but I\u2019ll give you all I got.\u201d</p><p>Her soft lips kiss my jaw and my body temperature spikes. Holding on to Rachel is like holding on to a flame. It\u2019s a soothing burn and an addictive burn. Her kiss is pure fire.</p><p>\u201cBeing with you is enough.\u201d She adjusts so that she can look at me, and I love how the spark has returned to her eyes. \u201cWe could open our own shop.\u201d</p><p>I curl her silky hair around my finger and tug lightly. \u201cYou and me alone in the garage with you bent over the hood of a powerful engine. I think I can handle that.\u201d</p><p>She blushes at my words, but keeps the banter alive. \u201cWe\u2019ll only take fast cars or clients who want faster cars. The faster the better.\u201d</p><p>I like how she thinks. \u201cIf you\u2019re touching cars in our shop, then you\u2019ll have to get your certification.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tutor me?\u201d</p> <p>I shouldn\u2019t, but I can\u2019t resist. Cradling her face in my hands, I brush my lips against hers. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you everything you need to know.\u201d</p><p>She rests her forehead on mine. My hand stays against her cheek, and my thumb glides over her soft skin. Rachel\u2019s chest moves faster, almost matching my pace. Energy rushes into my veins and the heat between us teeters on the edge of flames.</p><p>\u201cMy brothers are going to try to keep us apart,\u201d she whispers, then presses her mouth against my bottom lip. My grip on her waist tightens in response. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know, but the way she curls in my arms makes me feel like I\u2019m the hero. I like being her hero. I like the way her eyes shine at me, the way her body melts when I touch her, her soft lips on mine. I love her warmth and every curve.</p><p>I love her.</p><p>My fingers draw up her back and tangle into her hair. \u201cThey\u2019ll never separate us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she repeats.</p><p>Our lips crush together, our bodies pressed tight. An inferno of lips and hands and movements that continues to grow in heat. The blanket falls away as Rachel slides her legs so that she straddles me. On the verge of burning up completely, I groan and cling to her small frame. Her hands drift under my shirt, leaving a singeing trail.</p><p>We\u2019ve become a wildfire. Almost unstoppable. I kiss her neck and the beautiful sounds escaping her mouth encourage me further. My hands skim under her shirt, up her back, linger for seconds near her bra, and I gently nip her ear when I feel lace.</p><p>Images pour into my mind of what she\u2019d look like with her shirt off, then her jeans. My fist traps strands of her hair. \u201cI want you, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>And because I do, I kiss her fully on the mouth\u2014nothing left to the imagination. Every fantasy becomes a reality with that one embrace. Then, summoning more willpower than I possess, I end the kiss, cupping her head to my chest.</p><p>We both breathe hard. Blood pulses in my temples, throughout my entire body. Need screams for me to bring her back into my arms. But I love Rachel, and the physical between us has to go slow.</p><p>\u201cCan we stay here?\u201d Rachel asks. \u201cFor a little longer?\u201d</p><p>We can stay here for life. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 52</p><p>Rachel</p><p>MY BROTHERS FOLLOW ME TO class. Every class. I ditch one brother when class starts and pick up another when class ends. I tried losing them at lunch by seeking refuge in the library, but one or both still trailed behind me. I\u2019m furious with my unwanted bodyguards.</p><p>The bell rings. The collective sigh of it\u2019s-Friday relief from the English class visiting the library is tangible. Books snap shut and zippers on backpacks close into place. I shelve the remaining books, grab my stuff and head into the hallway. My skin feels as if it\u2019s going to peel off my bones. I haven\u2019t seen Isaiah since Saturday and I miss him\u2014desperately.</p><p>Against the wall of lockers, Ethan waits with his hands stuffed in the pockets of his dress khakis. \u201cYou\u2019ve never gone this long without talking to me.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in a week, Ethan and I look at each other without glaring. I attempt to ignore the hurt swimming in his dark eyes, but I can\u2019t. Ethan is my twin\u2014my best friend. \u201cYou started this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you aren\u2019t seeing the punk and it\u2019ll end.\u201d</p><p>My grip tightens on my pack. \u201cHe is not a punk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWest and I are trying to protect you. That\u2019s all.\u201d Ethan reaches out as if he\u2019s going to take my hand, a reaction to his hurt and mine. A comforting touch we\u2019ve shared since toddlerhood. \u201cWe saw the picture. Tattoos. Earrings. The guy looks like a damn serial killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s arm falls to his side. My hand twitches, not used to feeling empty.</p><p>I step toward him, pleading. \u201cI know he looks tough, but he\u2019s an amazing guy on the inside. If you and West would try to get to know him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen bring him home to meet Mom and Dad. To meet us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I shift from my left to right foot. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Because if Mom and Dad discover I\u2019m dating Isaiah they\u2019ll become grime caked on an axle, and I\u2019ll never be allowed out of the house. Isaiah and I agreed that we need to pay off Eric before we drop the dating bomb on my parents.</p><p>Ethan and West want me to dump Isaiah, and they\u2019d prefer for me to do it without anyone, meaning my parents and our older brothers, finding out that he existed. I\u2019m gambling that their need to protect Mom and Dad, coupled with the fact that Gavin and Jack will kick their asses for letting me get close to a guy, will keep them from ratting me out. So far, I\u2019ve been right. This weekend, I may have to be home by ten, since Ethan won\u2019t cover for me anymore, but at least I can make it to the races.</p><p>Ethan pushes off the lockers. \u201cYou won\u2019t introduce him to Mom and Dad because he\u2019s bad news and you know it.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and walk alongside Ethan. My heart aches. I miss my best friend. I miss not being able to tell him everything in my life. He can blame Isaiah for our strained relationship, but that\u2019s not the case. Our relationship started to deteriorate years ago when I began to lie about the attacks.</p><p>My head tilts when the words he said to West in the locker room last week haunt me. \u201cYou told West that you knew that I\u2019d been lying about my panic attacks.\u201d</p><p>Ethan dips his head, as if he\u2019s counting the floor tiles. \u201cI know you better than anyone else. At least I thought I did. I know when you\u2019re in pain. I know when you hurt.\u201d</p><p>Neither one of us say anything as we pass a group of seniors cutting up. Both of us scan the crowd for West. In the middle, dark blue eyes that mirror mine peer at me. West\u2019s smile falters, but he\u2019s quick to hide the concern. My chest hurts. Both of them love me.</p><p>\u201cIf the two of you suspected, then why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cBecause we\u2019re selfish assholes who wanted Mom for a few seconds. She was always so obsessed with you and your attacks that we got nothing. When you claimed to be better, she was still up your butt, but at least we got something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never asked for this,\u201d I say as we go down the stairs. \u201cAny of it. For the panic attacks. To be Colleen\u2019s replacement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd to be honest, that\u2019s why West and I pity you instead of hate you.\u201d</p><p>How on earth has my family become so dysfunctional? We walk outside, and Ethan places a hand on my shoulder to stop me. My stomach cramps as if I\u2019ve been sucker punched when he immediately removes his arm. We\u2019re so distant we can\u2019t even touch.</p><p>\u201cTalk to us\u2014me and West. Tell us the whole truth about the attacks. We\u2019ll find a way to make everything work between you and Mom and the speeches. And dump the punk. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to see him anyway. I won\u2019t cover you anymore, and if I don\u2019t cover you, Mom will start asking questions about where you\u2019re going. There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll be able to think of a good enough excuse as to why you suddenly have a life.\u201d</p><p>Ethan is right, and I start to wonder how I\u2019ll make it to the dragway without his help. If I tell Ethan the truth about Eric, he\u2019ll go ballistic and he\u2019ll possibly snitch on me to my parents. Movement near where I parked my car causes me to shift so I can look past my brother.</p><p>Holy hell. I brush past Ethan and try to think of something coherent to say other than, \u201cWhat are you doing here, Abby?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In a white button-down shirt remarkably like mine, and a blue-and-green plaid uniform skirt, Abby leans against my car. \u201cDo you like it? Isaiah and I skipped this afternoon and went to Goodwill. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s ironic that Goodwill has clothes for a private school? If you have money to go to a private school, you probably wouldn\u2019t shop at Goodwill.\u201d</p><p>My mouth pops open with a million questions, but before I can ask any of them, Ethan appears by my side. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan,\u201d I answer. \u201cHe\u2019s my twin.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes dart between us. \u201cYou don\u2019t look anything alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a boy. She\u2019s a girl. I sure as hell hope we don\u2019t,\u201d says Ethan.</p><p>Abby flashes a daring smile. \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><p>Ethan ignores her statement. \u201cHow do you know Rachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends,\u201d she answers. \u201cI go to that other rich school.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes widen as I understand. Blue-and-green uniform. Abby\u2019s faking that she belongs in my world by pretending she goes to a school that is acceptable to my family. \u201cMason Academy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says. \u201cThat one. I\u2019m new to town and met Rachel at the mall.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat as Ethan automatically doesn\u2019t buy anything that involves me and malls.</p><p>\u201cParking lot,\u201d adds Abby. \u201cMall parking lot. I had a flat. She helped. It was all serendipitous. I like bunnies. She likes bunnies. We totally clicked.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s eyebrows furrow together as he assesses me. \u201cYou like bunnies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother dropped me off,\u201d Abby continues, \u201cbecause our school gets out before your school and you promised we could do girl stuff at your house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbby,\u201d I interrupt before she says anything else. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at home, Rach.\u201d Ethan continues to eye Abby.</p><p>With Ethan safely in his car behind us and Abby in the passenger side, I let the questions flow. \u201cWhat are you doing? How did you get here? What is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you snort crack? Don\u2019t answer. Isaiah said you lost your way out of the house past curfew. We bought these clothes, he dropped me off here, and ta-da...I\u2019m your new best friend\u2014private school\u2013going, new in town, rich Abby.\u201d</p><p>I glance in my rearview mirror. Ethan is hot on my tail. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. How is this supposed to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntroduce me to your parents tonight and then I\u2019ll invite you for a sleepover tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>My entire body feels lighter. Isaiah thinks of everything. \u201cSerendipitous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d She waggles her eyebrows. \u201cI learned it for today.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 53</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>LOGAN HOVERS OVER THE ENGINE as I slide myself underneath. I\u2019m changing the oil in my car, again. The engine\u2019s been acting funny, and my gut tells me she\u2019s close to overheating. The continued drag racing is aging my baby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not feeling the cash flow tonight,\u201d says Logan.</p><p>\u201cMe, either.\u201d The types of people we race do it for shits and giggles. Side bets are for those who feel cocky. Logan and I have kicked ass for two weekends straight. Tonight, we\u2019ll have plenty of people who will race against us for bragging rights, but few will put up money.</p><p>\u201cExplain bracket racing,\u201d he says.</p><p>My hands hesitate as I work. Bracket racing. The thought has circled in my head. \u201cThey do it on Sundays. If you think you can hit an eighth mile in 10 seconds then you race against other cars that can do the same. Same rules apply at the line. You can\u2019t go before the green, but they will give you a handicap. If the competition is a second faster than you, then you\u2019ll get to leave a second faster. Whoever crosses the line first without breaking the green wins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fair enough,\u201d says Logan.</p><p>I roll out from underneath my car. \u201cBut if you say you can hit an eighth in 10 seconds and you take the finish line at 9.9 seconds, then you lose. You have to stay above 10 seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pick your target, man. It\u2019s like a game show. You pick the number you think you can take the finish line in without going over. If you go over that number, you lose.\u201d</p><p>Logan scratches the back of his head. \u201cThat means we have to have an insane reaction time at the line and watch that we don\u2019t go too fast, but fast enough to beat whoever we\u2019re against all in a matter of seconds.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd the world got complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the draw?\u201d says Logan.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a pot for the first three finishers. The pot for a street car like mine isn\u2019t worth the investment, but if we add a nitro system, then we could compete in a class where the money may be worth it.\u201d</p><p>Logan gets that crazy glint in his eye anytime we discuss something that involves the cars going faster. \u201cThen we should add a nitro system. I can\u2019t think of anything holding you back.\u201d</p><p>Both of us turn our heads to the sweet sound of Rachel\u2019s Mustang pulling in. Sitting on the rolling board, I rest my arms on my bent knees and watch as my angel glides into the garage.</p><p>Logan glances at her then me. \u201cThink I discovered your issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Nitro can be dangerous, and I don\u2019t want the system in her car.</p><p>In the used designer jeans and soft blue sweater we bought at the Goodwill, Abby looks like a completely different person.</p><p>\u201cHer brothers are hot. Annoying, but hot,\u201d announces Abby. \u201cJust saying.\u201d</p><p>I stand, and Rachel weaves her arms around my neck. I kiss her lips. \u201cHey, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Red touches her cheeks. Either because she hasn\u2019t seen me in a week or because she\u2019s staying the night with me.</p><p>\u201cYou look nice,\u201d says Logan. Rachel and I turn to see Logan checking Abby out.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention her brothers aren\u2019t nearly as hot as you?\u201d Abby flashes a sexy grin. She doesn\u2019t release that smile often and flags shoot straight into the air.</p><p>I roll my eyes. Logan and Abby hooking up is not a good idea. She destroys guys and...I like Logan. \u201cLogan, I forgot my seed money. Wanna come back with me to pick it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I kiss Rachel\u2019s lips again. \u201cBe back in a sec.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 54</p><p>Rachel</p><p>FIDDLING WITH A WRENCH, I listen to Abby gush about my family. How insanely nice my parents are and how crazy it is that all of my brothers are good-looking. I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m blessed. I have so much more than others, and on the outside my family is absolutely perfect.</p><p>\u201cHello, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps up and Abby falls silent. My heart drums, and a cold sweat breaks out over my body, onto my palms. I swipe my hands against my jeans the moment I see the face that haunts my nightmares. \u201cEric.\u201d</p><p>He strides into the garage as if he owns the place. His green army jacket engulfs his bony body. \u201cMaking new friends, Abby?\u201d</p><p>Abby straightens beside me, and gone is the girl that I\u2019ve come to know over the past couple of weeks. All emotion drains from her face and leaves a hardness that frightens me. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your block, Eric. It belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it belongs to the person you pay off to keep you and your family safe.\u201d Eric makes a show of glancing over both of his shoulders before leaning into Abby. His nose nearly touches hers. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t see him here.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t flinch. A creepy smile eases onto her face as she tosses her hair so she can stare him straight in the eye. \u201cOne phone call, Eric, and it\u2019ll be raining fire and brimstone.\u201d</p><p>If I didn\u2019t know better, I would have thought fear flashed in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d let Isaiah be caught in the crosshairs? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Eric switches his sights to me. \u201cHow\u2019s it going with my money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I rub my arms. The skin crawls as he invades my personal space. He\u2019s so close that I smell his breath.</p><p>\u201cWord on the street is that you might make deadline,\u201d he breathes out as his eyes linger near my chest.</p><p>I cross my arms, trying to hide what he\u2019s focusing on. Adrenaline begins to leak into my bloodstream, and I silently pray for Isaiah to stride back into the door. Isaiah can fix this. He knows how to make me feel safe.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him get to you,\u201d Abby says. \u201cHe\u2019s like those damn annoying dogs always starved for attention and begging for scraps at the table. It\u2019s best to pretend he doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth,\u201d he mutters.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pathetic and transparent. Isaiah won\u2019t fall for your intimidation shit, which is why I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Eric tears his eyes away from Abby and this time stares at my lips. \u201cHow close are you really to paying me off? We could make a deal. You do something for me and I\u2019ll provide a discount for you.\u201d</p><p>Abby appears at my side. \u201cStep back, Eric.\u201d</p><p>He smirks. \u201cOr what, Abby? You gonna jack up the prices on the drugs you sell? I\u2019m aware of the service charge reserved only for me. You need to start rethinking your business practices.\u201d</p><p>My head jerks and Abby falters. Our eyes meet and her calm, cold facade cracks.</p><p>Eric laughs. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know that you\u2019re a drug dealer, did she?\u201d</p><p>When Abby says nothing, Eric inches closer. I inch to the side, but Eric follows. Without thinking, I trapped myself against a wall. I don\u2019t like how Eric looks at me. The panic begins to claw at my chest and I swallow. I need to stay in control.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Isaiah is an addict? Uses like the rest of us street rats.\u201d His eyes wander up, then down. \u201cWhat kind of currency are you paying Isaiah to take on this debt? Not cash, I\u2019m guessing.\u201d</p><p>Eric raises his hand and all the air squeezes out of my lungs. I gasp right as he moves to touch my skin. He can\u2019t touch me. I won\u2019t let him. My hands thrust out and I push at his chest.</p><p>Anger explodes in his dark, soulless eyes. He grabs my wrist, slamming it over my head into the concrete wall. I scream.</p><p>Abby screams.</p><p>And with my free hand I\u2019m hitting and kicking and so is Abby and suddenly...</p><p>He\u2019s gone.</p><p>The world spins, and I can\u2019t find my bearings. There\u2019s more yelling and more voices. Gravity overtakes me as I can\u2019t inhale. Abby appears in front of me\u2014dark eyes and hair. \u201cRachel!\u201d</p><p>Abby is free of Eric. We both are. I grab her, still struggling for air, and drag both of us as I stumble into the office. I need to make sure we\u2019re safe\u2014me and Abby. She\u2019s my friend and I can\u2019t leave her behind.</p><p>She says things, things I don\u2019t understand, and she strokes my hair while she talks. I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t.</p><p>She disappears and in her place are gray storm clouds. \u201cBreathe, angel. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah. I wrap my arms around him, and he holds me\u2014tightly. I listen to his heart: the steady beat, the steady pace, and within a few seconds I start to match his breathing. I inhale deeply one more time. \u201cIsaiah.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cups my face and forces me to meet his eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cEric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs gone,\u201d says Logan from the doorway of the office.</p><p>Isaiah helps me walk back into the garage. Logan\u2019s right. It\u2019s only the four of us. With her shoulders hunched, Abby stands beside Logan. She lifts her head only to share a wary glance with him, then Isaiah, but not me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask. Because I can feel it. A heaviness that wasn\u2019t here before.</p><p>Isaiah swears under his breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I hate the prickling in my stomach, a sensation foretelling doom. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit him. Eric. I came in and saw the two of you fighting him off, and I hit him. Hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I mean it. If I could have socked him in the jaw and caused the bastard to bleed then I would have, but I\u2019m not that strong.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hit Eric.\u201d Abby nudges her foot at the concrete. \u201cNot without repercussions.\u201d</p><p>My stomach cramps. \u201cIs he going to hurt you?\u201d No, please no. My hands flutter near Isaiah\u2019s face, terrified of Eric hurting him. \u201cI\u2019ll apologize. I\u2019ll...I\u2019ll...\u201d I have no idea what to do.</p><p>Isaiah takes my hands. \u201cHe moved up the due date. We have to pay him in one week.\u201d</p><p>My head becomes light and I sway. Isaiah places his hands on my waist to steady me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unexpected,\u201d he says. \u201cBut not impossible. We\u2019re close to the total. Let\u2019s race tonight, count our winnings and see where we stand.\u201d</p><p>Okay. He\u2019s right. Plus Isaiah would never lie. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbby!\u201d Logan calls out. \u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d</p><p>With her hands in her pockets, Abby walks away from the garage. Isaiah holds on when I move to go after her. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI need to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah releases me, but keeps his arm near my elbow in case I drop. \u201cAbby!\u201d</p><p>She continues to walk away and I quicken my pace. \u201cAbby!\u201d</p><p>Abby stops on the sidewalk and doesn\u2019t turn around. I slow as I approach and think of Eric\u2019s words and Abby\u2019s description of her job. She\u2019s a drug dealer.</p><p>A drug dealer. My first real girlfriend is a drug dealer. My entire world feels upside down and sideways; yanked inside out then pulled back out again. With new eyes, I look at Abby. She\u2019s exactly the same as before: black hoodie, braver-than-I-could-ever-be jeans and long brown hair. She\u2019s a beautiful girl\u2014a mystery to me, and bold, but what I\u2019ve never seen is how seventeen she appears. How...young, like me.</p><p>She\u2019s what I should hate in the world, yet she\u2019s come to be someone I love.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say.</p> <p>She flips her hair over her shoulder. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor helping me with Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He is.\u201d I hesitate. Eric called Isaiah an addict. He called her a drug dealer. Drug dealers are bad and Abby isn\u2019t. She\u2019s good. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, not even pretending she doesn\u2019t know what I mean. \u201cI inherited a mess, and someday, I\u2019m not going to do this anymore. But right now, there are problems with my family and I\u2019m the only one who can fix them.\u201d</p><p>I understand inheriting a mess. My birthright is to make up for Colleen\u2019s death and as for family problems, I understand those, too. \u201cCan you come with us tonight? It gets lonely sitting in the stands by myself.\u201d</p><p>Abby stares at me blankly, as if she never heard me speak. \u201cI don\u2019t use the drugs. I swear to God I\u2019m clean. And I never bring them around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because she stands by me. Because I think she loves me like I love her. \u201cBecause we\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>Abby smiles. \u201cI knew there was a reason I chose you to be my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Is it strange that that just made me incredibly happy? \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Abby and I both take interest in anything else but each other. I think this whole friend thing is completely new to both of us. From the open bay of the garage, Isaiah watches us with his hands shoved in his pockets. Logan stands right behind him. They\u2019re a strange combo, but so are Abby and I.</p><p>There\u2019s so much I thought I understood, but that\u2019s not the truth. I avoid issues more than I try to understand. \u201cAbby?\u201d Deep breath. \u201cDoes Isaiah use drugs?\u201d</p><p>She tucks her hair behind her ear again. \u201cI think you should talk to him.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s as if my soul became too heavy for my heart. That\u2019s a conversation I don\u2019t want to have.</p><p>Chapter 55</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>RACHEL\u2019S LIGHT FOOTFALLS CAUSE THE wooden stairs to groan. \u201cSeven hundred dollars. If you asked me two weeks ago if we could make seven hundred dollars in one week, I would have said yes, but after tonight...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>As predicted, we found plenty of guys willing to race us, but not as many who were willing to place bets. I carry her overnight bag in one hand and hold her fingers with the other. \u201cLogan and I knew that this could be a problem. But I think we can make seven hundred in the next week. It\u2019ll be tight, but it will happen.\u201d</p><p>She continues to stare at the floor as we walk to my apartment. \u201cI could hock more of my jewelry, but Mom figured out I got rid of one of the pieces. I told her I lost it. I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019ll continue to buy the excuse if I \u2018lose\u2019 any more.\u201d</p><p>I let go of her hand, unlock the door and push it open. She enters first, flipping on the light as she goes. I love how she feels comfortable here.</p><p>\u201cIt feels hopeless,\u201d she says. \u201cLike we get two steps forward and take a trillion back.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile. Rachel does this sometimes\u2014wallows, but I don\u2019t mind. It never lasts long, and she\u2019s usually repentant when she\u2019s done.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d I ask as I close the door and lock the dead bolt.</p><p>Rachel blinks and the crimson on her cheeks tells me she snapped out of wallowing. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know that when I say I\u2019m going to fix something, I do. On my life, Rachel, Eric will be paid back in a week.\u201d</p><p>She fidgets with the ends of her hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that everything seems so big all the time and...\u201d</p><p>And here comes the repentance. I wrap my arms around her waist. \u201cI want you to forget about it. At least for tonight.\u201d</p><p>She bites her bottom lip and glances up from below heavy eyelashes. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Nerves are written all over her face. I kiss the top of her head and give her the room she needs by going into the kitchen and cocking a hip against the counter. Rachel\u2019s never stayed the night with a girlfriend, much less a boyfriend.</p><p>She leans against the back of the couch. \u201cIf I ask you something, will you be honest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Abby is a drug dealer?\u201d</p><p>Damn, straight to the point. I pull at my bottom earring. Abby warned me at the dragway about this conversation. I had no idea Rachel would yank out the guns this early. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d She inspects her nails like this is casual for her, but I know better.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s Abby\u2019s story to tell, not mine. She promised to keep her business away from you, and when Abby gives her word, she means it. If I thought you\u2019d be in danger, I\u2019d be in the middle of this.\u201d</p><p>She scoffs like I told a joke. \u201cYou can\u2019t get in the middle of anything.\u201d</p><p>I say nothing because I don\u2019t argue. Rachel\u2019s safety and happiness is my priority. \u201cWhat you did for Abby tonight was nice.\u201d Nice is an understatement. For the first time since I\u2019ve known Abby, someone gave her love.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>Rachel laces her hands together, unlaces and repeats. Something\u2019s digging at her and I want her inner thoughts. \u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>She lets her hands fall to her sides. \u201cZach offered to race against me. Since we need money, I should accept.\u201d</p><p>The guy is becoming a switchblade in my thigh. \u201cDid he say something to you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he first brought it up weeks ago...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And I told him to stay clear of her. It\u2019s too coincidental, Eric showing at the garage this evening then Zach approaching her at the dragway tonight, and I don\u2019t believe in chance. Zach\u2019s trying to pull Rachel into a race, but I can\u2019t see the benefit of it. I can\u2019t see how that would help Eric win.</p><p>\u201cI want to help.\u201d There\u2019s hurt in her eyes, and it dawns on me that there\u2019s more to her and Zach\u2019s conversations than cars.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he saying to you?\u201d</p><p>Rachel pauses as she chooses her words. She doesn\u2019t do that often and my gut twists. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d she asks.</p><p>A combination of dread and anger pummels my insides as the answer slams into my head. Zach is trying to create doubt. They\u2019re trying to place a wedge between us.</p><p>\u201cI trust you.\u201d And she needs to trust me back. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the money, Rachel. All right?\u201d I\u2019m not asking permission, but I am asking her to drop it. \u201cAnd stay away from Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I know he can come on a little strong, but he really doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><p>My neck tightens as I contemplate telling Rachel my theory on Zach and Eric. But then I wonder if that would scare her. She already mentioned a few minutes ago how she feels overwhelmed by it all. \u201cCan you just trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She glances around the empty apartment, reminiscent of her first night here. \u201cDo you mind if I take a shower? I smell like burnt rubber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d If she does, then I must reek like I bathed in it. \u201cI\u2019ll take one after.\u201d</p><p>The subflooring is cold beneath my feet, and after the heat from the misty bathroom my body shudders against the temperature of the apartment. I change to a fresh pair of jeans and walk into the dark bedroom for a shirt.</p><p>In a tank top and pair of cotton drawstring pants, Rachel sits in the middle of my bed with her knees drawn to her chest. Her hair is blown dry and angles around her face. Light from the street highlights her perfectly, casting a heavenly glow.</p><p>I\u2019m reaching into the laundry basket next to the bed for a T-shirt when delicate fingers touch my wrist. \u201cCan I look at your tattoos?\u201d</p><p>My mouth dries out when I meet her eyes. There\u2019s no seduction there, but honest curiosity. My heart beats faster when I nod and join her on the bed. Rachel traces the dragon. Playing with fire again, her tickling caress strikes a match and creates a slow burn.</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d she asks. \u201cThe tattoos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome areas more than others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d</p><p>As her fingernails slide down my arm to the knot tattooed on my forearm, shivers run through my blood. \u201cLike someone with sharp nails scratching a sunburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s a simple question, but a complex answer. \u201cSo I\u2019ll always remember.\u201d</p><p>Rachel traces the twists and turns of the Brothers of Arrow Knot, granting me silence. It\u2019s my decision whether or not to continue the conversation. My angel does this\u2014she opens the door and allows me the freedom to decide whether or not I want to step through. It\u2019s strange, my entire life I\u2019ve had doors closed on me and now that one\u2019s open, I\u2019m not sure how to enter.</p><p>I suck in air, guessing one way is headfirst. \u201cThat one\u2019s for Noah.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s eyes flash to mine, and I take comfort in the happiness I created there.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Celtic knot\u2014it means warriors bonded as brothers through battle.\u201d</p><p>The right side of her mouth tips. \u201cDoes that mean you and Noah have been on the same side of several fistfights?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle, remembering a few we probably shouldn\u2019t have taken on. \u201cYeah. But it\u2019s more than that. Noah accepts people as they are. Doesn\u2019t ask. Doesn\u2019t judge. He\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>Though lately he\u2019s been inching away by following his dreams. Someday, he\u2019ll graduate from college, get a real job and marry Echo. Then they\u2019ll be a family without me.</p><p>Rachel moves to kneel in front of me. Everything about her is softness and curves. Too innocent. Too beautiful. She admires her favorite tattoo\u2014the tiger.</p> <p>I sweep the bangs from her eyes. \u201cI used to be weak when I was younger. The smallest kid in the class and the group home. I kept waiting for someone to save me.\u201d Like how that old tiger must have waited for someone to release him from his cage. \u201cOne day I decided to save myself, and I stopped being weak.\u201d</p><p>She touches the tiger. \u201cSo you got the tattoo.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. Such honesty makes me uncomfortable. \u201cEarrings first. Then I started hanging out with the type of people most avoided. Got in fights just to prove I\u2019d never run. Then, when I scraped up enough money, I got the tattoo.\u201d</p><p>Rachel withdraws her hand and prepares for the other question Abby warned would be coming. \u201cDo you do drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d I won\u2019t lie. Not to her. \u201cI do drink. But I don\u2019t like the feeling of being high or being drunk. Losing control isn\u2019t my style. I make people believe I do drugs. It\u2019s better if people are scared of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>I jerk my chin toward the window. \u201cLife is different out there. I\u2019ve survived because of what I make people think. No one messes with me, and that same reputation has kept you safe because no one would mess with anything that\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>She wipes at her forehead, but her bangs were already swept to the side. \u201cEric messed with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he knows we\u2019re close to paying him off. He wanted to push my buttons and I fell for it. He wants us to fail. Eric wants more than money. He wants power, and it would be a strong message to a lot of people if he held power over me.\u201d</p><p>Rachel picks at the lint on the blanket with her eyes cast down. My iron wall, the one she expertly maneuvered around, becomes cold underneath my skin. I\u2019ve bared my soul and she has to be second-guessing being with me.</p><p>\u201cThis is who I am, Rachel. Accept it or not. The tattoos won\u2019t wash off. The earrings will never change. I am who I am and nothing more. I\u2019m loyal to a chosen few, I always keep my word and I\u2019ll protect you with my life.</p><p>\u201cI scare the hell out of most people, but you will never have anything to fear from me. Choose. Love me or don\u2019t. But tell me now.\u201d Because I can\u2019t leave my heart open for her to rip out later. If I belong to her, then I do, and nothing will stand in our way.</p><p>She sits up on her knees and inches closer to me. Giving me my answer, she lets her warm, smooth fingers caress my cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s the dragon for?\u201d</p><p>I tunnel my hand through her hair, enjoying the silky rain, and I take a deep breath. She\u2019s chosen me. Rachel\u2019s decided to love me beyond the sharp edges. I have no idea what I\u2019ve done to deserve her. \u201cThe dragon\u2019s for the only good foster father I had. He\u2019s the one who taught me everything about cars. He used to call me a dragon.\u201d</p> <p>Her forehead furrows. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I smirk and the memory lightens my mood. \u201cBecause he said I was either breathing fire and destroying everything or I took the fire inside of me and created life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreated life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire can destroy, but it can also create\u2014provide warmth, protection.\u201d I still remember him explaining when I asked the same question. \u201cHe told me until I chose my path, I would always be capable of life and destruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you choose?\u201d She weaves her arms around my neck.</p><p>My hands melt into the indentation of her waist as I wonder how far we should go tonight. Rachel takes my bottom lip between hers, and the kindling bursts into flames.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to me,\u201d I answer. \u201cMy path chooses me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve chosen, Isaiah.\u201d She kisses the side of my neck. \u201cYou\u2019re life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still destruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cHow far?\u201d I ask while I still have a voice. Cupping her face, I reclaim her lips and gently guide her body next to mine on the bed. Rachel\u2019s tank rides up and my fingers explore the satin skin of her belly. There are so many places I long to go, so many places I crave to take her.</p><p>\u201cI want to go further,\u201d she whispers. When I skim the waistband of her pants, her breathing hitches.</p><p>Further. Damn, my entire body responds. I don\u2019t miss the way her hand fidgets with the hem of her shirt. Scared I\u2019ll spook her, I don\u2019t push her too far, but I\u2019m all for reading body language. I place my hand over hers and her smile appears.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She nods and her hand falls away. I lower my head as I slowly edge the material of her tank off her stomach. Jesus, her stomach is gorgeous. Flat and smooth. As my lips press the spot above her belly button I confirm how undeniably sweet Rachel is.</p><p>I kiss each and every centimeter of her exposed skin as I move up her tank. I linger over the material of her bra and Rachel fists the sheet with both hands. She\u2019s so damn hot I\u2019m about to forget slow and go for fast.</p><p>But I ignore those urges and guide the material up and over her head. I don\u2019t know what the hell I did to have such a beautiful creature in my bed, but she\u2019s here and I\u2019m going to spend tonight worshipping this gift in front of me.</p><p>I roll my body over Rachel\u2019s, and her legs tangle with mine. Elvis\u2019s deep voice drifts from the apartment below. He sings about wise men and fools who rush in. I know as I hold Rachel in my arms that I, too, had no choice in falling in love.</p><p>We become lost in kisses, warm bare skin and touches. I move, and this time Rachel moves along with me. There\u2019s a building, a sweet pressure. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re not even two separate people anymore, but one.</p><p>Hands are everywhere. Kisses on the lips, the neck and shoulders. I move faster and Rachel keeps the pace as her thighs press against my hips, bringing me closer.</p><p>Right as my world is about to be pushed over the edge, Rachel grasps on to my body and calls out my name. I wrap my arms around her, holding on as if I\u2019m saving myself from dying. My body jerks, and behind my closed lids there are bright colors. I inhale, and it\u2019s the scent of jasmine and when I open my eyes, I see an angel.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Rachel whispers, and her eyelids flutter with the delicious exhaustion.</p><p>I slip to the side and gather her into my arms. I want Rachel here every night for the rest of my life. It\u2019s what feels right, what feels natural. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d she yawns.</p><p>\u201cSleep, angel.\u201d I rub my hand up her spine and revel in the feel of her body pressed tight to me. \u201cSleep.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 56</p><p>Rachel</p><p>MY EYES POP OPEN AND a nervous adrenaline beats through my system. A nightmare. Just a nightmare. One of my mom and my father and of speeches...</p><p>I\u2019m in the same position as when I fell asleep: one leg draped over Isaiah\u2019s and my head resting against his bare chest. His heart has the same steady rhythm that I\u2019ve come to depend upon. Slants of light filter into the room from the streetlamp. Time lost all meaning hours ago. With one hand wrapped around me, keeping me tucked close to his body, Isaiah dozes.</p><p>Tonight, Isaiah took me places I\u2019ve never been, and the memory almost drives away all the fear from the nightmare....</p><p>The nightmare. Isaiah was in it, too. His words became a mantra: I\u2019ve survived because of what I make people believe.</p><p>I swallow and cringe. My throat is raw from vomiting with the panic attacks. I\u2019m exhausted, unable to sleep for long periods of time, and my body is wearing out further every day.</p><p>My mother wants me to give a twenty-minute speech at a dinner party for hundreds of guests. I\u2019m not sure how much more my body can take, but I risk too much if I tell my parents the truth. If I can hold on until we pay off the debt, then I can introduce Isaiah to my family, and if I give this speech, then my mother will be proud.</p><p>Proud of me like she was always proud of Colleen.</p><p>While Isaiah creates an outside that pushes everyone away, I\u2019ve created an outside in order to draw in my family. No, I\u2019ve done it to win my mother\u2019s love.</p><p>My body is breaking down because of what I make people believe.</p><p>I snuggle closer to Isaiah, and he locks his other arm around me. I ignore the voices in my head and focus on the one person who loves what no one else can: the real me.</p><p>My mind separates from itself as I scan my bedroom. I said goodbye to Isaiah an hour ago, and now my world is in tattered pieces. I did this damage in my search. My purple comforter is ripped off the bed. The pillows strewn across the floor. Every possible container opened and the contents poured out. Last night\u2019s meager winnings crunch in my hand as I close my fist.</p><p>My body trembles as I circle the room again. The money...it\u2019s gone.</p><p>Maybe I missed it. Maybe I got so panicked that it was right in front of me and I didn\u2019t see it. I reach for my jewelry box again, and this time toss the contents as I come across them. As I dig to the bottom, I do see something new: a note. Before I can read the entire thing, I scramble across the floor to my bathroom and discover that my panic has entered a new stage: vomiting blood.</p><p>The door to West\u2019s room bounces against his wall as I throw it open. Ethan and West drop their video game controllers and jump to their feet when they see what I can only assume is pure anger radiating from my face. My body shakes and I sway slightly to the side. My strength is gone. Damn them for doing this to me.</p><p>Ethan grabs my arm. \u201cJesus Christ, Rach. You\u2019re dead on your feet.\u201d</p><p>I smack him off, choosing to be supported by the wall instead. \u201cYou took my money.\u201d</p><p>Ethan and West share a knowing glance, and for some reason they both appear relieved as their shoulders lose their tension. West readjusts the baseball cap on his head. \u201cYeah. That. Did you bother reading the note? We said we\u2019d pay you back.\u201d</p><p>Over months. It said they would pay me back over months. \u201cThat was my money!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ethan\u2019s eyes flicker over me and his head falls back. \u201cYou had a panic attack over the money, didn\u2019t you? Shit, West, I told you we should have taped the note to the outside of the box. You didn\u2019t see the note, and I bet you freaked out when you found the money gone.\u201d</p><p>West flops back into his chair. \u201cA little overdramatic, don\u2019t you think, Rach? I mean, who else is going to take your money? We said we\u2019d pay you back, and we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my money!\u201d I scream. \u201cGive it back! Now!\u201d</p><p>Like always, the two continue their conversation as if I don\u2019t matter. Ethan turns to West. \u201cYou\u2019d flip if someone took over four thousand dollars from your room. By the way, Rach, what type of part were you planning on buying? You had to be saving for a while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you two even try to pretend that you feel bad for stealing?\u201d</p><p>West turns his back to me, preparing to rejoin his game. \u201cWe said we\u2019d pay you back. Chill the fuck out.\u201d</p><p>Screw it. I walk over to West\u2019s desk and begin pulling on drawers, tossing papers and pens and books and crap onto the floor. If they won\u2019t give it to me, then I\u2019ll find it. My brothers shout as I rummage through the room. When they figure out yelling won\u2019t stop me, one of them restrains me from behind. His hands become iron bands around my arms.</p><p>I\u2019m done being weak. I\u2019m done being controlled. I kick and I scream and I only snap out of it when Ethan gets in my face. \u201cRachel!\u201d</p><p>My twin\u2019s dark eyes bore into mine. When we were children, those eyes used to be right there when I fell asleep at night and there when I\u2019d wake in the morning. Even when our parents forced us into our own rooms, we\u2019d sneak away to be with each other. For years, we fought to be together and now, we seem forever apart.</p> <p>\u201cYou stole from me.\u201d</p><p>West holds my arms at my sides. \u201cI stole from you. Ethan objected. Blame me.\u201d</p><p>I stare at Ethan. He\u2019s been keeping something from me, and like he did with me over the panic attacks, I never asked. Maybe because I never wanted to know. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Ethan presses his lips into a fine line. \u201cGavin has a gambling addiction.\u201d</p><p>West releases my arms. \u201cEthan!\u201d</p><p>Ethan throws out his arms. \u201cWhat? We took over four thousand dollars from her, West. That\u2019s not money you take because you need gas.\u201d</p> <p>The two of them argue as I stumble across the items I had tossed on the floor. Gavin, my oldest brother, the head of all of us, the strongest, the leader, has a problem. I sit on the bed and clear my throat, ignoring the raw pain. \u201cHow bad?\u201d</p><p>West shoves his hands in his pockets with such force that his boxers stick out. \u201cBad. None of us ever meant for it to happen. You know those nights you\u2019d cover for Ethan, we figured out it worked for me, too, so the four of us started hanging.\u201d</p><p>Of course they did. Leaving me out would be the thing to do. I rub my forehead as the migraine from the panic attack sets in.</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to have fun,\u201d says Ethan. \u201cAway from Mom and Dad. It\u2019s hard on Gavin and Jack. They hate being a part of this family. They look down the hall and they see Colleen\u2019s room. They look at how Mom treated you and they felt like they were reliving the cancer. They saw you and...\u201d</p><p>They saw her.</p><p>\u201cSo one night we went to the riverboat.\u201d West continues Ethan\u2019s story, no doubt hoping I wouldn\u2019t make the connection. \u201cI\u2019d scored me and Ethan some fake IDs. Gavin got hooked and we tried to help, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe found other ways to gamble when we stopped him from going to the boat,\u201d finishes Ethan. \u201cHe owed some bad people money. Thank God you had enough to pay them off.\u201d</p><p>I lower my head into my hands. Isaiah and I are screwed. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019ve done,\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>The bed shifts, and I peek to find Ethan sitting beside me and West standing in front of me. Both of them hold their shoulders slouched forward.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not enabling him.\u201d West clearly believes that what I said means something completely different. \u201cGavin tried going to Dad, but Dad was too busy to listen, so Gavin came to me. He agreed to get help if I helped him pay the debt. And he\u2019s going to get help. Gavin just didn\u2019t want Dad to know how bad it was, and he never wants Mom to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRach,\u201d says Ethan. \u201cGavin\u2019s going to rehab after the charity dinner. Dad wants Mom to have one perfect night before Gavin goes and then Dad will tell Mom everything.\u201d</p><p>I massage my temples, wishing the throb would disappear. This entire family is one big mess. When I think my legs won\u2019t give out, I stand. Ethan joins me, and West braces his arms as if I\u2019m going to fall. I push past them and go for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d asks Ethan.</p><p>I pause and choke back the automatic lie. What would this family have been like if Colleen had never died? \u201cI\u2019m going to see Isaiah, and you aren\u2019t going to stop me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 57</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>I ROLL A GLASS JAR full of nuts against the tool bench at the garage. Completely broken, Rachel sits a few feet from me in the chair Abby dragged out of the office for her when her sobs became too intense for her to stand. Logan leans against the office window with the back of his head resting against the glass. This isn\u2019t his problem, but he treats it like it is. For that, I have respect.</p><p>Abby crouches in front of Rachel, doing what I should be doing, consoling. Saying the words I should be saying, that\u2019s it\u2019s not her fault and it\u2019ll be okay. Abby\u2019s right. It\u2019s not her fault. She did nothing wrong by protecting our money in her room. Her brothers on the other hand...</p><p>I grab the jar and throw it across the room. Glass shatters against the wall. My chest moves rapidly. We have seven hundred dollars. Four-thousand three hundred dollars short of what we need.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d asks Logan with absolutely no inflection.</p><p>My head falls back. \u201cSome.\u201d At least the anger is under control. That is, until I get my hands on her brothers. \u201cThe nitro system goes in my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d Logan says again. \u201cRachel\u2019s car is the better one. Add the system to hers. We\u2019ll have a better shot at winning.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest, unmoved and unconvinced. Movies and television make nitro look like child\u2019s play, but it\u2019s not. The systems are tricky and too many things can go wrong. Even though she won\u2019t be the person drag racing with it, I don\u2019t want her in a car with that type of danger. \u201cNot your call.\u201d</p><p>Rachel wipes her eyes and stands. \u201cThen it\u2019s mine. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re fighting us on this. We have a better chance to win with the system in my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her hair moves with her frustrated breath. \u201cIf you won\u2019t put the system in my car, then let me race against Zach.\u201d</p><p>Tension cramps my neck and I pop it to the right. Drag racing is dangerous. Nitro is dangerous. If Zach is working with Eric, then Zach is lethal. Rachel is the one thing in my life I can\u2019t lose. Why can\u2019t she see how much I love her? That I need to protect her?</p><p>Logan pushes off the wall. \u201cThe way I see it, you\u2019re outvoted. It\u2019s her car. If she wants the system in it, install it. Besides, you\u2019ll be the one firing the tanks, not her.\u201d</p><p>Because I don\u2019t argue, I stay silent, but let my arms drop. Rachel misreads me and wraps herself around me. Last night, I spent a few hours in heaven by holding my angel tight. Rachel went home, and we were both sent to hell. I kiss the top of her head. I promised I\u2019d take care of her, and I\u2019ll do anything to keep that promise.</p><p>It\u2019s Monday morning and because Pro Performance insists on a high school diploma along with the certification, I have to ignore my problems and go to school. The moment I walk into the building, Abby joins my side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually going today?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cMight as well. Occasionally I like to throw people off. By the way, I got my hands on a nitro system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>Abby matches my strides up the stairs. \u201cConsider it a gift.\u201d</p><p>I freeze on the landing. \u201cI thought you had to stay financially out.\u201d</p><p>Reaching the second floor, Abby walks backward. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one who had people owing them favors.\u201d She enters the second room on the right and I smirk. I never knew she took honors math.</p><p>Mr. Holden calls me from the steps below and waits as I head back down. I jack my thumb in the other direction. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a slip,\u201d he says, as if he ran to catch me. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>I nod and follow him. Instead of going to the school\u2019s auto shop, he chooses an empty classroom and closes the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Mr. Holden fiddles with his safety glasses. \u201cThere were some irregularities with the certification testing.\u201d</p><p>I say nothing, having no idea how this involves me. I knew everything on that test.</p><p>\u201cSeveral of the guys you tested with had the same scores, missing the same questions. They reviewed the tapes and caught them cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cheat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Mr. Holden. \u201cBut this scandal has the testing facility questioning everything from that day. They\u2019re zeroing in on you because of your score. They have adults who don\u2019t score as well as you did, so it makes them wonder if you had outside help.\u201d</p><p>I slam my books on the desk beside me. \u201cI studied for years for this test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Mr. Holden.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cheat.\u201d</p><p>He runs a hand over his salt-and-pepper hair. \u201cI talked to the facility\u2019s manager. Told him you\u2019re a good kid so he agreed to let you retake the test.\u201d</p><p>My teeth click together. Retake the test. For once in my life, I followed proper society\u2019s rules, and all I got was a kick in the nuts. \u201cWhat happens when I ace that one? Are they going to accuse me of cheating again? Because there is no way a street punk foster kid can have a fucking brain?\u201d</p><p>I hold my hand up, not wanting to hear the answer, and back away. The bell rings. Class has started for everyone else but I don\u2019t see the point of attending anymore.</p><p>Out in the hallway, I catch Zach staring at me from a few doors down. Without a word, he slinks into a classroom. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind now that the boy is working for Eric, because the guy I know would have never done something as low as this. Good thing for him that he\u2019s on Eric\u2019s payroll. Otherwise, he\u2019d be dead.</p><p>Chapter 58</p><p>Rachel</p><p>BESIDES THE TINKLING OF SILVERWARE against plates, dinner is unusually silent. The presence of Gavin and Jack at the dinner table every Monday usually means plenty of banter between my brothers, but each of them appears lost in their own thoughts.</p><p>The long cherry table is made for eight people. Mom and Dad sit at either end. Gavin and Jack are seated closest to Dad. Ethan and West share the middle seats. My chair is next to Mom, and I stare at the only empty seat: the one meant for Colleen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s quiet tonight,\u201d says Mom. Her blue eyes jump to each of our faces.</p><p>My brothers throw out excuses: work, school or tired. I say nothing.</p><p>I shove at the enchilada on my plate. The last thing I want touching my raw throat is anything spicy.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d Mom says. \u201cAre you feeling okay? You\u2019ve got circles under your eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Every single person gawks at me, including my father. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>No one drops their gaze. In fact, no one eats. Dad leans his elbows on the white tablecloth as he studies me closer. \u201cYour mom is right. You don\u2019t have your typical bounce.\u201d</p><p>No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m exhausted and worn and on the verge of collapsing. I\u2019m mad at my brothers, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re angry with me, and my boyfriend and I are going to get our butts kicked by Eric when we can\u2019t pay him five thousand dollars.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been overpreparing for that speech on Saturday, right, Rach?\u201d Gavin shoves a forkful of rice into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI want to make everyone proud,\u201d I say. At the word proud, Gavin glances away.</p> <p>With the mere mention of her event, Mom fills everyone in on the details. How every seat is sold and how there is a waiting list and how five hundred people will be attending. My stomach cramps. Eric may not be an issue after all since this speech will possibly kill me first.</p><p>I escaped after dessert, asking Dad in front of everyone for permission to go to Abby\u2019s. Understanding that I probably wasn\u2019t going to hang with my new \u201crich\u201d friend and was instead going to hang with Isaiah, Ethan and West slammed their silverware. My mother raised an eyebrow at their behavior, but said nothing. Once Dad confirmed I had finished homework, he told me to be home by ten.</p><p>Isaiah texted earlier today that he had work to do in the garage this evening. Needing to be someplace calm, I park next to the auto shop. I scan the lot and wonder if he went home when I don\u2019t see his car. The puzzle is solved when I walk into the garage. In the bay, the hood to his Mustang is open and so are the doors. \u201cIsaiah?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m greeted by the buzzing of the overhead heaters. Isaiah mentioned that he was concerned about his engine overheating. I look to see what he\u2019s done, and I rub my eyes. No.</p><p>A weariness overtakes me. A weariness that sleep could never solve.</p><p>I hit my hand against the open passenger door in my haste to peer inside the vehicle. In the backseat are two tanks of nitro. The door to the garage squeaks open. Isaiah\u2019s eyes meet mine, and I swear I hear my heart ripping in two when I spot guilt.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Isaiah asks.</p><p>I say nothing. We both know how bad this is\u2014how this borders on a betrayal that is unspeakable.</p><p>Isaiah tugs at his bottom earring\u2014a sure sign of inner turmoil. The silence builds between us and I\u2019m the first to crack. \u201cDid Abby get two systems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says.</p><p>Red-hot tears of anger well in my eyes. \u201cI thought we agreed...\u201d</p><p>He cuts me off. \u201cWe didn\u2019t agree. You and Logan wanted the system in your car, and I didn\u2019t. End of story.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah doesn\u2019t argue. How many times has he told me that? \u201cSo what? I don\u2019t get a vote? You aren\u2019t the only one on the line here. Eric is coming after me, too.\u201d</p><p>A string of curses leaves his mouth as he stalks over to me. \u201cEvery second of my day is consumed with the knowledge that you\u2019re under him. I\u2019m doing this to protect you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy lying to me?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah seems taken aback. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>The first stupid tear breaks through and I quickly wipe it away. \u201cYou knew I expected you to put the system in my car. Regardless that you never said the words, it\u2019s a lie.\u201d My mind reels with the implications of what\u2019s happened. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than a lie. This is major. You made a decision without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bull. You, Logan, Abby and I discussed the options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you decided our fate without me.\u201d My hand pounds at my chest. \u201cI thought we were a team. I thought we were partners.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah places his hands on my shoulders. His gray eyes are waves crashing between anger and fear. \u201cI don\u2019t have much, Rachel, and I refuse to lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I won\u2019t ever touch the system. It\u2019ll only be used on the dragway. We\u2019ll take it out after we pay the debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese systems are dangerous. If someone hits you or the system malfunctions or you accidently set something off...\u201d Isaiah runs through the impossible scenarios. His eyes dart as he talks, as if he\u2019s searching for a way to fix all of the problems. My energy fades as I realize that\u2019s exactly what he is doing. He\u2019s trying to fix one more thing.</p><p>\u201cThe risks are small. You can\u2019t control everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d His hands move to my face\u2014warm, strong, and I notice they tremble. \u201cLet this go, Rachel. The decision is made. I\u2019m doing this to protect you.\u201d</p><p>To protect me. Because I\u2019m not capable of making my own decisions. My hands shoot up and smack his arms off me. \u201cI am not weak.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widen. \u201cI never said you were.\u201d</p><p>I pull a hand through my hair and tug at the strands, hoping that I\u2019m wrong. But I\u2019m not. \u201cYou\u2019re just like my brothers. You see me as fragile and stupid and as someone who can\u2019t make her own decisions.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah reaches out. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. I love you. You know this.\u201d</p><p>I step away from him. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what they say, too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 59</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>THE PHONE RINGS THREE TIMES and Rachel\u2019s sweet voice answers again, \u201cHi, this is Rachel Young. Leave a message after the beep.\u201d</p><p>Like the other ten times, the beep happens, and I sit with my head hanging down listening to static. I should say I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not. I should tell her I\u2019m wrong and that we\u2019ll install the system in her car, but that would be a lie. What I want is for her to walk through the door of the garage and tell me that she understands my need to protect her, my need to fix things.</p><p>From cars to situations to myself. Because if I didn\u2019t take care of me, no one else would. This is me doing what no one ever did on my behalf\u2014I\u2019m protecting her because that\u2019s what you do when you love someone. It\u2019s what I always wanted someone to do for me.</p><p>\u201cCall me.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Tuesday afternoon. The day\u2019s dragged as I\u2019ve waited for Rachel to contact me, and the seconds continue to stretch now that I know she\u2019s out of school. The door to the garage squeaks open, and my heart speeds up in anticipation. I stand, wiping my hands against my jeans. I\u2019ll tell her I love her. I\u2019ll tell her that there\u2019s nothing I won\u2019t do to make her happy. I\u2019ll tell her...</p><p>Logan strolls in and I silently curse. I forgot I asked him to spot me when I tested the nitro system. If I weren\u2019t so damned screwed in the head, I\u2019d laugh at his jock baseball uniform. \u201cNice getup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCame straight from an exposition game. Spring season starts soon.\u201d</p><p>I close the hood of my car. \u201cBaseball seems tame for you. I would have pegged you for football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw,\u201d says Logan. \u201cCatcher is a crazy position. Bats flying near your head, a guy that hurls one-hundred-mile-per-hour fastballs at you and a runner going at full speed trying to take you out as you stand over home plate. That\u2019s an adrenaline rush.\u201d</p><p>Speaking of adrenaline rushes. \u201cFollow me in your car. We\u2019re going to head out past Fox Lane and test the system.\u201d</p><p>The sky turns pink as the sun prepares to set. Logan and I stand in front of my car, staring at the mile stretch of new blacktop that will someday shepherd people to a crapload of new homes. Currently, it leads to construction vehicles and woods.</p><p>I motion toward the side. \u201cWait over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d says Logan. \u201cI want in on this action.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI haven\u2019t driven with nitro before. If it weren\u2019t for Eric breathing down our necks, I wouldn\u2019t even be dealing with the shit. And if I did decide to play with it, I\u2019d be testing this car on the drag strip during Test and Tune. But I\u2019m short on time.\u201d</p><p>Logan pats my shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s live a little.\u201d</p><p>He opens the door to the passenger side and closes it. The space between my skin and bones begins to vibrate; the dread that something nuclear is on the verge of exploding. I\u2019m out of time, and something worse is going to happen if I don\u2019t make money. I slide into my car.</p><p>My eyes flutter open and my vision blurs. I blink and it doesn\u2019t help. I shut my eyes and press my thumb and forefinger against them, hoping to rub away the issue. Pain shoots through my body and when I open my mouth I taste blood.</p><p>The car spun. It kept spinning. I lost control.</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d My voice doesn\u2019t sound like my own.</p><p>Silence. My eyes stay closed and everything floats on a haze\u2014like a dream. Maybe I am dreaming. No. We crashed. My eyes won\u2019t open again so I throw my hand out toward the passenger side. It claws through the air and smacks the empty seat.</p><p>\u201cLogan, answer me, man,\u201d I call out louder. Something trickles down my nose and my mind drifts. Maybe this was only a dream.</p><p>Chapter 60</p><p>Rachel</p><p>I IGNORE ISAIAH\u2019S MESSAGES. I\u2019M in love with a guy who thinks I\u2019m as weak as my brothers say I am. The sad part is, I almost believed I was strong.</p><p>Three knocks on the door and I know it\u2019s Mom. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>With her blond hair slicked back into a ponytail at the nape of her neck, Mom pops her head in with a glowing smile. \u201cAbby\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbby?\u201d I sit up. Mom fell in love with private school\u2013going, rich Abby. Not that Abby wowed them with her personality as much as Mom is wowed I have a friend. I wonder how much she\u2019ll love her if she discovers my new best friend deals drugs.</p><p>Mom widens the door to reveal Abby dressed in her typical black hoodie and painted-on jeans. I start to smile until I notice she won\u2019t meet my gaze. She\u2019s only avoided me once, and that was when Eric revealed her real job.</p><p>I slide off the bed and dismiss my mother with one word. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you girls want anything?\u201d Mom asks as she stands between us. \u201cFood or drinks?\u201d</p><p>Abby enters my room and handles a picture of me and my brothers. Her behavior is seriously freaking me out.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I say. \u201cBut we\u2019ll let you know if we change our minds.\u201d</p><p>Mom claps her hands against her legs. \u201cAll right then. Oh.\u201d Her eyes brighten. \u201cAbby, would you like to come to a charity event I\u2019m throwing for the Leukemia Foundation on Saturday? It\u2019ll be at The Lakes Country Club. Rachel will be speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d says Abby.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Mom rattles out a few details neither Abby nor I catch before excusing herself.</p><p>When the door clicks shut, Abby puts the picture down. \u201cThink of a good lie to leave, and think of it fast. Isaiah and Logan are in the hospital.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 61</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>MY HEAD THROBS. A PULSE that originates from the twelve stitches on my forehead and vibrates my skull. If it weren\u2019t for my head, I\u2019d probably feel the rest of my body. The doctor called me lucky. Lots of bruises. No broken bones. No internal injuries.</p><p>I\u2019d feel luckier if someone would tell me about Logan. The bastard...my friend...a lump forms in my throat...I saw blood.</p> <p>I raise my hand to my head. The tubing of the IV line rubs against my forearm.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t touch it.\u201d</p><p>With the sight of her, my stomach twists to the point that the doctor may have to rethink internal injuries. \u201cI\u2019m not in the fucking mood, Beth.\u201d</p><p>A chair scrapes against the floor, causing the pounding in my head to increase. \u201cWe could be twins,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a nice-size scar over my eye, too.\u201d</p><p>I drop my arm and stare at the girl I had thought I loved since I was fourteen. When I met her, she had straight black hair and an attitude that scared the shit out of bikers. The prickly disposition Beth used to carry as a physical shield no longer drapes her aura. There\u2019s a peacefulness that surrounds her that I never noticed in all our years together.</p> <p>\u201cYou got your scar because you wouldn\u2019t listen,\u201d I say.</p><p>Beth flashes her patented sarcastic grin. \u201cTwenty dollars I\u2019ll find out the same thing about you.\u201d</p><p>Back in October, I stood in this same hospital waiting to hear if she was alive. Her mother\u2019s boyfriend tried to kill Beth. Her boyfriend, Ryan, saved her. Once I heard she was fine, I left. Beth obviously doesn\u2019t live by the same policy.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShirley and Dale.\u201d</p><p>My foster parents\u2014her aunt and uncle. They stopped in a half hour ago. They were part pissed I interrupted their long weekend at the lake, part pissed that my social worker is now up their ass and even more pissed I hurt myself. Who knew the two of them gave a slight shit.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Logan?\u201d I ask.</p><p>The peacefulness fades from her face. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. They took his dad straight back and he hasn\u2019t been out since. No one will tell us a thing. Ryan\u2019s going nuts.\u201d</p><p>I place a fist to my forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve fucked it all up. If something\u2019s wrong with him...\u201d</p><p>I could never forgive myself.</p><p>Beth places a hand over mine and squeezes. \u201cHe\u2019s an adrenaline junkie. We all know it. If it wasn\u2019t with you, it would have been with someone else at some other time. At least you were there. At least you could call the police. You can\u2019t fix everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how deep I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Because we\u2019re not friends anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Isaiah. I always have, but I\u2019ve never been in love with you. Both of us were so damn fucked in the head that neither of us understood the difference between friendship and love. We\u2019re friends. We always have been. I know you know what I mean because Logan\u2019s told me about Rachel.\u201d</p><p>My eyes snap to hers and Beth waves me off. \u201cHe never betrayed you. I annoyed the hell out of him until he told me, and all he would say was that you look at Rachel like Ryan looks at me. In all the years we knew each other, you never looked at me like that.\u201d</p><p>Beth opens her mouth to continue, but I cut her off. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>I return Beth\u2019s grip. \u201cYou let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>She raises an eyebrow, highlighting the scar above her eye. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel doesn\u2019t. She always wants to take care of herself. Drives me crazy.\u201d</p><p>Beth laughs. \u201cThen it must be love. I drive Ryan insane.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an ache that goes deeper than the physical wounds of my skin. \u201cI really did care for you.\u201d Beth\u2019s right\u2014I didn\u2019t love her, at least not in the way I love Rachel, but it doesn\u2019t negate the fact that I had feelings, even if she didn\u2019t return them.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She repeats the answer I gave her. \u201cI also know you love her, but is there room for me? Just as what we were good at? As friends?\u201d</p><p>Friends with Beth. I assess the small devilish pixie, and it\u2019s one of the first times in my life I\u2019ve seen her desperate for an answer. I rub my hand over my head. This could be really good, or the worst mistake ever. But because Beth\u2019s right again, I nod. She and I were always at our best as friends. \u201cFriends.\u201d</p><p>A female clears her throat at the doorway, and Courtney walks into the room. Beth stands. \u201cNoah and Echo are on their way,\u201d Beth says. \u201cAnd I dropped Abby off at Rachel\u2019s. They should be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Noah\u2019s going to blow a gasket, and I\u2019m not sure Rachel will want to show.</p><p>Courtney slips into the seat Beth abandoned. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>I motion toward my arm with the IV. \u201cI\u2019ll be better when they spring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah...\u201d She inhales deeply and exhales. \u201cWhat the hell were you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Logan?\u201d</p><p>Courtney shakes her head so sadly that her ponytail slumps. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll be honest...the longer his dad stays back there, the more anxious I become. He\u2019s got a lot of friends out there, and you\u2019d think his father would want to give them good news.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes, not allowing Courtney to see the fear there...the weakness.</p><p>\u201cThe police believe your story, Isaiah. That you tested a nitrous system on an abandoned road and it failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a story,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth. Something went wrong and I lost control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of what happens with Logan, the police won\u2019t press charges. Logan\u2019s father waived away the option of holding you responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay for fucking me. At least I won\u2019t be in prison like my mom, right?\u201d</p><p>My vision blurs for the second time today. This time it\u2019s because of tears. For years, I\u2019ve been fine. But now, emotions are everywhere and I can\u2019t control a damn thing.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why I asked to be your social worker?\u201d Courtney asks.</p><p>I peer at the blood pressure machine, wishing I could stop feeling. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I grew up in foster care, too.\u201d</p><p>The heart rate monitor increases speed, and Courtney pretends she doesn\u2019t notice that her bombshell affects me. \u201cEntered at six, just like you. I had the good homes, the bad ones and the group homes. I even have a tattoo from my pissed-off years.\u201d</p><p>My chest moves faster as my emotions threaten to consume me. I reach for anger, because it feels better than hurt. \u201cIs that what you think I am? Pissed-off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Isaiah.\u201d Courtney stares straight into my eyes. \u201cPissed-off is the easy emotion. Having been in the same exact position you\u2019re in...\u201d She flutters her hand at the hospital bed and then grows still. Her mouth attempts to quirk up, but her lower lip trembles. \u201cI\u2019d bet, right now, you\u2019re feeling very alone.\u201d</p><p>Alone.</p><p>Logan\u2019s got a dad beside him. Me? I\u2019ve got a social worker. I shake my head, fighting the hurt. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me that nobody wants to keep me?\u201d</p><p>Why no one wanted to love me. Right now, I don\u2019t feel badass. I feel seventeen and crave for someone to tell me that my friend will be okay.</p><p>Her fingers find mine and I don\u2019t draw away. \u201cNothing,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with you.\u201d</p><p>I suck in air, close my eyes and exhale out the emotions. Courtney withdraws her hand, and I\u2019m grateful she doesn\u2019t push me further.</p><p>\u201cCan you find out about Logan?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 62</p><p>Rachel</p><p>ABBY GRIPS THE PASSENGER DOOR. \u201cI\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrow up in my car, and that will be the last thing you ever do.\u201d Spotting the exit for the hospital, I cut over two lanes and shift down. Isaiah\u2019s been teaching me some tricks after school. Never in a million years would I have thought I\u2019d be using those skills to race to the hospital to see if he\u2019s alive.</p><p>\u201cYou were doing ninety and switching lanes like we were being chased by the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s here?\u201d Because I\u2019d prefer for Isaiah to be at any of the other hospitals in the county over University. This is where they bring the awful trauma cases.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Abby loosens her hold on the door as we approach the stoplight at the end of the ramp. \u201cEcho told me.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah called me and I never called back. My last words to him were in anger. What if he thinks I don\u2019t love him? My fingers beat against the steering wheel, counting how long it takes for the cross light to turn yellow. \u201cAre you sure she said University?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where they take the worst trauma patients.\u201d I admit my fear out loud.</p><p>Abby releases a heavy sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s also where they take people with no insurance. He\u2019s a foster kid, Rachel, and a line item on the government\u2019s budget. That is where they\u2019d take him. Not the fancy-ass hospital with the flat-screen televisions.\u201d</p><p>Like Isaiah taught me, my foot hovers over the gas while my other presses on the clutch. My fingers grasp the gearshift. A solid wall with no windows, a practical fortress, University Hospital looms over us two blocks ahead. I watch the cross light turn yellow, and my eyes flick to my light, waiting for the green.</p><p>In one instantaneous movement, I lay off the clutch, step on the gas and shift into gear the second the light flips. Next to me, Abby curses.</p><p>Abby and I run past the sliding glass doors of the hospital and hesitate. The bland waiting room with beige-painted cinder block walls is cramped with people. Wet coughing hacks, crying babies and the sound of someone vomiting makes me turn my head. In the corner, wearing too many layers of clothes that haven\u2019t been washed, a man hunches over and talks to himself.</p><p>Abby nudges my elbow. \u201cOver there.\u201d</p><p>My heart soars out of my body when I spot Isaiah. He\u2019s hugging his roommate, Noah. Strong arms wrapped around each other in a brief embrace. They separate, and I cover my mouth when I see the wound on his head, the bruises forming on his face, the blood dried on his clothing.</p><p>Stepping forward out of the shadows and touching Isaiah\u2019s arm is one of my many nightmares: Beth. She smiles up at him, and when he smiles back my heart shatters.</p><p>Chapter 63</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>WITH NO CLUE ABOUT LOGAN\u2019S condition, I walk into the waiting room. Hearing that Noah was on his way, Shirley and Dale left, but told me I could crash in their basement if I needed. After all, the state still pays them for me.</p><p>I see red hair and curls first. Echo chokes me. It\u2019s nice to have a sister. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d I glance at Noah from over her head. With his hair hiding his eyes and hands on his hips, I can\u2019t read my best friend. \u201cHow\u2019s Noah?\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cScared,\u201d she whispers. \u201cMad.\u201d</p><p>I nod at Noah. \u201cS\u2019up, man.\u201d He embraces me\u2014a strong crush of arms and muscles. We hold it for a second, keep it tight and then let go. The two of us are brothers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive me a reason why I shouldn\u2019t kick your ass,\u201d says Noah. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, Noah,\u201d says Beth from behind me. \u201cHe already has stitches.\u201d</p><p>Beth and I used to gang up against Noah all the time. She\u2019s right about us. We were friends first. Always friends. Not understanding a relationship that close, it got muddled.</p><p>She flashes a genuine smile and I smile back. Yeah, Beth and I, we can do friends. A few feet behind her and hanging with what I assume is Logan\u2019s entire baseball team, Beth\u2019s guy, Ryan, watches us with his arms folded over his chest. I tip my chin at him to let him know I\u2019m good, and he tilts his head in acceptance. That\u2019ll probably be the longest conversation the two of us ever have.</p> <p>Noah leans into us so that we form our own circle. \u201cDo you know what he\u2019s been doing?\u201d</p><p>Beth shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s always liked to drive fast. Stupidity caught up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupidity did catch up, but not in that way.\u201d Noah\u2019s dark eyes snap to mine and he rolls his shoulders back. He\u2019s looking for a fight and my body reacts. My head continues to throb like a bad bass line, but if Noah wants to have it out, we will.</p><p>\u201cSay what you gotta say, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Beth places an arm between us. \u201cHe just got out of the hospital. This is the first time I\u2019ve been with the two of you in months. You are not ruining this for me by fighting.\u201d</p> <p>Noah and I stand toe to toe and neither one of us flinch. \u201cDo you want to tell her, Isaiah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, man. It sounds like you\u2019ve got all the answers.\u201d</p><p>Keeping his eyes locked on me, Noah drops the bomb. \u201cHe owes money to Eric.\u201d</p><p>The silence between the three of us builds pressure in my neck.</p><p>\u201cHow much,\u201d asks Beth in a low tone.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d I answer. Too much.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she demands. \u201cWhy did you street race?\u201d</p><p>Noah finally looks away. \u201cBecause I told him I was moving into the dorms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah!\u201d Beth grabs hold of the arm of his jacket. \u201cWhat the hell? You promised both of us a year ago that you would never leave us behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Noah asks Beth. \u201cYou promised you\u2019d stay away from Louisville.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s head tilts in her familiar pissed-off way. \u201cLogan\u2019s my friend. So is Isaiah. Explain why you\u2019re bailing on us? You break a promise to him, you break it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept my promise to you,\u201d says Noah. \u201cWho do you think told Shirley to call your uncle when you got arrested last fall? Do you think the lush figured it out on her own? I reminded her that your Uncle Scott had money and would be able to help with bail. As for Isaiah, I can\u2019t help him if he owes people like Eric.\u201d</p><p>Beth pales. \u201cYou...you did that to me?\u201d</p><p>Noah lowers himself to stare into her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t stand there acting like I ratted you out. You\u2019re better off and you know it. You\u2019re happy. You\u2019ve told me that yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Beth clenches her hands together. \u201cBut it should have been my choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth...you never saw your choices.\u201d And his eyes flash to me. \u201cAnd neither do you.\u201d</p><p>I gesture with palms open. \u201cShow me my rich uncle, Noah, and I\u2019m game. Wait...my bad...out of the three of us, I\u2019m the only trash here.\u201d</p><p>Noah shoves a finger into my chest, daring me into a physical confrontation. \u201cYou\u2019re so bent on believing what you want people to see that you forget that you\u2019re more. Keep saying it. Keep saying you\u2019re trash and take the fucking swing at me, but if you do, know I\u2019m hitting back.\u201d</p><p>My head is so close to Noah\u2019s that I feel the heat of his anger, or maybe it\u2019s mine.</p><p>\u201cYou want to fight, man?\u201d I ask. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, bro. But I do want to kick some sense into your head.\u201d</p><p>Around us, several guys leap to their feet, calling at us to back down. Most of them wear jock jackets like Logan\u2019s. One has the balls to touch me. Ryan, Beth\u2019s guy, has the balls to touch Noah. \u201cBring it down a notch.\u201d</p><p>Beth smacks Ryan\u2019s arm. \u201cLet him go, Ryan.\u201d She turns to the one with his arm on me. \u201cYou, too, Chris. This is how the two of them communicate.\u201d</p><p>Ryan yanks on the bill of his baseball cap. \u201cThis is a fight, Beth.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a family reunion. A fucked-up one, but how else would we do it.\u201d</p><p>Noah cracks his crazy-ass grin with her words and chuckles. I pop the tension out of my neck, and Noah flexes his shoulders to relax. \u201cYou should have told me you had problems.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI got problems.\u201d</p><p>Noah pats my back. \u201cThen we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in a while, the pressure inside of me dips. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>The door to the emergency room opens. On crutches, Logan hobbles out of the E.R. with a man who must be his dad by his side. Some of the guys near us clap or yell out Logan\u2019s name.</p><p>For the first time since waking up from the crash, I feel like I can take a lungful of air. Logan acknowledges his friends as he and his two poles maneuver through the mass of people. There\u2019s no mistake that he\u2019s making his way to me, Beth, Chris and Ryan.</p><p>Chris is the first to speak. \u201cYou\u2019re a moron, Junior.\u201d</p><p>Logan pops that insane grin. \u201cBut it was a hell of a rush.\u201d He nods at me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame with me.\u201d He kicks out his right leg. \u201cTwenty-four stitches on my thigh. Nothing broken.\u201d Logan loses the spark. \u201cI\u2019m out for a bit.\u201d He\u2019s referring to helping with the money.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. You still have to fix my \u201957 Chevy.\u201d</p><p>Logan turns to Ryan and the pair embrace. Beth told me they\u2019d been friends since elementary school. I can only imagine their bond. Beth wraps her arms around me. \u201cThanks for being my friend again.\u201d</p><p>I hug her back. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Isaiah,\u201d says Logan. \u201cWasn\u2019t that Rachel?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 64</p><p>Rachel</p><p>ISAIAH HUGGED BETH.</p><p>Beth\u2014the strong girl, the beautiful girl, the girl who twisted Isaiah in knots. He smiled at her. He hugged her. And they looked perfect together.</p><p>I\u2019ve watched Abby and Isaiah for weeks, and never once has he touched her, much less hugged her. And Isaiah doesn\u2019t smile easily. It\u2019s a rare gift and he gave it to her. Our fight must have opened his eyes. The crash must have revealed his true feelings.</p><p>And his feelings aren\u2019t for me.</p><p>I yank my keys out of my purse. They fall through my fingers and clank on the blacktop. Abby, I should go back for Abby, but I can\u2019t stay. She went to pester a nurse for news on Logan and never returned. Isaiah can drive her home. Or Noah can. Or Beth.</p><p>All people who belong together. I don\u2019t belong in their world. I\u2019m weak. They\u2019re strong.</p><p>Beth is strong.</p><p>I snatch the keys off the ground, and they clink together in my hands. I\u2019m shaking, and it\u2019s not because of the chill in the evening air. The guy I fell in love with never loved me. Never.</p><p>\u201cRachel!\u201d Isaiah calls out.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder, gripping the keys tighter in my hand. My breathing hitches. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t hear him say the words. Not with the memory of him holding her so fresh. Not with her probably observing through the glass door. A girl like her would enjoy watching me break.</p><p>My thoughts become a distorted mess, and my stomach hollows out as if I\u2019ve been pushed over a ravine. I feel the sickening weightlessness like I\u2019m falling, my arms flailing to stop.</p><p>I should run, but I\u2019m paralyzed by the sight of him. Even moving slowly, Isaiah possesses the prowess of a panther. His muscles pronounced in the easy way he strides. The set, determined gaze on me as his prey. This only proves how weak I am. Like the animal on the verge of being devoured in the wild, I stand here stunned by his dangerous beauty.</p><p>Isaiah touches me. His warm palm to my face. A soft slide of his thumb. My body has memorized the motion. I lean into his hand and close my eyes. I\u2019ll miss this. I\u2019ll miss everything about him. A tear escapes and creates a wet trail down my face.</p><p>Isaiah has always been gentle, and he is again as he wipes it away. \u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d</p><p>Hundreds of pounds of weight stack on top of my chest, restricting air. I open my eyes, not daring to meet his stare. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome stitches and bruises, but yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Logan?\u201d I ask with as much strength as I can muster. I fight the tingling in my blood, a reaction to the shortage of oxygen. I have seconds before I lose control. Breathe.</p><p>\u201cStitches, too. But fine. Rachel, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Because his hand on my cheek prods me to face him, because I\u2019ve hardly ever been able to defy him when he speaks to me in such a deep, soothing voice...my eyes rise to meet his. Confusion and hurt swirl in a murky storm in his gray eyes. I\u2019d do anything if that pain was for me, but it\u2019s not. It can\u2019t be.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hear his words, not yet, so I ask, \u201cYour car?\u201d</p><p>His head drops as he presses his hands to his face. \u201cTotaled.\u201d</p><p>Pain for him, pain for me, rips at my heart. Another tear escapes. The car was his\u2014a part of his soul. The sorrow he must feel\u2014there has to be a better word than mourning.</p><p>Yearning to touch him, longing to comfort him, my fingers instinctively brush against his temple. Isaiah takes my hand and knots our fingers together, squeezing a little too tight. \u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t want the system in your car.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re back to this\u2014so easily. His words are a sandblaster against my soul, decimating my insides, crushing my bones, leaving me as a completely empty shell. \u201cBecause your car, your life, is worth less?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answers with stubborn resolve.</p><p>The hospital doors open, and Beth steps onto the sidewalk. My throat thickens, and the warning contortion of my stomach tells me my time is up. I yank my hand from his. \u201cShe\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>He glances over his shoulder, and I take advantage by fleeing. Quickly. Turning into the maze of cars. Hoping to disappear. Words fly in my head\u2014all related, yet not; all tangible, yet slipping through my fingers: Eric and debt and Isaiah and love and Beth and strength and weakness...</p><p>And my mother and my brothers and my father and Colleen...</p><p>All of us dominoes on a board where one event results in chaos. One tip of a piece and everything scatters. There\u2019s no control. Like everyone else, I\u2019m a piece to be overturned. I will never control my destiny.</p><p>My hand grabs at my coat, jerking it off as heat consumes me and chokes my neck. At the intersection of four parked cars, I fall to my knees and convulse with the first dry heave. Searing pain cuts through my throat and I become light-headed.</p><p>\u201cRachel!\u201d Isaiah lifts me upright, wiping my hair from my face.</p><p>\u201cNo hospital.\u201d They can\u2019t know...they can\u2019t know...they can\u2019t... \u201cPromise they won\u2019t know....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My stomach cramps, and I roll away from him with the blast of heat rushing through my body.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d Isaiah scrambles beside me. \u201cThere\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 65</p><p>Isaiah</p> <p>PROMISE THEY WON\u2019T KNOW...</p><p>Craving a physical connection, I slide my finger along the back of Rachel\u2019s hand. She\u2019s asleep. Has been for a while. Curled in the fetal position in the middle of my bed, Rachel wears the mask of a ravaged person. Somehow, I missed the signs: dark circles under her eyes, the clothes that once fit perfectly now hang, her skin so pale it\u2019s translucent.</p><p>Rachel told me she had attacks, that she ended up in the hospital once, and that she hides them from her family. I never thought to ask if she was concealing them from me.</p><p>Her eyes press tightly in her sleep, and she flinches as she swallows. I wish she\u2019d sleep deeply, but she doesn\u2019t. Staying restless, Rachel turns her head. I tuck the blanket back around her, whispering for her to rest.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d Abby says softly from the doorway. \u201cEveryone\u2019s here.\u201d</p> <p>I nod and Abby slips behind the door. Everyone being here would be Noah\u2019s doing, not mine. He found us\u2014me cradling a broken Rachel in my arms\u2014and drove us home. Took everything I had not to rush Rachel into the E.R., but she made me promise not to. I\u2019ve never considered going back on my word as much as I do right now.</p><p>The world is stacked against Rachel and me. The money is due this weekend. We\u2019re down a car and we aren\u2019t even close to the amount. Rachel\u2019s body is worn, her spirit drowning. If we don\u2019t pay off this debt, a nightmare will visit us both. Eric will come after me and he\u2019ll hurt her. My fingers ball into a fist. I\u2019ll die before I let that happen.</p><p>A rustle of sheets, then soft fingers glide against mine. I glance at Rachel and meet glazed-over blue eyes. The spark is gone, taking the violet hue along with it.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d I ask, and focus on not demanding why the hell she\u2019s kept all this from me. We\u2019ll have the conversation, but not in this moment.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says in a hoarse, cracked voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, not wanting her apology. \u201cMe, too.\u201d I lace my fingers with hers. \u201cWhy did you run from me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw you hug Beth,\u201d she croaks.</p><p>\u201cI love you. Not anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. My head got messed up. I was worried about you and we had a fight and I didn\u2019t know if you were alive and when I saw you two together...\u201d Rachel lets the words trail off. \u201cBeth\u2019s strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d I snap, then close my eyes to rein in my temper. I suck in a breath before reopening them. \u201cI do think that. Most girls I know would be lying under a bed in the fetal position after living a day with Eric on their backs. You\u2019ve stood strong the entire time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept now.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shaking my head again. \u201cEveryone has a breaking point, and I\u2019d lay odds this isn\u2019t Eric.\u201d But I won\u2019t go near a conversation about her family. \u201cYour body may need a break, but your spirit is still strong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI bet this wouldn\u2019t happen to Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t, because Beth always ran.\u201d</p><p>Rachel blinks.</p><p>\u201cBeth was always a runner. She may have stood in place, but she always hid behind the wall she built, and if that didn\u2019t work, she ran to a guy, to drugs, to anywhere other than where she should have been, to forget. You and Beth\u2014you\u2019re night and day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you really think that then let me race Zach.\u201d Her voice breaks, leaving her only able to whisper. \u201cLet me bet the seven hundred and race him. I\u2019d do it without you, but he already said that he won\u2019t race me without your permission because he doesn\u2019t want to mess with you.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in my jaw contract. \u201cIs that all he said?\u201d</p><p>She winces. \u201cHe\u2019d also race me if I broke up with you. But ignore that. Isaiah, we\u2019re already in trouble. If I win, then we try to double the fourteen hundred, and then we try to double again. Let me help dig us out of this hole.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s so pale I can see the veins beneath her skin. She could win. Rachel\u2019s been practicing. Stolen moments between us in abandoned parking lots. All she lacked was experience and confidence. My angel has both now. Even with her body defying her, she\u2019s a force of nature.</p><p>But what if the race Zach\u2019s offering isn\u2019t innocent? What if his association with Eric drags her in deeper? Not able to see the angle he\u2019s playing, I can\u2019t take the risk.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s waiting on me,\u201d I say as a cop-out. \u201cLet me talk to them.\u201d</p><p>She casts her eyes down. \u201cWe won\u2019t work if you never trust me to be strong enough.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her forehead. \u201cIt has nothing to do with trust or strength.\u201d But with keeping her safe. \u201cRest. You can\u2019t do anything if you don\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>I close the door to the bedroom behind me and freeze when I assess the room. All eyes fall on me. Echo and Abby lean against the kitchen counter. Noah stands near the couch. Ryan and Beth sit next to Logan, who has his bum leg propped on the old coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were out,\u201d I say to Logan. \u201cAnd you were with your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad works third shift,\u201d he replies. \u201cHe asked Ryan to take me home. I\u2019m out of driving. Doesn\u2019t mean my mind stopped working.\u201d</p><p>Ryan snorts. \u201cThat\u2019s up for debate.\u201d I throw him a questioning glare, and he earns a little respect when he doesn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cBeth and Logan see something in you,\u201d he says. \u201cBut know if you hurt either one of them again, I\u2019ll kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. \u201cNoted. But good luck with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that the pissing contest is over,\u201d says Abby, \u201chow\u2019s Rachel?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. Rachel wouldn\u2019t want her business discussed.</p><p>\u201cAbby and I told them everything,\u201d Logan says, unrepentant. \u201cIn detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t your place.\u201d Embarrassment thinly disguised as anger seeps into my tone.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t, but I did it anyhow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI borrowed two thousand dollars from my brothers\u2019 parents.\u201d Noah jumps in, possibly to stop my anger at Logan from accelerating. Noah\u2019s a proud guy, and that type of gesture had to kill his soul. \u201cTo cover rent for the semester. I hoped to buy us enough time until you got a job where you could support yourself. The money is yours.\u201d</p><p>An understanding passes between us. If I accept the money, Noah moves into the dorms and I return to foster care. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than half,\u201d says Logan. \u201cWe still have that seven hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, twenty-seven hundred, but we\u2019re still short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got five hundred saved to buy a car,\u201d says Beth. She winks at Ryan. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to drive me around longer.\u201d</p><p>Before I can tell her no Logan says, \u201cThirty-two hundred.\u201d</p><p>Noah stretches his arms out to his sides. \u201cAnd we race for the rest.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve entered the land of fantasy. \u201cWith what? Your piece of shit couldn\u2019t beat a Yugo.\u201d</p><p>Echo crosses the room and curls around Noah. \u201cNo, but I bet a \u201965 \u2019Vette could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Echo.\u201d The Corvette belonged to her brother. It\u2019s the only memory she has left of him. \u201cThe car is vintage and worth more than my sorry ass. Racing it could burn out the engine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould,\u201d she says. \u201cBut Noah would win first. We can always fix the car. You\u2019ve done it before.\u201d</p><p>No. I shift my gaze to Noah. \u201cEric will find out that you helped. He\u2019ll mark both you and Echo.\u201d</p><p>A dangerous shadow crosses Noah\u2019s face as he holds Echo tighter. \u201cI can take care of what\u2019s mine. Besides, Eric will back off once he\u2019s paid.\u201d</p><p>He may not be wary of Eric, but I am. I\u2019m not sure I can allow the target on his back. I glance at the clock on the microwave. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get Rachel home in time for curfew. I\u2019ll drive her car, but I need someone to follow to bring me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d says Abby.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a car,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI told Tom about the accident. He\u2019s going to let you use one of his cars until you get your Mustang working again. I\u2019ll get it, then meet you at Rachel\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Abby leaves and a second later I follow. She stalls near the front entrance, waiting for me to join her. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, Isaiah, and I think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>I place my hand over the door handle, keeping her there. \u201cWhat exactly am I thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same thing I think when I look in the mirror every morning\u2014that\u2019s the face of someone living in pissed-off desperation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few weeks ago you wanted me to steal. A thousand dollars a car. I could make the money in one night and have Rachel on my arm by morning, remember?\u201d</p><p>Abby rubs her hands over her face. \u201cThat was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I met Rachel. Before she became my friend. Before I saw how happy she made you. Before I saw that you could be like Noah and get out of this part of town. You got your certification, a job waiting after graduation and a girl who loves you. If you steal those cars...\u201d She stares at her feet. \u201cIt\u2019ll change you. Once you go down that road, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>Abby hates selling drugs, but she\u2019s stuck. Her family has seen to that. So has her employer. \u201cI\u2019ll be in and then right back out,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYeah, keep telling yourself that. You\u2019ll be owned. Not as bad as if Eric owns you, but they\u2019ll always hold what you\u2019ve done over your head. You\u2019ll never be free.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not free. The future I once dreamed of has crumbled into dust. \u201cI don\u2019t care about my freedom anymore. This is about Rachel.\u201d</p><p>The door upstairs opens and closes. Rachel appears at the top of the stairs. I\u2019ve got thirty-two hundred in seed money and only one night to race. If I take everyone up on their offer, I\u2019ll go back to foster care and Noah and Echo will have targets painted on their backs. I would be wreaking all this damage in the hope I can win at the dragway.</p><p>Rachel holds tightly to the banister. Yeah, Abby\u2019s employer will own me, but Rachel will be safe. \u201cMake the deal, Abby.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 66</p><p>Rachel</p><p>ISAIAH PARKS MY CAR A block from the security gate of my neighborhood. Headlights flash behind us as Abby follows his lead. Her lights turn off, indicating that she\u2019s granting us time.</p><p>We\u2019ve been silent\u2014Isaiah and I. Not that silence is unusual between us, but it\u2019s never been so heavy. We\u2019re both angry, hurt. I\u2019ll admit to being scared. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make the money, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric will be paid off this weekend,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happened tonight, the panic attack, that\u2019s been going on for a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The unspoken accusation that I\u2019ve lied to him slices like a knife. I rest my head on the back of the seat. \u201cHow are we coming up with the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou vomited blood,\u201d he says, ignoring me. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about anything until we discuss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou vomited blood,\u201d he repeats.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel...you need help.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and it\u2019s the same bitter laugh I remember him giving when we met so many weeks ago. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Isaiah says it so simply that my heart soars and sinks at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper. \u201cDid you ever think that loving someone could hurt so bad?\u201d</p> <p>Isaiah shakes his head and stares out the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to us?\u201d I ask. Because I don\u2019t know how the two of us can continue forward. Isaiah refuses to let me in. It\u2019s sort of cruel. He\u2019s brought me close with his stories of his childhood and with his words of love, but he can\u2019t relinquish control. I refuse to be with someone who won\u2019t treat me as an equal.</p><p>Isaiah clears his throat. \u201cI failed the ASE.\u201d</p><p>Dread washes over me. \u201cYou said you passed....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey accused me of cheating so they failed me. Once Pro Performance finds out, I\u2019ll lose the internship and the job. I have nothing left to offer you.\u201d</p><p>I grow numb as my mind races to understand. \u201cWhy would they think you cheated? I mean, there\u2019s no way you would, so why would anyone else think it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. You can retake it. Prove to them that you know everything about cars.\u201d</p><p>His hands hover over the wheel as if he wants to hit it, but he doesn\u2019t. Instead he slowly lowers his palms to the leather covering. \u201cIt\u2019s over. The certification. The job. The hope we could pay Eric off by racing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to race Zach.\u201d It\u2019s the only way. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need your permission to do it.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah slams his hand against the steering wheel and I flinch. \u201cWith what, Rachel? Our seven hundred? Let\u2019s say you win, we\u2019re still down over three thousand dollars. We tried and we failed. Playing by the rules is no longer an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll take on more races. I\u2019ll race Zach more than once. He said money wasn\u2019t a problem\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s betting Eric\u2019s money.\u201d</p><p>My face whips as if I\u2019ve been smacked. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cZach\u2019s working for Eric.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a disorientation like I\u2019m having an out-of-body experience. He\u2019s known this and he hasn\u2019t told me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to steal cars to make the money to pay Eric.\u201d There\u2019s no mistaking the determination in his voice or the set of his jaw. He\u2019s made his decision, and nothing I can say will change his mind. I open the door to the car.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d Isaiah pleads.</p><p>I pause, long enough to give him the opportunity to apologize for keeping the secret. To tell me that I misheard about stealing the cars.</p><p>\u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t the case, we\u2019d need to race Friday and Saturday night. Are you going to walk away from your mom\u2019s charity event to race? Just give me time to fix this and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d I snap. When Isaiah says nothing, I point at his door. \u201cGet out of my car.\u201d</p><p>With a click of the handle he does, and he meets me in front of the hood. Without looking at him, I reach into my coat, extract his lighter and hold it out to him.</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s forehead wrinkles as he looks away. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one doing this.\u201d I hold my palm out, waiting for my keys. Isaiah\u2019s hand covers mine. The keys feel frozen against my skin and the lighter is gone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it to protect you,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d I whisper to the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it to protect yourself. You never really let me in, did you?\u201d</p><p>His hand falls away and I slide behind the wheel. Isaiah stands off to the side and I drive home without looking back. Isaiah says he\u2019s protecting me. My brothers and father say the same thing about my mom. For the first time in my life, I wonder if my mother wants to be protected.</p><p>It\u2019s supposed to be used as a windowless conference room, but Mom fashioned it into her command center. The ballroom across the hall is decorated with thousands of mini pink roses and shimmering crystals. Dressed in their best gowns and tuxes, hundreds of people nibble on hors d\u2019oeuvres. There will be a salad, followed by a choice of fish or steak, and during the cheesecake dessert, I\u2019ll stand and tell everyone how much I loved Colleen. Then there will be dancing.</p><p>I\u2019ll excuse myself, with grace I hope, and spend the rest of the evening in the bathroom\u2014dying.</p><p>Taped to the mirror my mother brought in so the two of us could fix our hair and makeup is a picture of Colleen. Mom\u2019s right. Everyone\u2019s right. I resemble her. Long blond hair. Dark blue eyes. Even the smile. Except everything about me looks better on her.</p><p>I hate Colleen. Hate her. I\u2019ve never met her and I despise her.</p><p>How dare she be perfect and beautiful and everything everyone could have ever dreamed of in a sister and daughter. How dare she get sick and die and leave this entire family in shambles. How dare she haunt me from her grave, taunting me with how I will never be good enough.</p><p>I glance at my cell resting on the table. Like the first few days after I met Isaiah, I carry it around, hoping for a call or a text. I\u2019ve received neither. Abby and I talk. She says he\u2019s miserable, a bear to be around, and that he\u2019s stealing the cars tonight.</p><p>The deadline to pay Eric is midnight.</p><p>I don\u2019t want Isaiah to become a criminal. My heart thuds faster when I pick up the phone. The worst that will happen is that he doesn\u2019t respond. I\u2019ve already proved once that I can live through that. Me: :(</p><p>The door opens, and the sound of laughter and conversation drifts in with my mother. She\u2019s radiant in red, and she\u2019s complete happiness and smiles. My mother lost Colleen, but she\u2019s content living with the replacement who fakes every moment.</p><p>\u201cThe party is going beautifully. You should come out, Rachel. There are several nice-looking young men from school in attendance. Is Abby here yet?\u201d</p><p>Abby. I forgot. She told Mom she\u2019d come. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like your new phone?\u201d</p><p>I stare at the device in my hands. After I tossed my old phone at the top of the hill and left it in the rain while Isaiah and I sought shelter in his car, it stopped working. I told my parents I dropped it in the toilet. Dad purchased me something ostentatious. Too many bells. Too many whistles. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>My fingers brush over the screen, praying for his response. From out of the corner of my eye, I peer at my mother as she reapplies her lipstick. A sinking desperation claws at me. Isaiah\u2019s off becoming a criminal to save me when he was right. Too terrified of losing my mother\u2019s love and approval, I wouldn\u2019t have walked away from this event to race.</p><p>Mom slides her finger along the bottom of her lip to wipe off the excess makeup. She\u2019s perfection to a T, but she\u2019s never seen me. What type of love is that? Better, is that a love worth having? \u201cIf I needed money, would you give it to me?\u201d</p><p>The words fall out as if I\u2019m on autopilot, and maybe I am. I need five thousand dollars, Mom. I need to save the guy I love. Beside me, Mom pushes her hair into place. \u201cOf course. What do you need?\u201d</p><p>As I open my mouth, preparing to ask, the door opens, and the country club\u2019s manager steps in. \u201cMrs. Young, your presence is requested in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Mom pats my shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk after dinner.\u201d</p><p>After my speech. After Isaiah becomes a criminal. Before I can ask her to stay, she leaves. My phone vibrates and my finger trembles as I awaken the screen.</p><p>Isaiah: Don\u2019t b. I love u.</p><p>Me: Please don\u2019t do it.</p><p>Isaiah: I have no choice.</p><p>The clock ticks time away and each second that passes feels like a step toward death row. Outside of that door looms either West or Ethan. Neither of them will permit me to leave. I have two choices. Give the speech and have the attack or tell the truth and disappoint my family.</p><p>Isaiah said I need help. Maybe he\u2019s right. Maybe I do.</p><p>Me: I\u2019ll get help if you do. I\u2019ll let my family in on my nightmare if you let me help you. You have to decide. Now.</p><p>I will my phone to ring; pray for it to vibrate. Too much time passes and there\u2019s a knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d Ethan says with sad eyes. \u201cMom said that it\u2019s time for us to be seated for dinner.\u201d</p><p>And after the dinner will be the speech. I rest the phone on the table and gather the skirt of my dress. Ethan places a hand on my back as I walk past him. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Rach. I swear. Just breathe through the speech, and West and I will get you out unnoticed. We\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>I say nothing. I\u2019m tired of being protected.</p><p>Chapter 67</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT CARS ARE stolen in the dead of night, while the entire world sleeps. While that may be true, there are simpler ways. Later tonight, if it comes down to it, I\u2019ll become the clich\u00e9. Otherwise, I\u2019m opting for easy.</p><p>I stand in the shadows of the alley outside a liquor store waiting for the moron who hates cold weather yet yearns for a drink. Someone will abandon their car with it still running. Since it\u2019s early in the evening, I have the time to wait.</p><p>Rachel\u2019s text weighs on me. I\u2019ll get help if you do. I\u2019ll let my family in on my nightmare if you let me help you. You have to decide. Now.</p><p>For four days, Rachel and I have ignored each other, and when she breaks the silence she offers an ultimatum that cracks open my heart. Help her or protect her. Rachel needs help or she\u2019ll end up in the hospital. But I have to steal the cars to protect her. She doesn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Rachel\u2019s wrong on this. She said I never let her in. My head falls back against the cold brick of the building. I told her things I never told anyone. Yet her words have become a mantra in my mind...you never let me in.</p><p>I inhale, trying to erase the thoughts. I\u2019ve got a job to do and distractions can cause danger. A Saturn pulls into the lot right as a pizza delivery guy walks out of the store. The Saturn owner emerges from his car and my heart pumps strongly. The motor still runs as he closes the door to his empty car.</p><p>The delivery guy asks, \u201cDo you know Elmont?\u201d</p><p>My head jerks back\u2014that\u2019s my mom\u2019s street.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d says the driver. \u201cIt\u2019s the side street to the right.\u201d</p><p>They say a few more things and the delivery guy takes off and the other man enters the store. My eyes trail after the delivery guy.</p><p>Protection\u2014Mom used the same word with me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my mom,\u201d I told Rachel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see her when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, I\u2019m ready now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If it is at all possible, the house is smaller than Shirley and Dale\u2019s. It\u2019s a shotgun house, meaning it shoots straight back. The living room is first, the next room is typically the bedroom, followed by a makeshift bathroom and kitchen.</p><p>On an uneven sidewalk, I assess the house with my thumbs hitched in my pocket. Behind a bedraggled lace curtain, a dim light shines and the flashing of a blue screen indicates a television. The crumbling front stoop shelves an old mason jar full of cigarette butts and a small green ceramic frog. Mom liked frogs.</p><p>The metal screen door rattles as I knock. The floor creaks on the other side. There\u2019s hesitation for what I assume is a glance through the peephole, and the door swings open.</p><p>Mom\u2019s eyes are wide and color touches her cheeks. She\u2019s dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. The same big hoop earrings move when she tucks her short dark hair behind her ears. \u201cIsaiah. Come on in.\u201d</p> <p>Her living room consists of a couch, end tables, a recliner and a television. She\u2019s been out for two years so she\u2019s had time to collect. \u201cCan you come out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She steps into the cool night with bare feet, leaving the wooden door open. From the living room, the final round of Jeopardy begins.</p><p>Mom retrieves the pack of Marlboro Lights and a lighter from behind the glass jar. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, and Mom sits on the step of the stoop. She pulls out a cigarette and flicks the flint of the lighter three times, curses and jiggles the lighter before trying again. Growing impatient, I yank my lighter out of my pocket and light the cigarette for her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbles. After a long draw and even longer exhale she says, \u201cI don\u2019t have money to give you. I live on a tight budget, but I\u2019ll have something next week.\u201d</p> <p>Jesus Christ. The weight of what I\u2019ve done forces me to sit next to her. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in your money.\u201d Not anymore.</p><p>She taps the ashes to the ground. \u201cI named you after a person in the Bible. Isaiah\u2014a prophet of God. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandpa, my dad, was a reverend.\u201d She inhales a long draw from the cigarette, leaving a path of red ashes. \u201cHe died three years ago.\u201d Mom dangles the cigarette. \u201cLung cancer. My mom died a few months later. Probably from a broken heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say. It feels weird to hear I had family. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them not to take you.\u201d</p> <p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cThey agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says. \u201cThey did, but it killed them. Me, Momma and Daddy were prideful to the point it hurt.\u201d She sucks away the rest of the cigarette and smashes it against the concrete. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had something you needed to say, and I think I\u2019m ready for you to say it.\u201d</p><p>She slides the broken lighter in her hands. \u201cFunny. I seemed hell-bent on saying it until now.\u201d Mom has a soft Southern accent. Not normal for someone raised in Florida.</p><p>\u201cDid you grow up in Florida?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She tilts her head as she looks at me and almost smiles. \u201cYou remember?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and lie. \u201cI remember the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was raised a few counties south of here in a town with one stoplight. When I was sixteen Daddy took a new job in Florida and I ran away to be with the guy I loved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy dad?\u201d I ask before I can stop myself.</p><p>She stares at her painted toenails. \u201cSorry. No. Good thing, too. Turned out the bastard was married to a crack whore.\u201d</p><p>Taking another cigarette out, she gestures for my lighter. I refuse to give it to her, but I do light the cigarette for her again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re real protective of that,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI had a good home once.\u201d I return the lighter to my pocket. \u201cThe guy gave it and a compass to me before he and his family moved to California.\u201d The same guy who called me a dragon. The compass was for me to find my way. Both tattoos are for him.</p><p>She sighs. \u201cFor ten years, I thought about how I would explain this to you. I made up lie after lie, and when I got out, I couldn\u2019t face you. So I spent two more years trying to think of something else to tell you, and now that you\u2019re here I realize it\u2019s still not good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry the truth.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what it is anymore.\u201d Ashes drift into the breeze. \u201cI slept with a couple guys, Isaiah. Not knowing for sure who your dad was, I decided to raise you myself. Me and you did okay for a while. I had a job, but then I lost it.\u201d</p><p>The smoke from her mouth billows into a ball. \u201cI went home and asked for help. Daddy wanted me to repent in front of his congregation\u2014to tell them how I was a sinner. I thought that made you look like a sin, so I refused. I ripped you out of that house so fast that I had burn marks on my hands. I said I was protecting you. Daddy said I was stubborn.</p><p>\u201cWe came back here. We needed food. Money. So...\u201d She shrugs. \u201cDo you remember?\u201d</p><p>I do. \u201cI liked the houses that had cable.\u201d Mom broke into houses during the day with me by her side. Images of walking up long driveways and heading into backyards fills my mind. The sound of a window being slid open and the feel of the cool central air hitting my face as she pushed me in.</p><p>My heart would hammer as I walked through the silent house to open the back door for my mother. As she rummaged through the house, she\u2019d let me watch TV and eat whatever cookies she found in the kitchen. I thought it was great...until she got caught.</p><p>Mom stares at the night sky, searching for something. \u201cI often wondered what would have happened if I stayed and did as Daddy asked or if I had agreed to let them take you or if I let that one couple adopt you when you were ten.\u201d</p><p>My head jerks to glare at her. \u201cThey wanted me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She draws on the cigarette again. \u201cThey wanted you, but I didn\u2019t know how to let you go. Plus, I was worried if I made the wrong choice, again, you\u2019d end up in a bad home. I thought the state would protect you.\u201d Mom rubs her eyes. \u201cI thought I was protecting you.\u201d</p><p>Faint memories emerge of my then social worker asking me if I\u2019d like to stay with that family. At the time, I hadn\u2019t known she meant for good. \u201cI told the state I wanted to stay with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says. \u201cHe told me. Maybe they could have taken you without my consent. I don\u2019t know, but that guy wanted my blessing. How could I be sure you were making the right choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew what I wanted.\u201d I wanted to be with that family. With the man who called me a dragon. A man who believed I was more life than destruction. My mother ruined my shot at happiness because she couldn\u2019t let go. Because she had to control everything, even from prison.</p><p>Just like my need to control.</p><p>As if a lightning bolt ripped out of the sky and struck me, I jump off the stoop. Mom stands, anxious over my sudden movement. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I tear my cell phone out of my pocket and text Rachel: don\u2019t do the speech.</p><p>Seconds go by, maybe minutes. Nothing in return. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 68</p><p>Rachel</p><p>OUR ENTIRE FAMILY SITS AT a large round table. The waiters remove the remains of dinner and replace it with beautifully decorated pieces of cheesecake. Everyone claps as the last eloquent speaker, a doctor who specializes in leukemia, finishes his speech. Mom flashes me a smile as she slides out of her chair so she can introduce me.</p><p>I draw in air and release it, a continual action. I try not to obsess over how this is the longest speech I\u2019ve ever given in public or how this is the largest crowd I\u2019ve ever spoken to or how people will stare or how they\u2019ll laugh when they hear my trembling voice.</p><p>I try not to think about Isaiah stealing cars or Eric appearing on my doorstep tomorrow morning or how Gavin is antsy and how the news of his gambling addiction will affect our mother. I try to ignore the heat crawling up my neck and the way my stomach cramps. I try not to think about vomiting in public.</p><p>My hands ball in my lap and from under the table, Ethan grabs them. \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>My eyes hold his. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is wrong. You can\u2019t do this to yourself, and I shouldn\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing this for Mom,\u201d I whisper, as Mom starts to introduce me by explaining who Colleen was, because let\u2019s face it, my entire life is defined by her oldest daughter.</p><p>\u201cBut who\u2019s looking out for you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201c...my youngest daughter, Rachel Young.\u201d</p><p>People applaud at my name. I stand, and Ethan still clutches my hand. We stare at each other as he also straightens. He wraps his arms around me and I allow the embrace.</p><p>\u201cI forgot I was supposed to be your best friend,\u201d he says.</p><p>I hug him tightly. \u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>The applause continues and I leave my twin for the podium. Typically this time of year, Mom\u2019s so low, she can barely get out of bed, but this year, it\u2019s different. Her eyes shine as she kisses my cheek and the pride and love radiating from her creates a blanket of guilt over my skin. Who does that pride and love even belong to? It can\u2019t be for me.</p><p>On the podium, the speech Mom prepared is laid out\u2014typed and double-spaced. I brush the hair from my face and ignore my shaking hand as I lower the microphone. Silence spreads across the room. Occasionally someone coughs or there is a clink of a fork against china.</p><p>I concentrate on the words on the paper, not on the eyes on me. \u201cColleen was barely a teenager when she discovered she had leukemia...\u201d</p><p>My stomach aches and I shift my footing. I sip water and a man clears his throat. The crowd grows uncomfortable. I refocus on the speech and freeze on the next words...my sister.</p><p>Somewhere deep inside of me, this horrible emptiness folds in like a black hole.</p><p>My sister. I search the crowd...looking for Ethan. I have a brother\u2014a twin\u2014and I have older brothers, but I\u2019ve never known a sister.</p><p>People begin to whisper, and Ethan stands. He thinks I\u2019m on the verge of an attack. West joins him. I take a deep breath, and for the first time in my life in front of a crowd, I\u2019m able to breathe. \u201cI never met Colleen.\u201d</p><p>I cover the speech with my hands and focus instead on my two lifelines: Ethan and West. \u201cI have brothers. Lots of them.\u201d And people laugh, and that makes me almost smile.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have a sister. For weeks, I\u2019ve talked about how great Colleen was and about her beauty and strength, and the entire time I talk all I can think is how I sort of hate her because I can never be as awesome as her.\u201d</p><p>I swallow as my throat tightens. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t die then maybe she could have taught me all those things that I lack that she possessed\u2014like grace and compassion and how to be an extrovert. Maybe if she didn\u2019t die, then my parents and my oldest brothers wouldn\u2019t have spent so much of their lives living in the past. I used to think I hated Colleen, but I don\u2019t. I do hate cancer.\u201d I stop as my lips quiver. I hate cancer. So much.</p><p>\u201cI hate how it took someone wonderful and destroyed her. I hate how cancer ripped apart a family. I hate...I hate...that I would have never been born without her death. Cancer wasn\u2019t fair to Colleen. It wasn\u2019t fair to Mom and Dad. It wasn\u2019t fair to Gavin and Jack.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A tear escapes from the corner of my eye as I stare straight at my parents. \u201cAnd it sure wasn\u2019t fair to West, Ethan or me.\u201d</p><p>My mother places a hand over her mouth, and a sickening pain strangles my gut when I realize I spoke every thought I\u2019ve had since I can remember. My body shakes and I run a hand through my hair. What have I done?</p><p>A million eyes gawk at me. The back door to the room opens and I almost weep with relief: Isaiah.</p><p>Chapter 69</p> <p>Isaiah</p><p>THE ENTIRE ROOM TURNS AND stares. There\u2019s no doubt what they see\u2014ripped jeans, a black T-shirt, tattoos and earrings. I don\u2019t care what they see. All I care about is what she sees: a person unwelcomed or the guy she loves.</p><p>A tear flows down her face, and the hand wrapped at her waist tells me she\u2019s paralyzed. In a long gold ball gown that\u2019s more skirt than dress, Rachel is truly the angel I believe her to be. A man in a tuxedo stands. \u201cSon, I think you have the wrong room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d I stride between the tables, keeping my eyes locked with hers. The closer I get, the more she straightens. Her hand falls from her stomach, and the tear clears from her face. Rachel gazes at me as if I\u2019m a dream. I extend my hand, palm out. \u201cI need help.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes lose their glaze, and the hue of violet I love so much returns. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p> <p>My fingers tighten around hers and I gesture to the parking lot. \u201cIs your car here?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cGood,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause Zach will only race you in your Mustang.\u201d</p><p>The smile she flashed to me the first night we met brightens her face. \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 70</p><p>Rachel</p><p>WITH MY HAND IN HIS, Isaiah sets a blinding speed and I match it. People stand, unsure what to do. Confused and rapid conversation erupts around us. I should be freaked by the way they stare at me, but instead, I get hit with an adrenaline rush and I feel\u2014alive.</p> <p>In the hallway, I\u2019m desperate to keep pace, hoping to leave my family behind. I kick the heels off my feet, and Isaiah flashes a crazy grin. \u201cBlacktop\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t drive in heels. Besides, you can carry me.\u201d</p><p>I love how he laughs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need clothes,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cZach would pay double for you to race him in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call Abby and Echo once we get in the car. They\u2019ll find something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel!\u201d my father yells from down the hallway and I stop cold. The blood drains from my body.</p> <p>Isaiah rounds on me, concern clouding his eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my keys.\u201d</p><p>He yanks a key out of his pocket. \u201cHad one made. In case you lost yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel!\u201d My father slows and warily eyes us as Isaiah moves in front of me.</p><p>\u201cMy father won\u2019t hurt me,\u201d I whisper to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not him,\u201d he mutters. \u201cIt\u2019s your asshole brothers I\u2019ve got a problem with.\u201d</p><p>Taking his hand, I step by his side. Isaiah shoots me an unsaid warning.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I say with a mixture of complete fear and courage. \u201cThis is Isaiah.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah nods. My father gapes. Overall, the first introduction could have gone worse. One by one, my brothers join my father. Each one of them a different level of angry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>I turn my back to my family. \u201cGo get the car,\u201d I whisper to him.</p><p>Isaiah glares at my brothers. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you. Just do as I ask.\u201d</p><p>As if it physically hurts him, Isaiah walks out the door. I inhale deeply, hoping I made the right decision as I confront my family. With wide eyes and a hand on her dress, Mom slowly joins my father. \u201cWho was that, Rachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend,\u201d I say. \u201cHis name is Isaiah.\u201d</p><p>My father\u2019s skin becomes a strange shade of purple as he loosens his tie. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done tonight...with that boy...and that speech...\u201d</p><p>I cut him off. \u201cI only did what you and Mom asked. You wanted me to talk about Colleen, and I did.\u201d</p><p>His anger grows, as does the level of his voice. \u201cThat was an embarrassment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the truth!\u201d I scream.</p><p>My father blinks and my mother tilts her head. She peers at me as if looking at someone she\u2019s never seen before. Maybe she is, because the person in front of them is me: the Rachel I\u2019ve hidden for years. I grab Mom\u2019s hands, squeezing, begging for her to see. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>\u201cLook at me!\u201d I scream. \u201cI\u2019m not Colleen. I\u2019m not even a bad replica. I\u2019m Rachel. I hate purple and I hate malls and I hate shopping and I hate being a disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you learned to like...\u201d And she closes her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBecause you wanted to believe.\u201d I snatch my hands away and point at my brothers. \u201cAt least look at them. Two of them want nothing more than for you to love them, and the other two spend their entire lives trying to be perfect. Meanwhile all of us are screwed-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel.\u201d My father\u2019s tone drops to a mixture of sad and tired. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not now?\u201d My skirt swirls as I face him. \u201cHave you ever thought that you created this? If you had given Mom an ounce of respect and treated her as an equal instead of like a child, that she would have found a way to get over her grief?\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s eyes flit between me and Dad. \u201cWhat is she talking about?\u201d</p><p>I glare at Gavin, waiting for him to confess. Instead he lowers his head and leans his back against the wall. Disgusted, I stare at Mom. \u201cThey do the same thing to me that they do to you\u2014protect. But I don\u2019t need their protection. I\u2019m strong and I have a feeling you\u2019re strong, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still has panic attacks,\u201d says West. \u201cI know you think you\u2019re strong on your own, Rach, but you need us.\u201d</p><p>My heart hurts as West and I stare at each other. Lines worry his forehead and the hurt that I see\u2014is it possible that all his concern, his worry, his overprotection...could it be that he really just needs me to need him?</p><p>Mom\u2019s face becomes blank and pale as if she\u2019s going to pass out. \u201cWhy would you lie about being over them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d I say with way too much anger and then force myself to calm down. \u201cBecause the real me made you sad, and when I changed you became happy. You wanted me to like shopping, so I did. You didn\u2019t want me to like cars, so I hid it. My panic attacks made you cry, so I lied.\u201d</p><p>The rumbling sound of my Mustang echoes behind me. I slowly back away from them and toward the door. \u201cI\u2019m done making this family happy.\u201d</p><p>West and Jack begin to move in my direction and I realize I won\u2019t make it.</p><p>\u201cRach!\u201d Ethan yells, waving them off. They give him space as he grabs my arm. I jerk, but he subtly shakes his head. Ethan shoves my small purse into my hand and abruptly opens the door. \u201cYou owe me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 71</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>AT THE DRAGWAY, I PARK Rachel\u2019s Mustang next to Echo\u2019s \u201965 Corvette and smile when I hear the sharp intake of air from Rachel.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Either forgetting or not caring she has no shoes, Rachel plops out of the car in full ball gown and heads for the \u2019Vette. \u201cAre those the original fenders?\u201d</p><p>Standing next to each other, Echo and Noah laugh. Echo answers, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Completely floored the owner of such a classic doesn\u2019t know the answer, Rachel turns to me. I sweep her up into my arms, hating that she\u2019s barefoot on gravel, and she squeals when I do it. \u201cThe car belonged to Echo\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, remembering how I explained that he died.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rethinking that double date,\u201d says Noah. \u201cOne car freak is enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough,\u201d I tell him. I nuzzle the top of Rachel\u2019s head, inhaling her sweet ocean scent. Part of me is higher than I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. She chose me and I chose her. Nothing will stop us. \u201cEcho, do you have clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She shows a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. \u201cThey\u2019re mine so they\u2019ll be a bit too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I brought shoes.\u201d Abby magically appears beside Echo. She gives Rachel the pair Abby most often wears, and I set Rachel down. With a quick peck to my lips, Rachel goes off to change.</p><p>\u201cDo you have the money?\u201d I ask Noah.</p><p>He hands me an envelope and it feels heavy. This is how much it cost me to be free from the system. \u201cYou really did have my back,\u201d I say to him.</p><p>Noah shifts so that his hair hides his eyes. \u201cI would do anything for you or Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, man. I\u2019ve been a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you have.\u201d He smiles and so do I.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got two hours until this place closes.\u201d I take the rest of our money and slip it into the envelope. Thumbing through the cash, I realize there\u2019s more here than there should be, even with the money Beth put up. \u201cI thought you said you only borrowed two thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d says Noah. \u201cAbby said she chose a side. We need to win nine hundred.\u201d</p><p>The girls come out of the bathroom. Rachel drags the dress along with her. \u201cWe could use this thing as a parachute.\u201d</p><p>I stare at Abby as she walks by, and my never-ending gaze makes her squirm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cPissing Eric off is fun. Besides, it was your money to begin with.\u201d</p><p>No, she did it because she and I are friends.</p><p>\u201cI got us races.\u201d Noah leans on the driver\u2019s-side door of the Corvette. \u201cSince you were taking your time winning the girl.\u201d</p><p>Over the loudspeaker, the announcer calls the next set of races. I look at Noah and nod with my chin. \u201cMount up.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 72</p><p>Rachel</p><p>THE DRAGSTERS\u2019 ENGINES SCREAM INTO the night. From the top row of the bleachers, Eric looks down on me, waiting. Our money is due to him by midnight. We\u2019re twenty minutes away and five hundred short.</p><p>Standing next to the bleachers, I watch from a distance as Echo and Abby wait for Noah and Isaiah to bring her Corvette back around to the side. The engine burned at the line, costing Noah the race and Echo her car.</p><p>I suck in my bottom lip as I glance at Echo again. It was her brother\u2019s car. The only piece she has left of her best friend that died in Afghanistan. I think of Gavin, Jack, Ethan and West. Right now, I\u2019m mad at them and they\u2019re mad at me, but it would kill me if they died.</p><p>And I cost Echo his car.</p><p>Loose rocks roll on the blacktop and Zach appears at my side. \u201cI hear you\u2019re finally taking the race against me.\u201d</p><p>I nod. Isaiah didn\u2019t have to tell me that we\u2019re down to desperate. \u201cWhat happens if I lose?\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s eyes shoot up behind me, and I don\u2019t have to follow his gaze to know that he\u2019s looking at Eric. Shoving his hands in his pockets, Zach steps closer to me and whispers, \u201cDon\u2019t take this race.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ironic how Isaiah had tried to warn me away from racing on that first night we met, but I don\u2019t regret a single decision. Because I stuck around, I fell in love with him. \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice. Now tell me what happens if I lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do have a choice,\u201d he pleads. \u201cI thought I did, too, but I don\u2019t now. I have to win and I will. I\u2019ve seen you race before. You don\u2019t have it in you to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I lose, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll own you. He\u2019ll own Isaiah. Details don\u2019t matter at that point.\u201d</p> <p>I suck in air and slowly release it. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the line.\u201d</p><p>Noah and Isaiah push the Corvette into a vacant spot and when they pop the hood they both curse as smoke billows out. I wander to stand beside Echo and Abby. Echo\u2019s finger taps anxiously against her arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell her. To see something that means so much to her fall apart is heart-wrenching. Knowing that Isaiah and I are responsible is devastating.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d she says. \u201cNoah lost two hundred because the \u2019Vette broke down at the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcho...\u201d How do I say this so she doesn\u2019t deck me, because she obviously doesn\u2019t know. \u201cFixing the engine on a \u201965 Corvette is going to cost a lot more than two hundred dollars.\u201d</p> <p>Echo rips her gaze from the car. \u201cWe have forever to fix the car. We\u2019ve got twenty minutes to come up with five hundred. You and Isaiah are more important than any car.\u201d</p><p>Abby elbows me. \u201cShocking, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t get is how this guy knows we\u2019re here.\u201d Echo looks over at Eric, who seems all too happy with the turn of events.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s Satan,\u201d says Abby.</p><p>With his shoulders hunched over, as if preparing to tell a loved one the news of a death, Isaiah slowly strides over. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Echo. I swear to you, I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Isaiah. I knew what I was getting into.\u201d</p> <p>His heavy storm-cloud eyes glance at me. \u201cWe\u2019re short.\u201d Isaiah draws me into him. \u201cThis scares the shit out of me, angel.\u201d</p><p>I place a slow kiss against his cheek and a longer one against his lips. \u201cI won\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>At least I pray I won\u2019t. The confidence I\u2019m exuding on the outside doesn\u2019t exist on the inside. Isaiah worked hard to prohibit this race, but in the end, couldn\u2019t stop it. It\u2019s on me to save the two of us.</p><p>The loss of control, the fact he can\u2019t protect me in this moment, wages war on his face. \u201cIf you lose this race, you don\u2019t stop the car. You keep driving. This time you go to the police. You tell them everything. You get someone to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>His hands weave into my hair. \u201cPlease, Rachel. I\u2019m trying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEcho will get Rachel out,\u201d says Noah. \u201cRachel, I\u2019ll stay by his side.\u201d</p><p>I go to protest, but the grumble of Zach\u2019s engine interrupts. Isaiah places an arm around my waist to tuck me close. Zach yells over his engine, \u201cWhat\u2019s the bet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFive hundred,\u201d answers Isaiah. \u201cAbby\u2019s holding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think I\u2019ll watch Abby.\u201d In his half strut, Eric slinks over with a few guys from the night I street raced with him.</p><p>\u201cPole dancers are down the street,\u201d says Abby in a bored voice. \u201cAnd if I let you watch, I\u2019d cost more.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for his retort, Abby walks over and shows Zach our five hundred. He motions to Eric, and Eric produces a wad of cash that he holds between the slits of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not neutral,\u201d Eric replies.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a jackass. Public place, Eric, and think about whose territory you\u2019re standing in. I believe at the moment I outrank you.\u201d</p><p>Eric bends his elbow to hand her the cash. She collects and counts. Once she nods to Isaiah, he crushes his lips to mine. It\u2019s a fast kiss, yet intense. Hands warm on my face, on my back. His lips moving rapidly, with such desire that when I go to catch my breath he pulls away. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah opens the door to my Mustang, finds his helmet, flips my hair behind my ear and straps the helmet on my head. Behind me, Noah edges the fire-retardant jacket onto my arms.</p><p>Isaiah speaks at such a fast pace I can barely keep up. \u201cIf the car makes any funny sounds, does anything strange, you brake, do you understand me? Don\u2019t try to win the race. Don\u2019t floor the gas. That\u2019s when the wrecks happen. Listen to your instincts. Anything weird, you hit the brake.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve watched Isaiah put the jacket and helmet on dozens of times, and each time my heart ached with the thought of what would happen if the car wrecked. My eyes widen as I see the sweat breaking out on his forehead. \u201cThe fire extinguisher is under the passenger seat. If the car crashes, you get out. If you can\u2019t, you grab the extinguisher, and I swear I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a nitrous system in the car,\u201d I remind him blankly.</p><p>His fingers pause on the zipper. \u201cEven without it, this is dangerous.\u201d A pause. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to back out. I swear to God I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her about the torque,\u201d says Noah as Isaiah zips up my jacket.</p><p>\u201cI know what torque is,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cNot this, angel.\u201d Isaiah secures the straps to the jacket and double-checks the helmet. \u201cYou\u2019ve played with the car in parking lots, learning how to go for the light, but I\u2019ve put enough torque and horsepower in your pony that she\u2019s going to kick up on you. Nothing like those bad boys with the million-dollar engines, but she\u2019ll ride up. It\u2019s a good thing. She\u2019ll come back down. Don\u2019t fight her, Rachel. Just let her run.\u201d</p><p>In the driver\u2019s seat, I numbly reach for the seat belt until Isaiah leans in. His hands quickly maneuver around the five-point harness he installed for racing. \u201cCan you see?\u201d</p><p>One hand grips the steering wheel, the other the stick shift. The harness has me locked tight to the chair. \u201cYeah.\u201d And then I start to think. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to see the lines.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah squeezes my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you through it.\u201d</p><p>He closes the door and I start my pony. I rev the engine a couple of times because I need the calmness associated with her singing. Taking a deep breath, I shift into First and follow Isaiah to the starting line.</p><p>My entire life I tried to be all girl with bows and painted nails, but feeling my baby purr beneath me, knowing that I\u2019m about to push her\u2014I feel very alive.</p><p>Curling his fingers as a sign to continue or using his palm as a stop, Isaiah guides me around the water to avoid a burnout and slowly edges me to the staging area. I hit the first light and Isaiah throws his hand to a stop. My heart pounds in my chest. I\u2019m going to drag race.</p><p>The smell of rubber hangs in the air as Zach completes his burnout. The roar of his engine grows as his car joins mine. Isaiah nods at me as he walks away. This is it. This is me on my own. Zach creeps forward, his second staging light hit. Once I hit the second line, I\u2019ll have seconds before the race starts.</p><p>I inhale deeply and tap on the gas. My second light flashes on. In rapid succession, the yellow lights count down...three...two...one...</p><p>My foot falls off the clutch as the other rams on the gas, a perfect coordination of shifting and moving. The engine roars as my body presses into the seat. Adrenaline shoots through my veins as the front wheels pop up and slam back onto the dragway. The same gravitational forces that pulled me back push me forward.</p><p>Becoming one with the car, I shift with her sounds, letting her rip, letting her run. And in seconds, I pass the finish line, laughing, soaring like a bird in flight.</p><p>I just won.</p><p>Chapter 73</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>RACHEL BARELY PARKS HER MUSTANG when I open the door and undo the harness. She yanks the helmet off and shakes her blond hair into a mess that only makes me want to touch her more. I slip her out of the car.</p><p>She laughs as she knots her arms around my neck. Both of my arms are steel bands on her waist as I lift her feet off the ground. From this angle, she\u2019s higher than me and I have to tilt my head up to meet her lips.</p><p>Rachel sends hot shivers down my spine as her hands caress my neck and cheek. Her lips move smoothly against mine. She\u2019s drawing me in by conjuring up images of being alone with her, and forcing me to forget that we have an audience. Until Noah coughs.</p><p>Her eyes have a contagious gleam. \u201cI want to do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make scaring the shit out of me a habit, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her lips whisper against mine as she speaks. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t do a thing to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d As much as it kills me. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d I reluctantly set Rachel on the ground. Abby extends the thousand dollars to me and I put it in the envelope.</p><p>\u201cMind taking a walk with me, Noah?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s end this,\u201d he says.</p><p>Eric leans against the fence line on the other side of the lot. His boys loiter a few feet down, and they keep their eyes on us.</p><p>Echo places her hand on Rachel\u2019s arm. \u201cShould you really leave your car here?\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s violet eyes stay trained on me. \u201cNo. But it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel.\u201d Echo gently nudges. \u201cLet\u2019s move your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, angel. We won this one.\u201d</p><p>With reluctance, Rachel slides back into the driver\u2019s seat of her car, and Echo slips into the other side. Rachel drives off, and Abby starts off after them on foot.</p><p>\u201cTake care of her,\u201d I call out.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Abby says without looking back.</p><p>The envelope feels heavy in my hand. Not long ago, I went to Eric so I could stay out of foster care. Now I\u2019m handing him five thousand dollars, and I\u2019m still losing my home.</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019ll keep his word?\u201d I mutter to Noah.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers. \u201cIt\u2019s not his style to lose.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not. \u201cI\u2019ve told Abby to get Rachel and Echo the hell out of here the moment the first punch is thrown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is killing Echo, but she knows what to do and will help Abby get Rachel out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>Noah flashes the same jackass-crazy grin as the day he moved into Shirley and Dale\u2019s. \u201cYeah, bro, I do. This is what brothers do for each other.\u201d</p><p>Brother. Years without a mom. Years without a dad. Knowing that no other blood relative existed on the face of the planet for me. But within two years, water becomes thicker than blood.</p><p>I hold my hand out to Noah and when he has a firm grip, I pull him in for a fast hug. We both clap each other\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re family,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>\u201cFamily,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>I let him go and we start off for the fence line. Eric watches us approach. He says nothing so I offer him the envelope. \u201cCount it if you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The skinny asshole doesn\u2019t bother opening it, but instead shoves it in the inside pocket of his coat. \u201cYou say you have it, you have it.\u201d</p><p>A pair of cars roar down the dragway, silencing the conversation between us. When the noise dies down, Eric continues, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you want to race here. There\u2019s no money to be made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to involve Zach,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI like insurance policies, and Zach was one that didn\u2019t pay out...at least for tonight. As with any policy, the interest builds with time.\u201d</p> <p>I assess the area and notice Zach\u2019s car missing. He\u2019s caused me problems over the past several weeks, but once he was a friend. No one should be underneath Eric, and what I hate is there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Zach made his choice and I\u2019ve made mine. This is how forks in roads are created.</p><p>\u201cCome back to the streets, Isaiah.\u201d Eric pushes off the fence. \u201cThat\u2019s your home.\u201d</p><p>If Eric keeps living this life, someone will steal from him again, and one day, they may take his life in the process. Mistakes I refuse to make. \u201cNaw, Eric. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever say never, my brother.\u201d Eric gives that sly grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll find me when you\u2019re short on money again. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll stop this bullshit and you work for me. You\u2019re not the first foster kid to age out of the system.\u201d</p><p>My chin rises as he speaks my fears. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ll come crawling to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m letting you and your girl go home injury-free. You\u2019ll remember how I\u2019ve given you grace and realize that I\u2019m not your enemy. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got other business to attend to tonight.\u201d</p><p>Noah smacks my shoulder and the two of us leave, both occasionally glancing back. But we don\u2019t need to. Eric\u2019s moved on and so have we.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen,\u201d says Noah. \u201cYou\u2019ll make it after you age out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I don\u2019t, but I shove the doubt away. I can only handle one battle at a time.</p><p>Laughter representing our futures guides us to a streetlight. For Noah, the future includes a redhead, and mine includes a blonde.</p><p>When Rachel sees me, she runs right into my arms. \u201cAre we free?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this place,\u201d I say real slow. \u201cOn a hill.\u201d</p><p>She blushes. \u201cThink I\u2019ve heard of it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d I ask too innocently.</p><p>\u201cYeah. From this really hot guy. You\u2019d like him. He has a couple of tattoos and some earrings.\u201d</p><p>I lace my hand with hers, but the smile on my face fades with the sound of one voice.</p><p>Chapter 74</p> <p>Rachel</p><p>\u201cRACHEL.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps in the direction of my father\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>With his black tie off and the top couple of buttons of his wrinkled dress shirt undone, my father appears worn. The circles under his eyes indicate exhaustion. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no way...none... \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour new phone. It has a GPS tracking device.\u201d My own thoughts haunt me\u2014too many bells, too many whistles.</p><p>Isaiah squeezes my hand. He subtly moves one shoulder in front of me, and I realize he senses danger. My eyes search for what alarms Isaiah and my mouth goes dry. A police officer strolls up to my father.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Dad?\u201d</p><p>He places his hands on his hips. \u201cI want you to come home.\u201d</p><p>The police officer talks into his shoulder unit and gestures to Isaiah. \u201cSir, we need you to step away from the young lady.\u201d</p><p>I hold tight on to Isaiah. \u201cWhy did you bring the police?\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s lip pulls back. \u201cHe abducted you.\u201d</p><p>Abducted? \u201cI left with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunning away is just as bad. You created chaos and left your mother and me wondering if we\u2019d ever see you again! How can you do this to her?\u201d Dad turns his head to the police officer. \u201cShe\u2019s seventeen. He either took my daughter or this is a runaway situation. I have an entire ballroom of people who can testify to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t running away!\u201d Dad is twisting everything, and no matter what I say, no one will believe us.</p><p>\u201cArrest him,\u201d Dad snaps. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Rachel. We\u2019re going home before your mother sinks too low because she thinks she\u2019s losing another daughter.\u201d</p><p>What I feared from my brothers is now happening with my father. He\u2019s separating me and Isaiah. \u201cPlease. We haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>Not true. We\u2019ve done lots of things wrong, but for the first time in weeks, we have the chance to do something right.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d says the police officer with more force. His hand moves to his belt and my heart trips in my chest. \u201cStep away from the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Isaiah in a voice so cold I shiver.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a minor,\u201d Dad reminds Isaiah. \u201cAnd has no business being here or with you.\u201d</p><p>Noah approaches from the side with his hands in the air to show he\u2019s peaceful. \u201cSir, Isaiah\u2019s only seventeen. Officer, if you\u2019re arresting him, I\u2019d like to know the charge.\u201d</p><p>The officer glances at my father. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>Agitation leaks into my father\u2019s tone, and his jaw jumps. \u201cI don\u2019t know how old he is. He came into a party and took my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left with him,\u201d I hiss. \u201cHe didn\u2019t kidnap me and we weren\u2019t running away. I was coming home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see some ID,\u201d says the officer. \u201cThen we\u2019ll start to sort this out, but you should go home with your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d Noah interjects in an overly calm voice. \u201cShow the man your ID. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep away from the girl first.\u201d The officer\u2019s hand twitches on his belt. \u201cAnd slowly take out your ID. Everyone can go home if we do this right.\u201d</p><p>Still grasping me, Isaiah slowly removes his wallet and tosses it in the direction of the police officer. \u201cAnd no. I don\u2019t have a record.\u201d</p><p>The way they both stare at him, I know what they see: the tattoos and earrings and every worst nightmare. But Isaiah is nothing like that. He\u2019s gentle and kind and strong... My body starts to quake and it\u2019s not a panic attack. It\u2019s my heart\u2014breaking and ripping into shreds. \u201cIsaiah.\u201d</p><p>Isaiah\u2019s silver eyes have turned to ice. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Rachel. Won\u2019t it?\u201d He nods at my father.</p><p>Dad all but sneers. If I had introduced them properly, would my father have given him a chance? \u201cYou either come with me peacefully or I have this police officer physically put you in the car. Your choice, but this entire fiasco you\u2019ve created is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck who you are,\u201d says Isaiah in a low tone that indicates the threat is very real. \u201cNo one touches her.\u201d</p><p>Off to the side, Noah lets loose a string of profanities. \u201cGo with them, Rachel. Otherwise Isaiah will give them a reason to put him in jail. We\u2019ll work it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re afraid of them,\u201d Isaiah whispers. \u201cI won\u2019t let you go if you\u2019re afraid of them.\u201d</p><p>I glance at my father\u2014years older than he was this afternoon. The way he rubs his eyes shows the worry mixed with the anger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared of him.\u201d I edge so that I stand beside Isaiah. \u201cI\u2019m scared of losing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay goodbye to him.\u201d Dad barely keeps his voice low as he glares at Isaiah. \u201cDo not come looking for my daughter again. Contacting her in any way is out of the question.\u201d</p><p>My arms go around Isaiah\u2019s waist and my eyes immediately flash to his, searching for a solution. Isaiah always has a way to fix things, and too panicked to think, I\u2019m desperate for help. \u201cIsaiah?\u201d</p><p>Isaiah touches my face. The same warm, loving caress he\u2019s tenderly given me since I first met him. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>My hand covers his. \u201cPromise me.\u201d Because Isaiah always keeps his word. He\u2019ll move hell if he has to. Isaiah never breaks a promise.</p><p>\u201cI swear it.\u201d</p><p>The trembling turns to shaking. I can\u2019t lose Isaiah. We just found the place where the world could be good. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it like that.\u201d Isaiah lowers his head so that his mouth is near mine. \u201cDon\u2019t say it like goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel!\u201d my father snaps.</p><p>My lips touch his and I try so hard to memorize how they feel: warm and a bit sweet. I don\u2019t want to forget this, ever. When I force myself to step back, my eyesight is so blurry that I can barely see in front of me. Isaiah shoves his hands in his pockets and shifts. Knowing he has to let me go\u2014commanding his body to comply. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I promise. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019ll be okay. I repeat the words over and over again. He promised. Isaiah never breaks his promise.</p><p>As I get closer to my father, he extends his hands. \u201cGive me your keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t drive a stick,\u201d I choke out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you anymore.\u201d</p><p>Staring at Isaiah, I suddenly wish I had taken more pictures of us. I only have two. One of him I took for my phone. Another of us being silly next to my car. Two pictures. It doesn\u2019t feel like nearly enough.</p><p>Feeling the loss, I snap a mental picture of Isaiah. His dark hair shaved close to his scalp, the stubble on his chin, the muscles of his arms, the kind tilt of his lips, even though his gorgeous eyes tell me that he\u2019s in pain.</p><p>I reach into my pocket and hand my father my keys. The policeman offers Isaiah his wallet back and mumbles something to him. Isaiah locks his eyes on me, never once responding to the officer.</p><p>\u201cGet in the car,\u201d Dad says as he opens the passenger-side door to my Mustang.</p><p>I do, wondering if I\u2019ll ever see Isaiah again. Not so long ago, I asked Isaiah if he ever thought love could hurt so bad. Little did I know, at the time, I had no idea what I was asking or how awful saying goodbye would really feel.</p><p>I slip inside, and the passenger side feels off and unnatural. Dad slams his door and thrusts the keys into the ignition. \u201cI have never been so disappointed in anyone in my life.\u201d</p><p>His cell phone begins to ring, and Dad yanks it from his pocket. With one glance, he drops it into the drink holder. It\u2019s a familiar number\u2014a work number. One he typically picks up immediately. I never thought I\u2019d see the day when his anger would surpass the love he has for his job.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whisper, and wipe my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d he bites out, so forcefully that I shake.</p><p>My hand slams over my mouth to stop the sob. My throat begins to close as I desperately search for a way to explain. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I love him.\u201d</p><p>His cell ceases ringing and seconds later begins again. The same number, but this time it feels louder in the small confines of the car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re too young to understand what love is! He\u2019s a thug. A user. Look where you are! Look at what you\u2019ve done to your mother! What the hell are you even doing here?\u201d</p><p>Dad presses the clutch and the gas while trying to shift and the engine completely stalls out. \u201cDad...you need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d he yells, and the pure fury shooting from his eyes shuts me up. Again the cells stops then starts all over again.</p><p>In the rearview mirror I watch as Abby eases toward Isaiah. I\u2019m losing the two people I love the most. Dad tries again and the engine roars to life. He successfully shifts the car into First, and I close my eyes as he grinds the gears.</p> <p>\u201cJust let me drive. I\u2019ll take us home, I swear.\u201d No matter how I try to stop them, the hot tears in my eyes overflow down my cheeks. \u201cYou can\u2019t drive a stick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ruined today.\u201d Dad ignores me completely. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your mother sick. This isn\u2019t what I expect from you.\u201d</p><p>The cell stops and when it begins again, Dad reaches for it. \u201cGoddammit!\u201d</p><p>The light at the entrance of the dragway begins to change, and my eyes dart between the cell against his ear, the light and my father\u2019s inexperienced hand off the gearshift. \u201cDad, I don\u2019t think you should\u2014\u201d</p><p>I suck in a breath at the sound of the horn, and all I see is the grill of a semi. \u201cDad!\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 75</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>I SLIP MY WALLET INTO my back pocket and watch as her father murders the clutch. The ache in my chest is enough to kill me, but I hold on to the words I said to her: I swear we\u2019ll be together. Rachel knows I\u2019ll never break my word. This love between us\u2014it will never stop.</p><p>Noah places a hand on my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd she loves me. She\u2019ll be eighteen in less than a year. Graduate in less than a year and a half.\u201d Then no one can keep us apart.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have me.\u201d Abby appears on my other side. \u201cMaybe my cover will work, and I can keep you connected. You never know.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t say it like she believes it.</p> <p>Abby stares after Rachel as if she lost her best friend. I place an arm around her. That\u2019s because she did. \u201cWe\u2019ll get her back.\u201d I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m trying to convince her or me.</p><p>She wipes at her eyes. \u201cThis is why I don\u2019t do relationships.\u201d</p><p>At the intersection leading out of the dragway, the police officer turns right. The brake lights release as the Mustang rolls forward on a yellow and a tightness overwhelms my throat. The sensation that I dread, the tingling between my skin and muscles, crawls over me. I release Abby and take several steps. Terrified that if I lose sight of Rachel, I\u2019ll lose her forever.</p><p>The light switches to red and the Mustang stalls in the middle of the intersection. I hear the attempt to turn over the engine, and my feet move faster as I watch the tractor trailer move into the intersection\u2014speeding. My world goes into slow motion as my legs pump hard to reach the car, to protect Rachel.</p><p>There\u2019s a sickening crunch and the white pony flips onto its side and rolls again and again. Like a ball hurling down a hill. From the other direction another car hits, and I scream out Rachel\u2019s name. Brakes screech, glass shatters, more cars collide. The carnage lies in front of me as her car comes to a rest. The entire body smashed beyond recognition.</p><p>Buzzing fills my head as I continue to scream her name. I push my body harder, faster, but I can\u2019t reach her. A few wisps of smoke puff from the hood.</p><p>And then fire.</p><p>I jump onto the hood of a sandwiched Civic. \u201cRachel!\u201d</p> <p>People are crying. Others screaming. Glass falls to the pavement. \u201cRachel! Answer me!\u201d</p><p>The windshield of her car is a spiderweb, allowing me no visual access. Noah joins me on the hood of the Civic, and both of us use our arms as shields when a burst of flame shoots in our direction. Heat warms my arms. My eyes flicker, hunting for her exit. She\u2019s wedged in. Both doors blocked by other vehicles. \u201cRachel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe gotta move this car,\u201d Noah shouts.</p><p>Her car is on fire. The thought races in my head. We slide off the hood and run to the back end of the Honda Civic. \u201cPick it up.\u201d</p><p>The driver of the Civic joins us. Blood stains his cheek. \u201cIt happened so fast.\u201d</p><p>Noah and I say nothing to him as we raise the back end with our bare hands. We both yell as the end lifts. My fingers scream in agony, but we keep going until we create a space. The Civic slams back on the ground. The gap isn\u2019t much, but enough to wedge through. I cough as I inhale smoke and open the driver\u2019s-side door. Blood soaks her father\u2019s white shirt, but his eyes are open and he blinks. Beyond him, Rachel lies completely broken.</p><p>\u201cGet her out,\u201d her father coughs. \u201cShe\u2019s not responding.\u201d</p><p>Panicked adrenaline surges through my body. She can\u2019t be dead. She can\u2019t. \u201cNoah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull him out!\u201d Noah says on top of the Civic. \u201cHand him to me.\u201d</p><p>I squat down, in order to get a better grip. \u201cCan you stand?\u201d</p><p>He tries to move and groans instead. \u201cGet her out!\u201d</p><p>Smoke rises from the dashboard, and my heart rate increases. Using my shoulder, I lean into her father and yank him out of the car. He yells in pain and screams again when Noah pulls him up. The second his body is off me, I dash into the car.</p><p>\u201cRachel.\u201d I say her name calmly, hoping she\u2019ll answer. \u201cAngel, I need you to open your eyes. Come on. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>I place my arm behind her back and the other beneath her legs. She flops like a rag doll. \u201cYou\u2019re not fucking doing this, Rachel. I made a promise, and that means you made a promise to me. We\u2019re going to be together. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I tug and Rachel\u2019s body jerks back toward her seat in response. Readjusting my grip, I yank harder, and her body resists. My lungs burn from the smoke, and I wave at the air, trying to see the problem.</p><p>My hand reaches to the floorboard, exploring, and the world halts. I swear. No, no, no, no. The floorboard collapsed up and the side smashed in, metal twists around her legs. I cradle her sweet face in my hands and talk to her as if she can hear me. My voice breaks. \u201cYour legs are stuck, angel. Your legs are stuck.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to lose her. Please no, I\u2019m going to lose her.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah!\u201d yells Noah. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out! Get out, get out, get out!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 76</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>May</p><p>I SPENT A GOOD PORTION of my life trying to figure out where I would get my next meal or how to avoid physical pain. In other words\u2014how to survive. I never had a reason to contemplate death\u2014too busy worrying about living.</p><p>Standing in this cemetery, it\u2019s hard not to think about the end of life. Noah told me that his parents are buried in the section across from here. Echo\u2019s brother\u2019s final resting place is on the other side of the massive graveyard. No one is immune to mortality.</p><p>A light misty rain makes the warm spring day humid, causing my shirt to stick to my skin. I stay motionless, staring at the plot. There\u2019s a heaviness inside of me that could produce tears. But I push it away. I\u2019ve got too many emotions running rampant.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I ask.</p><p>My mother squats and touches the tombstone. \u201cYes. I knew he was your father the moment you walked into that visitation room. You look exactly like him, Isaiah.\u201d She glances at me with a weak smile and glassy eyes. \u201cHe was handsome, too.\u201d</p><p>My father. Unable to stand anymore, I sit on the wet grass. James McKinley. \u201cI\u2019m Irish?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI guess. We never discussed family trees. He was a good guy. Decent. He died before I knew I was pregnant. So I crossed him off the list of possible fathers. Once again, a stupid mistake on my part.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re not close\u2014me and Mom. She wants to bond. I\u2019m okay with knowing she\u2019s alive. She pressures me for more, but I tell her she should be happy that the anger I feel for her is receding. Too much time passed between six and seventeen. Too many hurts. Sometimes it\u2019s best to forgive someone and keep them at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>\u201cJames had a big family. A little odd, but great people. I wish I had known then that you belonged to him. They would have taken us both in.\u201d She goes silent. \u201cOr at least you. You should find them.\u201d</p><p>I scratch the back of my head. Somewhere in Kentucky, I have a big family. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go through a paternity test.\u201d And be proved wrong.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say they wouldn\u2019t ask for one, but one look at you and they\u2019d know. You\u2019re all him. Right down to the earrings and tattoos.\u201d</p><p>The thought makes me smile. \u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>She laughs again. \u201cHe would have said that, too. James was good to me. We were friends, and I got stupid and took advantage of him. I never forgave myself for hurting him, and I feel awful that he never knew you existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCar accident.\u201d She stares at the tombstone as if he\u2019d appear if she focused hard enough.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me about him?\u201d</p><p>Mom relaxes back on her bottom. The rain mats her dark hair against her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know much, but I\u2019ll tell you everything I do know. James loved motorcycles...\u201d</p><p>At the McDonald\u2019s across the street from the cemetery, I wait in a corner booth. Courtney slips me a container of vanilla ice cream before sitting across from me with her own. She opens her purse and produces a bottle of multicolored sprinkles. She shakes some on hers and pours a whole shitload on mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cBuying you ice cream.\u201d Courtney drops the bottle into her purse and digs into her soft serve. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that at eight you didn\u2019t wish someone would have bought you ice cream with sprinkles.\u201d</p><p>Courtney can do this now. Extract a memory buried within me with scary ease. There are times I think she\u2019s a mind reader, then I remember she\u2019s not. She was a foster kid, raised by the system, just like me. A pang in my chest makes me think of being eight and watching families buy ice cream. Courtney smiles when I take a bite.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like you ratted by becoming a social worker?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She\u2019s silent as her forehead furrows. \u201cI choose to think about how I can help other kids in ways no one helped me.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough.</p><p>\u201cYou and your mom talked a lot today.\u201d Courtney observed us from her dry car.</p><p>\u201cMet my dad.\u201d So to speak.</p><p>\u201cSort of figured. How are things going with her?\u201d</p><p>I shovel the ice cream in my mouth so I don\u2019t have to answer. My eyes narrow at the way the sweet sprinkles roll on my tongue. Courtney giggles. \u201cBy the way, gummy worms on ice cream are way overrated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d I mix the ice cream. \u201cI can\u2019t give her what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d she says. \u201cI never said a relationship with her is healthy, just that you should talk to her. From experience, you eventually would have had an ache to see your mom. I thought it would be better to deal with her while you\u2019ve got me to buy you ice cream afterward.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou should have told me when we first met you were system-produced.\u201d</p><p>She squishes her lips together. \u201cI was once pissed-off-seventeen.

I nudge the ice cream away and relax back in my seat. Lately, I feel like I\u2019ve been drifting. I\u2019m back in foster care at Shirley and Dale\u2019s. Noah lives in the dorms. We still talk, but not nearly as often. There are times I feel...alone.</p><p>\u201cI know people who have families,\u201d I say. \u201cThey graduate from high school and they get a job or go to college and if they fuck it all up they go back home.\u201d I pause, tapping my finger on the table. \u201cWhat do I do if...\u201d I fuck it all up. I clear my throat and my eyebrows move closer together. \u201cWhere do I go?\u201d</p><p>Courtney shoves her ice cream away, too. \u201cFoster care sucks, but so does aging out. It\u2019s weird. You spend the entire first part of your life fighting to get out and then one day...you are out. Then you want to scream at the closed door that you\u2019re still a kid, but everyone is pretty damned insistent you\u2019re an adult. I cried a lot when I first aged out.\u201d</p><p>My lips quirk. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be crying.\u201d</p><p>Courtney snorts. \u201cOr whatever boys do.\u201d</p> <p>I swallow and find the courage to say the words. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be homeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be.\u201d She waggles her eyebrows and pulls a folder out of her bag. \u201cI have a plan. You don\u2019t turn eighteen until this summer, so we have a couple more months before you age out. I can teach you how to budget and help you find a place to live and all sorts of fun adult things. And here\u2019s the cool part. I\u2019ll still be around when you turn eighteen. I may not be mandatory, but I don\u2019t disappear.\u201d</p><p>The alarm on my phone rings, and Courtney smiles, knowing why I\u2019m ready to bolt. \u201cWe\u2019ll start this next week.\u201d</p><p>I stand. \u201cThanks. For everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. And next week we\u2019re getting hot fudge.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 77</p> <p>Rachel</p><p>I DREAM A LOT. FOR the past three months, I\u2019ve been sleeping more than I\u2019m awake. Between surgeries, hospital stays, pain meds and rehab, I always seem tired.</p><p>I see Isaiah in my dreams. Giving that rare smile. Laughing that deep chuckle. Every now and then, I dream of his kiss. Those are my favorites.</p><p>Someone whispers and I open my eyes. The specialist appointment wore me out physically. My therapy appointment with my counselor knocked me out mentally. I stretch my arms on the bed and hear crinkling to the side. I turn my head and see a Mustang magazine with a note:</p><p>Tell me which one you want. I love you\u2014Dad.</p><p>My fingers brush the note before I toss the magazine onto my bedside table. I don\u2019t want to think about cars, not yet.</p><p>\u201cTold you she wasn\u2019t ready,\u201d whispers a deep voice from across the room.</p><p>Propping up on my elbows, I lift my upper body. West and Ethan sit on the floor, both with controllers in their hands. Their eyes locked on the video game they play with no sound on my flat screen. The two of them practically moved in here when I came home from the hospital. Most of the time, I don\u2019t mind the company.</p> <p>Ethan glances over his shoulder at me. \u201cFinally.\u201d He tosses the controller on the floor, and West follows his lead.</p><p>\u201cField trip, baby sis,\u201d says West. He flips his hat so that it\u2019s backward.</p><p>I flop back on the bed. \u201cI\u2019ve got rehab in two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going now,\u201d Ethan says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be too tired later. How do you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a question I\u2019m used to, and one they\u2019ve learned to ask. It\u2019s been weird between my family and me. My entire life I never wanted to be the family weakling, and now there\u2019s absolutely no doubt that I\u2019m the physically weakest one under the roof. The casts are off, but both of my legs are in a full brace.</p><p>While it\u2019s apparent to anyone that I can\u2019t run as far as my brothers or dance like my mom, what can\u2019t be seen by the naked eye is the real miracle. It was hard to ask for help at first. I made everything a million times harder by my need to do it all myself, and it was a zillion times harder for my family not to do things for me. But I learned to ask. And they learned not to jump in. And so my weakness has made me stronger.</p><p>\u201cLet me swing my legs off the bed.\u201d</p><p>My brothers both take two steps back and watch as I use my upper-body strength to readjust myself so that my legs are near the edge. My face goes red and my teeth clench, but inch by fought-after inch, both of my legs hover over the side.</p><p>I release enough air to move the hair hanging in my face. The small smile tugs at my lips. I did it. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab her wheelchair,\u201d says Ethan as he slips his arms around me and lifts me into the air. West goes out the door of my bedroom first, and Ethan follows. The workmen in what used to be Colleen\u2019s room stare at me, then at my legs, before returning to installing the custom-made shelves and desk. Mom is being paid to fundraise now and announced she deserved an office.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs, West sets up my chair, and Ethan settles me in the seat. They gesture for me to follow and I do. Down the hall, through the kitchen, down the ramp, and I pause when they head to the unconnected garage. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to go anyplace.\u201d</p><p>West walks backward. \u201cCome on, slowpoke. You got wheels, use them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an ass.\u201d</p><p>West smacks Ethan\u2019s arm. \u201cShe called me an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an ass.\u201d Ethan opens the garage door.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but she called me an ass.\u201d</p><p>I blink when I roll into the garage. There\u2019s a contraption with a plank of wood covered by a cushion. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d West stands next to it and shoves his hands into his pockets with straight arms. \u201cIt\u2019ll help you navigate the car.\u201d</p><p>I raise a questioning eyebrow, and West holds out his arms. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>I nod, and West lifts me from the chair and places me on the cushion. He motions to two cranks and begins to turn one. \u201cThis one moves you up.\u201d</p><p>Surprised by the momentum into the air, I flinch and grab the sides. He continues to turn the crank until I\u2019m level with the open hood of his SUV. \u201cAnd this one will bring you closer.\u201d</p><p>The plank extends forward and for the first time in three months, I can touch the inside of a car. As if it\u2019s a dream, I sweep my fingers across the engine. Even from this position, I won\u2019t be able to do much, but it\u2019s better than doing nothing.</p><p>Feeling a little speechless, I pop open my mouth and say the mundane. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWest built it for you,\u201d says Ethan.</p><p>West sheepishly raises a shoulder. \u201cEthan helped. Besides, who else is going to change my oil?\u201d</p><p>A wetness invades my eyes. I\u2019m touched that they would invest time and energy into something for me...not just anything...they created something to help me return to what I love.</p><p>\u201cDad wants to get you a new car,\u201d says Ethan.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d But that part is more complicated. I won\u2019t lie. It hurts that I won\u2019t be able to drive\u2014for a very long time.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d says West. \u201cWasn\u2019t joking on the oil change. Tell me what to do and me and Moron will do it.\u201d</p><p>An adrenaline rush tickles my bloodstream. \u201cGet me that rolling board and help me down. I\u2019m going under the car.\u201d</p><p>Gloriously covered in grease and oil, I sit on the top of West\u2019s contraption and hover over West as he tries to figure out the oil filter. \u201cThis isn\u2019t rocket science.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the car genius,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>A clearing of a throat grabs our attention and we all pause when we see Mom in the garage door frame.</p><p>West and Ethan share a guilty glance. \u201cMom,\u201d Ethan says. \u201cWe were just about to bring her back to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you boys give Rachel and me a second?\u201d</p><p>West wiggles his grimy hands in front of my face and wipes one particularly greasy finger across my cheek. Ethan squeezes my wrist before he leaves. I readjust myself and lean over to inspect West\u2019s work. Not too bad.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s dressed in a pair of gray dress pants and a blue sweater. Dad took me to my appointments this morning while Mom visited Gavin in rehab. Because of the accident, my father\u2019s original plan for Gavin and rehab tanked. But a few weeks ago, Gavin finally entered treatment. \u201cHow\u2019s Gavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. He\u2019s worried about you.\u201d Mom peers into the hood. \u201cYour father said your appointments went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d It feels odd being here with Mom after lying about my love of cars for so long.</p><p>Mom looks at me. She does this now\u2014actually stares at me with her blue eyes and sees me. Not being used to it, I always glance away. Mom tucks a wayward strand of hair over my shoulder. \u201cGavin and I had a group-therapy appointment today. He promised to not keep secrets like his addiction from me anymore. I thought about it on the way home. I think I want a promise like that from all of you. Secrets have come too close to ruining this family.\u201d</p><p>I pick at my flaking thumbnail. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you about Gavin.\u201d</p><p>Mom shifts her weight. \u201cI care that you didn\u2019t tell me about you.\u201d</p><p>Confrontation has never been a strong suit for either of us, and I wonder if the silence is killing her like it\u2019s killing me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to hear it. You wanted me to be Colleen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel\u2014\u201d</p><p>Preferring not to hear her deny it, I stare straight into her eyes. \u201cI spent a good portion of my life overhearing you tell people that you dreamed of me becoming like Colleen. It\u2019s true, so please don\u2019t pretend it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Mom touches her wedding ring and turns the band. \u201cI wish I could tell you that you weren\u2019t the replacement, but we\u2019d both know that would be a lie. Regardless of what you think, I have always loved you.\u201d</p><p>I fidget with the tools my brothers left on the board. Over the past three months, Mom and I have danced around this issue. \u201cYou loved her more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d says Mom. \u201cBut I do miss her. Too much. I\u2019ve thought about it and think there\u2019s some truth to what you said that night. I loved you, but I don\u2019t think I ever saw you. For that I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d And it is.</p><p>\u201cIn my defense, you never gave me the chance to know you.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to protest, and she waves it away. \u201cRachel, the problem in this family is that no one gave me credit. Instead of changing to make me happy, do you ever wonder what would have happened if you had told me what I was missing?\u201d</p><p>And I snap my mouth shut. Part of me thinks I could have screamed until I was blue in the face, but there\u2019s another part that wonders what would have happened if I had truly tried. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on here?\u201d Mom leans over the engine like it might bite her and I realize that she\u2019s trying.</p><p>\u201cI was teaching West how to change his oil filter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could teach you.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth contorts. \u201cHow about you explain and I\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a start. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 78</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>THE FRONT DOOR OPENS, AND I come face-to-face with Rachel\u2019s father. Strands of gray highlight the area near his ears. He looks older than that night at the dragway, but in truth, I probably look older, too. Sleeping in hospital waiting room chairs does that to a person. He and I got to know each other real well during those periods that Rachel had surgery or slept.</p> <p>Her father refused to leave her side when he wasn\u2019t at work. The same was said for me when I wasn\u2019t at work or at school. Turns out we have the same business hours.</p><p>\u201cCome on in, Isaiah.\u201d</p><p>I step into the massive front hall and, like always, I\u2019m still amazed that people live like this. \u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous,\u201d he says, and from the way he rubs his head I can tell he is, too. Rachel relearns how to walk today.</p><p>Mr. Young\u2019s eyes flicker to the spot a few centimeters below the tiger tattooed on my biceps. I carry a burn mark from when I saved him and his daughter three months before. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the dragway required me to carry a fire extinguisher during a race, Rachel may have died. And me along with her\u2014because I never would have left that car without her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve discussed what you proposed with Rachel\u2019s mother, and we both agree it would be good for Rachel to get out. But we\u2019re going to start slow. An hour and a half.\u201d</p> <p>An hour and a half\u2014alone\u2014with Rachel. I feel like a man stepping out into daylight after years of incarceration. \u201cI swear I won\u2019t be a minute late.\u201d</p><p>Her father wears a knowing smile. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t be, or it\u2019ll be another few months before you step out of this house with her again.\u201d Mr. Young accepts me with the condition that I follow their rules. For Rachel, I\u2019d shovel coal into the furnace in hell.</p><p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d her mom calls from the living room. \u201cShe won\u2019t start without you.\u201d</p><p>Her mother turned their massive once-formal living room into their personal rehab clinic. My heart stutters when I see Rachel perched in her wheelchair. Her golden hair is pulled back into a ponytail and she wears a T-shirt and a pair of shorts. Gone are the casts on her legs, and in their place are large, full-length, black braces.</p><p>Her face brightens when she sees me. \u201cIsaiah!\u201d</p><p>Every time I enter this house she has the same reaction. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve held her hand in the hospital, sat with her after the multiple surgeries and have supported her during every rehab session. I made a promise to Rachel, and I\u2019m never breaking it.</p><p>As I walk over to her, her physical therapist, an ex-football player and one hell of a big son of a bitch, steps in front of me. \u201cNaw, you don\u2019t get to be beside her today.\u201d</p><p>Big or not, I\u2019ll take on any asshole keeping her from me. \u201cWant to rethink that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsaiah,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cThis is my decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re learning to walk today,\u201d I say, as if she doesn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The casual way she replies causes my hands to twitch.</p><p>\u201cBut you could fall.\u201d</p><p>Rachel narrows her eyes. \u201cI know, and you need to be okay with that.\u201d</p><p>I release a long stream of air. Right. It all goes back to the same conversation\u2014I\u2019ve got to let Rachel make her own way, even if it means watching her stumble.</p><p>\u201cI need you here, son.\u201d Her therapist indicates for me to stand at the end of two wooden parallel bars. \u201cRachel, if you want to see your boy, then you\u2019re going to have to work for it.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps and rustling by the door catches my attention. One by one, except for Gavin, her brothers walk in, followed by her parents. Rachel doesn\u2019t look at them. Those gorgeous violet eyes stay on me. Without help, Rachel uses the bars to lift herself out of the chair.</p><p>At my end, I grip the bars in a mirroring position, as if I could send her my strength. It took her weeks to grow strong enough to stand. It\u2019ll take her weeks, if not longer, to walk again. Her physical therapist stays behind her in case she should lose her balance. \u201cOkay, Rachel. You see what you want. Go get it.\u201d</p><p>The right side of Rachel\u2019s mouth tips up as a blush touches her cheeks. My heart pounds as I pray she doesn\u2019t fall with her first try. I force a smile. \u201cI\u2019m waiting, angel.\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019s always been a miracle, Rachel lifts her leg and takes her first step.</p><p>Chapter 79</p><p>Rachel</p><p>WITH A HIP COCKED AGAINST the door frame of my bathroom, Abby watches as I wrap one last strand of my hair around the curling iron. She showed halfway through my therapy appointment. As always, she just walked in, not announcing herself to anyone, and stayed in the shadows until I saw her lurking.</p><p>It\u2019s weird, but it\u2019s Abby.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re doing all this. You could show up in a garbage bag, and Isaiah would still think you\u2019re pretty.\u201d</p><p>I release the strand from the iron and a hot curl bounces on my neck. \u201cIt\u2019s our first official date. As in Dad knows and Mom knows and everyone\u2019s okay with it.\u201d</p><p>Pretty much okay with it. Mom and Dad are still a little hesitant about Isaiah, but they understand him better. He\u2019s been shockingly open with them about his past, his present and his intentions with me. While I was in the hospital, he told them everything about Eric and the debt.</p><p>I don\u2019t think what swayed them was his honesty as much as his devotion to me. Besides school and work, and he even skipped that some, Isaiah never left my side.</p><p>\u201cWill your mom take pictures since it\u2019s your first official date even though they know you\u2019ve stayed the night with him?\u201d</p><p>I cringe. Isaiah was a little too honest with them. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be in the pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I move my wheelchair to the left so that I can get a better glimpse of myself in the full-length mirror behind me. Mascara. I need mascara. As if hearing my thoughts, Abby hands me the mascara from my cosmetic bag.</p><p>\u201cCan we take one of just me and you?\u201d</p><p>I meet Abby\u2019s eyes and she looks away. That was very un-Abby to do. \u201cYeah. I think I\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Abby glances over her shoulder into my room. \u201cEthan alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard that, freak.\u201d Ethan leans past Abby to poke his head in to see me. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much small talk Tattoo Boy and I are capable of, so get moving.\u201d</p><p>I sigh as I finish stroking on the mascara. While West and Isaiah have come to a surprising compromise, Ethan\u2019s not entirely sold on my relationship with Isaiah. I have faith that will change with time.</p><p>Abby examines my brother in a very not-best-friend way. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...hi.\u201d Ethan blinks as if he\u2019s a fish that just realized he was hooked on a line. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter now that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I stifle the giggle when Ethan\u2019s cheeks turn red. \u201cAh...Mom asked if you\u2019re staying for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteaks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount me in.\u201d Mom\u2019s oddly adopted Abby. No one\u2019s asked outright, but they all seem to understand that she\u2019s not private-school Abby, and while they observe her as if she\u2019s a science experiment about to explode, they generally seem to like her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be here,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>She flashes a smile that promises all sorts of trouble at my brother. \u201cBut Ethan will be.\u201d</p><p>Ethan clears his throat. \u201cSeriously, are you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I say quickly to save him from Abby. My best friend loves to make guys squirm. God help any man that falls for her, because they\u2019re going to need all the help they can get to keep up with her.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d Ethan swings me up and carries me down to Isaiah.</p><p>Chapter 80</p><p>Isaiah</p><p>IN THE BACKSEAT OF AN \u201989 Mustang I bought off of Craigslist for two hundred dollars, Rachel gasps for air, and my lips trail down her neck. We both breathe hard, and our hands are everywhere we can possibly touch. Her legs rest across the bench seat as I cradle her in my lap. We were given an hour and a half and we\u2019ve spent forty minutes of it kissing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be getting you food,\u201d I whisper in her ear.</p><p>Her hand squeezes my neck, bringing my lips to hers. \u201cI can always eat.\u201d</p><p>For three months, I\u2019ve dreamed of having her in my arms again. Rachel is the kind of girl that requires a wait, and she is definitely worth waiting for. My cell chimes, and Rachel moans as she snuggles her head in the crook of my neck. \u201cIt can\u2019t be time to go home yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s getting close.\u201d Hand-holding and the occasional quick, chaste kiss is all I\u2019m allowed to do under Rachel\u2019s family\u2019s ever-present gaze. Recently, we\u2019ve been promoted to a hug. I hold her tighter, my hands sliding up and down her back. \u201cI was thinking that we could buy some land and build our shop and home there. That way we\u2019re never apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut don\u2019t you think business will be better in the city?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll be so good that people will flock to us just from our reputation.\u201d</p><p>Rachel kisses my jaw, sending shivers along my spine. She cuddles into me. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>My heartbeats become lighter and happier. She\u2019s alive and loves me. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She sighs, showing some heaviness. \u201cI miss driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I wish I could tell her when she\u2019ll be able to do it again. I sit up straighter as the thought washes over me. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I gently help her back into the passenger side and jump into the driver\u2019s seat. I start the car, and we both cringe at the sorry state of the engine. I press the clutch, take her hand and place it on the stick shift. \u201cI can\u2019t give you the complete feeling of being behind the wheel, but I can give you control. This car ain\u2019t moving without you.\u201d</p><p>That brilliant smile lights up her face. \u201cHow fast are you wanting to go?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYour choice, but I don\u2019t have problems with speed.\u201d</p><p>Keeping our eyes locked on each other, Rachel shoves the car into First. I lift off the clutch as I step on the gas. </p> </body></html>"]
