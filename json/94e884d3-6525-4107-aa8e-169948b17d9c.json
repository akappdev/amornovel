Summer sunlight shone through the trees, creating patterns on the grass and the log that made her think of fairies dancing in the breeze.</p> <p>\u201cMommy said kissing a frog meant becoming a princess,\u201d Francesca said, sounding doubtful. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a princess that bad.\u201d</p><p>Brenna pushed back the cardboard tiara Katie had carefully cut out, then covered with glue and glitter. \u201cBoys are stupid and so are frogs. And princes.\u201d She crossed her arms over her tattered lace-and-tulle dress-up costume and scowled.</p><p>Katie didn\u2019t like boys all that much, but princes were different. Princes rode white horses and carried girls off to beautiful castles, where they got to eat ice cream any time they wanted and never had to write thank-you notes.</p><p>But Francesca had a point. Was all that really worth kissing a frog?</p><p>\u201cHow do we know it\u2019s a magical frog?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cIn the book the frog had a little crown on its head. I don\u2019t think this one used to be a prince at all,\u201d Francesca told her.</p><p>Katie crouched down until she was eye level with the frog. It regarded her with big eyes, but didn\u2019t jump away.</p><p>Francesca was right\u2014there wasn\u2019t any crown. No twinkling lights filled the air. But they\u2019d never seen a frog here before\u2014not in their special place.</p><p>She glanced around at the ring of trees and the soft, springy grass. Here she and her sisters pretended to be everything from elegant travelers taking a boat to a mysterious new land, to Cinderella, to mermaids. Sometimes their games were so elaborate they went on for days and Katie helped their Grammy M make special costumes. Today they were dressed to be fairy princesses. They\u2019d just been deciding who was going to be kidnapped by the evil Dark Duke, when they\u2019d spotted the frog.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s magic and it wants to be sure we believe?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>Brenna rolled her eyes. \u201cThen kiss it and find out. If it\u2019s not magic, you\u2019ll get warts all over your face and have to stay in your room because you\u2019ll be so ugly.\u201d</p> <p>Not a happy outcome, Katie thought. But she really wanted to find a handsome prince and fall in love. She wanted a big wedding, with lots of lace and flowers and a sky full of stars.</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019re a prince in disguise,\u201d she whispered to the frog. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you and then wait every night for you to come find me. You\u2019ll be my one true love, and we\u2019ll live happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath for courage, leaned close, and pressed her lips against the frog\u2019s small face. It croaked and hopped away.</p><p>Brenna laughed while Francesca tried to hide a smile. Katie wasn\u2019t discouraged. When she\u2019d kissed the frog, she felt...something. Like a tingle. Or a promise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d she told her sisters. \u201cOne day my prince is going to come for me. He\u2019s going to want only me, and you\u2019ll be sorry you didn\u2019t kiss the frog, too.\u201d</p><p>Francesca looked wistful, but Brenna shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll be waiting until you\u2019re old, because no prince is gonna show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. He will and I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>Katie did wait. Every night for the next three years, she stood at her window and watched the sky, waiting for her prince to ride up on his white stallion and whisk her away.</p> <p>In time she forgot about the frog, the kiss, and her beliefs, which was a good thing, because twenty years later there had been a lot more frogs, but not a single prince.</p><p>1</p><p>K atie Marcelli knew that with the right staff, she could organize the world. But as good help was hard to find, she contented herself with smaller projects, such as organizing closets, parties, and seminars. She owned her own business, made a decent living, and had a five-year business plan that would make a Fortune 500 CEO weep with envy. She was tough, confident, in charge.</p><p>On the outside.</p><p>On the inside her nerves were currently playing baseball in her stomach, and someone had just hit a foul ball down the third base line. She pressed a hand to her midsection and knew that fourth cup of coffee she\u2019d gulped in her car was about to turn to acid. She was tense, wired, and pacing in high heels that might make her ankles look as slender as a gazelle\u2019s but also threatened her future ability to walk without a limp.</p><p>Oh, please, oh, please let me say just the right thing, she thought as she paused in front of a large window overlooking Century City and Beverly Hills. Opportunities like this didn\u2019t come along every day. She\u2019d wanted to take her company to the next level, and this job was going to make it happen. All she had to do was be...sparkling.</p><p>The word made her smile. Ah, yes. She was \u201cthe Sparkling One.\u201d Bright, bubbly, like fine champagne that had\u2014</p><p>\u201cMs. Marcelli? Mr. Stryker will see you now.\u201d</p><p>Katie turned toward a well-dressed fifty-something woman who held open a thick door and motioned for her to enter.</p><p>Katie stepped from the nicely carpeted hallway into sink-to-your-ankles plushness in an office the size of Rhode Island. A corner office, with floor-to-ceiling windows, sleek yet traditional furniture, a massive pair of leather sofas on the walls opposite the windows, and an elegantly dressed man good-looking enough to grace one of the billboards that lined Sunset Boulevard.</p><p>Zach Stryker, one of only three senior partners in the largest family law firm in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and the youngest partner. He had a reputation for being tough, unflinching, and a hell of a negotiator. Oh, and he wasn\u2019t just a winner in the courtroom. Rumor had it he broke at least two female hearts a week.</p><p>The nerves in her stomach instantly abandoned their baseball game and began flying in a \u201cman-alert\u201d formation which warned her that caffeine overload was not all that far away. Perfect, she thought, because staying calm in a meeting was so overrated.</p><p>\u201cMs. Marcelli?\u201d the man said, his voice low and sultry enough to make him a fortune in radio. \u201cI\u2019m Zach Stryker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stryker. A pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She managed to cross the carpet without twisting her ankle. As he came around his pool-size desk, she transferred her briefcase from her right hand to her left, then shook with him.</p><p>Oh, great, sparks, she thought as sexual heat arced from her fingers to her chest and beyond. Wildly attractive, tall, dark, and blue-eyed. How L.A. How her luck. Wasn\u2019t she only supposed to care about the job?</p><p>A good question, she thought as she took the seat he offered in front of his desk.</p><p>Instead of circling back to his \u201cI\u2019m the man\u201d leather chair, he settled next to her, then angled toward her and gave her the kind of engaging smile that could send an angry, gray-haired nun into cardiac arrest. Katie told herself she was made of sterner stuff.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re going to throw a party together,\u201d he said.</p><p>Right. A party. The reason she was here. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She opened her briefcase and pulled out a light blue folder. \u201cYour assistant filled me in on the basics. Your law firm hosts an annual fund-raiser, with the proceeds going to several local family charities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. The event is generally coordinated by one of the partner\u2019s wives. John\u2019s wife volunteered, but then she discovered she was pregnant with twins. Her doctor didn\u2019t want her stressing herself with all the planning, so I stepped in and said I\u2019d take care of things.\u201d He rested one ankle on his opposite knee. \u201cNot having a wife, I needed to call in a professional. That\u2019s where you come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Which she did. Sort of. Yes, she\u2019d planned parties before, but never one of this magnitude. It was black-tie, A-list, and exclusive. She would never personally have been invited, although she\u2019d read about the fun and good times in In Style magazine.</p><p>No doubt he couldn\u2019t ask one of his women to do it. That would require him keeping her around for more than fifteen minutes. A circumstance that would no doubt cramp his style.</p><p>He pushed a stack of folders toward her. \u201cEverything you need to know about the previous two parties, including the guest list. John\u2019s wife got as far as picking the hotel, so you\u2019re going to be starting from there.\u201d</p><p>Which meant practically starting from scratch. Easy enough. If she had six months and hired three or four more staff members, she could\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe party\u2019s in May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d she said, holding in a shriek. May? As in less than four months from now? As in ohmygod, now what?</p><p>He gave her the exact date, and she wrote it down on her pad.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to ask,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAs you said, Mr. Stryker, I\u2019m a professional. This is what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do it very well.\u201d</p><p>The intensity of his gaze unnerved her. Or maybe it was the heat he generated. She felt as if she were sitting too close to a furnace. Or maybe it was the drop in his voice, as if they were having an intimate conversation.</p><p>She glanced around at the impressive office, then studied his tailor-made suit, expensive shoes, and casually elegant good looks. Uh-huh. She knew the type. Zach Stryker was the kind of man used to getting what he wanted in business, and in life. Women lined up by the dozens just to throw themselves at his feet.</p><p>She might be experiencing a little attraction, but there was no way she would become one of a crowd. So she would keep her thoughts and her reactions to herself. Besides, this was business.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re the kind of woman who enjoys a challenge, this is going to be exactly what you were looking for,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI do like a challenge,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to take risks or work hard. That\u2019s why I\u2019m successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is.\u201d He shrugged, and gave her another dazzling smile. \u201cI\u2019m a typical guy about party planning, so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to be much help to you. Still, I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d He shifted so that both feet were flat on the floor, then leaned toward her. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to work closely together.\u201d</p><p>She had the feeling they were talking about more than the party, but she wasn\u2019t going to let on.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your willingness to cooperate, but the bottom line is, Mr. Stryker, you\u2019re hiring me to make the party happen with a minimum of disruption to your already busy schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Zach.\u201d</p><p>Call me anytime.</p><p>Fortunately she only thought the words, rather than saying them aloud. When she got home she was going to give her hormones a stern talking to. Over the years they\u2019d quivered over any number of inappropriate men, but never one this far out of her league. Men like Zach chewed up and spit out women like her with their morning coffee.</p><p>She mentally winced at the awkward metaphor, then turned her attention back to business.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look over the plans from the previous fund-raisers,\u201d she said as she gathered the files. \u201cI\u2019ll review the location and come up with three or four possible themes. I should be back in touch with you by the middle of next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good. I\u2019ve notified my assistant to get you in to see me as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>Talk about an invitation. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Katie snapped her briefcase closed and they both rose. Which meant they were standing close together. Too close.</p><p>Despite her potentially crippling high heels, she found herself several inches shorter than Zach. He smelled good\u2014clean, sexy, powerful. His cobalt blue eyes crinkled slightly at the corners. She couldn\u2019t decide if they were his best feature or if she liked his mouth better.</p><p>The job, she reminded herself. His ability to pay her was by far his most appealing characteristic.</p><p>\u201cThis event is very important to my law firm, Katie,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a win.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hardly a news flash. He wasn\u2019t the kind of man who looked for anything else. Still, she could reassure him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in second place, either. You\u2019ll have your win.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. She felt her insides shift slightly. The sensation was nearly as disconcerting as the heat washing over her. If the man ever got tired of the law, he could make a fortune simply smiling at women.</p> <p>She doubted any of his attentions were even personally directed at her. No doubt he knew he was God\u2019s gift to women and couldn\u2019t help sharing the bounty. She was smart enough not to take any of it personally.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your time,\u201d he said as he led the way to the door.</p><p>Katie followed, then paused when he opened it.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done any work for your firm before,\u201d she said, because in addition to being efficient, she was wildly curious. The combination occasionally got her in trouble. \u201cHow did you find my company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA recommendation.\u201d He held up his hand before she could speak. \u201cI don\u2019t remember from whom. I have it somewhere. I\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate that. Most of my business comes through referrals. I\u2019d like to pass on a thank-you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He took a step back, then paused. \u201cMake sure Dora has your number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Good-bye.\u201d</p><p>She nodded once and headed down the long corridor toward the bank of elevators by the reception desk. Dora must be his assistant. As she\u2019d already given the woman her card, she knew Zach had her number. If he needed it. Not that he would. There was nothing more to say until she\u2019d gotten up to speed on the fund-raiser.</p><p>Unless he wanted to call for some other reason. Seduction? The thought made her chuckle. Right. So likely to happen.</p><p>As the elevator doors opened, she stepped inside and pressed the button for the parking garage.</p> <p>What very few people knew and what she took great pains to disguise was that under her expensive business suit beat the heart of a romantic. Men like Zach Stryker would never appreciate that. They wanted the new, the trendy, the easy. She had been told more than once she was anything but easy.</p><p>If he wanted a conquest, she wasn\u2019t his woman. She wanted hearts, flowers, and happily ever after. He wanted a cheap, sexual encounter.</p><p>As she walked out of the elevator, her hormones took great pains to remind her that it had been some time since the last emotionally significant relationship in her life and that a cheap, sexual encounter would go a long way toward smoothing some of her frazzled edges.</p><p>\u201cNot my style,\u201d Katie said aloud and unlocked her car door.</p><p>Oh, but if it were, Zach Stryker would certainly be her man.</p><p>Katie drove out of the underground parking lot and headed west. While mid-February could be cool and rainy in Los Angeles, the past week had been perfect. California blue skies, balmy temperatures\u2014no smog, no haze, and not an earthquake in sight. It was the kind of weather that drew tourists like flies to a pest strip, especially those suffering with snow and blizzards in their regular lives.</p><p>After crossing under the 405 freeway, Katie turned left, toward Santa Monica and her dollhouse-size bungalow. Traffic was lighter than it would be in an hour or so, as lawyers, accountants and financial types packed it in for the weekend.</p><p>Okay, yes, it was only two in the afternoon, and she really should still be working. But hey. She\u2019d just landed a huge contract, been smiled at by one of the best-looking men in LaLa Land, and somewhere north of the city there was a cannoli with her name on it.</p> <p>Inspired by the thought of dinner, she threaded her way through the growing congestion and made it home in about twenty minutes. After changing from her suit and high heels into a sleeveless dress and sandals, she grabbed a cardigan, the already-packed overnight bag, and headed for the bathroom. There she plucked pins from her hair until the shoulder-blade\u2013length reddish-brown waves tumbled free. A scrunchy secured them at the nape of her neck. She paused long enough to slather sunscreen on every exposed inch. She might be half Italian, but she\u2019d inherited her mother\u2019s Irish skin. Just thinking about the sun was enough to start her burning.</p><p>On her way to the front door Katie glanced at her answering machine. No flashing light announced the delight of a waiting message. Obviously Zach Stryker had manfully resisted the nearly overwhelming urge to call her and beg her to return to his office where they would make love on his designer leather sofa.</p><p>Once in the driveway she stowed her luggage in the trunk, then slipped into her Sebring. The convertible top opened, then folded neatly behind the backseat. An adjustment of her radio from NPR to a rock station completed her travel ritual. It was time to go home.</p><p>By three o\u2019clock she\u2019d crested the hill that marked the line between L.A. and the valley. The exit to the 101 freeway was on her right. Katie slipped into that lane, all the while singing along with a song about broken hearts and holding on.</p><p>Her car phone rang.</p><p>Katie hit a button on the console, muting her radio and activating her hands-free microphone.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, speaking loudly to be heard over the wind and the sound of the other cars.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. You\u2019re in your car,\u201d her youngest sister, Mia, said, sounding delighted. \u201cI was calling to make sure you\u2019re still coming home this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already on my way. How\u2019s school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m settling into my classes and getting ready for midterms.\u201d</p><p>Katie frowned as she followed the curving interchange. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just start the quarter?\u201d</p><p>Mia sighed dramatically. \u201cTell me about it. I love UCLA, but the quarter system is so tough. I barely figure out what the class is about and suddenly it\u2019s time for midterms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd despite the pressure, you dazzle us all with your straight A\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d Mia giggled. \u201cGuess what? There\u2019s gonna be an announcement at dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnouncement?\u201d Katie eased into the fast lane and concentrated on the minivan in front of her. \u201cGood or bad?\u201d</p><p>The Marcelli family had a tradition of announcing news at large family gatherings. Once everyone was seated and the meal had been served, the pronouncements began. Confirmations of births, blights, and illness were made, along with surprises, some welcome, some not.</p><p>Katie quickly considered the possibility of damage to the vines, but it was only February. Everything was dormant.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Mia said with another giggle. \u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to give me a hint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. So how was your Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d</p><p>Katie remembered the quiet evening she\u2019d spent in front of her tiny fireplace. She\u2019d celebrated one of her favorite days with a bottle of champagne, Godiva chocolates, and a romance novel.</p><p>\u201cIt was perfect,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>\u201cWas there a man involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m currently blissfully single.\u201d</p><p>Mia sighed. \u201cKatie, you know that means trouble. If you\u2019re not seeing anyone, the entire family is going to jump all over you this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The Marcelli family might be incredibly close and loving, but they were also rabid about marriage and kids. At twenty-eight and still single, Katie wasn\u2019t just considered an old maid, she was thought to be unnatural and in need of serious therapy.</p><p>Which she didn\u2019t want to think about. \u201cSo how was your Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous.\u201d</p><p>Katie pictured her sister\u2019s petite yet curvy figure, her streaked blond hair and doe eyes. She grinned. \u201cLet me guess. Forty-seven guys wrestled for the honor of buying you dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just saw David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been seeing him for a while now, haven\u2019t you?\u201d She vaguely recalled a good-looking kid breezing through at Christmas.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Since September. He\u2019s really special, Katie. We\u2019re in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you,\u201d Katie said, speaking the truth. She was two parts thrilled and one part envious. When was the last time she\u2019d been in love? Not her previous boyfriend, or the one before that. They\u2019d been great guys, but not the one.</p><p>\u201cI should let you concentrate on driving,\u201d Mia said. \u201cSee you in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there. Give my love to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Bye.\u201d</p><p>The connection clicked off. Katie pushed the button to restore her radio, but instead of joining in with the song, she shook her head. Mia in love? Was her baby sister really old enough to fall for a guy?</p><p>She laughed. Mia was eighteen. In the Marcelli family that was the perfect age for a short engagement, followed by a long marriage. Katie\u2019s other sisters, Francesca and Brenna, had both married at eighteen, although Francesca was now a young, beautiful widow. Katie herself had been engaged at eighteen, although the marriage had never taken place.</p><p>Whispers of the past threatened, but she wasn\u2019t interested in spoiling her drive, so she ignored them. Instead she cranked up the volume on the radio and fantasized about a certain lawyer she\u2019d recently met. He might be fifteen kinds of bad for her, but he sure knew how to make her body burst into flames.</p><p>A wrought-iron arch announced the entrance to the Marcelli Winery. Hundreds of acres of vineyard stretched out on both sides of the two-lane drive amusingly named Pleasure Road. Come summer, the plants would be thick with leaves and budding fruit. In September, right before harvest, they would hang low with heavy, ripe grapes, but now, in February, they were simply gray and bare.</p><p>As Katie drove under the arch, she noticed that the winter pansies flourished. The dozen or so flower-filled half barrels surrounding the base of the arch were filled with colorful blossoms waving in the soft breeze. She could inhale the scent of flowers and earth, and the ocean in the distance.</p><p>The road to the main hacienda was nearly three quarters of a mile. Up ahead the three-story, pale yellow hacienda stood at the end of a long driveway. Wrought-iron balconies decorated the front of the structure. Katie didn\u2019t have all that much interest in growing grapes or making wine, but she considered herself a real fan of the Marcelli family home. So many happy memories lingered in the corners and crevices of the old place. So much history filled each of the rooms. Coming back always made her feel good.</p><p>She pulled up next to the large house, parking her car next to Mia\u2019s five-year-old Accord. A beat-up pickup sat on the other side, which meant Francesca had also come home for the weekend. Brenna would be arriving later. Katie smiled in anticipation. The four sisters hadn\u2019t been under the same roof since Christmas, nearly two months before.</p><p>She\u2019d barely popped the trunk when a side door opened and Francesca strolled out.</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d be the next to arrive,\u201d she said with a wave. \u201cBrenna won\u2019t be here for a while. She had to take Jeff to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not coming for the weekend?\u201d Katie asked, more than a little disappointed. She, along with her sisters, adored Brenna\u2019s husband. He was funny, affectionate, the brother they\u2019d never had.</p><p>\u201cNope. He had to go to some doctor convention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019d rather go there than hang out with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. I mean, we\u2019re charming and we have unlimited access to pasta. What\u2019s not to like?\u201d</p><p>The two women laughed, then embraced. Katie hugged her sister hard, holding her close for a second. When they released each other, she tried not to notice how great Francesca looked in her white cropped T-shirt and pale blue skirt.</p><p>Francesca had always been the pretty sister...pretty and nearly physically perfect. She was perfectly tall (5 feet 9), perfectly slender, with that annoying combination of large breasts and nonexistent hips. Her perfect features\u2014wide hazel eyes, a full mouth, and cheekbones that defied gravity\u2014combined to create a face that could not only launch a thousand ships, it could heal several debilitating personality flaws. Long, thick brown hair tumbled down her back, while perfect, olive-colored skin seemed to radiate light. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All of this and a brain, too, Katie thought with a combination of love and pride, flavored with a touch of sibling rivalry. Katie had always been the smart sister, but Francesca\u2019s success in her Ph.D. program demonstrated there were fairly efficient brain cells firing behind those big eyes.</p><p>Katie grabbed her suitcase. \u201cPoor Dad and Grandpa Lorenzo. They always look forward to Jeff\u2019s visits. He keeps them from feeling outnumbered by the women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll survive, but I\u2019m not sure we will,\u201d Francesca said as they walked to the back door and stepped into the utility room. \u201cYou need to brace yourself. There\u2019s an estrogen fest going on in the kitchen. The Grands are on a roll and Mom is only making it worse. If you don\u2019t keep your distance, your ovaries may mutate.\u201d</p> <p>Katie smiled as she dropped her suitcase and purse. She stepped into the kitchen and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d</p><p>Three women stood around the central island of the massive kitchen decorated with hand-painted tiles. Dozens of bowls, casseroles, and pots filled every inch of counter space that wasn\u2019t already holding fresh produce and homemade pasta.</p><p>Three heads turned, three pairs of eyes widened in delight, six arms reached for her. Katie found herself being engulfed in a hugging competition designed to snap at least two ribs, while making her feel she was the most important person on the planet.</p><p>\u201cKatie, at last! We were so worried. The long drive. A young woman alone. Who knows what could happen?\u201d</p> <p>Her paternal grandmother pinched her cheek hard enough to leave a mark. Katie smiled, even as her eyes watered from the pain. \u201cGrandma Tessa,\u201d she said warmly. \u201cIf you stopped worrying, what would the saints do with their time?\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa, born and bred in Italy, dismissed the blasphemy. She was used to it from all her girls.</p><p>Katie\u2019s mother, petite and stylish in a designer suit, sans shoes, cupped her face. \u201cYou look thin. Katie, you\u2019re a beautiful young woman. You don\u2019t need to starve yourself. Are you dieting again?\u201d</p><p>Katie kissed her soft, pale cheek. \u201cI swear, I\u2019m not dieting. In fact, I weigh exactly the same as I did the last time you saw me, and the time before that.\u201d</p><p>Colleen O\u2019Shea Marcelli harrumphed, obviously unconvinced. \u201cI think we should talk later. When your father and I were in San Francisco, we met the nicest young man. He\u2019s a sous chef in a restaurant up there.\u201d</p><p>Francesca stole a slice of cheese. \u201cI thought all chefs were gay.\u201d</p> <p>Grandma Tessa brought the cross on the rosary around her neck to her lips. \u201cFrancesca, God did not make you so lovely on the outside so that you could have such a dark heart. Katie needs a man. For that matter, you need a man.\u201d</p><p>Francesca looked at Katie. They both rolled their eyes.</p><p>Finally Katie turned to the tiny woman still holding her arm. \u201cGrammy M,\u201d Katie said, her voice warm with affection. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grand. The sun feels good on these old bones. I\u2019ve no complaints a\u2019tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not so old,\u201d Katie reminded her. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m counting on you living forever.\u201d</p><p>Mary-Margaret O\u2019Shea had been born in Ireland and married at seventeen to a young man she\u2019d only met twice. Less than two weeks after the wedding he\u2019d taken her away from home and family, bringing her across the ocean to a great new land. They\u2019d eventually settled in California.</p><p>Grammy M squeezed her hand. \u201cI\u2019m plannin\u2019 on it, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Katie\u2019s mother said, expectantly. \u201cIf you\u2019re not interested in the sous chef, does that mean you have someone special in your life?\u201d</p> <p>Katie looked at Francesca, who stuck her finger down her throat and silently gagged.</p><p>Katie knew she had two choices. She could tell the truth\u2014that she wasn\u2019t seeing anyone and that she was perfectly okay with that. Only no one would believe her. Instead her grandmothers and mother would fuss and chide and torture her for the entire weekend. They would bring up names of men who had never married (and once they reached forty without tying the knot, how couldn\u2019t there be something wrong with them?), men who were recently divorced, even men who were thinking about divorce. They would talk about her growing old alone, about the odds of finding a man after she turned thirty. They would try to love her into submitting to the family credo of \u201cmarry young and have many babies.\u201d</p><p>Or she could lie.</p><p>While she generally tried to tell the truth, desperate times and all that.</p><p>\u201cI recently met the most amazing guy,\u201d she said.</p><p>The Grands did a second swooping thing, while her mother beamed.</p><p>\u201cTell us everything,\u201d she insisted. \u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Zach Stryker and he\u2019s a very successful lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, a man with a profession,\u201d her mother said happily. \u201cSo he has money.\u201d</p><p>Katie didn\u2019t have a clue, but unless Zach spent every weekend redecorating his house at the Neiman Marcus home store, he should have gobs. \u201cSure. He\u2019s gorgeous and charming and I think he\u2019s really special.\u201d</p><p>Francesca nearly choked on her cheese. Katie tucked her hand behind her back and crossed her fingers. \u201cHe hired me to handle a big fund-raiser for his firm. It\u2019s a huge job and it\u2019s going to put my company onto the \u2018A\u2019 list, but that\u2019s not nearly as exciting as meeting the right guy, you know?\u201d</p><p>Francesca still stood behind the Grands. Now she chewed the last bit of cheese and wrapped her hands around her throat, as if strangling herself. Katie knew she was laying it on a bit thick, but she was on a roll.</p><p>She sighed heavily. \u201cThe man is a hunk.\u201d</p><p>Just then footsteps clattered on the dining room hardwood floor. Katie was almost disappointed by the interruption. She could have done another five minutes on the unlikely virtues of Zach.</p><p>Everyone turned toward the sound as Mia burst into the kitchen.</p><p>As usual, she was dressed in jeans and a cropped shirt. Her highlighted hair looked more blond than brown, although the roots were showing, the way Mia liked it. Heavy makeup emphasized her brown eyes. She looked like a makeover gone bad, and yet so lovely and full of life that Katie couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to start blending,\u201d Katie said, crossing to her youngest sister and hugging her. \u201cThat\u2019s why God invented Q-tips.\u201d</p><p>Mia puffed out her glossy lips, then gave an exaggerated sigh. \u201cI\u2019m still experimenting to find my style. We can\u2019t all be perfect like Francesca or together like you.\u201d Mia fingered Katie\u2019s cardigan. \u201cI mean, you match, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa fingered her rosary. \u201cMia Theresa Marcelli, your mouth shames the entire family.\u201d</p><p>Mia dropped her head in mock surrender. \u201cSorry, Grandma. I didn\u2019t mean to take the Lord\u2019s name in vain.\u201d</p><p>Never one to stay contrite for long, she quickly straightened. \u201cIs Brenna here? I really, really want to tell everyone my news. Where are Dad and Grandpa Lorenzo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be back for dinner,\u201d Grandma Tessa said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d</p><p>Katie grinned. Telling Mia to wait when she wanted something was about as productive as attempting to change the Earth\u2019s axis. No matter the effort, not one thing shifted.</p><p>\u201cOh, sh\u2014\u201d Mia glanced at her paternal grandmother and quickly modified her word choice. \u201cOh, shimmy! I\u2019ll just tell you, and then we can tell everyone else when they get here.\u201d She frowned.</p><p>\u201cHave you been working on your plan to rule the world?\u201d Katie asked her youngest sister. \u201cRemember, I\u2019m only going to organize it. You\u2019re in charge of world domination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d Mia drew in a deep breath, then spun around once. She clapped her hands together and grinned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the best news. I\u2019m getting married!\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>T heir mother and both grandmothers swooped down on Mia like peregrine falcons diving for a hapless mouse. Katie laughed as her baby sister was alternately squeezed, kissed, cheek-pinched, and cooed over.</p><p>Mia held out her left hand, showing everyone her simple diamond solitaire.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d Katie said, leaning in for a glance.</p><p>\u201cMarried,\u201d Grandma Tessa said with obvious delight. \u201cTo that nice boy, David? He\u2019s not Italian, but he\u2019s very handsome. Is the family Catholic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama Tessa, you worry too much,\u201d Mom said as she kissed her daughter\u2019s forehead and brushed her streaked hair off her face. \u201cMy baby is going to be married. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d</p><p>Katie watched the show and fought tears of happiness. \u201cWay to go, Sis,\u201d she called when Mia looked at her. \u201cMake the weekend all about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Mia grinned. \u201cI\u2019m really excited, Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>Francesca pushed off the counter she\u2019d been leaning against and joined the affection competition. \u201cCongratulations, Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sad,\u201d Mia implored, grabbing her hands and squeezing them. \u201cPlease, Francesca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sad,\u201d her sister protested. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled for you.\u201d</p><p>Katie knew Francesca was telling the truth, even if the Grands wouldn\u2019t believe it. Eight years ago, right on schedule, she and Brenna, her fraternal twin, had been married in a lovely double ceremony. While Brenna was still happily married to Jeff, Francesca had become a widow at the tender age of twenty-one. Busy with getting an education, Francesca preferred staying single and independent. A philosophy that violated everything the sisters had ever been taught.</p><p>Grammy M clapped her hands for silence. \u201cWhen is the wedding to be?\u201d</p><p>A hush fell over the kitchen. Francesca and Katie glanced at each other. Katie remembered the fund-raiser she\u2019d just agreed to organize and tried not to panic. Not soon, she thought silently. The fund raiser was going to take all the free time she had.</p><p>Mia reached for a cherry tomato and popped it into her mouth. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure,\u201d she said after she\u2019d finished chewing. \u201cThis summer. Probably sometime in July.\u201d</p><p>Katie did the math. The fund-raiser was at the end of May, which meant if the wedding was in mid-July, there would be only six weeks left. Which meant she wouldn\u2019t be sleeping much between now and then.</p><p>Grammy M nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get started right away.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa sighed. \u201cJuly is so pretty with the vines and the leaves. You\u2019ll be a beautiful bride, little one.\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s mother grabbed a pad of paper from the stack under the wall phone. \u201cWe need to start a list. How many people? What kind of food? Mia, have you thought about invitations yet? I suppose we need an actual date for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case anyone is interested, David and his father are coming over for dinner tonight,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>That set off another flurry of activity. The two grandmothers returned their attention to the cooking. Katie\u2019s mom shrieked something about the dining room table not being set right and rushed out of the kitchen. Francesca excused herself, leaving only Katie and Mia with nothing to do.</p><p>Mia sidled up to her. \u201cSo what do you think? I mean, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember the day you were born,\u201d Katie said softly. \u201cMom and Dad were desperate for a son, but I wanted you to be a little girl. They even let me name you. And now you\u2019re all grown up. I can\u2019t believe my little sister is getting married.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s dark eyes widened. \u201cSo you\u2019re happy for me?\u201d</p><p>Katie thought about how Mia had always known what she wanted from a very young age. Not only was she intelligent enough to be considered gifted, she had the uncanny ability to choose exactly the right path for herself.</p><p>Mia had found her handsome prince. Did it get any better than that? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled for you,\u201d Katie promised. \u201cI want you to have the most beautiful wedding ever, and I want you to be delirious with joy for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be. David is so great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEighteen, like me. We met during orientation.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cHe\u2019s a freshman, which is kinda weird, but okay, too.\u201d</p><p>Katie swallowed. Eighteen? Somehow she\u2019d assumed that her sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was older\u2014maybe a grad student. Mia had started college at sixteen, which meant she and David weren\u2019t in the same class. \u201cBut you\u2019re a junior. What happens when you graduate? Don\u2019t you still want to go to Georgetown for your master\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about David? He won\u2019t be finished with his undergraduate degree. Won\u2019t that be a problem?\u201d</p><p>Mia dismissed her concern with a flick of fingers tipped in bright purple. \u201cWe\u2019ll work it out.\u201d Her expression turned pleading. \u201cBe happy for me, Katie. I really need that.\u201d</p> <p>Katie gave in with a smile. She\u2019d never been able to deny Mia anything. If her sister wanted to get married, then Katie would make sure that happened.</p><p>\u201cYou got it, kid,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll help plan the wedding? And help me when Grammy M wants to put me in too many ruffles and a thirty-foot train that went out of style like twenty years ago?\u201d</p><p>Katie made an X above her left breast. \u201cI swear. I\u2019ll defend you against ugly wedding gowns. We\u2019ll pick out something really special and all of us will make it for you. This will be the best wedding ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Mia hugged her. \u201cThere\u2019s just one more thing.\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed. \u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you and I have a special bond and there always is.\u201d Mia glanced around to make sure they were still alone, then leaned close. \u201cCan you take care of David\u2019s dad tonight? I\u2019ve met him and he\u2019s really great, but he\u2019s, you know, a dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Mia sighed. \u201cKatie, come on. This is us. The Marcellis. We\u2019re not exactly average. The Grands are going to fuss, and Mom and Dad will probably want to check his teeth or something. I don\u2019t want to think about what Grandpa Lorenzo will say about me getting started on having babies right away. You\u2019re so normal. Just be nice to him. You know, be charming.\u201d</p><p>Katie remembered that David\u2019s father was single. \u201cGreat. So you\u2019re using me as bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA distraction. Remember, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s so good with people. So keep him busy enough that the rest of the family doesn\u2019t freak him out.\u201d She arched her eyebrows. \u201cHe\u2019s not that old and he\u2019s really cute. Well, in a Dad sort of way. You might really like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>Of course, there was the problem of having just convinced the female members of her family that she\u2019d already met the perfect man in the form of Zack Stryker. Still, she wasn\u2019t opposed to helping out her sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cGreat. You\u2019re the best.\u201d Mia twirled in place. \u201cTonight is going to be so amazing.\u201d</p><p>Zach Stryker consciously relaxed his hands on the steering wheel. As he and his son drove steadily north, he struggled to find the right words and the right to say them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d came to mind, along with, \u201cCould you be more successful at screwing up your life?\u201d</p><p>He reminded himself that anger and sarcasm would only make David dig in his heels. His son had inherited many good qualities from his father, but he\u2019d also inherited a large dose of Stryker stubbornness. In the eyes of the law Mia and David were both adults. There was nothing to prevent them from running off and eloping. Zach was determined to keep that from happening. Which meant playing along with the engagement...for now.</p><p>\u201cHave you met Mia\u2019s family before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo her parents know about the engagement?\u201d</p><p>Some of David\u2019s teenage confidence slipped. \u201cI, ah, don\u2019t know. Mia said she was gonna tell everyone today. You know, before we got there.\u201d He shifted uncomfortably in his seat.</p><p>Some of Zach\u2019s tension eased. If Mia\u2019s parents didn\u2019t know about this idiotic engagement, then there was a chance they would object. What normal parents would want their eighteen-year-old daughter marrying a kid with no life experience and no job? Mia was David\u2019s first girlfriend, for God\u2019s sake. He knew as much about being a husband as he did about solving the issue of global warming.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see how it goes,\u201d Zach said, striving for noncommittal. \u201cSo tell me about the family.\u201d</p><p>David shoved his too-long blond hair off his forehead and slumped down in the seat. \u201cMia\u2019s the youngest of four sisters. Katie\u2019s the oldest. Brenna and Francesca are a year younger. They\u2019re twins, but they don\u2019t look alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of them married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna. Her husband\u2019s a doctor. I don\u2019t know much about Francesca except she\u2019s like really hot. Mia said she could have gone into modeling, but she\u2019s not that shallow.\u201d</p><p>David continued to talk about parents and grandparents, but Zach wasn\u2019t listening. None of this information was new to him. When David had first admitted he was serious about someone, Zach hadn\u2019t been concerned\u2014not until his eighteen-year-old son had asked for money from his trust fund so that he could buy the girl in question an engagement ring.</p><p>At that point Zach had been tempted to lock David in his room for the next five years or until he came to his senses. Whichever happened first. Reality had prevailed. Instead of searching out a secure location, he\u2019d learned as much as he could about Mia\u2019s family and had come up with several plans to keep the happy couple from tying the knot. One of those plans had already been put into action.</p><p>Katie Marcelli had not been hired by accident. She was going to owe him big time for her new contract, and he intended to use that to his advantage.</p><p>Zach was determined to keep David from screwing up his life. If the kid wanted to get married in a few years...like ten or twelve...when his career was established and he knew what he wanted, that was great. But not now. Not like this.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the exit,\u201d David said, pointing to the sign above the highway. He fished a sheet of paper out of the front pocket of his khakis and read off the directions.</p><p>Zach drove along two-lane roads. It was already dark, and the small country signs were difficult to read. A rock clunked against the side of his car, and he winced at the thought of a chip in his paint job. He didn\u2019t have many personal pleasures in his life, but his one-year-old dark blue BMW 540i was one of them.</p><p>They made a left after the railroad tracks, then drove for three more miles. Finally David pointed at a well-lit wrought-iron arch and a small street sign reading PLEASURE ROAD.</p><p>\u201cThere it is.\u201d</p><p>Zach slowed. The high beams from his car illuminated cultivated grape vines for as far as the eye could see. He recalled the multiple offerings from the Marcelli Winery in his local wine emporium. Even the low-end stuff sold for over ten bucks. None of the research he\u2019d done on the family and the winery had indicated there was any financial trouble. Between the Marcelli legacy and David\u2019s trust fund, it was going to be a hell of a prenuptial agreement.</p><p>Five minutes later he parked his car next to several others. The side door of the house burst open and Mia Marcelli raced into the night.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here! I told everyone about the engagement and they\u2019re so excited. Hey, Mr. Stryker.\u201d</p><p>That was as much as Zach heard. David had already sprinted from the car toward his intended. The teenage lovebirds embraced, then kissed. Zach\u2019s stomach tightened in a combination of anger and frustration.</p><p>He slowly stepped out into the cool February night. Light spilled from the house. He saw several people standing by the open door, no doubt trying to get a look at the man who\u2019d raised such a crazy kid. He wanted to defend his son, and himself, but that wouldn\u2019t accomplish anything useful. Instead he was going to make nice, act friendly, and size up the opposition. Once he figured out who was on his side, he would suggest they get together to come up with a plan to break off the engagement.</p><p>Katie heard Mia run outside. The rest of the family gathered around the back door while she started opening the bottles of wine that had been chosen to accompany dinner.</p><p>\u201cThat should send David and his father screaming into the night,\u201d Francesca said as she leaned against the counter. \u201cFamilies like ours should only be allowed to greet people in groups of two.\u201d</p><p>Katie grinned. \u201cMia\u2019s already sweating that. She asked me to be nice to David\u2019s father. Actually, I think I\u2019m a sacrificial distraction so the Grands don\u2019t scare the life out of him.\u201d</p><p>Francesca raised her eyebrows. \u201cWon\u2019t that be difficult with your attention so firmly riveted on your new job and the hunk-in-a-suit you\u2019ll be working with?\u201d</p><p>Katie knew Francesca was only teasing, but she still felt embarrassed. \u201cI know. I shouldn\u2019t have lied, but they make me crazy. If I\u2019d told them I wasn\u2019t seeing anyone, they would have tortured me endlessly. Besides, the guy who hired me is all the things I claimed, and more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a first-class player. He dates starlets and models and society types. From what I\u2019ve read, no relationship lasts longer than thirty-five seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly the kind of material to get your romantic heart to thumping.\u201d</p><p>Katie wished that were true. \u201cThe bad news is, he\u2019s really sexy. I can\u2019t explain my hormonal reaction to him, but it\u2019s amazingly powerful. How can I lust after someone I don\u2019t even like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know him enough to make that kind of judgment?\u201d</p><p>Katie shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m reasonably confident I won\u2019t like him no matter how much we know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re not prejudging the situation.\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed. \u201cGood point. I\u2019ll try to keep an open mind, while resisting the need to rip off my clothes in his presence.\u201d</p><p>Outside car doors slammed. \u201cHere they come,\u201d Francesca said, then pushed off the counter. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to comfort David\u2019s father. I have to go make a quick call to my adviser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken.\u201d</p><p>Francesca glanced over her shoulder. \u201cNot even close. I just have really good timing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who likes to rescue people,\u201d Katie called after her. \u201cSo rescue me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is definitely a save-yourself-first moment. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo called from his place in the doorway.</p><p>Katie stayed in the kitchen, where she continued opening bottles of wine for their dinner. The Marcelli kitchen was generally a happy place, but tonight there was a festive air. As if the wine with dinner wasn\u2019t enough, their father had already set several bottles of their best champagne to chill in the small wine refrigerator tucked under the counter by the alcove.</p><p>She glanced up and saw her parents surrounding Mia and David as the young couple entered the house. David\u2019s father had yet to make an appearance.</p><p>Katie looked at David\u2019s blond hair and pale skin and tried to picture the man. Maybe an older version of his son, she thought. If Mia was worried about him, he was probably shy and quiet. She frowned as she realized she didn\u2019t know what he did for a living. A professor, maybe? She would like that. They could talk about books and\u2014</p><p>A man walked into the kitchen and seemed to look straight at her. Instantly her stomach dived for her toes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d read the expression in books and had never believed it, but at that moment all her internal organs zipped down her legs and splatted onto her feet.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe. She couldn\u2019t think, which was probably a good thing. Panic flooded her. While she was willing to accept being punished for lying, she resented the punishment not fitting the crime. This so wasn\u2019t fair.</p><p>Zach Stryker, smooth sophisticate, powerful lawyer, and her newest client, stood in the center of the Marcelli kitchen.</p> <p>Horror joined panic as she remembered all the things she\u2019d told her mother and grandmother about him. She wanted to scream. She wanted to run. She wanted to disappear into a puff of black smoke.</p><p>Instead she was forced to just stand there, immobilized by frozen muscles, while Zach raised one eyebrow in obvious surprise.</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>Her mother looked at her. \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d</p><p>Before Katie could come up with some swell lie to cover the other lie she\u2019d already told, Zach spoke.</p> <p>\u201cMy law firm recently hired Katie to plan a big charity party for us.\u201d</p><p>Katie braced herself, but it didn\u2019t help. Not when Grandma Tessa scurried close and clutched Zach\u2019s arm. \u201cOoh, so you\u2019re the handsome man she was telling us about.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s other eyebrow joined the first. Katie moaned softly as heat raced up her cheeks to her hairline. Oh, God. Now what?</p><p>Well, this being her life, it got worse.</p><p>Grammy M took Zach\u2019s other arm. \u201cOur Katie says you\u2019re a very special man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She swallowed and tried again. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p> <p>The corner of Zach\u2019s mouth quirked. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie.\u201d Grammy M\u2019s gaze turned reproachful. \u201cDon\u2019t be insultin\u2019 our guest.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to die.</p><p>To complete the thrill of the moment, both Grands chose to release Zach and leave her alone with him. She clutched the last bottle of Cabernet to her chest and wondered what would happen if she hit herself in the head with it.</p><p>Zach shoved his hands into his slacks pockets. \u201cSmall world,\u201d he said easily.</p><p>Of course, it was easy for him, she thought bitterly. He\u2019d been invited to a free, live show.</p><p>\u201cJust my luck,\u201d she muttered, then sighed. The best course of action was to pretend none of this had actually happened. \u201cSo you\u2019re David\u2019s father?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re so...\u201d She hesitated, not sure how to phrase the obvious.</p><p>\u201cI was seventeen when David was born,\u201d he told her, answering her question without her having to ask it.</p><p>He leaned toward her. \u201cYou told your family you thought I was hot, huh?\u201d</p><p>She winced as the heat on her face returned. \u201cThose exact words never crossed my lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut something close.\u201d</p><p>Obviously the man didn\u2019t have an ego problem. Unfortunately she was hardly in a position to put him in his place.</p><p>For a second she thought about explaining why she\u2019d said what she had, but he was unlikely to believe her. Women threw themselves at Zach. Why would he think she was any different?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll recover,\u201d she said, striving for a light, cheerful tone. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want to.\u201d</p><p>His low words rubbed against her skin like velvet. Man oh man, he might be not her type, but did he know how to use what he had to the greatest advantage.</p><p>\u201cWe have a working relationship,\u201d she told him. \u201cI intend to respect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll work and no play...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll risk being dull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to bet I can change your mind?\u201d</p><p>Yes! Her hormones had already taken a vote and offered their opinion. Part of her couldn\u2019t believe he was coming on to her. And while sex without emotional commitment had never tempted her, she was suddenly all aquiver to find out if it had any redeeming qualities at all.</p><p>She was saved from answering when her father came up and claimed Zach.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave the cooking to the women,\u201d he said.</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo joined his son, slapped Zach on the back, and led him to the study.</p><p>Katie set down the bottle of wine and breathed a sigh of relief. She\u2019d just survived the most humiliating experience of her life and deserved some kind of tasteful award.</p><p>Instead, Grammy M winked at her. \u201cDavid\u2019s father seems very nice. A strong man.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa picked up the refrain. \u201cSmart, too. A lawyer. I can see why you liked him.\u201d</p><p>Katie wanted to protest that \u201clike\u201d didn\u2019t begin to describe what she felt, but she couldn\u2019t at this late date. Okay\u2014if God was trying to show her why it was stupid to lie, she\u2019d learned her lesson.</p><p>Her mother leaned against the opposite side of the island. \u201cMia says David told her that Zach never remarried after his wife left. Could be he had a broken heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime heals,\u201d Grammy M said.</p><p>\u201cA man who loved once is more likely to love again,\u201d Grandma Tessa pronounced.</p><p>\u201cOne marriage leads to another.\u201d Her mother beamed at her.</p><p>Katie leaned her elbows on the counter and covered her face with her hands. \u201cStop, I beg you.\u201d</p><p>Grammy M patted her arm. \u201cI\u2019ll sit him across from you at dinner. He\u2019ll spend the entire meal gazing into your pretty eyes, and by dessert he\u2019ll be yours.\u201d</p><p>Not knowing if she should laugh or cry, Katie contented herself with a strangled moan. \u201cThere are no words to describe my joy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her grandmother kissed her cheek. \u201cI know, child.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>\u201cT he cannolis can\u2019t wait forever,\u201d Grandma Tessa complained, checking the casserole dish in the top oven. \u201cWhere is that girl?\u201d</p><p>Katie was about to explain about Brenna taking her husband to the airport when the back door opened and Brenna breezed inside.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d she said. \u201cTraffic getting out of the city was awful. It\u2019s the whole Friday thing.\u201d</p><p>Brenna kissed her two grandmothers and mother, then hugged Katie.</p><p>\u201cI saw a Beamer parked outside. Who\u2019s the company?\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed as the older women rushed to the window and peered out into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see it,\u201d Grammy M complained. She straightened and looked at Brenna. \u201cWas it nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>The two grandmothers exchanged a look of satisfaction, then turned their attention to Katie. \u201cGood-looking and well off,\u201d Grandma Tessa said with a wink. \u201cGood for you, Katie.\u201d</p><p>Brenna looked confused.</p><p>Katie pulled her toward the dining room. \u201cRemember Mia\u2019s boyfriend? You met him around Christmas. Tall, blond hair, blue eyes, a little skinny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re engaged. He and his father have joined us for dinner, and we\u2019re doing the celebration thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! That\u2019s great. So why is that good for you?\u201d</p><p>They stepped into the dining room. A table that seated twenty filled the center of the room. Two hutches lined one adobe wall, while a long buffet sat against another. Two wrought-iron chandeliers illuminated the sparkling crystal and elegant china. Katie sat on an extra chair pushed under the high window.</p><p>\u201cGod is punishing me,\u201d she said, and told Brenna about her attempt not to be bugged about her current boyfriend-free status.</p><p>Brenna covered her mouth to hold back hysterical laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d Katie told her.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but it is. Something like that would only happen to you. So how bad was it? Did the Grands completely humiliate you when he walked in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Brenna sank down next to her. \u201cOh, Katie. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Katie glared at her sister. \u201cYeah. Sorry you missed the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that, too.\u201d Brenna touched her arm. \u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot me now.\u201d</p><p>Francesca came into the dining room. \u201cSo you two are hiding out here? What did I miss?\u201d</p><p>Brenna rose and hugged her twin. \u201cKatie was telling me about her recent humiliation. I think it\u2019s pretty funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d Katie said glumly.</p><p>Francesca shrugged. \u201cSo he knows you think he\u2019s hot. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>Katie couldn\u2019t believe she was even asking. \u201cI have to work with the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll pay more attention to your legs than what you say. What\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he isn\u2019t the least bit interested in my legs. Which makes all this not just humiliating, but also pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m willing to bet he was interested.\u201d Brenna sat back down and took Katie\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cI think you should sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>Katie stared at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep? Have sex? Get laid? It can\u2019t have been so long that you\u2019ve forgotten the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant, I just can\u2019t believe you\u2019re saying it. Zach is not a nice man. He\u2019s shallow and superficial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, those two characteristics are the same,\u201d Francesca said helpfully. \u201cAnd perfect qualities for a one-night stand. Besides, you don\u2019t know him well enough to be sure.\u201d</p><p>Katie glared at her, then returned her attention to Brenna. \u201cWhy would you suggest that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you obviously want to. Katie, you\u2019ve been a good girl all your life. We all have. Maybe it\u2019s time to be bad.\u201d</p><p>Katie pulled her hand free. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. If my punishment for one little lie was that swift and severe, I\u2019d hate to think what would happen if I actually did something wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Zach is everything you say, maybe it would be worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost your mind,\u201d Katie told Brenna. \u201cYour brain fell out of your head while you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Francesca stretched. \u201cDon\u2019t dismiss Brenna\u2019s suggestion. Zach may not give you the happily-ever-after romance you\u2019re looking for, but he\u2019d be good for some hot, quickie sex. Brenna\u2019s married and I don\u2019t date, so it\u2019s up to you to provide us all with the vicarious thrill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not possible. For one thing, he\u2019s a new client. The job is huge and could easily take my company to the next level. I\u2019m not going to mess with that. For another\u2014in case you\u2019ve forgotten\u2014his son is marrying our sister. That makes him an in-law. I can hardly spend the next forty years sitting across from him at Christmas and Thanksgiving, knowing we\u2019ve seen each other naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Francesca started to protest, but Katie cut her off with a flick of her wrist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a double yellow line,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Brenna and Francesca looked first at each other, then at her. \u201cWant to explain that?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. You can cross one yellow line, no problem. But if you cross two, things get ugly.\u201d</p><p>Francesca grinned. \u201cKatie, honey, we\u2019re talking about sex, not a moving violation.\u201d</p><p>Katie wanted to pound their heads together. Fortunately she was saved from coming up with a response by Brenna\u2019s groan. \u201cGeez, Francesca, do you have to be so damn skinny? You\u2019ve lost more weight, haven\u2019t you? Let me guess. You\u2019ve been so busy, you\u2019ve forgotten to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens,\u201d Francesca said, sounding only a little defensive.</p><p>\u201cNot to me.\u201d Brenna poked at her own thigh. \u201cI can honestly say that I\u2019ve never missed a meal by being too busy. There\u2019s always time for pasta. It\u2019s these Italian genes. Every mouthful heads directly south of my waist. Why couldn\u2019t I take after Grammy M like you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Katie studied her sisters. Francesca was taller, slimmer than her twin, with small bones and lighter eyes. Brenna took after Grandma Tessa and Grandpa Lorenzo. Large bones filled out her five-foot, seven-inch frame. She had thick dark hair, brown eyes, and olive skin. Despite her Irish name, she appeared to be all Italian.</p><p>\u201cStop whining,\u201d Katie said. \u201cYou\u2019re both pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I outweigh my taller twin by nearly thirty-five pounds,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cYou\u2019re tiny, too. I hate you both.\u201d</p> <p>The sound of footsteps in the hallway broke up the conversation. Their father and Grandpa Lorenzo entered with Zach, Mia, and David. Katie introduced Brenna and Francesca, then wished she could excuse herself to the other side of the planet. But no. Seconds later Grammy M was urging everyone to their seats. And just as she\u2019d promised, she put Katie directly across from Zach so her oldest granddaughter could spend the entire meal reliving the humiliation.</p><p>Dinner with the Marcelli family was like a scene out of a Merchant Ivory film, Zach thought nearly an hour later. A beautiful setting filled with charming, interesting, slightly odd characters in nice clothes, all accompanied by classical opera in the background. He had a sudden yearning to go find a Starbucks and take a call on his cell phone.</p><p>They were a party of eleven at a table built for a much larger group, so there was plenty of space between each place setting. Dozens of dishes lined the center of the table\u2014each filled with something more delicious than the next. He hadn\u2019t known there were that many ways to serve pasta. And even better than the food was the wine.</p><p>He took another drink, appreciating the fullness of the Cabernet, the rich middle and mellow finish. The family served their own private blend. The handwritten label contained notes about year of harvest, location in the vineyard, the type of barrel, and how long it had been aged.</p><p>Lorenzo Marcelli noticed Zach\u2019s interest.</p> <p>\u201cWe make a few cases the old-fashioned way,\u201d the patriarch of the family explained, raising his voice to be heard from his seat at the head of the table. \u201cThey\u2019re pressed separately from the main harvest and then aged. This is for family.\u201d</p><p>Mia, sitting next to Zach, giggled. \u201cGrandpa means that someone stomped the grapes with his feet.\u201d</p><p>Brenna smiled at her sister. \u201cMia\u2019s not into the process\u2014only the product. Crushing the grapes by hand...or by foot, as it were...is a more delicate way to achieve the end result. Less juice is extracted from the grapes. Most harvests are pressed by massive machines that can crush a grape to sawdust. We don\u2019t go to that level, but for our commercial wines the old ways are too expensive and slow.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo turned to Brenna. \u201cYou remember.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI still love the grapes, Grandpa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you here? Working with me? Of all your sisters you\u2019re the only one with the passion for what we do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to be in L.A. You know that. Jeff\u2019s medical training was there and now his practice is. I\u2019m married. My place is with my husband. Haven\u2019t you always taught us that?\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo snorted, obviously unconvinced. Lorenzo\u2019s wife, sitting at the opposite end of the table, flapped her napkin at her husband and her granddaughter. \u201cZach does not want a lesson in wine making. You can be boring another time. Tonight we celebrate the young lovers.\u201d</p><p>Her beatific smile made Zach uncomfortable. His half hour or so alone with Mia\u2019s father and grandfather hadn\u2019t given him the opportunity to casually discern opinions on the potential union. Instead Lorenzo had talked about the land, showing Zach a map of the winery grounds.</p><p>Since sitting down to dinner, however, the family had offered multiple toasts to David and Mia\u2019s happiness. Didn\u2019t anybody else think the marriage was a damn stupid idea?</p><p>He studied the various family members. Mia\u2019s parents seemed engrossed in each other, as were Mia and David. Not wanting to observe young love in full bloom gave him plenty of time to check out the rest of the family.</p><p>He glanced at the Marcelli daughters. Francesca had the face and the body of a cover model. She reminded him of Ainsley, his ex-wife, and he instantly dismissed her as high maintenance. Brenna, the only married sister, seemed torn between her devotion to her husband and the pull of the family business. Which left Katie.</p><p>Katie, who sat across from him but refused to look at him. Katie, who had apparently told her family all about their meeting in such terms that her grandmothers had practically picked out china patterns. Katie, who had great legs and the kind of mouth that made a man fantasize about being taken advantage of.</p><p>Kathleen Elizabeth Marcelli\u2014age twenty-eight, never married. She had a bachelor\u2019s degree in business from UCLA, and had started working for a party planner/organizer type during college. Five years ago Katie bought out the client list and opened Organization Central. She had three full-time employees, seven working part-time.</p> <p>No illegal vices\u2014from what he could find out, no vices at all. She was smart, organized, reasonably successful, and while she visited her family regularly, she didn\u2019t make them her life.</p><p>He\u2019d hired her to get her in his corner. Based on the chemistry clicking between them, all was going according to plan.</p><p>At least the wedding wasn\u2019t for a few months. That would give Zach time to stop things. His son was too important for him to lose this battle. He was the best at what he did for a reason.</p><p>\u201cSo, Zach,\u201d Lorenzo said, motioning with his wineglass. \u201cWe have the big wedding this summer, then next year, the bambinos, eh?\u201d</p><p>Babies? Zach nearly spit. Mia and David were still babies themselves. Damn. The last thing he needed was Mia getting pregnant.</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cGrandpa, I have school. I\u2019m not getting pregnant until I have my degree.\u201d</p><p>Tessa frowned. \u201cBut being a mother is more important than a few classes at a university. You\u2019re a woman, Mia, not a computer. You don\u2019t need to fill yourself with more learning. You\u2019re a smart girl. Wouldn\u2019t you like to have some babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time for that,\u201d Zach said hastily, earning a grateful smile from Mia.</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d Colleen Marcelli, the girls\u2019 mother, spoke up. \u201cI had Katie when I was nineteen and the twins the following year. But Mia didn\u2019t come along until ten years later. I have to say, that pregnancy was a lot more difficult. A woman\u2019s body is built to have children early.\u201d</p><p>Even petite, grandmotherly Mary-Margaret had an opinion. \u201cI suppose if you\u2019re waitin\u2019 until summer to get married, there\u2019s no hope of an unexpected bundle of joy?\u201d</p><p>Zach nearly choked.</p><p>\u201cWe need a son,\u201d Lorenzo said, pounding his fist on the table.</p><p>Zach glanced from the old man to his equally aging wife. Even with all the advances in fertility research, there was no way that was going to happen.</p><p>\u201cBrenna.\u201d Lorenzo turned his attention to his granddaughter. \u201cYou\u2019re married nine years and no babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa, we\u2019ve had this discussion before. Jeff had to get through all his medical training first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBambinos come first,\u201d Lorenzo insisted. \u201cBesides, he\u2019s a doctor now. Why are you still so skinny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only,\u201d Brenna muttered.</p><p>\u201cMy granddaughters\u2014you all let me down. Katie\u2014my beautiful Katie. Why haven\u2019t you found a nice boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorenzo,\u201d his wife warned. \u201cLeave the girls alone.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. \u201cFrancesca\u2014you have a face like an angel. For many years you mourned the loss of your husband, but it is time to move on.\u201d He motioned to the table. \u201cOnly little Mia goes out of her way not to break her old grandfather\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPop, back off,\u201d Marco told his father. \u201cIf the girls are happy, we\u2019re all happy.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo didn\u2019t look convinced.</p><p>Zach glanced at the sisters. Their expressions were identical masks of long-suffering. Apparently this wasn\u2019t an unusual outburst. Still, he felt a strong need to grab David and make a break for the car.</p><p>Their mother straightened in her chair. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly finished with the new labels. They\u2019re very impressive,\u201d she said, and suddenly everyone was talking about wine.</p><p>Mia leaned toward him. \u201cWelcome to the family. It\u2019s not always like this. Just when someone mentions something about a wedding.\u201d</p><p>Great. So in addition to worrying about David screwing up his life, Zach also had some concerns about mental stability in the older generation.</p><p>When the meal ended, the sisters quickly cleared the table. Brandy was brought out, along with trays of cookies.</p><p>\u201cBring in some paper,\u201d Colleen called. \u201cI don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to all be together again. Let\u2019s work out some of the details of the wedding while we have the chance.\u201d</p><p>Zach swore silently. \u201cIsn\u2019t there plenty of time for that? Maybe we should enjoy the engagement for a while.\u201d</p><p>Colleen looked at him as if he\u2019d lost his frontal lobe. \u201cZach, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a whiz in the courtroom, but like the average male, you don\u2019t know anything about planning a wedding. Think of it as invading a small country. We need to plan, organize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShop,\u201d Katie offered helpfully as she stepped back into the dining room. She carried several pads of paper and a handful of pens. Instead of circling to her seat, she paused by his chair, and for the first time since dinner had started, actually looked at him. \u201cYou might want to take notes, just so that later, when you\u2019re finally home, you don\u2019t try to convince yourself that this was all just a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>A smile teased at the corner of her full mouth, making him want to smile in return. When he\u2019d met her in his office, he\u2019d thought she was attractive and sexy as hell. Now he was impressed by her ability to recover. Most women he knew couldn\u2019t get over a broken fingernail in less than twenty-four hours. Katie had survived what even he had to admit had to have been a pretty humiliating experience, and she\u2019d done so with grace and style.</p><p>She was tough. He liked that. He took the pad of paper she offered, along with a pen. As she turned away, he admired the curve of her hip and the length of bare leg exposed by her dress. Tough, together, and more than a pretty face. Exactly the sort of ally he needed to keep his son safe.</p><p>The rest of the sisters returned to the dining room. All the women grabbed pads from Katie.</p><p>Mia knelt on her chair. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about July,\u201d she said, drawing a big heart in the center of her paper. \u201cMaybe the nineteenth.\u201d</p><p>Six pens dutifully scratched out the date. Zach\u2019s good humor faded. Ally or not, how the hell was he going to stop this damn wedding?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have the ceremony here,\u201d Marco, Mia\u2019s father said. \u201cThe vineyards will be beautiful then, and all the flowers will be in bloom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn arch by the east garden,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Husband and wife smiled at each other. Zach\u2019s stomach knotted. Until then, Marco hadn\u2019t said much, and Zach had been holding out hope that at least one person in the Marcelli family had a brain. Unfortunately Marco seemed just as enthused by the idea of the wedding as everyone else.</p><p>He glanced at David. \u201cThis is moving pretty fast. You okay with this?\u201d</p><p>His son beamed. \u201cIt\u2019s great, Dad. Didn\u2019t I tell you this was the best family?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah. Just peachy, Zach thought grimly.</p><p>\u201cWe were thinking of afternoon for the ceremony,\u201d Mia continued, after kissing David\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cLate afternoon,\u201d Tessa said from her end of the table. \u201cYou\u2019ll want a nice dinner. We could have it outside. Lorenzo, do we have enough champagne?\u201d</p><p>He dismissed the question with a wave. \u201cWhat kind of man would I be to not have enough champagne for my youngest granddaughter\u2019s wedding?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In a surprisingly short period of time, the family had worked through a number of points. At this rate the wedding would be planned by ten that night. If they were going to work fast, he would have to work faster.</p><p>Mia drew more hearts on her paper. \u201cI haven\u2019t had time to start looking for dress ideas yet, Grammy M. Maybe we can go out next week.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s petite Irish grandmother shook her head. \u201cMy hands aren\u2019t steady enough anymore,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s time for someone else to be in charge.\u201d She turned to the granddaughter sitting next to her and clasped Katie\u2019s hands. \u201cKatie will make your dress.\u201d</p> <p>Make? Zach blinked stupidly. Couldn\u2019t they just buy it...and return it when the wedding was canceled?</p><p>There was a second of silence, followed by an explosion of conversation. Mia raced around David to hug and kiss her sister. Colleen wiped away a tear. Katie simply looked stunned.</p><p>Apparently not, he thought grimly.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, Grammy?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. You were always the most patient and the best seamstress. You\u2019ll make your sister a beautiful dress.\u201d</p> <p>Mia pulled Katie from her chair and hugged her again. \u201cWe can go shopping together and find the absolutely best pattern and then come home and make it. I\u2019m so happy!\u201d</p><p>Chairs were pushed back as the family collected for a group hug. Once again all Zach wanted to do was grab his kid and bolt for freedom. Instead a surprisingly wiry Grandma Tessa pulled him to his feet, where he was ushered into the crowd.</p><p>David owed him for this, he told himself as Lorenzo grabbed him by both arms and kissed his cheeks. David owed him big time.</p><p>4</p><p>Z ach and David didn\u2019t escape until well after midnight, although Zach doubted his son viewed their leaving as an escape. David had seemed genuinely sad to go.</p><p>Zach congratulated himself on having the foresight to have his assistant, Dora, make reservations at a nearby hotel. After the post-dinner brandies, not to mention an impromptu sing-along with a Barber of Seville CD, he was in no shape to face the long drive back to Los Angeles.</p> <p>Instead he and David bedded down in adjoining rooms in a small beach-front hotel that had probably been fashionable back in the nineteen-forties.</p><p>He\u2019d barely turned out the lights and shifted on a mattress that had seen better days when he heard footsteps rustling on the carpet. He clicked the light back on.</p><p>David stood in the doorway between their rooms. Sometimes his son seemed so grown-up. He was capable and competent. But tonight, wearing the hotel\u2019s too-big bathrobe, with his hair mussed and a thousand questions in his eyes, he looked like a little boy. Zach shoved several pillows behind his back so he could sit up, then motioned to the room\u2019s only chair.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about it,\u201d he said.</p><p>David shifted his weight from foot to foot, then slowly headed for the dark blue armchair. He sat down, legs parted, hands hanging between his knees.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you think?\u201d he asked, not quite looking at his father.</p><p>Zach considered the question. There was no way he was going to tell his son what he really thought about anything. \u201cThey\u2019re nice people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d David glanced up, his expression hopeful. \u201cI really like them all,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI mean Mia\u2019s great and I love her a lot, so the family\u2019s just a bonus, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Kind of like finding a plastic race car in the cereal box.\u201d</p><p>David grinned. \u201cExactly. I like spending time there.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. Zach waited patiently, knowing that his son would get to whatever he had to say eventually.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember my grandmother very well,\u201d David admitted softly, speaking of Zach\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cYou were what, six, when she died?\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cAnd I never met your dad, or my mom\u2019s parents.\u201d</p><p>Zach figured the day had been crappy enough without him having to think about Ainsley, or his ex-in-laws.</p><p>\u201cI really like the idea of a big family, Dad,\u201d David continued. \u201cIt took me three visits to figure out Mia\u2019s grandparents. Grandpa Lorenzo is always talking about vines and grapes. I don\u2019t get the whole wine thing, but it\u2019s fun to listen. He tells great stories about going back to Europe during the Second World War and smuggling out cuttings from French and Italian vineyards. Mia\u2019s grandparents found these really old architecture plans based on some house for a Spanish nobleman and used them to design the house.\u201d</p><p>Zach listened without saying anything. He was just a single father\u2014a lawyer who worked in an office. No way he could compete with Spanish noblemen and war stories.</p><p>He wanted to slam his fist against a wall and demand a fair trial. He\u2019d done the best he could. Ainsley had been the least maternal woman known to the human race, and when she\u2019d bailed, he\u2019d been left alone with a child. He and his son had grown up together. Sometimes Zach even allowed himself to think he\u2019d done a damn fine job.</p><p>\u201cI was an only child as well,\u201d he said casually. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to want a big family. But we\u2019ve done okay together.\u201d</p><p>David swallowed uncomfortably. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not. You\u2019re saying that your attraction to Mia isn\u2019t just because she\u2019s a pretty girl who makes your heart beat faster.\u201d</p><p>David nodded.</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t want to hear that. It meant breaking them up was going to be more difficult than he\u2019d first thought.</p><p>\u201cYou were really great tonight,\u201d his son said. \u201cI could tell you were sort of, you know, uncomfortable, but you did good.\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t know if he should be pleased or insulted by the compliment. \u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it. You\u2019re trying to keep an open mind about everything.\u201d</p><p>Warning bells went off in Zach\u2019s head. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>David crossed and uncrossed his legs. \u201cJust that you\u2019re not a huge fan of the whole wedding thing. At least not for me.\u201d He grinned. \u201cDad, you haven\u2019t said anything. But I\u2019m your kid. I know you. I\u2019d have to be a complete moron not to guess that you\u2019re a little nervous about the idea of me getting married. You probably want to ship me off to an island somewhere on the other side of the planet. I appreciate that you\u2019re really listening to me, to what I want.\u201d</p><p>He rose and headed for the open door between their rooms. \u201cSome parents would lay down the law, but you\u2019re willing to let me go my own way. I know you think I\u2019m making a mistake, but you\u2019re wrong. Mia is absolutely the one for me. So thanks for being supportive.\u201d He gave a small wave. \u201cNight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Zach could barely speak, what with the way his throat was closing. When David climbed into his bed and turned out the light, Zach clicked off his as well. But he didn\u2019t slide back down in bed. Instead he stared into the darkness and mentally ran through every swear word he\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t fooled David for a minute. He supposed it was a testament to his child\u2019s intelligence...or maybe it was just that he hadn\u2019t done a good job of concealing his feelings. Either way, he was going to have to be more careful than ever. If David was alerted, he would be on guard. Zach was still determined to stop the wedding at any cost. The trick would be getting David to think it was his own idea.</p><p>\u201cMy client had an excellent grade-point average while she was in college,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>Wayne Johnson, the attorney for the opposition, sighed in mock disgust. \u201cShe was studying sculpture. Are you trying to tell us that she plans to get a master\u2019s in sculpturing? I wasn\u2019t aware there were that many openings for professional sculptors. Or is it sculptress?\u201d</p><p>Zach ignored the question. He knew Wayne. They\u2019d been on opposite sides of the negotiating table many times. The thing Zach liked most about Wayne was that the man didn\u2019t learn. He had yet to figure out that Zach always won.</p><p>Zach glanced at his client, a small, quiet woman in her forties. Her husband, a successful accountant with a practice specializing in movie stars and doctors, had left her for a much younger woman. He wanted to dump the old and used, and marry the trophy wife. Obviously it didn\u2019t bother him that the future Mrs. Allen Franklin was two years older than his oldest child.</p><p>Zach turned away from Wayne and spoke to the judge overseeing their mediation session.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Franklin was a promising young artist when she met Mr. Franklin. She\u2019d just received her B.A. and was expecting to start on her master\u2019s in the fall. She\u2019d had two showings, had sold several pieces, and had been given a grant. When Mr. Franklin proposed, he requested that they start a family right away and asked my client to give up her art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could have said no,\u201d Wayne pointed out.</p><p>\u201cShe could have. Or Mr. Franklin could have respected her talent. Your honor, my client\u2019s request that her husband support her while she returns to college to get an advanced degree isn\u2019t unreasonable. She plans to get a master\u2019s in elementary education, thereby allowing herself to find a job and be a contributing member of society.\u201d</p><p>Zach knew that the request was a little unusual, but it was what his client wanted.</p><p>Wayne slapped several folders onto the conference table. \u201cYour Honor, Mr. Stryker and his client have passed from reasonable to greedy. It\u2019s one thing to talk about helping Mrs. Franklin get back on her feet, but between the request for alimony and the ridiculous property split, Mr. Franklin is the one who is going to need assistance.\u201d</p><p>The judge looked at Zach.</p><p>Zach shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. Franklin feels he doesn\u2019t have the resources necessary to aid his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does not.\u201d</p><p>Zach shifted a file from the bottom of the stack in front of him to the top. \u201cPerhaps if Mr. Franklin were to liquidate some of the assets he purchased for his new lifestyle, he wouldn\u2019t feel the financial pinch quite so much.\u201d Zach casually pushed the folder toward the judge. \u201cAssets he purchased with community property, Your Honor. Actually, under California law, they\u2019re technically half Mrs. Franklin\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Zach gave Wayne a slight smile. Both the lawyer and his client paled suddenly. Mr. Franklin had a heated conversation with his attorney that wasn\u2019t as quiet as it should have been. Zach caught a couple of choice phrases along the lines of \u201cYou told me no one would find out about the beach house\u201d and \u201cYou mean I have to pay her for half the jewelry I bought Sara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Franklin was not as forthcoming as he could have been on his financial statements,\u201d Zach said unnecessarily.</p><p>The judge was not amused.</p><p>An hour later they reached a settlement that would ensure that Mrs. Franklin would have ample funds to support her while she studied for her advanced degree. If she didn\u2019t spend her days on Rodeo Drive, she wouldn\u2019t need to work again at all.</p><p>After Wayne and a very angry Mr. Franklin stormed past them, Zach turned to his client.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you could get it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me your wish list. I did my best to achieve it. Your husband was stupid. Hiding money in a community property state is guaranteed to make the courts angry. Once I found out what he\u2019d done, I knew we\u2019d win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo me a favor,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cLet me guess. Pay your bill on time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going after your ex-husband for that. Don\u2019t forget the judge slapped him with the fees. Actually, the favor is\u2014before you get married again, give me a call. I\u2019ll write up a prenup that will protect you so you don\u2019t have to fight so hard next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting married again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Just give me a call.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They shook hands, then parted. Zach headed for the elevators that would take him to the underground car park. He would bet money that they were both remarried within two years and divorced the following year. He\u2019d seen it happen a thousand times. On one hand, it kept him in business...on the other hand, it was a hell of a way to run the world.</p><p>Katie walked into the waiting area three minutes before her appointment with Zach. She\u2019d crammed her briefcase as full as possible, but all her notes weren\u2019t going to ease the fluttering panic in her stomach.</p><p>There weren\u2019t enough words in the universe to describe how much she didn\u2019t want to be here. Not after what had happened nearly a week ago at the hacienda. She still cringed whenever she thought of it, which was about forty-seven times a day.</p> <p>The thing was, she couldn\u2019t tell Zach the truth. If she explained why she\u2019d mentioned him to her family, he would think she was lying, trying to downplay her attraction to him. Saying she wasn\u2019t attracted to him would mean lying, and she wasn\u2019t about to risk more cosmic interference. Saying she was attracted, but not sure she liked him, was just plain tacky.</p><p>\u201cDeep, cleansing breaths,\u201d she murmured to herself. \u201cI am confident, professional, and more than ready to take on this challenge.\u201d</p><p>After squaring her shoulders, she reminded herself of her greater purpose. This fund-raiser would put her company onto the A-list of party planners. Once there she would be able to expand, pick and choose her jobs, and start saving to buy a house. All that was more than worth a few awkward moments with a client. Besides, rather than focusing on what she\u2019d done, she should think about what she had to do. Putting together a charity event of this magnitude in an impossibly short period of time would tax her and her staff to the point of insanity. If she wanted to sweat something, worrying about the party was a whole lot more productive.</p><p>Feeling completely calm and centered, not to mention attractive yet professional in a forest green suit and another pair of killer heels, Katie crossed to the receptionist and gave her name. The young woman there told her to go right back. Mr. Stryker was expecting her.</p><p>Zach\u2019s assistant sat outside his office. She stood up as Katie approached and eyed her bulging suitcase.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he volunteered to be in charge of the annual fund-raiser,\u201d Dora Preston said cheerfully. \u201cIf he starts to glaze over when you talk about the details, slam something hard against the coffee table. Loud noises help keep him awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Katie really appreciated the other woman\u2019s friendly nature, but didn\u2019t think she would be using the advice. If Zach fell asleep during her presentation, she would take it as a sign that she was supposed to run for the hills and never be heard from again.</p><p>\u201cGo right in,\u201d Dora said.</p><p>Katie nodded once, took a deep breath, sucked in her stomach, and opened the door to Zach\u2019s office.</p><p>He sat behind his desk, engrossed in paperwork.</p> <p>\u201cKnock, knock,\u201d she said as she entered.</p><p>He glanced up, then rose. He was even better looking than she remembered. When he smiled, she nearly stumbled, what with all her blood rushing around her body like so many lost bumper cars.</p><p>Just perfect, she thought, more annoyed than embarrassed. Couldn\u2019t the horror of their previous encounter have chased away her visceral and inappropriate hormonal response to him? Was this fair?</p><p>\u201cKatie.\u201d He sounded delighted to see her.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming by.\u201d He walked around the desk and moved close to her.</p><p>\u201cAh, no problem.\u201d</p><p>She was about to point out that the meeting had been her idea when he put his hand on her upper arm and guided her toward the leather sofas in the corner.</p> <p>\u201cCoffee, tea, soda?\u201d he asked as she settled onto the slick seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said as she set her briefcase next to her.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Zach sank onto the sofa next to hers. As they were both sitting on the side closest to the corner table, they were actually fairly near each other. Knees had the potential for bumping. Which, of course, she noticed.</p><p>For about three or four seconds she thought about pretending the other night had never happened. But there wasn\u2019t just the party to consider. After David and Mia were married, Zach would be her brother-in-law\u2019s father. She didn\u2019t need to deal with undercurrents for the next fifty years.</p><p>\u201cI have to explain something,\u201d she said.</p><p>He leaned toward her, his forearms resting on his thighs. His expression was attentive, his dark blue eyes fixed on her face. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Her throat went dry. \u201cI, um. I need to apologize for what happened. You know. At my folks\u2019 house.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth twitched. Then the other. Then his whole mouth curved in a smile. A lock of dark hair fell across his forehead in a sexy, mussed look that tempted her to push it back into place.</p><p>\u201cYou mean when you told your entire family you were hot for me?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t exactly what I said, but yes. It was completely unprofessional of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I would have thought a man like you would get tired of women saying things like that. They practically line up to be taken advantage of. Doesn\u2019t it get old?\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words were out, she wanted to call them back. She slapped a hand over her mouth, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Oh, God, she hadn\u2019t really said that, had she?</p><p>Horror and humiliation blended into what was becoming a familiar feeling. Zach leaned back in the sofa and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve been doing your research,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell if he was just annoyed or completely furious. \u201cSort of. A little. I do like to know about the people I\u2019ll be working with, and you have something of a reputation.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mean that in a bad way. I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t seem to engage my brain and mouth together.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cIs it circumstances or me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe both.\u201d</p><p>Humor brightened his eyes. \u201cWant to start over? Clean slate on both sides.\u201d</p><p>In this case she wanted more than a fresh start; she wanted to travel back in time and do the whole thing over. But as that wasn\u2019t available, she would accept what he offered.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand. \u201cThen we\u2019ll ignore the fact that you think I\u2019m irresistibly sexy, and I\u2019ll do my best not to come on to you. Deal?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been about to put her hand in his when his words sank in. Come on to her? As in he thought she was...well, attractive?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she had a low opinion of herself. Men found her appealing. She had dates, boyfriends. But Zach wasn\u2019t just any guy. He was a world-class player. His women were starlets and models. In the smorgasbord of women available to him, she was little more than an appetizer.</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she said and slid her hand against his.</p><p>The heat that flared, along with the sparks arcing up her arm, nearly made her laugh. Okay, one problem solved, but the issue of the wayward hormones needed more work.</p><p>She pulled her hand free and reached for her briefcase. \u201cReady to talk about the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019ll distract me from the hell of my day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStressful case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMediation.\u201d He dropped his hands to his lap. \u201cThe couple had been married for over twenty years. The wife stayed home to take care of the kids. He hit his forties and decided he wanted a new-and-improved spouse. Fairly typical.\u201d</p><p>Katie wasn\u2019t sure what to do with the information. \u201cWho were you representing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer. She got a decent settlement. I guess the real question is why she married the guy in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because she loved him.\u201d</p><p>Zach looked at her. His dark blue eyes seemed to flash with anger, and there was a cynical twist to his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t see a whole lot of that in my line of work. In my world, relationships don\u2019t work, and the kids nearly always pay the price for that.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ll step off my soapbox for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re obviously concerned about the people you deal with. I think that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cKatie, I\u2019m a mean, hard-assed, son-of-a-bitch lawyer. I don\u2019t do \u2018concerned.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He was right\u2014she\u2019d heard he was a tough opponent. Word had it he was smart, ruthless, and never gave away any advantage. Between that and his reputation with the ladies, she\u2019d assumed he was self-absorbed and someone she really wouldn\u2019t like. But he\u2019d surprised her twice in less than five minutes. First with his gracious offer to forget what had happened at the hacienda, and just now with his comments about kids getting caught in their parents\u2019 problems.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d judged him too quickly. Maybe there was a real person under the sharkskin. Maybe she liked him.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Enough about the law. I have a very large charity event to plan.\u201d She pulled several folders from her briefcase. \u201cI looked over the notes you gave me and went to see the hotel that had been reserved. Apparently no one had arranged for a contract, so nothing was firm.\u201d</p><p>A tickle of nerves swept across her chest, but she ignored it. She was the professional here. Zach had hired her to make the fund-raiser a success. That\u2019s what she intended to do.</p><p>\u201cI want to change venues,\u201d she told him. \u201cThe original hotel is older, and while the architecture is lovely, the ballroom isn\u2019t very big. With a crowd of over two thousand people to consider, space is important. We need spillover rooms. Also, I thought it would be fun to make the locale more of an integral part of the party, rather than just the background.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Zach to check for some kind of a reaction, but his expression was unreadable. Assuming silence meant agreement, she passed him a brochure.</p><p>\u201cThe West Side Royale Hotel?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s new, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRefurbished. What I like best about it are the gardens. They start by the ballroom and flow throughout the property. The man in charge is a botanist. He\u2019s done amazing work. A cancellation cleared the weekend we\u2019re interested in. They\u2019ve got a big hole in their schedule, and they\u2019re willing to deal to get it filled. They\u2019re offering a great price to give us the rooms we need.\u201d</p><p>Zach flipped through the brochure. The hotel had been done Art Deco style.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean rooms?\u201d he asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t there one ballroom?\u201d</p><p>Okay, now came the selling part. This is where she proved she was worth what he was paying her. \u201cThere can be. That\u2019s more traditional. I\u2019ve pulled articles on different fund-raisers held in Los Angeles. They\u2019ve ranged from funky with organic food and barefoot guests to elegant black-tie. I wanted something different, something special. Something successful. To that end, I\u2019m thinking of a two-tiered system.\u201d</p><p>Zach raised his eyebrows. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cost of a ticket is a thousand dollars per couple, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The partners set the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that can stay the same. The cost of the party is about two hundred dollars a person, leaving a good chunk of money for the charity. But out of the two thousand to twenty five hundred people who will attend, at least three hundred and as many as five hundred are serious players in the charity game. They give away millions of dollars every year. Why not to your charity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to invite them to the party and then go begging for additional donations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. But you could charge them more up front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She held up a hand. \u201cI\u2019m suggesting that a few hundred special guests receive an invitation to attend the fund-raiser, but that they are invited to a more exclusive party held at the same time. They\u2019ll have the same dinner and the same entertainment, but there will be separate activities both before and after the meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>Katie opened a pale blue folder and unfolded a map of the hotel grounds. She pointed to the main ballroom, and the gardens beyond, then showed a small ballroom flanking the main one.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of games of chance,\u201d she said, \u201cbut not gambling. That\u2019s so overdone. More like carnival games, but instead of winning a goldfish at the ring toss, you could win a diamond bracelet worth, say, five grand. We could do ski vacations in Gstaad and balloon trips in France. If we keep the prizes around five to ten thousand a piece and charge the couples twenty-five thousand to participate, we\u2019re still coming out ahead of the thousand-dollars-a-plate donation.\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t read his face. He was listening and he hadn\u2019t started screaming. She figured that was all good news.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Well, I thought we\u2019d go with a whole dipping-for-charity theme. The menu would be dipping foods and finger foods. A lot of kabobs, which would mean small grills set up all over. We can do all kinds of exotic meats and fun vegetarian kabobs for those who don\u2019t do the animal-product thing. We can grill bread and have make-your-own appetizers, then do chocolates from around the world in fondue pots for dessert. We\u2019d have entertainment in the ballroom, and then put tents in the gardens. Each tent would be a different food station.\u201d</p><p>She stopped talking and surreptitiously crossed her fingers. Yes, it wasn\u2019t the usual kind of party, but Katie figured her best chance of success was to make the event her own rather than trying to do what every other party planner in the city had already done and done well.</p><p>Zach tapped the brochure for the West Side Royale Hotel. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a party like that before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. Different can be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to run it by the partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He smiled\u2014a slow smile that made the corners of his eyes crinkle and her heartbeat zip into an aerobic state.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d he said.</p><p>She nodded briskly, determined not to show her intense relief. \u201cI\u2019m glad. I think it could be fun. At least the larger venue will keep the party from feeling crowded. That seems to be a big problem with mega events.\u201d</p> <p>He tossed the brochure onto the table and settled back into the sofa. With one ankle resting on the opposite knee, he looked dangerous and masculine...or maybe one went with the other. Could a man look masculine without appearing dangerous?</p><p>She found it impossible to stop staring at him, especially when he began loosening his tie. It was only an insignificant length of silk, yet the way his fingers worked the knot, then tugged it free made her thighs go up in flames.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll present the idea to them in the next day or so and get back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. The hotel will hold the facilities until the end of the week. As long as I hear by Friday, we\u2019ll have our space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>She collected her various folders, but left him with the brochure. Their work now concluded, Katie felt she should make her escape as quickly as possible, before she put her foot in it again. Still, one thing continued to bother her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than a little surprised by the coincidence of all this,\u201d she said. \u201cYou hiring me to plan this party. Your son getting engaged to my sister. What are the odds of that?\u201d</p><p>His relaxed posture didn\u2019t change, but she would have sworn something inside of him shifted. He shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cThings like that happen.\u201d</p><p>Until that moment she\u2019d never thought anything else, but suddenly she wondered if there had been some kind of manipulation behind the scenes.</p><p>Don\u2019t be crazy, she told herself. That wasn\u2019t possible...was it?</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t hire me on purpose?\u201d she asked, speaking slowly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hire me because Mia is marrying David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>\u201cUnless I wanted something from you.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. Every nerve ending went on alert and not in a good way. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son is my world, Katie. He\u2019s a good kid. But there\u2019s no way in hell he\u2019s ready to get married.\u201d</p><p>She blinked several times. \u201cWhat? Why are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>He pointed toward her stack of folders. \u201cThis job represents a lot of money to your company. It would change your life. What would happen if word got out that you weren\u2019t up to the task?\u201d</p><p>Her chest tightened. Half-formed sentences flashed through her brain. Nothing made sense. \u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d</p><p>Confusion turned to anger. \u201cLet me get this straight. You deliberately hired me because I\u2019m Mia\u2019s sister. Now you\u2019re telling me if I don\u2019t get Mia to somehow back off from marrying your son, you\u2019ll destroy my company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds melodramatic.\u201d</p><p>Not to her. \u201cDo I have it wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping you achieve your goal. I expect you to help me achieve mine.\u201d</p><p>Outrage joined fury. \u201cMia loves David. You want me to sacrifice my sister\u2019s happiness because you don\u2019t approve?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and pinned her with a gaze that could have cut metal. \u201cIt\u2019s not about approving. It\u2019s about my son\u2019s future. Do you know the odds of a marriage surviving past five years? Any marriage? They\u2019re less than ten percent of that when the couple is under twenty. If you\u2019re so damn worried about your sister\u2019s happiness, think about how well she\u2019ll survive a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This isn\u2019t personal, Katie. I think Mia\u2019s great. But David\u2019s too young to marry anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s eighteen. Isn\u2019t that his decision to make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegally, which is why I haven\u2019t delivered an ultimatum.\u201d</p><p>Of course. Because being upfront wasn\u2019t his style. Katie gritted her teeth. To think she\u2019d actually felt badly about judging him. She\u2019d bought into his nice-guy act, but he was just as much of a slimy player as she\u2019d first thought. And he was trying to ruin her baby sister\u2019s life. The bastard.</p><p>She shoved the folders into her briefcase and snapped it shut. \u201cI appreciate that you\u2019re worried about David. You care about him, just like I care about Mia. But here\u2019s the thing. I won\u2019t go behind my sister\u2019s back. She loves your son and she wants to marry him. That\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>She rose and glared at him. \u201cIf you thought you could force me to do what you want for the price of this job, you were wrong. And if that means you\u2019re going to try ruining me, then have at it. Anyone who would be swayed by your opinion doesn\u2019t matter a damn to me.\u201d</p><p>She started for the door. Her high heels and the thick, plush carpet slowed her down, so it wasn\u2019t a surprise when Zach caught up with her. He grabbed her arm, holding her until she stopped and faced him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>His mouth twisted. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you can\u2019t be bought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He stunned her by grinning. \u201cYou\u2019re tougher than you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, that\u2019s nearly as nice as saying I\u2019m smarter than I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bastard, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot technically, but maybe in spirit.\u201d He released her and shoved his hands into his slacks pockets. \u201cI had to try, Katie. He\u2019s my son. I love him.\u201d</p><p>Two seconds ago she would have sworn there was nothing he could say that would have made her want to do anything but hit him upside the head with a two-by-four. But with six simple words, he knocked the mad right out of her.</p><p>\u201cThen tell him you\u2019re worried. Won\u2019t he listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He already knows what I think.\u201d Zach shook his head. \u201cI tried to keep it from him, but I didn\u2019t do much of a job. He\u2019s determined to marry your sister, and I know it\u2019s going to be a disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never wrong.\u201d</p><p>The mad returned. \u201cI\u2019m guessing no one has ever accused you of being humble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColor me surprised.\u201d She shifted her briefcase to her other hand. \u201cI won\u2019t get between them. David and Mia want to get married, and I think it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you open to persuasion?\u201d</p><p>She hated that her first thought was sexual. This man was slime and she still found him attractive and intriguing. There was definitely something wrong with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll listen,\u201d she said, \u201cbut only if you\u2019ll give equal time to the opposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>As he made his living arguing his side, it didn\u2019t sound fair to her at all.</p><p>\u201cYou still doing the party?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She narrowed her gaze. \u201cAre you going to threaten me again?\u201d</p><p>The smile returned. \u201cI was bluffing. I wanted to see how far I could push you.\u201d</p><p>That had been a bluff? What would he do if he was serious? \u201cDon\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>She reached for the door. \u201cUneasy business associates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping for more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope away,\u201d she said as she stepped into the hallway and walked toward the elevator.</p><p>5</p><p>M ia stepped out of the bridal shop dressing room and headed for the platform in front of the three-way mirror. The stiff satin gown flowed out around her as she walked.</p><p>\u201cShoes will help,\u201d Katie said, grabbing a pair with three-inch heels from a row of bridal pumps in front of the mirror.</p><p>Mia held up her skirt, then slid into the shoes. They were too big. Like a little girl playing dress up, she shuffled the last couple of feet to the platform and stepped up. Katie moved around her, adjusting the dress.</p><p>\u201cHow are you two doing?\u201d the salesperson asked as she breezed in front of the mirror. She tilted her head as she studied Mia. \u201cShe\u2019s just lovely. What a beautiful dress.\u201d</p><p>Katie agreed with her on both counts. The strapless satin gown hugged Mia\u2019s full breasts, rib cage, and waist before flaring out to the floor. The heavy fabric flowed into a train. The dress was a little big on Mia, so Katie reached for a box of pins tucked on a shelf by the side mirror.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d like to see what it would look like if it was fitted,\u201d she said to the saleswoman. \u201cIs that all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>The woman watched for a couple of seconds, then smiled. \u201cYou seem to know exactly what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll leave you two to discuss possibilities.\u201d</p><p>Katie circled Mia, taking in a bit of fabric around the waist, then fluffing out the skirt. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Mia looked at her reflection. \u201cI like the style, but there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d</p><p>Katie nodded. Mia looked like a princess, despite her streaked hair and big eyes. The white satin set off her skin. Yet it didn\u2019t look...perfect.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you like about it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mia shrugged. \u201cThat it\u2019s strapless. I like the lace.\u201d She brushed her hand against the lace sewn across the waist and rising toward her breasts. More lace decorated the hem and the train.</p><p>Katie squinted, trying to imagine her sister walking down the aisle of a church. The way she would move and the dress would move with her. The flow of the fabric. The\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe satin\u2019s too heavy,\u201d she announced. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to look right on you. We should have seen it before. You\u2019re only five foot three and despite having the biggest boobs in the family, you\u2019re really small. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>She hurried back to the dressing room, where they had already tried on and discarded five other wedding gowns. She returned with one covered in tulle and lace.</p><p>It was an off-the-shoulder style that had made Mia\u2019s neck look as wide as a fullback\u2019s. But the fabric was perfect. Lace decorated the bodice of the dress, becoming more scattered closer to the bottom. A lace trim finished the hem.</p> <p>\u201cImagine the dress you\u2019re wearing,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut with this material. It\u2019s soft, it flows better, and it won\u2019t overwhelm you. I would do a band of satin at the top, to give the bodice structure, but the rest of the gown could be in this lacy tulle. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Mia kicked off her shoes and spun around on the platform. \u201cYes. That\u2019s exactly right. It will be perfect for summer, too. I love all the lace.\u201d She beamed at her sister. \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know.\u201d Katie couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cOkay. If you\u2019re sure, then go get changed and we\u2019ll grab some lunch. After that, I want to have you pick out the lace.\u201d</p><p>Forty-five minutes later they sat across from each other at a Beverly Hills bistro. While Katie didn\u2019t normally shop in this part of town, she\u2019d wanted Mia to see as many lovely gowns as possible before making her choice.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about the dress?\u201d Katie asked after they\u2019d given their order. \u201cWe can keep looking.\u201d</p> <p>Her youngest sister tucked her shoulder-length hair behind her ears. \u201cI swear, I love your idea. I\u2019ll have to start working on my arms, though, so they\u2019re buff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty buff now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Mia picked up her soda and took a drink. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the look on David\u2019s face when he sees me walking down the aisle. He\u2019s gonna die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope not.\u201d</p><p>Mia grinned. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d Her smile faded a little. \u201cKatie, are you okay? You\u2019ve been kind of distracted today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Katie nodded because there was no way she was telling the truth. What Zach had done yesterday still made her furious every time she thought about it, which was far too often. Okay, he loved his son and was worried about him, but that didn\u2019t excuse threatening her or wanting her to betray her family.</p><p>Whatever his plan had been, he\u2019d blown it, because she was more determined than ever to see Mia and David happily married.</p><p>\u201cAre we counting calories?\u201d she asked to distract her sister.</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Katie flipped back the white napkin covering the bread basket between them and groaned when the smell of freshly baked rolls drifted to her. She offered the basket to her sister, then took one for herself.</p><p>The flaky crust scattered crumbs everywhere when she tore it in half. Katie braced herself for a religious experience. A dab of sweet butter completed the moment. She took a bite.</p> <p>Heaven. Pure heaven. Who needed men when there was perfect French bread in the world?</p><p>And speaking of men...</p><p>Zach flashed back into her brain. Go away, she told the image. She refused to find him attractive after what he\u2019d done. He was not good-looking, not sexy, and certainly not her type.</p><p>One out of three, she thought wryly. Not bad odds. He\u2019d been a jerk, and she would be wise to forget about him. There was only one problem\u2014a couple of things he\u2019d said had made sense.</p><p>Oh, she didn\u2019t want that to be true, but there it was. Young marriages didn\u2019t often make it.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think it\u2019s strange that our parents have always pushed us to get married so young?\u201d she asked her sister.</p><p>Mia shrugged. \u201cI never thought about it. It\u2019s not really our folks, it\u2019s much more Grandma Tessa and Grandpa Lorenzo. It\u2019s an Italian thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and they want a male heir for the winery.\u201d</p><p>Mia laughed. \u201cGranny M shares that. I couldn\u2019t believe she sounded disappointed when I said I wasn\u2019t pregnant. Most grandparents would be relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ours.\u201d</p><p>Katie thought about all the subtle and not-so-subtle hints she\u2019d received over the years. About how she would be so much happier if she was married and had children of her own. Preferably male children.</p><p>Mia leaned toward her. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they leave the winery to Brenna? She cares about wine making and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna lives in L.A. That makes it hard to run things on a day-to-day basis. I have my own business, Francesca is studying psychology and sociology, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I plan to take over the world,\u201d Mia said lightly. \u201cBrenna is the right one, if you ask me. Now that Jeff is out of medical school, he could start a practice up close to the hacienda. Plus, then we\u2019d get to see them more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. I wonder if they\u2019ve discussed it. Or if Jeff would be interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Mia planted her elbows on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I really like about David. He sees me as an equal. He knows I\u2019m smart and capable and that I have goals. And he\u2019s okay with that.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s words drifted through Katie\u2019s brain. She could hear him saying that Mia and David were too young to make it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a pretty big decision,\u201d she said, even as she hated herself for bringing it up in the first place. \u201cMarriage is forever. I envy you knowing it\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s smile faded as she reached for Katie\u2019s hand. \u201cIs all this wedding talk making you think about Greg?\u201d</p><p>Oops. Not the direction she\u2019d wanted the conversation to go. Ex-fianc\u00e9s should best be forgotten. She squeezed her sister\u2019s fingers. \u201cI\u2019m fine with Greg. To be honest, I\u2019m not sorry we didn\u2019t get married. I don\u2019t think it would have worked. I guess my concern is that you have so much of your life in front of you. I want to make sure you\u2019re marrying David because it\u2019s what you want and not because of family pressure or feeling that it\u2019s time.\u201d She grinned. \u201cAfter all, it would be much easier to rule the world if you were single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can handle a marriage and world domination. I\u2019m a great multitasker.\u201d Mia studied her. \u201cKatie, I love him. He\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever wanted. As for being pressured by the family, that\u2019s impossible to escape. You know. You get hassled every time you walk in the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. I swear I\u2019ve dated every single guy over the age of twenty in a fifty-mile radius. Well, except for the ordained priests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Grandma Tessa didn\u2019t think it was a sin, she\u2019d be dragging them home for you, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of these day\u2019s I\u2019ll find the right man.\u201d</p><p>Mia smiled. \u201cYour own handsome prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I found mine.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked at her sister\u2019s pretty face. Contentment radiated from her expression and happiness brightened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019ll be happy with David,\u201d she said, wondering why she\u2019d ever thought differently. Zach might have his reasons for worrying\u2014in his line of work, who could blame him? But statistics were about other people. Marcelli marriages were forever.</p><p>Mia collected the mail, including a copy of Cosmo in French, and ran up the stairs to her apartment. She\u2019d already seen David\u2019s truck parked on the street, so she knew he was waiting for her. She burst into the front door.</p><p>\u201cWe picked out a dress,\u201d she announced, tossing her mail and backpack on the floor and slamming the door shut behind her.</p><p>David lay stretched out on the sofa. He grinned at her and motioned for her to come closer. \u201cHello to you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>She kicked off her Nikes and straddled him, bending low to kiss him. His arms came around her.</p><p>She loved looking into his face. His eyes were a deep, true blue and made her melt a little inside when she gazed at them. In his arms she felt sure and safe. While everyone in the world thought she was so smart and together, what they didn\u2019t see was she was always afraid of being just the baby. She\u2019d been the baby her whole life, and getting out on her own and growing up hadn\u2019t been easy. With David around, she didn\u2019t have to try so hard.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your day,\u201d she said, brushing his mouth again and feeling heat fill her body.</p><p>He nipped her lower lip. \u201cTell me about the dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. You know that. It\u2019s a surprise. But it\u2019s beautiful and we picked out the fabric and the lace. Katie\u2019s going to make the pattern from a couple of different ones. In the meantime, we all start the beading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat beading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the lace gets beaded by hand. The flower petals are outlined in seed pearls and filled in with little beads. It\u2019s what we do. You know\u2014a tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d He kissed her jaw. \u201cSo who is Robert Anderson?\u201d</p><p>She raised her head. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked first. He called while you were out. There\u2019s a message. Something about him coming out to L.A. in a couple of weeks and wanting to know if you\u2019d like to have dinner.\u201d</p><p>Mia bounced off the sofa to her feet and raced for the machine. Sure enough, the red light blinked steadily.</p><p>\u201cHe called!\u201d she crowed. \u201cHe called, he called, he called.\u201d</p><p>David sat up slowly. \u201cMia, who\u2019s the guy?\u201d</p><p>She spun around and grinned at him. \u201cOh, don\u2019t give me that look. This isn\u2019t personal. It\u2019s about my career. Robert Anderson is that guy I met last summer at the Arabic language course I took. Remember? He went to Georgetown, too. We\u2019ve been e-mailing and he said if he got out here, we could hang out. He\u2019s willing to write me a letter of recommendation to both Georgetown and the State Department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d David looked anything but convinced.</p><p>\u201cDavid, don\u2019t act like that. The man is in his forties. He has a daughter close to my age. Plus he\u2019s married and I met his wife and they\u2019re a totally cool couple. They took me to dinner a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>David didn\u2019t look convinced.</p><p>She hurried back to the sofa and squeezed onto his lap. \u201cYou\u2019re the one I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of you having dinner with other guys.\u201d</p><p>Mia really, really wanted to roll her eyes, but that never led to meaningful conversation with the opposite sex. She also wanted to smack David upside the head. Another bad idea. Instead, she kissed his face, all the while murmuring phrases like \u201clovey dovey\u201d and \u201ckissy wissy.\u201d It usually worked. Just not today.</p><p>He moved her off his lap and set her on the sofa next to him. David might be tall and skinny, but he could sure push her around without breaking a sweat, which was one of the things she really hated about being short.</p><p>\u201cMia, I\u2019m serious,\u201d he said.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m serious, too, David. Robert Anderson is someone who can help me. I\u2019m in my junior year, which means I\u2019ll be applying to grad schools over the summer. Getting into Georgetown isn\u2019t a sure thing. Robert can help. If you\u2019re so concerned that it\u2019s more than just that, then come with us to dinner. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Instantly his face brightened. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind me being there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs they say in the Valley, well, duh. Of course you\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s going to be boring, but if you want to be there, then be there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. Great.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her, but instead of falling into his embrace, she rose and crossed to the window. Once there, she stared out at her view of the side street and the apartment building across the way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t trust me,\u201d she said softly, folding her arms over her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get over that, David, or we\u2019re going to be in trouble.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do trust you.\u201d</p><p>Mia didn\u2019t say anything. Although she and David were the same age, sometimes she felt years older. Maybe all that crap about girls maturing more quickly wasn\u2019t exactly the crap she thought it was.</p><p>\u201cI know things are different for you,\u201d she said, not wanting to fight. \u201cYou\u2019re in your first year of college. You haven\u2019t even picked a major yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She turned to face him. \u201cI\u2019m not being critical. I mean, most kids don\u2019t know what they want when they enter college. I happen to be one of the ones who did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou also started college when you were sixteen. What was that all about?\u201d</p><p>He grinned as he spoke, reminding her that this was a familiar point of discussion. He accused her of being too smart for her own good while she called him a lazy bum who couldn\u2019t pick a direction of study.</p><p>But what if they weren\u2019t really kidding?</p><p>Mia didn\u2019t know where the thought came from. She also didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said intently.</p><p>David rose and crossed the floor. When he reached her, he pulled her close. \u201cI love you, too. I want to be with you for the rest of my life.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned into him, parting her lips for his kiss. When he picked her up to carry her into the bedroom, she found she sometimes quite liked that he was big enough to push her around.</p><p>6</p><p>T he delivery guy from the Thai place arrived thirty seconds before Katie did. Zach paid the bill and added a generous tip for speedy service, then waited by the open front door while Katie parked her convertible in front of his house.</p><p>She turned off the engine, then collected her ever bulging briefcase and stepped out onto the street.</p><p>It was nearly seven, and long since dark. The night was cool and damp. Winter, such as it was, had returned to Southern California, keeping daytime temperatures in the fifties. In deference to the change in season, Katie wore a lightweight coat over slacks. As she approached, street-lights illuminated the red in her hair.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d show up,\u201d he called.</p><p>She stepped onto the walkway. \u201cThis is business. Besides, I don\u2019t scare off that easily.\u201d She glanced at the large bag he held. \u201cAm I too early? I thought you said seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d He held up the bag. Already the smell of Thai food made his mouth water. \u201cIt\u2019s a peace offering.\u201d</p> <p>She sniffed once, then smiled. \u201cI could be persuaded.\u201d</p><p>He was hoping she would say that.</p><p>Zach ushered her into his tall, narrow house. The split level entry led down to the main living area and up toward the bedrooms.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you lived here?\u201d she asked, glancing around. \u201cIt\u2019s a fabulous location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo blocks from the beach with a perfect view,\u201d he said. \u201cDavid and I moved in two years ago. We\u2019d been living on the west side for a few years and wanted a change.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the kitchen and Katie set her briefcase on the granite counter. Bleached birch cabinets lined two walls. Aside from the Sub-Zero freezer and six-burner stove, the previous occupants had left behind a built-in under-the-counter wine cellar and Jenn-Air cooktop in the center island.</p><p>Katie did a slow turn. \u201cI\u2019m not a huge cook, but even I could envy this setup.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cLet me guess. You only order take-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d He set the food on the counter. \u201cLet me take your coat.\u201d</p><p>He moved behind her as she slipped out of her jacket. Beneath, she wore tailored black slacks and a soft-looking sweater in emerald green. She\u2019d piled her long hair on her head, leaving her neck bare.</p><p>Zach draped the coat over his arm, ignoring the scent of Katie\u2019s body and the warmth lingering in her coat. He hung the garment in the hallway closet and returned to the kitchen. He had to keep his mind on business. At least for now.</p><p>But when he found her leaning against the counter, looking at several pictures of David on the refrigerator, he found thoughts of business fading. Instead he focused on the curve of her hip as she rested her weight on one foot, and the way her fingers gracefully skimmed the collection of photos.</p><p>He could imagine those fingers touching other things\u2014namely him. He would do some touching in return. Naked, he thought. He wanted her naked.</p><p>He mentally cuffed himself. Time for a distraction.</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t call me up and tell me to go to hell,\u201d he said.</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cWas I supposed to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have. You were mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been more of a \u2018living well is the best revenge\u2019 kind of person. I\u2019m going to throw you a party so incredible, you\u2019ll have to eat your words.\u201d</p><p>He appreciated that she\u2019d twisted the situation to her own advantage and that she wanted to win.</p><p>\u201cUntil then, let\u2019s eat Thai,\u201d he said, grabbing the bag of food and moving toward the table in the corner. \u201cYou willing to put business on hold until after dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He plied her with noodles and Thai chicken, all the while asking questions about what it was like to grow up at the winery.</p><p>\u201cFour girls,\u201d he said. \u201cAny complaints about not having a brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a sore spot,\u201d she admitted as she scooped up more noodles. \u201cMy grandparents are old-fashioned and want a male heir. That\u2019s why there\u2019s some pressure to marry and have grandkids. Jeff, Brenna\u2019s husband, is a sweetie and we all adore him, but he wasn\u2019t interested in wine. Instead he wanted to be a doctor, if you can believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never married.\u201d</p><p>Her brown eyes widened slightly. \u201cWas that a question or a statement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich isn\u2019t going to get me in trouble?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI think it\u2019s too late for that. As for me being married, I was engaged when I was eighteen, but things didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>She took a bite of food, then chewed. After she swallowed, she said, \u201cHe joined the service three days before the wedding. I always thought it was pretty tacky of Greg to prefer the possibility of going to war over marrying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe dumped you?\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cThank you for putting it so delicately, but yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been about ten years. I\u2019ve managed to get on with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout getting married.\u201d</p><p>She put down her fork. \u201cMarriage is one of those topics we should probably avoid.\u201d</p><p>She held her own with him\u2014he liked that. \u201cSo let\u2019s talk about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour favorite subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Ask me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you prefer to represent in your work?\u201d she asked, leaning back in her chair. \u201cThe husband or the wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take on whoever asks me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t care about being on the side of right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about divorce. There\u2019s almost never a \u2019right\u2019 side. I\u2019ve yet to see a marriage fall apart all because one person is inherently evil. Usually both parties have some claim to the blame. In the case of drugs or alcohol, the nonabusing spouse doesn\u2019t usually deal with his or her problems because the substance issue is bigger than both of them, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought about it,\u201d Katie admitted. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any divorce in our family. I guess we\u2019re just lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuck helps. In my line of work I don\u2019t see very much of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy a divorce lawyer? There are a lot of ways for a lawyer to make a living in this town. Why\u2019d you pick that specialty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move to the living room first,\u201d he said easily, rising, then pulling out her chair for her. \u201cIt will be more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>She reached for the empty plates on the table, but he brushed her hands away. \u201cI\u2019ll get that later.\u201d At her look of surprise, he shrugged. \u201cI can be domestic when the situation calls for it.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on the small of her back. She didn\u2019t move away. Score one for his side, he thought, pleased that she liked being close to him. He didn\u2019t find her nearness a hardship, either, which meant being charming to get his way had plenty of perks. Pleasant working conditions always improved his attitude.</p><p>The sunken living room had west-facing, floor-to-ceiling windows. Katie walked toward them.</p><p>\u201cYou must see amazing sunsets,\u201d she said, staring into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m home in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I lived here, I\u2019d make sure I was home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hacienda overlooks the Pacific. You see the sunsets from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I grew up, so it\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>She started toward the sectional sofa. As she passed a hip-high table, she paused. He saw that her gaze had settled on several framed photographs. Zach shoved his hands into his pockets and waited for the questions. So far everything was going according to plan.</p><p>A beautiful blonde smiled out from one picture. The same woman laughed in two other pictures. She and a much younger Zach were together in a fourth.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stunning,\u201d Katie said, a question in her voice.</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. She\u2019s really lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the outside. On the inside\u2014\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe walked away from David when he was four, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s seen him more than twice since.\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s gold-flecked brown eyes widened. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. How could she not want to be with her child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never wanted children.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, more to figure out how much to tell than because he was reluctant to share his past. He didn\u2019t usually spill his guts to people he just met, but extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary measures. He needed Katie as an ally, but he had to be careful.</p><p>He motioned to the sectional sofa. Katie sank down onto the cushions. Zach settled across from her. He schooled his features into his \u201cI\u2019m concerned but I\u2019m okay\u201d look.</p><p>\u201cI met Ainsley in high school. She was the head cheerleader, prom queen. You know the type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met one or two,\u201d Katie said with a slight smile.</p><p>Zach nodded. \u201cI thought Ainsley was a princess. So I wooed and won her. Boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy gets girl pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Katie winced. \u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust seventeen. We got married. David came along nine months later. It wasn\u2019t how I planned to spend the summer after graduating from high school. But we learned how to be parents. It wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t go into details. There was no point in discussing the fights, the anger that had flared between them as they struggled to take care of their son. They\u2019d both felt trapped. Whatever infatuation they\u2019d once shared had quickly burned away.</p><p>\u201cI had some money from a trust fund,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat paid for our living expenses, although there wasn\u2019t much left over for more than basics. Ainsley\u2019s parents paid for her college. I had a scholarship. Both our moms helped out with daycare. It was still tough.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tough didn\u2019t begin to describe what it had been. Ainsley had made his life a living hell. She\u2019d resented David and being married. She had been young and beautiful, and she wanted to be out in the world.</p><p>\u201cThe day I graduated from college, Ainsley had me served with divorce papers,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cShe\u2019d hired one of the best lawyers in the city. My lawyer had been recommended by a friend. He wasn\u2019t in the same league. Ainsley got everything. I fought for custody of David, which turned out not to be a problem. Not only did she not want to see her son, she wanted compensation for the pain and suffering of having to have a child in the first place. She claimed she\u2019d wanted to have an abortion and that I\u2019d talked her out of it. She even had notes from a clinic visit she\u2019d made while she\u2019d been pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Katie frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Had she wanted an abortion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She never said anything to me. In the same breath she told me she was pregnant, she announced we were getting married. I\u2019d been raised to believe a man took his responsibilities seriously, so I never thought otherwise.\u201d</p><p>He rested his elbows on his knees. \u201cLet\u2019s just say Ainsley got her pound of flesh and then some. I was to come into the lump sum of my trust fund when I turned twenty-five. She got all of that and didn\u2019t have to pay child support. When it was over her lawyer took me aside. He slapped me on the back and told me next time I needed to get a better lawyer. At that moment I vowed to be a better lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked stunned. Zach knew it wasn\u2019t a pretty story, but every word of it was true.</p><p>\u201cSo Ainsley simply disappeared from your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe showed up to collect her checks, but once she had all the money she was due, she disappeared. I heard she moved back East. I don\u2019t care where she is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you keep her pictures out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey matter to David. I packed them away once, but he asked me to let them stay. He has trouble remembering her and the photos help.\u201d</p><p>Katie had never had a child, so she was unable to comprehend the depth of Zach\u2019s feeling for David. Still, there wasn\u2019t a doubt in her mind that this man loved his son with every fiber of his being. His intensity, his steadfastness, not only made her quiver on the inside, they confirmed her belief that Mia had made a good choice. David Stryker had an amazing role model guiding him through life.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d heard Zach\u2019s history, she understood his concerns for the engagement. She approved of his concern, even if she didn\u2019t appreciate his tactics.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell me this to explain your position or to win me to your side?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause threatening me didn\u2019t work? Now you\u2019re going for the heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I getting close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I have extreme respect for your skill level in court. Can you see the other attorneys trembling or do they hide it?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThey try to act cool.\u201d</p><p>Katie leaned back in the sofa. \u201cSo if you\u2019re so smart, why did you tip your hand with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I wanted to see if you would call my bluff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d caved in, you would have accepted the victory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. And solved the wedding problem.\u201d</p> <p>Katie didn\u2019t appreciate her sister\u2019s engagement being referred to as \u201cthe wedding problem,\u201d but she knew what Zach meant.</p><p>\u201cHave you considered that I could rally the entire family to my side?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt crossed my mind, but I\u2019m not worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He smiled slyly. \u201cYou can\u2019t risk your grandmothers and mother resenting me. What if the wedding goes through? I\u2019ll be a part of the family. You wouldn\u2019t want to be responsible for screwing up that relationship.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. She closed it with a conscious thought, but that didn\u2019t stop her from being stunned. \u201cHow did you figure that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen get over things. Women remember forever.\u201d</p><p>He was right, she thought, still amazed. About all of it. Her first instinct had been to call home and let everyone know what he was planning. But she\u2019d reconsidered when she\u2019d realized her mother and grandmothers would hate Zach from that moment on.</p><p>He was good. Maybe too good. She was out of her league with him in more ways than one. He was also annoying, what with always being one step ahead of her.</p><p>Zach stood up suddenly and held out his hand. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll buy you a drink and we\u2019ll talk about your plans for the party.\u201d</p><p>It took her a second to decide if she wanted to switch gears. But what was the point in arguing? \u201cActually you\u2019re supposed to tell me that everyone loved my ideas, that they think I\u2019m so incredibly brilliant that they might have to pay me more, and they\u2019re waiting breathlessly for the event to occur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p><p>After telling herself not to do anything stupid, Katie placed her hand in his.</p><p>Despite having braced herself for the impact, she still felt it all the way down to her toes. Her heart rate quadrupled, her skin flushed, and rational thought fled. She might not trust him, but that didn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t chemistry between them.</p><p>Zach led her back into the kitchen. He released her hand, which allowed her to catch her breath and try to remember what it felt like to be an adult. While he cleared the table, she pulled the paperwork out of her briefcase.</p><p>The good news was that alternating between being annoyed by Zach and being turned on by him kept her from being nervous about planning the party.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you have?\u201d he asked, opening a cupboard and revealing several bottles of liquor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving, so I\u2019ll pass, but please have something yourself. If you pour me ice water in a pretty glass, we can pretend I\u2019m drinking hard stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>They sat down at the table. Katie spread out her various folders, then turned her attention to Zach. They were close enough that she could see the tiny lines by the outside corners of his eyes and the various shades that made up his deep blue irises. He was handsome, and he smelled good. A potent combination.</p><p>\u201cSo talk,\u201d she told him. \u201cTell me the truth\u2014I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of the single malt scotch he\u2019d poured for himself. \u201cThey love your ideas. John\u2019s pregnant wife thinks everything is, and I quote, \u2019Too precious for words.\u2019 That\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he added. \u201cShe also wants you to call her. She has the names of a couple of jewelry designers who would be happy to come up with some original designs for various prizes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I hadn\u2019t been worried exactly, but I\u2019ll admit to being relieved now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had every confidence.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. Was it her imagination, or had he just shifted closer to her?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll, ah, call the hotel in the morning and finalize the contract. Menus will be next. Do we want to schedule a tasting for everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I trust your judgment. And I don\u2019t want to have a heated conversation about flowers, napkin colors, or table placement.\u201d He leaned toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re the expert. Dazzle me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll line things up, make some selections, and then run everything by you. While I\u2019ll agree to skip the massive tasting, there are some things I\u2019m going to want you to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m open to that.\u201d</p><p>His low and seductive voice made her think of tangled sheets, champagne, and chocolate. Was there a more enticing combination? Throw in a good-looking man...preferably dressed in nothing, with an eager-to-please attitude, and an evening couldn\u2019t get much more perfect.</p><p>Just not her evening.</p><p>\u201cSo if threats and heartfelt stories aren\u2019t going to work, you\u2019ll try seduction?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked amused rather than embarrassed. \u201cWill it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>A lesser man would have been rattled by being shot out of the water, she thought. But not Zach. Figures.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d She began to pack up her briefcase. \u201cThat\u2019s all I need for now. I\u2019ll just get out of your hair so you can have the rest of your evening to do whatever it is you do.\u201d</p><p>She half expected him to invite her to stay, and when he didn\u2019t, she tried to be relieved rather than disappointed. She was about fifty percent successful.</p><p>Zach collected her coat, then held it out for her. As she slipped into it, she said, \u201cI know you\u2019re worried about Mia and David, but I wish you\u2019d relax. I thought a lot about what you said, about young marriages failing and I know it happens, but not to everyone. I come from a long line of people who get it right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a worried father,\u201d he said, staring deeply into her eyes and making her want to throw herself at him. \u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good father, too,\u201d she said instead. \u201cTrust that and trust your son. If that doesn\u2019t work, remind yourself that Marcelli marriages never fall apart. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you\u2019re wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be. You can\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off with a kiss. Katie supposed she should have seen it coming, but she hadn\u2019t. One second they\u2019d been talking, and the next she was in his arms, and his mouth had claimed hers.</p><p>The brush of his firm lips sent her senses into a tail-spin. Heat surrounded her, as did need and passion. He didn\u2019t deepen the kiss, which only made her want more, and when he stepped away, she found it impossible to speak.</p><p>He picked up her briefcase and put his arm around her, then led the way to the front door. By the time they reached it, she\u2019d regained the power of speech.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to. Should I apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She tried to work up some righteous indignation, but she tingled too much. \u201cZach, we have a business relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re irresistible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>Pathetically, she wanted him to be telling the truth. Right. Because she was exactly Zach\u2019s type. Not.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t use sex to get what you want from me,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I use it for?\u201d</p><p>She ignored him, grabbed her suitcase, and stalked out of the house.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d he called after her.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI had a good time, too, Katie.\u201d</p><p>She fumed all the way to the car. When she was inside, she put the key in the ignition. The man made her insane.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait to see him again.</p><p>Seed pearls multiplied in the night. At least that was Katie\u2019s conclusion Tuesday morning when she dumped out bags of them onto the dining room table at the hacienda. Along with the seed pearls were tiny beads and stacks of lace appliqu\u00e9s.</p><p>Four pairs of eyes turned accusingly from her to Mia. The eighteen-year-old shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSo the dress has a lot of lace. It\u2019s gonna be beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa fingered the stack of lace, then glared at her granddaughter. \u201cWe\u2019ll be beading for months. My fingers will fall off.\u201d</p><p>Mia remained uncowed. \u201cI\u2019m your favorite. You love me. You want my dress to be beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa smiled. \u201cYou girls are all my favorite, but yes, I do want you to have the most beautiful dress ever. Who needs fingers, right?\u201d</p><p>Mia laughed and hugged her. \u201cI knew you\u2019d understand.\u201d</p><p>Francesca wasn\u2019t so easily swayed. \u201cHow will we get the blood out?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Katie grinned. Francesca had many wonderful qualities, but she couldn\u2019t sew for spit, and whenever she sewed there were always drops of red scattered on the delicate fabric. It was amazing that she hadn\u2019t bled to death when she\u2019d taken a quilting class a couple of years ago. But then Francesca was a hobby junky. If there was a craft/cooking/decorating class within a fifty-mile radius, she had taken it.</p><p>\u201cI can get it out. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Katie glanced at her watch and frowned. Brenna was late. Maybe traffic had been bad up from the city.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get started,\u201d Katie said. \u201cI\u2019ll show Brenna the design when she gets here.\u201d</p><p>She opened the sketch pad, exposing the drawing she\u2019d done of Mia\u2019s dress.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Grammy M said. \u201cSo delicate. Just perfect for you, Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>Their mother fingered the stack of lace flowers. \u201cI love how you\u2019ve scattered the lace over the dress.\u201d</p> <p>Even Francesca had to admit that the gown was lovely, before grumbling about the amount of work they were all going to have to do.</p><p>Mia, knowing her family, ignored the teasing and discussed hairstyles and shoes instead.</p><p>Katie reached for the first lace appliqu\u00e9. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple,\u201d she said. \u201cOutline the flower in seed pearls. Fill in the petals with beads. I did one over the weekend. It took me about four hours.\u201d</p><p>Four hours she\u2019d spent not thinking about how complicated Zach was and how much she hated that she\u2019d enjoyed their kiss.</p><p>Silence descended. Francesca blinked first. \u201cFor one flower? How many are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout sixty or seventy for the skirt, a hundred and fifty for the hem, twenty-five or so for the bodice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen we\u2019d better get started,\u201d Colleen said, reaching for several lengths of seed pearls and bags of beads.</p><p>Just then Brenna burst into the room. Katie turned to chastise her for being late, but the stark expression on her sister\u2019s face stopped her before she could start.</p><p>Their mother moved toward her. \u201cBrenna, honey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Tears pooled in Brenna\u2019s dark eyes, then trickled down her cheeks. \u201cJeff l-left me,\u201d she managed as a sob caught at her throat. \u201cThis morning. H-he says he wants a d-divorce.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>B y the time everyone stopped talking and Grammy M had prepared tea, Brenna\u2019s sobs had settled into hiccups. The seven women huddled together in the living room, with Brenna sitting in the center of the green sofa by the window, flanked by her mother and Grandma Tessa. Katie sat on the coffee table in front of the sofa, Francesca next to her. They each held one of their sister\u2019s hands. Mia and Grammy M hovered.</p><p>Katie felt sick to her stomach. How could this have happened? Brenna and Jeff were always so happy.</p><p>\u201cTell us what\u2019s going on,\u201d their mother said firmly. \u201cStart at the beginning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know when it started,\u201d Brenna said, then pulled her hands free and clutched at the crumpled tissues on her lap. \u201cI thought everything was great. I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, but that didn\u2019t stop a tear from trickling out of each corner. She brushed them away impatiently.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cJeff\u2019s been working long hours, but he always does. His practice is new and he has to make rounds at the hospital. I never suspected...\u201d</p><p>Katie gasped. No! She refused to believe it. Bad enough for Jeff to want a divorce.</p><p>\u201cAnother woman?\u201d she asked in disbelief.</p><p>Brenna nodded and dropped her chin to her chest. \u201cHe says he\u2019s loved her for a l-long time.\u201d</p><p>Katie turned toward Francesca, who looked as heart-sick as she felt. Tears filled Francesca\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening,\u201d Francesca whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Brenna said with a sob. \u201cIt hurts too much not to be real.\u201d</p><p>Katie pressed a hand to her stomach. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>Brenna glanced at her, then shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly. He didn\u2019t say much, except...\u201d Her voice thickened. \u201cShe\u2019s a lot younger. Like twenty.\u201d</p><p>Brenna sprang to her feet and slipped out from between the sofa and coffee table. She paced the length of the room, still twisting the tissues in her hands.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I just can\u2019t. I gave up everything for him. I loved the winery. I\u2019m the only one of the four of us who gave a damn about it, and I walked away because of him. I worked hard, I supported him and cared about him, and he left me.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa half rose to her feet, but for once she didn\u2019t chastise her granddaughter for her language. \u201cBrenna, it wasn\u2019t like that. You were getting married. Jeff was going into medical school. Supporting your husband the way you did is a sign of a loving wife.\u201d</p><p>Brenna brushed away more tears and shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s the sign of a fool. I can\u2019t believe I was such an idiot. I sacrificed my whole life for him and he walked out on me for a younger woman. I\u2019m a twenty-seven-year-old clich\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>She crumbled into a wing chair. The Grands and Mom headed to her side. Katie shared a glance with Francesca. Neither of them knew what to say. Katie had friends who had divorced, but that was different. Friends weren\u2019t family. Friends\u2019 husbands weren\u2019t Jeff.</p><p>Francesca sucked in a breath. \u201cWe loved him like a brother,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWe joked with him and confided in him. He betrayed us all.\u201d</p><p>Katie nodded, but couldn\u2019t speak. She felt as if she were going to throw up.</p><p>Grandma Tessa stroked Brenna\u2019s hair. \u201cI know it sounds like the end of the world, but it isn\u2019t,\u201d she murmured. \u201cMarried couples sometimes say horrible things to each other. Or do horrible things. Occasionally men stray. Time heals\u2014we forgive.\u201d</p><p>Brenna made a sound that was either a strangled sob or a very scary laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t get your hopes up, Grandma Tessa. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m ever forgiving Jeff.\u201d</p><p>Their grandmother clucked her tongue, then pulled her ever-present rosary from her pocket and kissed the cross. \u201cDon\u2019t say such things. You weren\u2019t raised to be so cruel. Your husband will come around. I think you two need to talk about having babies. That will makes things right between you.\u201d</p><p>Katie felt her grandmother\u2019s advice was poorly timed, at best. Not to mention overly optimistic. Her mother didn\u2019t take it so well.</p><p>\u201cMama Tessa,\u201d Colleen said, glaring at her mother-in-law. \u201cFor once leave babies out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut bambinos\u2014\u201d</p><p>Grammy M pulled her granddaughter close. \u201cAh, my poor darlin\u2019. The pains of the world seem bigger than usual today, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Brenna clung to her. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said harshly. \u201cThere aren\u2019t going to be any babies. There isn\u2019t going to be any marriage. Jeff told me he already filed for divorce, and when it\u2019s final, he\u2019s getting married. To the bimbo.\u201d</p><p>A fresh storm of sobs overtook her. Katie rubbed her temples, fighting a sudden headache. Even Mia was subdued for once. This couldn\u2019t be happening. Not to Brenna. Not to the family. Francesca was right. Jeff had betrayed them all. She wanted to kill him.</p><p>Brenna raised her head and looked right at Katie. Anger glittered in her eyes. \u201cI want you to call Zach.\u201d</p><p>Katie stiffened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a lawyer and I want a good one. You said he\u2019s a shark. That\u2019s what I want. I want Jeff to suffer.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa winced. \u201cBrenna, please. Do you have to be so hasty?\u201d</p><p>Brenna ignored her grandmother. \u201cI mean it, Katie. Will you help me?\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s first thought was to protest. Zach was ruthless. He was a take-no-prisoners man who would stop at nothing to win. Not to mention she wasn\u2019t ready to face him after that kiss. Then she thought about her sister and her pain. Ruthless sounded about right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Tell him I need to see him as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Manna from heaven, Zach thought when he hung up the phone. So much for Katie\u2019s promise that Marcelli marriages never fell apart.</p><p>He buzzed Dora, his assistant, and had her clear his calendar for the afternoon. Right after his eleven o\u2019clock partners meeting, he would head north.</p><p>It was nearly one when he finally drove onto the freeway and close to three when he exited. Tidy rows of grapevines stretched for as far as the eye could see in every direction. A fancy sign at a T-intersection directed tourists to the public buildings of the winery and indicated that the facility was open for tasting seven days a week, even in winter.</p><p>Zach turned the opposite direction and soon found himself driving under the massive arch over the road that led to the main house.</p><p>The three-story, pale yellow hacienda stood on the crest of a small hill. His first visit had been at night, when he\u2019d been unable to appreciate the vivid colors of the main structure and the surrounding buildings. Flower boxes hung from several windows. The red and orange blossoms matched the tile roof. Wrought iron provided counterpoint, the gleaming black metal scrolled and swirled in intricate patterns forming balcony railings and lampposts on the driveway.</p><p>He pulled up to the side of the house and parked. Katie must have been watching for him because she was on the front porch even before he\u2019d closed his car door. Her expression was both sad and wary. No doubt she thought he was going to say \u201cI told you so.\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t believe in wasting breath on the obvious.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for coming,\u201d she said by way of greeting. She hurried down the front steps and crossed to stand in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say it\u2019s my pleasure to be here,\u201d he told her, taking in the troubled expression darkening her eyes and the way she bit on her lower lip. Her lashes were damp and spiked. She\u2019d been crying.</p><p>\u201cIt all really sucks,\u201d she admitted. \u201cEverybody liked Jeff. I know Brenna\u2019s the one he\u2019s divorcing, but we all feel kicked in the gut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and realized he meant it. \u201cThis is never easy on anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would know.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around her. \u201cI know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but time heals. It\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better, but it will get better.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>He thought of her promise that Marcelli marriages lasted forever, but didn\u2019t mention it. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She looked like a grown-up version of Alice, after her journey to Wonderland. A headband held her long, wavy hair away from her face. She wore a simple cotton dress, matching cardigan, and sandals.</p><p>\u201cStaying calm is important,\u201d he said. \u201cBrenna needs that. She\u2019s in shock and it\u2019s going to be a few days until she fully comprehends what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Katie shook her head. \u201cBrenna\u2019s not the only one in shock.\u201d She glanced up at the house. \u201cWe should probably go in.\u201d</p><p>She led the way into the house. All the Marcelli women huddled together in the living room, not saying much as they sewed. Only Brenna stood separate from the group, her back to the room as she gazed out the window.</p><p>Zach watched the flash of needles through lace. Nearly invisible thread hooked beads, securing them in place. Light caught the iridescent pearls, glinting off them like sunlight off dew on a spiderweb. He stiffened slightly, seeing these women as spiders, weaving a trap to snare his son.</p><p>Mia glanced up and saw him. \u201cZach! You\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She rose and hurried toward him. The grandmothers rose as well, but stayed in place, as did Francesca. Colleen moved across the room.</p><p>\u201cZach, thank you for coming.\u201d She touched his arm. \u201cWe appreciate you driving all this way to help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zach wasn\u2019t sure that representing Brenna as she divorced her husband technically qualified as help, but he didn\u2019t dispute Colleen\u2019s description. He was here because he wanted the family to owe him. He planned to build up a damn big credit. When the time came, he would cash it in, take David, and escape.</p><p>Brenna was the last one to turn toward him. He recognized the stunned disbelief in her eyes. She was a woman who felt as if she\u2019d just walked through a war zone. It was his job to tell her all she\u2019d survived was the opening salvo of the very first battle. The war was far from over.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d Grandma Tessa asked. \u201cThere\u2019s pasta.\u201d</p> <p>He had a feeling there was always pasta in her house. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome tea?\u201d Grammy M asked. \u201cFixin\u2019 it is no trouble a\u2019tall.\u201d</p><p>Brenna walked toward him. \u201cLet\u2019s not drown Zach in food or drink,\u201d she said. As she got closer, he could see that her eyes were red, and her mouth trembled when she spoke.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the hospitality, but it\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>Brenna swallowed. \u201cYou got here pretty fast. After Katie called, I realized I probably shouldn\u2019t have asked you to come all this way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn my business, house calls aren\u2019t all that uncommon.\u201d Actually they were for him, but she didn\u2019t have to know that. He might be taking advantage of a miserable situation to find a way to keep his son from screwing up his life, but that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t going to give Brenna his best.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong when divorce lawyers make house calls but doctors don\u2019t,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around at her family, then pointed down the hall. \u201cThere\u2019s a library just over there. Second door on the left. I think that would be the best place.\u201d</p><p>Colleen moved to intercept her. \u201cDo you want one of us with you? Me or Francesca or Katie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s going to be ugly enough without witnesses.\u201d She gave her mother a very shaky smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>Grandma Tessa pulled out a string of rosary beads and began speaking softly under her breath. Colleen hugged her daughter. \u201cCall if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Brenna led the way down the hall. She and Zach entered a good-size room with bookshelves lining three walls. A large desk sat near the bay window, and two leather sofas faced a stone fireplace.</p><p>\u201cWe might as well make this official,\u201d Brenna said, motioning to the desk. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a seat?\u201d</p><p>Zach set his briefcase on the surface, but instead of settling in a chair, he leaned against a corner of the desk. Brenna paced to the window, then back to the door she\u2019d closed when they entered the room. Her body screamed tension. She hunched her shoulders, as if against a blow, and looked a lot like the other wives he\u2019d met over the years. Wives who had been left; wives who weren\u2019t sure if they wanted revenge or a second chance.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I go first,\u201d he said easily, as if they were about to discuss the weather. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you how I like to handle things, and you can let me know if that agrees with you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded without speaking. Nor did she stop pacing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to get a divorce,\u201d he began.</p> <p>The words were familiar\u2014he\u2019d given the speech countless times. It served two purposes. First, having him start things usually put his clients at ease. Second, he was blunt about the divorce process, which often shocked the ambivalent back into their marriages for a year or two. Divorce was ugly, destructive, and expensive. Those who weren\u2019t sure shouldn\u2019t get involved.</p><p>\u201cIf you decide you want a divorce, you don\u2019t have to do anything about it today.\u201d</p><p>Brenna reached the window and turned to look at him. \u201cIf this is your standard line, how on earth do you stay in business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cLet me guess. Because the world is filled with foolish women who marry bastards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d He waited, and when she didn\u2019t speak again, he continued. \u201cWhatever you tell me is private. Attorney-client privilege means I won\u2019t be discussing your personal business with anyone.\u201d He allowed himself a slight smile. \u201cNot even your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have their ways of making people talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie says you\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to go for the gut. But know this. Divorce is going to change your life in ways you can\u2019t begin to imagine. I\u2019ll start the process if and when you say you want to. However, if you change your mind, I have no problem stopping.\u201d</p><p>She paused in mid-pace and stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re a divorce lawyer. Why aren\u2019t you pushing me to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if we go through with the divorce, I\u2019ll need your cooperation. That doesn\u2019t happen if you\u2019re ambivalent.\u201d</p><p>He continued with his standard speech, going over everything from the length of time to the dissolution of marriage to the potential hazards of a court-mandated property settlement. Brenna listened intently and didn\u2019t wince when he named his hourly fee.</p><p>When he was finished, he moved behind the desk and sat down. \u201cNow you talk,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can tell me you need more time, tell me to go to hell, or just cry.\u201d</p><p>One corner of her mouth twitched slightly, as if she had almost smiled. \u201cYou must be pretty used to female tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of male clients lose it.\u201d</p><p>She walked to one of the chairs across the desk from his and collapsed onto the soft leather. He guessed she was a year or two younger than Katie, but right now she looked old and very tired.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no question about the divorce,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cJeff cheated on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t have to be a hanging offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is to me.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cHe\u2019s not remorseful and he\u2019s not coming back. He told me he\u2019s already filed for divorce.\u201d</p><p>Zach pulled out a pad of paper. \u201cThat means you\u2019ll be served in the next day or so. Brace yourself for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. So the hits keep on coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you hit back. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge sounds really good right about now. I guess one bright spot in all this is I don\u2019t have to change my name back. I never took his. A voice inside told me not to. I guess there was a bigger message I should have listened to.\u201d</p><p>Zach leaned forward. \u201cI need to ask you a lot of questions about your marriage, what property the two of you own, that sort of thing. Do you want to deal with that now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He pulled out a form and handed it to her. \u201cI\u2019ll need this information as soon as you can get it.\u201d</p><p>She read the paper. \u201cBank account numbers and balances, credit card accounts, car license information.\u201d She glanced up at him. \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to want to know a lot of personal details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will the court if we don\u2019t come to a settlement privately. California\u2019s a community property state. Everything gets split fifty-fifty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now tell me about the relationship.\u201d</p><p>Brenna wanted to curl up in a ball and have the entire world go away. Some kind of oblivion didn\u2019t sound so bad, right about now. One minute her heart raced so fast she thought it was going to jump out of her throat, the next she couldn\u2019t even find a pulse. She felt both hot and cold. Her body ached.</p><p>Less than twenty-four hours ago she\u2019d been blissfully happy. Stupid, but happy. Twenty-four hours ago she\u2019d been working at the job that she hated to pay off medical school for a husband who had been busy screwing someone else.</p><p>Anger filled her. Anger and rage and frustration and shame. She felt humiliated. She felt old and used.</p><p>None of which was going to help Zach Stryker with her divorce. So she did as he requested and gave him a thumb-nail sketch of her marriage to her soon-to-be ex-husband.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sharing a residence,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRight up until I walked out this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a bed?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, but he wasn\u2019t looking at her. Instead he scribbled notes on his pad. Heat flared on her cheeks. At that moment she wanted to get on her knees and thank God for her Italian genes. They might have given her chubby thighs, but at least her olive coloring prevented her blush from showing too much.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking if we\u2019re sleeping together, then yes. Every night.\u201d She frowned. \u201cExcept when he\u2019s gone for his conferences.\u201d Which there had been a lot of lately, she remembered. Tears burned in her eyes. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking about sex. Not very often.\u201d</p><p>Not even once in the past four months, she reminded herself. Jeff had had so many really good excuses. Her hands clenched into fists. To think he\u2019d wasted his time coming up with reasons to avoid making love. All he\u2019d had to do was tell her the truth. If she\u2019d known about the other woman, she wouldn\u2019t have bothered asking.</p><p>Humiliation clawed at Brenna\u2019s throat. That\u2019s what really got her. That she\u2019d asked. She\u2019d known there was something wrong, and like a fool she\u2019d assumed it was the pressure of finally finishing up his residency or the stress of interviewing with different doctors about joining their practices.</p><p>\u201cYou and Jeff don\u2019t have any children together, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>The question raced through her like electricity. Her skin seemed to shrink a size and it was hard to breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause a child means a whole new set of legal complications. Are you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together to maintain control, but it was useless. Tears spilled from her eyes.</p><p>She jumped to her feet and circled around the desk. A box of tissue sat in a bottom drawer. She pulled out the box and returned to her seat.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, her voice throaty.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I take it this is a sore subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She sniffed and wiped away her tears. \u201cI wanted kids, Jeff kept saying we had to wait. Wait until he was done with medical school, then wait until he finished his internship. Then wait until he had his own practice. I was working eighty hours a week, so it\u2019s not like I had time to brood or anything, but God.\u201d She leaned back in the chair and closed her eyes. \u201cI wanted kids.\u201d</p><p>She still did. The difference was now she didn\u2019t have a husband. No husband, no babies. Her heart twisted.</p><p>\u201cAny prenuptial agreement?\u201d</p><p>She straightened and stared at him. \u201cNo. We never discussed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid either of you bring any money into the relationship?\u201d</p><p>She laughed humorously. \u201cNo. Jeff brought plenty of debt, though. Student loans from college. Those just got bigger as time wore on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo basically you supported him through his medical training and paid for debt he\u2019d incurred before the marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he work also? Part-time or summer jobs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He studied. We agreed that was his job.\u201d Because she\u2019d been so damn stupid, she thought grimly. Being the perfect, supportive, loving wife had been all she\u2019d aspired to. If that meant two jobs and no free time, hey, she was married. She\u2019d walked away from her family, from the vineyards, and for what?</p><p>She balled up the tissue she held. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything. I worked, I cooked, I cleaned, I picked up his dry cleaning.\u201d Just talking about it made her furious. She rose to her feet and crossed to the window. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. All these years of my life given over to him, and I have nothing to show for it. I certainly didn\u2019t go to college. I have no education, nothing. I have no life, except for being his wife.\u201d She spun to face Zach. \u201cI gave him my entire being and this is my reward.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a fool.\u201d She rubbed her temples. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I put my husband through medical school and now he\u2019s left me for a younger woman. That wasn\u2019t supposed to happen for at least another ten years.\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t respond. Brenna knew there wasn\u2019t anything he could say. Instead he asked, \u201cWhat do you want from Jeff?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlood,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cI want him to pay. He used me and he cast me aside.\u201d Worse, he\u2019d hurt her, but she wasn\u2019t about to say that. The irony of the situation didn\u2019t escape her. Jeff was a cardiologist\u2014he\u2019d known exactly how to break her heart.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure there\u2019s no chance of a reconciliation?\u201d</p><p>She tried to laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s not interested. He\u2019s already moved on. I\u2019m not interested, either. He screwed some bimbo\u2014probably in my bed. Let her have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could change his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think the chances of him leaving his bimbo for an old, used wife are pretty remote.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you? What if he came to his senses and realized he was an idiot. What if he begged you to let him come back? Would you let him?\u201d</p><p>Brenna considered the question. This morning when Jeff had casually announced that their marriage was over, that he had filed for divorce, and oh, by the way, would she please leave the dry-cleaning ticket on the table when she left, she had felt as if a meteor had destroyed her world. She\u2019d been crushed\u2014broken into a million pieces with no hopes of ever being whole again. In that moment she would have done anything to have her life restored.</p><p>Since then she\u2019d been on a roller coaster of emotion, up and down, turning at breakneck speed until she didn\u2019t know what she wanted or where she was going to end up. But she did know one thing with complete certainty.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him back,\u201d she said with a conviction that came from the very depths of her being. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the infidelity that I can\u2019t forgive. It\u2019s that he wasn\u2019t even willing to try. I didn\u2019t get a vote or a hearing. He decided it was over, so he filed for divorce. I would never trust him again. What\u2019s been broken can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d She leveled her gaze and stared at Zach. \u201cI want him punished.\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded. \u201cI can do that. It\u2019s something I do very well.\u201d</p><p>8</p> <p>T he printer spit out page after page. Mia glanced at David, who looked just as lost as she felt. The perfectly dressed woman in the bridal registry department smiled as she tore off what looked like an endless list.</p><p>\u201cNow, these are just some ideas. Obviously you don\u2019t need to register for everything on the list.\u201d</p><p>Mia took the offered papers. \u201cOkay. Great. We\u2019ll, um, just look around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Write down your choices as you make them. I\u2019ll be right here if you have any questions.\u201d She smiled again, her perfectly made-up features barely moving. \u201cDo you need a pencil?\u201d</p><p>Mia patted the small purse she\u2019d slung over her shoulder. \u201cGot one, thanks.\u201d Then she grabbed David by the arm and hurried away.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s scary,\u201d Mia muttered when they were out of earshot. \u201cAren\u2019t people\u2019s faces supposed to move when they talk?\u201d</p><p>But David wasn\u2019t paying attention. Instead he stared at a large display of china with all the enthusiasm of a vegetarian facing a steak dinner.</p><p>\u201cSo we have to pick one?\u201d he asked, desperation tinting his words.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the basic idea.\u201d She scanned the list. \u201cMy God. Just the dish section\u2014which they call china\u2014is broken down into sections. Plates, bowls, side plates, dessert plates, fruit nappies.\u201d</p><p>David stared at her. \u201cWhat the hell is a fruit nappy?\u201d</p><p>Mia giggled. \u201cDon\u2019t the British refer to diapers as nappies? Maybe it\u2019s some weird kind of fruit diaper.\u201d</p><p>David rolled his eyes. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>She continued to scan the list. \u201cServing pieces. Then we move into flatware. I think that\u2019s like knives and forks. Oh, and there\u2019s everyday china or stoneware, which I guess means we\u2019re supposed to have two sets.\u201d She thought about her postage-stamp-size kitchen. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have room for all this.\u201d</p><p>David grabbed the list. \u201cWater glasses, wineglasses, highball glasses, tumblers. What\u2019s a highball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA type of cocktail.\u201d She drew in a deep breath. Somehow she had thought that shopping for future presents would be more fun. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s just start with the china. We don\u2019t have room for one full set, let alone two, so we can find a pattern we like and use it all the time. Later, when we have a house or something, we\u2019ll deal with two sets. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He eyed the wall displaying over a hundred different patterns. \u201cWhat do you like?\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later Mia was ready to choke the life out of her intended. She liked flowers, he didn\u2019t. She wanted color, he thought beige was enough color for anyone. Then he\u2019d picked a pattern with three dimensional fruit that made her want to gag. They\u2019d discovered that fruit nappies were basically cereal-size bowls, and that they both hated anything with a gold rim, but otherwise, they couldn\u2019t come close to an agreement.</p><p>Rather than shed blood right there in the middle of fine china, Mia suggested a compromise.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with something different,\u201d she said, refolding the list to the section entitled: \u201cStocking your kitchen.\u201d \u201cWhat about small appliances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>They headed for that department, passing flatware on the way. If they couldn\u2019t pick out china, Mia figured they\u2019d better avoid any department with sharp knives.</p><p>However, kitchenware had knives. It also had dozens of appliances she\u2019d never seen before. Nor did she have any idea as to their purpose or usefulness. She stood in front of a multitiered device that was supposed to dry fruit.</p><p>\u201cWho eats dried fruit?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Mia studied the machine. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it just be easier to buy it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr eat chips.\u201d David poked at a massive box containing a pasta maker. \u201cDad never cooked much. I sure didn\u2019t learn anything from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me. The Grands have always done the cooking at our house.\u201d</p><p>He looped an arm around her and grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be the wife, Mia. I guess you\u2019ll have to learn.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged free of his embrace. \u201cThat is so not going to happen. Just because I\u2019m the female here, don\u2019t assume I\u2019m going to be taking care of you. As far as I\u2019m concerned, household chores will be split fifty-fifty, and that includes cooking.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly David wasn\u2019t smiling. \u201cI\u2019m not going to learn to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be busy with school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t? While you\u2019re still trying to figure out your major, I\u2019ll be applying to grad school, taking my regular classes, and working part-time at one of the consulates, assuming I get into that internship program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia, I\u2019m a guy.\u201d</p><p>She eyed the selection of knives on a nearby wall. But as her father liked to say, violence was the refuge of the incompetent.</p><p>\u201cI guess if you don\u2019t cook and I don\u2019t cook, we\u2019ll be buying a lot of take-out,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe good news is there are a ton of great places by campus. And when we\u2019re in D.C., there will be all-new places to try.\u201d She saw a display of coffeemakers. \u201cHey, I could use a new one of these. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>But David didn\u2019t follow her to the display. Instead he stood in the center of the aisle, feet braced, hands in his pockets, an unruly lock of hair falling across his forehead.</p><p>She turned to him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about Georgetown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I know I have to apply to other grad schools, but that\u2019s the one I really want.\u201d She frowned at his stern expression. \u201cDavid, it\u2019s not like this is news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you applying to UCLA?\u201d</p><p>She felt the ground turn into quicksand. Actually, she was not. Although she was enjoying her undergrad experience there, she wanted to attend a different school to continue her studies. Preferably somewhere on the East Coast.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided,\u201d she hedged.</p><p>\u201cWhen you graduate, I\u2019ll still have two years left there.\u201d</p><p>She shifted her weight from foot to foot, hating that she felt almost...guilty. \u201cI know.\u201d She had known. She just didn\u2019t like to think about it.</p><p>Then she reminded herself she had nothing to feel guilty about. This was her life, her dream, her career. She\u2019d wanted to go into the State Department since she\u2019d first learned what it was nearly six years ago. She\u2019d already compromised. Wasn\u2019t it his turn?</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to take that Japanese language class in Japan, and you agreed it would be fun. We talked about it being our honeymoon. Then you changed your mind and didn\u2019t want to go. So we switched to D.C. Now I\u2019m taking the language class and you\u2019re just going to hang out for six weeks. I\u2019m okay with that. Why can\u2019t you be okay with me not getting my master\u2019s at UCLA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it means I have to change schools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you already said was fine with you.\u201d She tried not to scream. \u201cIs this all about you? You need a wife who can cook, and you need a wife who won\u2019t study a foreign language in a foreign country, and you need a wife who has no dreams of her own, except you don\u2019t have any dreams or plans, either. You don\u2019t even have a fucking major.\u201d</p><p>They glared at each other. Mia refused to be the one who blinked first.</p><p>David sighed, then shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I need, Mia. You\u2019re the one with all the answers. Maybe you should tell me.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly picking out items for their gift registry didn\u2019t seem like such a good idea. She carefully folded the sheets of paper in half.</p><p>\u201cLook. I have a report I have to work on. You want to do this another time?\u201d</p><p>David shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>They headed for the escalator. Mia had the weirdest feeling that she couldn\u2019t catch her breath. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this, she thought frantically. Was it? She and David were engaged. Shouldn\u2019t they be happy?</p><p>The first time Katie had walked into Zach\u2019s office, she\u2019d been excited about the job offer of a lifetime. The second time she\u2019d been dealing with post-humiliation repercussions. Now she had to wrestle with the fact that he was not only her client and a future in-law, but a man who had rocked her world with a simple kiss (annoying but true). He was also her sister\u2019s divorce lawyer. If they got any more involved, they would become symbiotic beings.</p><p>She was determined to make sure that didn\u2019t happen. She would be wary, on guard, and completely professional. No visceral reactions allowed.</p><p>Dora Preston sat outside of Zach\u2019s office. She smiled when she saw Katie. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you,\u201d Dora said. \u201cGo right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Katie straightened her spine, tried her \u201cYou\u2019re the best\u201d mantra for good measure, and stepped into the shark\u2019s lair.</p><p>Zach rose when he saw her. And smiled. As she had yet to receive her Zach-smile vaccine, she found herself instantly melting.</p><p>Stop! No melting, she told herself. No being excited to see him. Nada!</p><p>\u201cKatie, what a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He walked around his desk and approached her. Instead of shaking her hand, he squeezed her upper arm and sounded genuinely pleased to see her. Uh-huh. Sure. Cool, she told herself. She was ice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI come bearing paperwork,\u201d she said calmly, holding up her stuffed briefcase. In her other hand she held a portable file box.</p><p>Zach led her to the desk, then offered coffee, which she accepted. While he walked over to a small tea tray by his credenza and poured her a cup, she unloaded her briefcase and started on the file folder.</p><p>\u201cCream? Sugar?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust black,\u201d she said.</p><p>By the time he returned to sit next to her, she had spread out several sample invitations.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get the order into the printer,\u201d she said. \u201cI like this one.\u201d She pointed to a thick paper invitation edged in black and gold.</p><p>Zach laughed. \u201cThe last invitations I picked out had toy soldiers on them. I think it was for David\u2019s eleventh birthday party. You go with what you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to pick, but do you want to run the selections by your partners?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot even on a bet.\u201d</p><p>She forgot herself for a second and smiled. \u201cOkay. So you\u2019re not party planners.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out her master list and noted the invitation number. \u201cNow, before I can do anything, I will need one thing from you. And that\u2019s budget approval.\u201d</p><p>The five-page document listed every possible expense, although some items, such as liquor, had to be estimated. Zach took the document and scanned it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very thorough,\u201d he said after a minute.</p><p>\u201cI try to be. As I noted at the bottom, should there be an unexpected expense of more than three hundred dollars, I\u2019ll send out written notice immediately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d He read a little more. \u201cGoody bags for adults. Isn\u2019t that a kid thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019ll do a smaller, less expensive bag for the regular guests and a dynamite one for our high rollers.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it, but there is a serious thrill in getting something for free. I practically shimmy in delight when my favorite makeup lady offers me a sample, even if it\u2019s something I\u2019ll never use. I thought a goody bag would be a fun way to leave our guests with warm fuzzies about the party.\u201d</p><p>He continued to study the budget. As he read, she watched him. There was something so sexy about his eyes, she thought. And of course, his smile. She also liked the way he seemed comfortable in his own skin all the time.</p><p>She groaned silently. Damn. What happened to being ice? Ignore him. Which was easier said than done, considering how the man turned her on. Her resolve seemed to have all the tensile strength of potato chips.</p><p>He tossed the budget down on the desk. \u201cI\u2019ll take it to my partners right away. When do you need to hear back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin a week. The invitations need to be engraved. Some of the food has to be ordered well in advance, and I won\u2019t even go into the trauma of picking out flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d He leaned back in his chair. \u201cI guess this means I need to get my tux into the dry cleaner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t complain to me about that,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou know exactly what you\u2019re going to wear, while I have the challenge of finding the perfect dress. I need to fit in, and yet not look like a guest.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his dark eyebrows. \u201cWhat about your date?\u201d</p><p>She hardly needed the pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s a working night for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Mr. Right?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell if he was making idle chitchat or trying to figure out if she was seeing someone. The possibility of the latter made her thighs tingle.</p><p>\u201cNot even a Mr. Adequate. And you? Who will you bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided. How\u2019s Brenna doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hanging in there. Her mood seems to swing between a strong desire to get revenge and feelings of devastation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe loss of a marriage is like a death. It takes time to move through the grieving process.\u201d</p><p>His insight surprised her until she reminded herself that this was what the man did for a living. Of course he would be familiar with the process.</p><p>\u201cBrenna said you won\u2019t be meeting with her for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll speak regularly, but there\u2019s no need for a face-to-face. I\u2019ve filed all the papers. We\u2019re going to have to deal with the settlement, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to take the planning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know Jeff\u2019s lawyer?\u201d</p><p>Zach smiled again, but it wasn\u2019t the least bit friendly. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with him before. Not to worry. I\u2019m a whole lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you think I\u2019m a complete bitch if I say \u2018good\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s your sister. She\u2019s in pain and you want blood for that.\u201d He studied her. \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways, Katie. You can\u2019t complain about my tactics, then use them for your own self-interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I can, but it\u2019s tacky.\u201d She shuffled through the papers she\u2019d brought, pulling out three more sets of the budget. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have to make copies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>She returned to the issue of her sister\u2019s divorce. \u201cWhile there might have been a snag in the \u2018all Marcellis stay married forever\u2019 theory, I\u2019m still not on your side about breaking off Mia and David\u2019s engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with that. However, I reserve the right to use any means at my disposal to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Hardly news, she thought wryly. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair and considered the question. \u201cTwo reasons. No, three. First, I have the most access to you. That means plenty of time to work my charm.\u201d</p><p>She widened her eyes in surprise. \u201cIs this charm? I hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSecond, your family listens to you. If I convince you, you\u2019ll convince them, or at least Mia, and she\u2019s the one who matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking bets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are. What\u2019s number three?\u201d</p><p>He turned his gaze fully on her. Dark blue eyes narrowed slightly, and his expression turned predatory. \u201cYou\u2019re the Marcelli who interests me the most.\u201d</p><p>Two parts intrigued and one part terrified, she did her best to act unconcerned. \u201cYou\u2019re saying spending this much time with Grandpa Lorenzo wouldn\u2019t blow your skirt up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wear a skirt, but if I did, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are really fabulous reasons. Thanks for sharing.\u201d She began to pack up her briefcase.</p><p>\u201cLeaving so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have another meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I wanted to take a few minutes to work on convincing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard what I had in mind.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but she could imagine. \u201cI don\u2019t need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tempted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>She had a feeling they both knew she was lying. She finished with her briefcase and went to work on the file box. When she was done, she turned back to him.</p><p>\u201cThanks for taking the time to see me today, Zach.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and rested his hand on hers. \u201cI\u2019m always happy to see you, Katie. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Was it her or had it just gotten really hot in here?</p><p>\u201cHow nice,\u201d she said primly and stood. She\u2019d wondered if he would kiss her again. Now that he hadn\u2019t, she told herself she was happy. Really.</p><p>He stood. \u201cYou\u2019re not easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not much of a compliment, but thank you anyway.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not easy, either. If we manage to get through the next couple of months without killing each other, I\u2019d like you to be my date for the fund-raiser.\u201d</p><p>The phrase about being knocked over by a feather had never been more appropriate. A date? With Zach? Only a fool would say yes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be working,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay with me.\u201d He winked. \u201cI like to watch.\u201d</p><p>Zach never left work early and he almost never took Pacific Coast Highway home. But at three o\u2019clock that afternoon, he did both. He drove west to Lincoln and turned south. The congested street met up with PCH in Marina Del Rey. It was a warm, sunny afternoon, with a hint of salt in the air. He opened his car\u2019s sunroof, as well as the windows, inhaling deeply.</p><p>Despite his busy schedule, he felt restless. As he headed toward the airport, he saw jets taking off toward the ocean, heading west. Where were they going? Who was on board and what would they do when they arrived? He didn\u2019t want to be going with them, but he did want something...A woman?</p><p>He had an answer to the question before he even asked it. Yes. A woman. And not just in bed, although he wouldn\u2019t mind an hour or two of pleasure in a pair of willing arms. No, what he wanted was more than sex. He wanted to talk to someone long enough to grow comfortable. He wanted rhythms and patterns and familiarity.</p><p>How long had it been since he\u2019d had a relationship that lasted more than two dates? A year? Longer, he thought. Although he\u2019d never been interested in getting married again\u2014Ainsley and his belief that long-term relationships didn\u2019t work had cured him of that particular desire\u2014he\u2019d always enjoyed the company of women. Generally one at a time, and often for as long as a few months, then he walked away. He might not do marriage, but he was deeply committed to serial monogamy.</p><p>It had been a long time since anyone had tempted him for more than a night or two. He couldn\u2019t remember the last woman who had surprised and challenged him. Some of it was his own fault. His position in a prominent law firm and his growing bank balance brought out a certain kind of woman. Those who were more interested in what he had than who he was. He\u2019d gone out with enough of them to earn a reputation. Once he\u2019d dated the shallow, those with substance didn\u2019t think he was worth the effort. Which meant he had to go find them.</p><p>Or wait on fate.</p><p>Is that what had happened with Katie Marcelli? Had fate dropped her into his lap? Maybe. Maybe not. Either way, he intended to take advantage of the situation, because that was what he did. Fate might have brought her to him, but he would be the one getting her into his bed.</p><p>9</p><p>\u201cM aybe we could figure out a way you could just borrow my hips and thighs,\u201d Brenna said as she shifted to get more comfortable on her sister\u2019s lumpy double bed. Not only was the mattress more like a rocky path than a place for restful sleep, the only light in the room was diffused by heavy lampshades, making it difficult for Brenna to bead as neatly as she would like. She had no doubt that if she did a less than perfect job, Katie would reject the lace appliqu\u00e9 out of hand.</p><p>Francesca smiled in response to Brenna\u2019s comment, but didn\u2019t speak as she continued to work on her face. Not her makeup...her face. While the light in the bedroom might be dim enough to qualify for a mood-lit nightclub, that in the bathroom rivaled the intensity of an operating room. Several bulbs illuminated the bathroom mirror from nearly every angle possible. Francesca had placed an eighteen-inch-wide board over her pedestal sink to give herself a work area for her array of cosmetics.</p><p>While Brenna found the various pots, jars, and pencils interesting, what really captured her attention was the fat suit hanging in the open doorway. The foam...what, she thought\u2014Garment? Creation? Outfit\u2014consisted of padded shoulders, full breasts, a bulging tummy and thick thighs. Actually it was everything Brenna hated about her own body. If only she could unzip the extra fifteen or twenty pounds she carried around.</p><p>Talk about a miracle, she thought glumly.</p><p>She reached for another bead from the small bag and sewed it into place. So far she\u2019d completed fifteen lace flowers. She hadn\u2019t been back to L.A. since Jeff had announced he wanted a divorce. She\u2019d called in her resignation to the job she\u2019d always hated and had only taken because the pay was decent. She clenched her teeth. Just thinking about all she\u2019d gone through with Jeff made her furious. She wanted to scream. She wanted to throw something. She wanted to stab an ice pick through his two-timing heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead she beaded lace. And fumed. Because if she allowed her anger to fade, she found herself feeling lost and alone, not to mention slightly panicked about the future.</p><p>She glanced around Francesca\u2019s tiny bedroom. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here forever,\u201d she said more to herself than to her sister.</p><p>\u201cSure you can.\u201d Francesca applied a grayish-taupe shadow under her eyes. She instantly looked tired and drawn. \u201cI like having you around.\u201d</p> <p>Brenna smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s because you like rescuing people. But if I spend many more nights on your sofa, I\u2019m going to be in physical therapy for the rest of my life. It\u2019s not exactly comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking of going back to L.A.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? I don\u2019t have any real ties there. I quit my job. I guess I need to get my stuff out of the apartment, but other than that...\u201d Her voice trailed off. She\u2019d been too busy working and taking care of her husband to make friends. God, her life was damn empty. Why had she allowed that to happen?</p><p>\u201cWe should have him killed,\u201d Francesca said, sounding calm enough to be scary.</p><p>While Brenna appreciated the support, she wasn\u2019t sure Jeff\u2019s death would make up for much. It would be too easy. In a perfect world, he would have to suffer.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s worth prison time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d Francesca turned and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just he\u2019s such a bastard. I know your pain is the worst and I want to make it better, but on a personal level, and for the family, I want revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could brainstorm a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come up with some ideas while I bead.\u201d Brenna returned her attention to the lace in her hands. \u201cIn the meantime, I need a place to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could move home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>Moving back to the hacienda wouldn\u2019t be her first choice, but at this point what options did she have? There wasn\u2019t any money. She had worked her ass off to cover the monthly bills and keep up with Jeff\u2019s student loans. Savings had been a luxury they couldn\u2019t afford.</p><p>\u201cYou know Mom and Dad would be thrilled to have you back. The Grands would treat you like a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use a little pampering,\u201d Brenna admitted. \u201cAlthough I\u2019d have to redecorate our old room. It looks exactly the same as when we moved out. My tastes have changed in the past few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were smart to stay single after Todd died,\u201d Brenna told her. \u201cYou learned your lesson early.\u201d</p><p>Francesca shrugged. \u201cMy marriage wasn\u2019t all good times and laughter. I\u2019m much happier on my own. Now you get to make that choice if you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already made.\u201d Fall for another guy who would only use her to get what he wanted? No, thanks.</p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll be unmarried into our dotage,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cPeople will think we\u2019re lesbians.\u201d</p><p>Francesca smiled, but didn\u2019t look up from the mirror. \u201cCan you imagine how many rosaries would be said by the Grands if they suspected that? They\u2019d need a hotline to heaven.\u201d</p><p>As Brenna watched, Francesca used a sharp eyebrow pencil to draw in tiny lines which thickened her eyebrows. She\u2019d already applied fake skin along her jaw line, to round out the shape.</p><p>\u201cAre you going for the ugly look on purpose?\u201d</p><p>Francesca glanced at her over her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be recognized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chance of that.\u201d Brenna eyed the fat suit. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it freak you out to gain weight instantly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I know it comes right off.\u201d</p><p>Which was true, but made Brenna feel cranky. \u201cI know this is all part of your studies, but I have to tell you that wearing a fat suit is a weird way to get a doctorate.\u201d</p><p>Francesca shrugged and returned her attention to the mirror. She shaded more of her face. \u201cActually today I\u2019m going out in a wheelchair. I\u2019ll use the padded suit later. As for my doctorate, my purpose is to document how people react to me, based on different physical appearances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I get the theory,\u201d Brenna told her. \u201cI just think it\u2019s strange.\u201d</p><p>Francesca reached for a lip pencil that matched the color of her skin. She carefully outlined her mouth, making the curves appear smaller. A tiny dot of a line at each corner drew the shape of her mouth downward, giving her a pinched appearance.</p><p>She applied a flesh-colored lipstick which made her mouth practically invisible. Then she reached for her hair-brush.</p><p>Several strong strokes tamed her thick, dark hair. She pulled it into a severe bun, after which she sprinkled baby powder on her hands and smoothed it over her sleek hair. Dark brown faded to muddy gray. Heavily rimmed glasses and a shapeless dress completed her transformation. She turned to face her sister.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Brenna wrinkled her nose in distaste. \u201cYou\u2019re my sister and I really love you, but I have to tell you, sometimes you scare me.\u201d</p><p>Several tables clustered together on one side of the vast hotel ballroom. Try as he might, Zach couldn\u2019t imagine the space filled with two thousand guests, nor did he have any interest in the china chosen for the event. But when Katie had asked him to drop by the hotel to make the final seating choice, he\u2019d found himself agreeing. Maybe it was because hotels were filled with beds and he was determined to get her into one.</p><p>\u201cThere are different philosophies,\u201d she was saying. \u201cTables of eight are more intimate. People can actually talk around the table. It\u2019s also easier for couples to buy a table when there are only eight seats to fill. Tables for twelve can make for an easier seating plan in a room this size. They\u2019re more efficient for the serving staff, but they make it virtually impossible to speak with anyone but immediate neighbors.\u201d</p><p>Katie indicated a large round table set with everything from water glasses to salt shakers.</p><p>\u201cWith our \u2019cook your own dinner\u2019 menu, we have to consider allowing people to move in and out of the area. A table for ten falls somewhere in the middle of the two. Obviously.\u201d She shot him a quick smile. \u201cAs an aside, tables for eight mean more linen rentals and centerpieces. I could work out the cost differences if you would like.\u201d</p><p>Zach already felt his eyes glazing over just hearing her talk about it. A spreadsheet on the subject was about as appealing as a root canal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the expert, Katie,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s your call.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d say that. Somehow I suspect this isn\u2019t all that interesting to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>Her grin turned into a chuckle. He leaned a little closer to better hear the soft sound. In the process he caught a whiff of feminine fragrance...something sweet and just a little sultry. Tempting\u2014much like Katie herself.</p><p>As usual she dressed for success\u2014slacks and a cropped jacket in black, with a red silk blouse. Her hair had been piled on top of her head in a style that was probably supposed to be professional. But it was late afternoon and too many tendrils had escaped for the look to be anything but sexy.</p><p>She was doing the \u201cI\u2019m a businesswoman\u201d dance, and all it did was make him want to see her naked. If she knew, she would smack the crap out of him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you have no vote on the table size,\u201d she said, making a note on her ever-present pad of paper. \u201cDo you want to express an opinion on the color and style of linens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to have a detailed conversation about torte law?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him out of the corner of her eye. \u201cGee, Zach, if I\u2019d known you were going to be so difficult, I wouldn\u2019t have asked for your opinion on anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you would. You like hanging out with me.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cNo wonder you drive such a big car. You need room for your ego. What do you do when you fly? Will it fit in the overhead compartment or do you have to check it into baggage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say. Big ego, big...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot?\u201d she offered with a smile and walked toward her briefcase, which rested on a chair. After opening the bag, she pulled out a thick folder.</p><p>\u201cBack to the subject at hand,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a list of the prizes for our high-end donors. I\u2019ve spoken with the jewelry designers Sara recommended. They\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cSara.\u201d Her eyes twinkled with humor. \u201cProbably better known to you as \u2018John\u2019s wife.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. The pregnant one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. She recommended a few jewelry designers. They all agreed to sell us unique pieces at cost. Of course their names will be prominently displayed in the program, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll start a fashion trend or two that night.\u201d She looked up from the paper. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you want to look at the design sketches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how about a list of the various prize packages? I\u2019ve worked up a ski vacation in Europe, golfing in Scotland and Pebble Beach, and a lovely weekend in Napa, complete with a private dinner with the three top wine makers there.\u201d She closed the folder. \u201cI used family connections on that last one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all a matter of knowing who to call. Now, about the centerpieces.\u201d</p><p>Zach held up his hands in front of him and took a step back. \u201cAbsolutely no flower decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cOrder whatever you like in any color or style. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Katie slid a little closer. \u201cIs the big, bad lawyer frightened of a few orchids?\u201d</p><p>He was saved from replying by the arrival of a tall, painfully thin man in a white coat. The dark-haired stranger crossed to Katie, spoke her name in a tone of delight, and kissed the backs of both her hands.</p><p>She disentangled herself with grace and a small laugh. \u201cJerome, you spent way too much time in France. Stop acting so Continental, or I\u2019ll tell my client that you\u2019re actually from Nebraska.\u201d</p><p>The tall man winced. \u201cKatie, don\u2019t even joke about that.\u201d He turned to Zach and held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jerome. I\u2019m the head chef here at the hotel, and I\u2019ll be in charge of the food for the charity event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Zach shook hands with the man, then glanced from one to the other. \u201cYou two have worked together before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral times,\u201d Katie said easily. \u201cJerome is a perfectionist. Fresh produce is practically a religion with him, and his food is the better for it. He\u2019s creative, yet willing to work within the confines of my ideas and, just as important, my budget. That\u2019s unheard of at his level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flatter me,\u201d Jerome said with obvious false modesty. \u201cI\u2019m simply gifted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And brilliant and all those other lovely adjectives you adore so much. Did you bring the menus?\u201d</p><p>Jerome held out several sheets of papers. Katie moved next to Zach so that he could read them as well. They were detailed food selections for the charity dinner. Handwritten notes filled the space by the typed items, detailing everything from possible condiments, to notations on availability and cost per serving.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pick the chocolates quickly,\u201d Jerome said as Katie flipped a page. \u201cSome are easy enough to get, but if you\u2019re serious about chocolate from around the world, some of my suppliers require a month\u2019s notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>When he started talking about the availability of produce, Zach excused himself and stepped into the hallway to call his office. Dora assured him there were no emergencies. He slipped the phone back into his jacket pocket and watched Katie work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mind returned to all the possibilities available in the large hotel. A small room with a smaller bed? A luxurious suite with a Jacuzzi tub? The sauna?</p><p>He found he really liked the idea of both of them slick with sweat, sliding against each other, burning from the inside out. He imagined himself pumping into her, then quickly shifted the fantasy so she was on top, riding him, her breasts\u2014</p><p>He swallowed a sudden laugh. What the hell. His vivid images had produced a predictable and physical response. He was hard, horny, and couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d gotten an erection during business hours. Work generally consumed him. Just not lately.</p> <p>Katie made notes as Jerome talked, narrowing down the list of possible choices to something manageable. She would get all the information onto spreadsheets that evening. It would seem less unwieldy that way.</p><p>\u201cWhat about a tasting dinner?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhen do you want to do that?\u201d</p><p>He pulled a Palm Pilot from his jacket pocket and pushed a couple of buttons. \u201cYou want it here, or you want to take it with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither works for me.\u201d She looked around and saw Zach in the hallway. \u201cYou\u2019re not escaping that easily,\u201d she called to him. \u201cCome on. I won\u2019t make you decide on the items for the tasting dinner, but you did promise to help me with the actual eating.\u201d</p><p>Zach returned to the ballroom. He moved with an easy masculine grace that left her mouth dry.</p> <p>He annoyed her, impressed her, charmed her, and surprised her. And she was supposed to be the people person.</p><p>\u201cWe have two important issues regarding the tasting dinner,\u201d she said, determined not to let him know how much he affected her. \u201cDo you want to eat it here or get it to go, and when do you want to have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get it to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we won\u2019t be rushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great.\u201d Maybe they could make it a very long evening. One that ended with...</p><p>She mentally slapped herself into paying attention to the moment at hand. Rather than deal with Zach, she focused on Jerome. At least he was completely safe. \u201cWhat dates are good for you?\u201d</p><p>He named off several.</p> <p>Zach pulled out his own Palm Pilot and pushed buttons. \u201cI\u2019m pretty open. What about you, Katie?\u201d</p><p>She ignored the suggestive tone of his voice. \u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>Jerome pushed more keys. \u201cThe fifth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>She nodded in agreement, noted the date, and volunteered to pick up the food. They would deal with the \u201cwhere\u201d they would be eating another time.</p><p>Jerome excused himself and returned to the kitchen. Katie pulled seating charts out from her briefcase and held them up to Zach. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no opinion? Isn\u2019t there someone you\u2019re dying to sit next to? A rich divorcee? A female rock star? The latest Hollywood \u2019It\u2019 girl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI prefer women to girls,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd despite the rumors, I\u2019m more into substance than style.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cJust once I would like to meet a man willing to admit he likes his relationships simple and his women easy.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a nanosecond. Come on, Zach. You\u2019re successful, good-looking, and rich. I\u2019ve seen the photos in the press. Tabloid text may not always be accurate, but you know what they say about pictures speaking a thousand words. Are you trying to tell me you haven\u2019t dated all those women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m saying there\u2019s a reason I walked away from all of them.\u201d</p><p>It was a semi-decent comeback. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been converted? Now intelligent, articulate conversation is the way to your heart? Big breasts and long legs no longer work? Imagine my surprise.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to win this conversation, so let\u2019s change the subject. Why don\u2019t you show me these fabulous gardens I\u2019ve been hearing about?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cYou\u2019re conceding defeat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making a strategic retreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I must remember to put a star by this day on the calendar when I get home.\u201d</p><p>He grunted in response. Katie was still delighted with her victory as they stepped outside into the landscaped gardens of the hotel.</p><p>It was late afternoon on the sort of day that made postcard photographers drool. The sky was the color blue only ever seen on the California coast. A warmish breeze chased away any clouds that might want to linger. Dappled sunlight illuminated the perfectly green grass, while elegant trees provided patches of shade. A few colorful leaves decorated the stone path, and birds offered commentary on the events. All the moment needed was an orchestra playing something dreamy and a quick, magical clothing transformation during which she would shed her sensible business attire for something diaphanous.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t likely to happen. Rather than push her luck when she\u2019d already scored for her side, she went for a safe topic.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s David doing in school?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s starting to panic. It\u2019s nearly time for finals again. The quarter system is proving to be a challenge for him. He\u2019s used to being the smartest kid in his class and not having to work very hard, but suddenly everyone around him was the smartest in each of their high school classes. But he\u2019s doing okay. I think by the third quarter, he\u2019ll be more relaxed.\u201d</p><p>There was pride in Zach\u2019s voice. And love. He might have a million faults, but his relationship with David made up for a lot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t have more children,\u201d she said idly.</p><p>Zach paused, giving her a startled glance. \u201cI never thought about it,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI like kids. But I was so busy being a single parent, I never considered having more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to stay single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother marriage wasn\u2019t in the cards for me,\u201d he said easily, his blue eyes staring directly into hers. \u201cWhat about you? Why aren\u2019t there a dozen or so Marcelli grandchildren running around? It\u2019s not as if your parents wouldn\u2019t have approved.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThey would love it. As you\u2019ve already experienced, the pressure to marry and have children is pretty relentless in our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you resisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because a dozen kids seems like a few too many.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cOkay. How about four? It\u2019s a nice round number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll agree.\u201d She\u2019d always wanted children and four sounded perfect. \u201cHowever, in my world, children require me to be married, and as I\u2019ve yet to find the right guy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? That I think there\u2019s a \u2018right one\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s a myth of popular culture.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSo speaks the man who has never risked marriage after one youthful mistake. I don\u2019t think that makes you an expert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy career does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your career makes you an expert on why marriages fail, not why they succeed. You know everything a couple shouldn\u2019t do, but very little about what they should do. In my family, marriages have always been forever.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cBrenna\u2019s recent troubles to the contrary.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cYou argue a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a very pleasant person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou argue a lot with me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Ask yourself why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know why. You\u2019re fighting the chemistry between us.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, he moved close. Very close. Close enough that it seemed unnecessary for her to keep breathing. There was also the matter of his arms going around her and drawing her next to him.</p><p>She knew what he was going to do, and she didn\u2019t even consider stopping him. Not when she\u2019d secretly wanted another kiss ever since he\u2019d ended the first one. Oh, she knew she should resist, but this was one of those times when being bad felt so good.</p><p>His lips moved against hers with the best combination of tension, pressure, and softness. Firm yet yielding, sweet yet masculine. She found herself melting into the sensation, savoring every exquisite millimeter of contact. She wanted to part her lips, to have him plunge inside of her, but she also wanted to continue the kiss, drawing out the moment, enjoying the need and hunger building inside of her.</p><p>He moved his mouth back and forth, gently discovering her. When he bit on the full center of her lower lip, she gasped in both shock and delight. A quick brush of histongue on the sensual injury made her shiver in anticipation. She raised her hands to his shoulders, for balance as well as to hold him in place. Her fingers rubbed against the smooth fabric of his suit.</p><p>Slowly, as if to give her time to get used to the idea, he slipped his tongue inside. She waited for some voice to call out the need to be sensible, but there was only silent anticipation. Hadn\u2019t Brenna told her she needed to be more bad? Kissing Zach sure had to qualify.</p><p>She surrendered to the wanting and parted her lips fully to admit him.</p><p>The arms around her tightened. He held her close enough that his heat warmed her, yet she didn\u2019t feel trapped. They moved together, as if they had performed this particular dance a thousand times before. There was no awkwardness, no bumping of noses and knees. Just mind-crushing desire. It swept through her like a tornado, sucking the air from her lungs and making her want to beg him to let her surrender.</p><p>Her skin felt too hot and too tight. Every erogenous zone she knew about and some she had yet to discover sent up warning signals that if they were not touched and soon, she would have to die right then. The taste of him, the pressure, the sweet sensations were all more than she had expected.</p><p>All her fantasies about Zach, both funny and serious, hadn\u2019t prepared her for the reality. His hands moved up and down her back, making her want to purr. When he slipped lower, cupping her rear, she instinctively arched against him, wanting to feel all of him. The hard proof of his arousal nearly made her scream in delight.</p><p>The rational part of her brain, which should have been telling her this was a big mistake, began to gauge the distance to the front desk of the hotel and calculate the embarrassment factor of checking in for a couple of hours of hot monkey sex. The alternative was doing it right here in the garden, but she\u2019d never been one for public displays of affection.</p><p>Before she could decide if she could overcome her inhibitions, Zach drew back just enough to break the kiss. He rested his forehead on hers. She had a feeling he\u2019d come to his senses, which really pissed her off. At least he was breathing just as hard as she was. She would hate to be the only one in the throes of uncontrolled passion.</p><p>He rubbed his thumb across her swollen lips. \u201cYou\u2019re full of surprises.\u201d</p><p>She tried to smile, but had a feeling it came out a little shaky at the corners. \u201cThe same could be said about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He cupped her face and kissed her again. \u201cI\u2019ve been kissing on and off for the past twenty years and I know I haven\u2019t felt anything like that before. So it must be you.\u201d</p><p>Even as she told herself his smooth line didn\u2019t mean anything, she found herself desperately wanting to believe it. Okay, Zach had promised to do whatever he could to change her mind about Mia and David, but she didn\u2019t want to believe he would go so far as to seduce her to his side. Except she had a feeling he just might.</p><p>The fact that she didn\u2019t know should have sent her running for the hills, or at least her car. Instead she felt only regret that they hadn\u2019t hooked up under slightly less charged circumstances.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be complicated,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot for me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re tough, Katie. I like that. I like it a lot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His words made her shiver, which only proved she was a fool.</p><p>She stepped back and straightened her jacket. \u201cThis was great and all, but I really have to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could come back to my place.\u201d</p> <p>The invitation, delivered in a sensually husky voice, made her knees melt. She had to consciously force her muscles to tighten so she wouldn\u2019t collapse in a heap.</p><p>\u201cI could, but I won\u2019t. Thanks for asking, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant a rain check?\u201d</p><p>She risked glancing at him. His dark blue eyes were bright with passion, his lips were still swollen. He looked impossibly sexy and irresistible. Giving in made perfect sense. No one would blame her.</p><p>\u201cThis is L.A.,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually get rain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd scared.\u201d</p><p>As they both knew that was the truth; she didn\u2019t see any point in admitting it. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>She picked up her briefcase and made a timely retreat. Because ten more seconds in his company would put her on the verge of giving in, and she couldn\u2019t risk that.</p><p>Mia stood up from her place at the kitchen table and stretched to relieve the muscles in her back. Too many hours spent hunched over a book, she thought. She crossed to the calendar posted on the refrigerator door, where she checked off another two-hour block of study. She only had a week until finals. As usual, she\u2019d prepared a schedule dividing up her non-classroom time into review sessions. Also, as usual, she was right on schedule.</p> <p>Thanks to Katie, she thought, her gaze straying to a picture of all four Marcelli girls standing together in the middle of a vineyard. Her sister had always been the most organized student, and she\u2019d passed all her tricks along to Mia.</p><p>A knock on the door made her turn. She knew instantly who stood in the hallway of her apartment building. She wrestled with two parts anticipation and one part apprehension.</p><p>She crossed to the door and opened it.</p><p>\u201cBefore you say anything,\u201d David told her as he entered, \u201cI\u2019m only staying thirty minutes. We need to stay focused on finals. But I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>She studied his familiar face, the blue eyes that she\u2019d noticed right off, and the way his blond hair always fell across his forehead.</p><p>He held up a white bag. \u201cI got your favorites,\u201d he said. \u201cJust yesterday I was reading that sugar helps with mental acuity.\u201d</p><p>She glanced from the bag containing Baskin-Robbins ice cream to David. Apprehension faded as love swelled to take its place.</p> <p>For the past few weeks, ever since they\u2019d tried to shop for the gift registry, things had been kind of twisted between them. Not wrong, exactly, but not right, either. The fight had changed things. They\u2019d been seeing each other, but the seeing had been strained.</p><p>Suddenly everything felt right again. She wrapped her arms around him and held him close. He dropped the ice-cream bag and pulled her hard against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, suddenly fighting tears.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cI love you, Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you more.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at the familiar joke. She continued to cling to him, needing to crawl inside and be a part of him. Whatever else went wrong in her life, being with David was always right.</p><p>10</p><p>Z ach arrived at the Marcelli hacienda shortly before five. The house calls were killing his billable hours, but he willingly accepted that. After all, there was a greater good to consider. Besides, he could feel time ticking away. It had been six weeks since David and Mia had announced their engagement. Six weeks during which he\u2019d made little progress toward breaking up the happy couple.</p><p>A recent spat between them had given him hope, but David had called to tell him they\u2019d made up. Katie had yet to see the light, and he found himself spending as much time thinking about getting her into bed as getting her on his side.</p><p>Brenna was a potential ally, but she was too caught up in her own personal grief to be of much help. So despite a plan to find a fellow dissenter in the enemy camp, he was still on his own.</p><p>He parked and collected his paperwork, then walked to the front door of the hacienda. Brenna met him there, looking dark-eyed and tragic. Despite her olive complexion, she appeared pale. Shadows stained the skin under her eyes, and there were new lines by the corners of her mouth. Divorce did not agree with her.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d she said as she stepped back to invite him into the house. \u201cI know I really need to start driving down to L.A., but right now that seems like an impossible task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been back to the apartment to collect your belongings?\u201d</p><p>She gave a strangled laugh. \u201cWhat is there to collect? Some old clothes and costume jewelry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStereo, television, a clock radio, whatever was yours to begin with.\u201d</p><p>She frowned slightly. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, but you have a point. I guess I should force myself to check out the place. I can\u2019t imagine Jeff would do anything to my things, but then I never thought he\u2019d want a divorce, either.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d heard of a whole lot worse. \u201cIf you find anything missing, I\u2019ll need a complete inventory of what\u2019s not there. Wanting to end the marriage doesn\u2019t give him the right to destroy your personal property.\u201d</p><p>She nodded listlessly, as if the entire process would take more energy than she had, then pointed to the living room.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to work in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere with a table would be better.\u201d</p><p>He had plenty of papers for her to review and some news that wasn\u2019t going to brighten her day. It would piss off the family, as well.</p><p>Brenna led the way into the kitchen. Zach was surprised to find it bustling with activity. The taller of the two grandmothers\u2014Tessa, he thought\u2014stirred something at the stove, while Mary-Margaret O\u2019Shea kneaded bread dough. Neither woman noticed them.</p><p>Grammy M, as Katie called her, used her forearm to brush back a loose curl. \u201cI\u2019ll be needin\u2019 the oven, Tessa. When I\u2019ve finished with the bread, the sweet rolls will be wantin\u2019 to bake.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa peered at the temperature setting. \u201cIt\u2019s ready now.\u201d She started to say something else, but spotted him and Brenna instead. \u201cZach, how good to see you.\u201d</p><p>She abandoned her efforts at the stove and hurried toward him. Between his briefcase and the stack of files he carried, he didn\u2019t have a free hand. Not that he would be able to ward off her enthusiastic greeting. He was summarily hugged, patted, and cheek-pinched. Grammy M\u2014so tiny she barely came up to his chest\u2014followed, although she only squeezed his arm instead of his cheek. They both spoke at once, one offering tea, the other Italian cookies, or maybe a nice dish of pasta. The combination of warm Italian staccato and lilting Irish brogue should have jarred his ears, but he\u2019d grown used to the odd melody.</p><p>\u201cNothing for me, thanks. I\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, depositing his briefcase in a chair and his files on the table.</p><p>They both ignored his statement. Within a minute a steaming cup of tea had been set at the head of the table and right next to it was a plate piled high with cookies. A mug of tea was pressed into Brenna\u2019s hands. She cradled it as she took a seat next to his. Zach settled into the chair obviously assigned to him and reached for his paperwork.</p><p>Grandma Tessa and Grammy M hovered by the table. He glanced at the bread dough now resting in a covered bowl, then at the stove. Nothing else appeared to be cooking. And whatever Grammy M had put in the oven was there to stay for a while. He hesitated, not used to conducting business with an audience, but Brenna didn\u2019t seem to notice. Finally he glanced at his client.</p><p>\u201cWill we be in the way here? Should we move to another room?\u201d</p><p>Brenna roused herself enough to shake her head. \u201cI like the emotional hand-holding. Besides, they\u2019re going to find out everything anyway,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cHaving the Grands here will mean two less tellings of the story. You\u2019re lucky the whole family isn\u2019t attending.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cKatie\u2019s not coming because she\u2019s busy with work, but Francesca should be here any minute. Not that we have to wait for her. I didn\u2019t tell Mia because she\u2019s busy with finals this week and I didn\u2019t want to upset her.\u201d</p><p>He had a couple of socialite clients who brought their rat dogs to meetings, and a famous actor who traveled everywhere with a publicist, business manager, and assistant, but very few people had a familial entourage. Somehow he thought the Grands were going to be a whole lot more helpful to Brenna than a pet or a personal assistant.</p><p>Zach was about to begin when Colleen Marcelli walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHave I missed anything?\u201d she asked, moving first to her daughter, where she bent low and kissed her cheek, then to Zach. She lightly touched his shoulder and gave him a warm smile before taking the seat across from Brenna and settling in to listen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just starting,\u201d Brenna said.</p><p>Colleen nodded. She was a well-dressed woman in her mid-forties, although she looked much younger. She\u2019d inherited her mother\u2019s blue eyes, along with Grammy M\u2019s delicate build.</p><p>\u201cI thought it best not to include your father,\u201d she said, nodding when Grammy M offered tea. \u201cYou know how much he can yell. Marco and your grandfather are already talking about altering Jeff\u2019s manhood\u2014such as it is.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think any of us needed to hear the details again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d Brenna said ruefully. \u201cEveryone welcomed him into the family when I married him, but now all I hear is how you all had your suspicions.\u201d</p><p>Colleen nodded sympathetically. She stretched her hand across the table to squeeze her daughter\u2019s arm. Zach waited it all out. He was used to emotional clients\u2014sobbing, even fits of rage weren\u2019t uncommon in his line of work. Compared with that, a quiet, rational family looking on was no big deal.</p><p>He cleared his throat, but before he could speak, Grammy M put a cup of tea in front of her daughter, then took a seat at the table. Grandma Tessa did the same, but instead of liquid refreshment, she brought a basket with her. He eyed the container, wondering what on earth they could be planning\u2014and then he knew.</p><p>Sure enough, lace flowers were passed around. Bowls of beads and seed pearls were set in the center of the table, and all the women, even Brenna, started sewing.</p><p>Light caught the tiny beads. Female fingers worked with a sure swiftness that came from hours of practice. Zach didn\u2019t want to think about what the lace was for, so he returned his attention to the business at hand\u2014namely Brenna\u2019s divorce\u2014and sorted through the files he\u2019d brought.</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cTake a deep breath and relax,\u201d he said gently. \u201cMost of what we have to discuss is fairly standard. The only unusual issue to turn up so far is that Jeff is claiming half of your share of the winery.\u201d</p><p>He braced himself as he spoke, knowing he\u2019d just dropped a bomb on the entire family. As expected, conversation exploded around him. He didn\u2019t bother to compete, instead letting them express their outrage. Grandma Tessa sprang to her feet and announced that her late father-inlaw (God rest his soul) had started the winery, breaking the ground with his own bare hands, and no lying, cheating\u2014She began muttering in Italian. Grammy M\u2019s eyes narrowed in an expression of fury that made Zach want to inch away. Colleen looked just as ready to skin Brenna\u2019s soon-to-be ex-husband, while Brenna simply appeared stunned.</p><p>When the talk died down, he turned his attention to his client. \u201cThis is a ploy. Jeff and his lawyer want to distract us from the real issue\u2014namely how long you supported Jeff through his medical training. Any inheritance you received wouldn\u2019t be considered community property unless it was commingled in some kind of joint account, with joint funds.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat bastard,\u201d Brenna snapped. \u201cHe never cared about the winery. I\u2019m the one who has always loved it. I gave it up for him and this is my reward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a divorce,\u201d Zach told her. \u201cFair or right doesn\u2019t enter into it. This is all about money. Unfortunately, fighting his claim is going to chew up a lot. Was there an inheritance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a penny,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cNothing has been turned over to me, and unless Grandpa Lorenzo has changed his will, nothing ever will be.\u201d Her mouth twisted. \u201cHe\u2019s giving up on a male grandson and holding out for a male great-grandson.\u201d</p> <p>Grammy M leaned close. \u201cDarlin\u2019 Brenna, don\u2019t you worry about this. The little ferret won\u2019t be gettin\u2019 so much as a single grape from this place.\u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded at her grandmother. \u201cI know, but I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, Jeff wants to divert our attention from the real issue. I\u2019m not going to let that happen. I\u2019ll let his attorney know there wasn\u2019t any kind of inheritance. He\u2019ll push back. Be prepared for that, but don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll handle it. If that\u2019s the best they\u2019ve got, we\u2019re in the clear.\u201d</p><p>He picked up a second folder. \u201cOur attention will be focused on the fact that you supported your husband through medical school, his internship and residency, as well as paying off debt he accumulated before the marriage. The precedence for you to receive compensation is very strong. We have some tables that show\u2014\u201d</p><p>The back door opened. A blond-haired woman in jeans walked into the kitchen. She was tall and slender, but that wasn\u2019t what caught his attention. Instead it was the tattoos covering nearly every inch of exposed skin. There was even a small blue star by the corner of her right eye, just under the silver ring piercing her eyebrow.</p> <p>The young woman laughed, then planted her hands on her hips. \u201cObviously it\u2019s working. Hello! It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>The grandmothers laughed, while Colleen rose to embrace the young woman. Brenna set down her sewing and studied the visitor.</p><p>\u201cI thought the fat suit was next,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was, but then I saw this guy with tattoos and it gave me an idea.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa sighed heavily and dug in her pocket for her rosary. \u201cFor this God gave you the face of an angel? Did you color your hair? Francesca, it was so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Zach blinked. Francesca? He tried to reconcile the tattooed woman in front of him with the sister he remembered. He supposed the shape of her face was familiar.</p> <p>Brenna leaned toward him. \u201cI know it\u2019s strange, but you\u2019ll get used to it. Francesca is studying social psychology. Her doctorate explores how people react to appearance. She spends her day shocking people.\u201d</p><p>Zach shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s good at it.\u201d</p><p>Francesca finished assuring both her grandmothers that the blond hair was just a wig. She poured herself some coffee from a pot on the counter, then sat next to her mother and reached for a lace flower.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJeff wants a share of the winery,\u201d Brenna told her sister.</p><p>Francesca\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cThat pissant, pinheaded, sleazeball.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa gave her granddaughter a warning glance. \u201cGod listens to everything you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he listening to Jeff\u2019s lies, too?\u201d Francesca slapped her hands against the table. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said no when you told me we should have him killed.\u201d She shook her head at both her grandmothers. \u201cJust kidding. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>Zach waded into the fray. \u201cJeff is going to have to pay up, ladies. Let\u2019s keep the big picture in mind. The best way to get his attention is through his wallet.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the financial table he\u2019d been holding and turned it toward Brenna. \u201cThis gives you an idea of how much of his income is up for grabs. You weren\u2019t married long enough to cross the ten-year threshold. That\u2019s the point at which you can petition for alimony for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my style,\u201d Brenna told him. \u201cI want him to suffer, but I\u2019m not going to sit on my butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. The court will see it the same way. You\u2019re young and capable. They\u2019ll expect you to want to make something of your life. Marrying a jerk doesn\u2019t entitle you to a lifetime of support. However, the state believes that everything should be divided equally. And there is the matter of you supporting Jeff.\u201d He laid the financial paper aside. \u201cIt would help if you had some kind of plan, Brenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoals for the future. A sense of what you want to do with your life. If you wanted to go to college or start a business, Jeff would most likely be required to ante up for some or all of that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll come up with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should. In the meantime, you need to get back into the apartment and collect your things. Make a list of everything that\u2019s missing. Did you get the information on your checking account?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Colleen looked up, but didn\u2019t say anything. Grammy M clucked sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cPlease check the current balance. Also, let me know what it was when you left. Oh, and would you get me a copy of your apartment lease?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He handed her several papers he needed her to fill out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about it,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you have any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll talk to you in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>He started to put his folders back in order.</p><p>Grandma Tessa rose instantly. \u201cAre you hungry? We\u2019ll be having dinner soon. You\u2019ll stay, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get back to Los Angeles,\u201d he said, a little surprised that he felt something close to regret. The idea of eating with the Marcellis, of spending the evening with them, wasn\u2019t unpleasant.</p><p>If not for David wanting to marry Mia, Zach would be pleased to hang out with the Marcelli clan.</p><p>\u201cThen at least stay long enough to eat some of the cookies,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cMy mother will be crushed if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He nodded because it seemed easier to give in than fight. Grammy M rushed to get him more tea, while Francesca rose to check on the delicious-smelling baked goods in the oven.</p><p>Grandma Tessa continued her beadwork. \u201cKatie called yesterday. She\u2019s working very hard on that fund-raiser for your law firm.\u201d</p><p>Zach shook his head. They were charming women, but not the least bit subtle. \u201cShe\u2019s a hard worker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty, too,\u201d Grammy M offered from her place by the stove.</p><p>\u201cVery pretty.\u201d Very sexy.</p><p>\u201cHave you been seeing a lot of her?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>He thought about the kiss in the garden. Not as much of her as he would like, but he wasn\u2019t going to complain to her mother. \u201cWe had a business meeting last week.\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s mouth settled in a straight line. \u201cJust a business meeting? Nothing more...personal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>He finished the cookie and rose to make his escape, before they started on a web for him. \u201cLadies, this has been terrific, but I have to head back to the city.\u201d</p><p>It took at least ten minutes to make his way out of the house. After he\u2019d stowed his files and briefcase, he settled behind the wheel and started the engine.</p><p>They were good, honest people who didn\u2019t have a clue about how financially vulnerable they were. To them, life was a sitcom. Easy problems wrapped up in twenty-two minutes. If Brenna hadn\u2019t inherited anything, then Jeff was out of luck. But what if she had? And what about the next Marcelli daughter who married? From where he was sitting he could see acres of vineyards stretching in every direction. Now the thick stalks were gray and wizened, but come spring...</p><p>He realized he didn\u2019t know what they would look like, come spring, but he could imagine. Each vine heavy with grapes. Grapes later transformed into wine. The Marcelli Winery was world famous. The family\u2019s wealth made David\u2019s trust fund seem insignificant.</p><p>They were all so gung ho on the wedding, but no one thought about what could happen after. There hadn\u2019t been a word of talk about a prenuptial agreement. They were too busy beading lace and spinning a web that could trap them all.</p><p>11</p><p>K atie juggled two \u201cstay-hot\u201d Styrofoam containers, along with her heavy briefcase, as she made her way up the stairs to Zach\u2019s front door. For the entire forty-two-minute trip from the hotel to his place, she\u2019d lectured herself on the importance of staying cool, acting professional, and pretending that the passionate kiss in the hotel garden had never taken place. No matter what, she would not react to him again. Even if he opened the door naked.</p><p>Especially then.</p><p>In keeping with the \u201cbusiness only\u201d attitude she\u2019d decided was the most sensible\u2014and safe\u2014she\u2019d dressed in a severe black pantsuit and a silk-blend turtleneck. Except for her face and hands, there wasn\u2019t an inch of exposed skin. She refused to give him any ideas.</p><p>Speaking of Zach, he must have been watching for her because he opened the door before she had a chance to knock. He grabbed both food containers and eyed her briefcase.</p><p>\u201cDo you take that with you everywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about,\u201d she admitted, unable to keep from smiling at the sight of him. \u201cI never know when I\u2019m going to need to produce a chart or schedule.\u201d</p><p>He ushered her into the kitchen. He\u2019d obviously arrived home some time ago. Not only was the table set, but he\u2019d changed out of his suit into jeans and a long-sleeved shirt. Katie couldn\u2019t help noticing his butt as he turned to put the containers on the counter.</p><p>Most men had pretty decent butts, far better than most women\u2019s, and Zach\u2019s was definitely in the top ten percentile. Damn. Don\u2019t look, she told herself as she moved toward the containers of food. \u201cJerome prepared all the dishes we\u2019d talked about tasting. Obviously they aren\u2019t as fresh as they will be at the party, so take that into account. Also, the presentation is somewhat lacking.\u201d</p><p>She started opening foil packages. Zach set Styrofoam containers on the table. Once the food was laid out, she pulled large, folded sheets of paper from her briefcase. She opened them to show mock-ups of the food displays. As Zach tasted, she explained what foods would be at which stations and how everything would be served.</p><p>\u201cSome of the kabobs will be precooked,\u201d she told him, \u201cbut others will require guest preparation. Also, we\u2019re going to have a station of exotic meats, and vegetarian stations for those who prefer that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTofu on a stick?\u201d he teased.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI hope it\u2019s more interesting than that, but yes.\u201d</p><p>She showed him computer-generated designs for the various carnival booths, then returned her papers to her briefcase and took some food for herself.</p><p>They discussed various ingredients, ranked their favorites, and narrowed the menu down to something close to its final form. Katie finished making notes while Zach prepared coffee.</p><p>\u201cIf only I could get you to care this much about the napkin selections,\u201d she joked as he collected two mugs from a cupboard.</p><p>\u201cNever gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspected as much.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a flat plastic box from her briefcase. Before she could open it, Zach moved to the table and set her coffee in front of her. He then took the box and opened it.</p><p>In that second she realized she hadn\u2019t been thinking. Beading lace in the presence of the one person determined to stop the wedding was bound to get a reaction.</p><p>Zach lifted the half-beaded lace flower from its container and turned it over in his hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do beautiful work,\u201d he said, his voice not giving away his feelings. But then she already knew what was on his mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing a good job of convincing you to see my side of things,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNot for lack of trying. You\u2019ve threatened me, tried reason and seduction. What\u2019s next? Money?\u201d</p> <p>He set the lace back in the box. \u201cKatie, it was one kiss. If I\u2019d been trying to seduce you, things wouldn\u2019t have stopped there.\u201d</p><p>She snapped the case shut. Talk about arrogant. \u201cYou\u2019re assuming a lot.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes locked on hers. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Heat boiled between them. Katie didn\u2019t want to be the one to blink first, but she could feel herself slipping under his spell. Better to retreat and live to fight another day than give in with a pitiful \u201cTake me, I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why can\u2019t you consider the possibility of being wrong about David and Mia?\u201d she asked in a feeble attempt to crank down the temperature in the room.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not. The only thing I feel more strongly about than keeping David from marrying Mia in July is keeping him from running off with her. He\u2019s stubborn enough to do it. I\u2019m still building my case. When I have it together, I\u2019ll take it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you love your son. But Mia is so sure about David, and she rarely makes a bad decision. Can\u2019t you trust her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Not a surprise. Maybe a nice change of subject was due. \u201cI spoke with my mom this morning. Everyone in the family is really impressed with how you\u2019re handling Brenna\u2019s divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust doing my job,\u201d he said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re also furious with Jeff. I can\u2019t believe he had the balls to come after the winery. I\u2019m half expecting Grandma Tessa to put some ancient Italian curse on him.\u201d</p> <p>Zach chuckled. \u201cInteresting plan. I prefer to take the legal approach, making him bleed every month as he writes Brenna a big, fat check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this where I hum the Jaws theme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cSo me thinking you\u2019re a shark doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am what I am. What I think isn\u2019t going to change your opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but my grandmothers adore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine women with excellent taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the cheek pinching?\u201d</p> <p>He winced. \u201cThat\u2019s not my favorite trait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to the family, but I would guess you find us all a little overwhelming.\u201d She put the lace flower back in the box. \u201cThe last dress I worked on was Brenna\u2019s. Well, Brenna\u2019s and Francesca\u2019s. They had a double wedding. Francesca\u2019s husband died a few years later, which left Brenna as the only married sister. Grandpa Lorenzo was constantly on her to have children. And now she\u2019s getting a divorce.\u201d She sipped her coffee.</p><p>\u201cThere are worse things,\u201d Zach pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNot in our family. She\u2019s feeling a lot of guilt about all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe divorce isn\u2019t her fault. Jeff is the one who left. From what I can tell, Brenna was willing to tough it out, even if things weren\u2019t perfect at home.\u201d</p><p>That surprised her. \u201cShe admitted there was a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but she didn\u2019t have to. Happy marriages don\u2019t end in divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose, but whatever the problem was, we never knew. Everyone liked Jeff, which made his leaving such a shock.\u201d She sighed. \u201cPoor Brenna. She\u2019d dealing with her own pain and knowing that this is the first Marcelli divorce ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess people don\u2019t have a choice. It must be really hard on the kids. Didn\u2019t you mention that your parents were divorced? Or is that too personal to ask?\u201d</p><p>Zach leaned back in his chair. \u201cKatie, a few days ago I had my tongue in your mouth. It\u2019s not too personal.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. She\u2019d been doing so well, feeling normal around Zach, and with one sentence he\u2019d made her aware of him again.</p><p>\u201cMy parents split up,\u201d he said. \u201cLike most couples, they were in trouble years before that. I guess I was ten when I figured out something was wrong. I saw my dad kissing a woman who wasn\u2019t my mother. When I mentioned it to him, he said it was time I learned the facts of life and proceeded to tell me that every man who knew what was good for him kept a little something on the side.\u201d</p><p>Katie felt her mouth drop open. She closed it quickly, but knew she looked as surprised as she felt. \u201cHe said that?\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded. \u201cHe thought he was hip. I told him he was a bastard. He only laughed. By the time I was twelve, he started introducing me to his flavor of the month. He never kept them around long, but there was always one waiting in the wings.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. \u201cDid your mother know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said anything. I was a kid and scared. She probably figured it out on her own.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cNot that it mattered. My dad came from money and she didn\u2019t, so he had the power.\u201d</p><p>She heard the bitterness in his voice.</p><p>Zach picked up his coffee, but didn\u2019t drink. \u201cHe never worked a day in his life. Maybe that was the problem\u2014too much time on his hands. I guess the cheating was the price my mother had to pay for the good life. But eventually the price got too high. They split when I was fourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did you live with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother. After my father left, his money disappeared, too. She went to work, first one job, then two. She wouldn\u2019t touch the trust fund my father set up for me. She kept saying that was for my future. Ironically, despite his millions, my father never paid child support and my mother wouldn\u2019t take him to court to make him. So we went from rich to poor in short order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she want him to pay child support? That was for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Pride? Shame? She was a hell of a woman\u2014always there for me. Once I had David, she was a rock. She died my first year of law school.\u201d He paused, then glanced around the kitchen. \u201cI wish she could have lived long enough to see all of this, and so I could have made her life easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Katie whispered, not sure what else to say. His childhood was light-years from her own. \u201cIs your dad still alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He died a few years back. Turns out he left David a nice trust fund and the rest of the money to me.\u201d He laughed, but the sound had no humor. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a bitch? Every stinking penny to me. But in the end I walked away from it. The old man put too many strings on his dollars, and I didn\u2019t need them that badly. So they went to some charity and I\u2019m finally free of him.\u201d</p><p>Ever the man in charge, no hint of pain flickered in his eyes. She wondered if it was still there, or if he\u2019d made peace with the past. Whatever doubts she may have had about Zach changing his mind about Mia and David getting married had just been squashed. No wonder he didn\u2019t think relationships worked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s my sorry past. Let\u2019s talk about something cheerful. How about your dating history?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWhy is that a cheerful subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou being happily married would put a real crimp in my plans to seduce you.\u201d</p><p>Katie was glad she wasn\u2019t drinking. Had she been, she might have spit. \u201cOkay, then. Thanks for making that clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. So tell me about all the Mr. Wrongs and how much more interesting I am than them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that ego again. I should have brought more food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stalling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say. My dating history is pretty much like everyone else\u2019s. I\u2019ve dated men who are afraid of commitment, or men who want to commit for the wrong reason. Even some who should have been committed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess so than you might think.\u201d She considered her dating past. \u201cThere were guys who could drive me crazy in three minutes and guys who just weren\u2019t as interested in me as I was in them.\u201d She leaned forward and rested her forearms on the table. \u201cIn all of that I never found the one who was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect?\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for perfect. Just a couple of bells.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. Hearing bells or music or something. A cosmic sign that I\u2019d found the right guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re way too romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want what most women want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA free ride and a pool boy for sex?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s cynical even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You\u2019re right. Not all women are on the take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn behalf of my gender, allow me to be flattered.\u201d</p><p>She rose and crossed to the sink, where she rinsed her mug. When she turned, Zach was standing right behind her. His dark gaze settled on her face.</p><p>\u201cI never thought that about you,\u201d he told her. \u201cI mean that, Katie. You\u2019re a class act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He was standing close. Too close.</p><p>He reached up and touched her cheek. Instantly heat spiraled through her, making it difficult to remember her plan not to react to him again. Somehow the importance of it all escaped her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked, his voice low and seductive.</p><p>\u201cI, um, I\u2019m not really thinking anything.\u201d</p><p>Which was true. She was using the moment to get lost in his blue eyes. They were the perfect color, she thought. She also liked the stubble darkening his jaw and the way he\u2014</p><p>His mouth brushed against hers. All her senses went on instant alert. The sensible part of her knew this was a really big mistake. Kissing the last time could almost be considered an accident. But if they did it again, it might have significance...although she couldn\u2019t say exactly what that significance would be. And before she could figure it out, his tongue brushed against her bottom lip and she no longer cared.</p><p>He felt too good, she thought, surrendering to the moment. Her arms came up and rested on his shoulders as she took a step forward. Their bodies pressed together. He was hard to her soft\u2014thick muscles and angles, unyielding where they touched. She liked that. She liked the scent of him, too. That heady masculine combination of skin and some unique elixir that was the essence of Zach himself.</p><p>He cupped her face, then slid his fingers into her hair. When he nipped her bottom lip, she gasped slightly, parting for him, wanting him to move inside of her. Her heartbeat quickened in anticipation. Heat flared between her thighs, and her breasts swelled. Every erogenous zone she owned prepared to party.</p><p>Their tongues touched in introduction, then circled each other. She dropped her hands to his back, where she could feel his muscles tensing. Was it suddenly hot in here, or was it her? She felt as if parts of her were on fire.</p><p>Zach must have read her mind because he tugged on the lapels of her suit jacket. She moved her arms to her side so he could push the garment over her shoulders. It slid soundlessly to the floor.</p><p>Her turtleneck suddenly seemed to be an unreasonable constriction. What had she been thinking? Wouldn\u2019t a silky camisole have been better? Something with thin fabric, lots of lace, and a style that exposed plenty of flesh. Or better yet a\u2014</p><p>Her mind experienced thought gridlock when Zach put his hands on her waist and began moving them higher. As there weren\u2019t a lot of choices in the destination department, she had a good idea where he was headed. She also knew what was going to happen when he got there.</p><p>If his hot kissing was anything to go by, he would touch her with a combination of gentleness and experience that would rob her of several important abilities. So if she was going to stop things, this would be the moment. Right now. Right this second. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His fingers grazed the undersides of her breasts. Any master plan she\u2019d had was lost, and she could do nothing but surrender to the sensation of his confident caress.</p><p>He cupped her curves, then brushed his thumbs against her already tight nipples. Even through the layers of clothing, she was exquisitely sensitive. Her breath caught and her pelvic muscles clenched.</p><p>As he gently squeezed her breasts, he drew back from her mouth. Before she could complain, he pressed his lips against her jaw, then moved lower to her neck. Soft, wet kisses made her arch her head back. He moved to the sensitive skin below her ears and gently sucked. She wanted him to keep going lower and lower, but her turtleneck was in the way.</p> <p>She braced herself for the sensible fairy to burst into her brain and make her stop. She waited for Zach to come to his senses and stop making her whimper with the erotic pattern he traced over her breasts. Instead he dropped his hands to her waistband and started tugging on her shirt.</p><p>The first whisper of cool air should have made her reconsider. Under other circumstances\u2014although she couldn\u2019t say what\u2014it would have. Really. Instead she found herself helping him drag up her turtleneck. She slipped out of the arms, then tugged the tight neck over her head.</p><p>Even as she tossed it aside, his mouth reclaimed hers. She parted as he plunged inside her. Tongues circled, stroked, danced. He moved closer still so that their bodies pressed together, her bare midsection rubbing against the softness of his shirt. His hands brushed her bare back, then moved up to expertly unfasten her bra.</p><p>She felt the slack in the band, then the straps fell off her shoulders. He eased away just enough to slip one hand between them. That large, warm hand moved under her bra cup and engulfed her aching left breast.</p><p>Need flooded her. Need and wanting and passion that made her wet and ready in a heartbeat. Every part of her throbbed, but most especially the swelling dampness between her legs.</p> <p>She quickly pulled off her bra and dropped it to the floor. Her hands moved restlessly, first to his shoulders, then to his back where powerful muscles bunched and released. When he bent down and drew her nipple into his mouth, she groaned. When his tongue flicked against the tight tip, she shook.</p><p>Her fingers went to work on his shirt, but his arms got in the way. She managed to pull a couple of buttons free, but that was all. He licked and sucked on her breasts until a steady pulsing beat began between her legs, and she knew that she was already heading for the edge of surrender.</p><p>He abandoned her long enough to pull off his shirt and step out of his shoes. She kicked off hers as well, but that was as far as she got before he reclaimed her with a deep, wet kiss that left her shaken down to her melting bones.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he murmured against her mouth. \u201cKatie, I want you. Now.\u201d</p><p>Simple words, but powerful. He drew her close and her breasts flattened against his bare chest. The hair there tickled erotically. He cupped her rear and squeezed. She tilted forward until her belly came in contact with his erection. They both groaned.</p><p>\u201cWe need to move this upstairs,\u201d he said even as he turned and took her hand in his.</p> <p>He led the way, pausing halfway up the stairs to kiss her neck, her shoulders, then her breasts. Even as his tongue circled her nipple, his fingers slipped between her legs and rubbed against her swollen flesh. She was so wet, so hungry, she surged against him. One or two more strokes would be enough, she thought, fighting desperate need.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d he said hoarsely and continued to the second floor.</p><p>She had a brief impression of high ceilings, skylights, and a king-size bed. The only light came from the hallway, but it was enough. She saw Zach reach for the button on the front of her slacks. When that was free, he tugged down the zipper.</p><p>Below she wore bikini briefs which he quickly stripped off, leaving her naked.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he murmured, even as he gently pushed her into a sitting position.</p><p>Before she\u2019d quite settled on the bed, he\u2019d dropped to his knees and pressed his mouth to the soft skin on the inside of her legs.</p><p>Everything was moving so fast, she thought hazily. She barely knew Zach. He was her client. This was all\u2014</p><p>Heaven, she told herself as his wet kisses moved higher. Stupid, maybe, but heaven. Need pulsed in time with her rapid heartbeat. She ached down to the very fiber of her being.</p> <p>She lay back on the bed and rested her heels on the edge of the mattress. The position left her exposed and vulnerable, and him in no doubt of what she wanted.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to wait long for him to agree to her suggestion. Warm fingers gently slid into slick folds of hungry flesh. He brushed perilously close to that one magical spot, without touching it directly. She shuddered. A whisper of breath was her only warning, then his mouth claimed her in a deep kiss that made every cell in her body scream.</p><p>He brushed his tongue against her tight center, stroking it rhythmically. Over and around, he teased, he promised, he made her gasp, then not breathe at all. She gave in to the journey because she had no choice. When he slipped a single finger inside her to stroke her from that side as well, she gasped his name. When he moved his tongue faster, she fought for control. When he inserted a second finger, she lost it.</p><p>Her orgasm crashed over her with an unexpected intensity. Pleasure filled her to the top and spilled over the sides. Every inch of her body participated, bathing in heat and release. She lost track of time, she lost control, she lost everything except the ongoing pleasure that transported her, shattered her, then returned her safe and sound to the universe of her origin.</p><p>Zach slowly lowered her feet to the floor, then kissed the top of her thigh. She risked opening her eyes. He was smiling, the pleased smile of a lover who has pleasured his partner.</p><p>Coming first made her feel vulnerable. Coming second hadn\u2019t been an option.</p><p>\u201cThat was really good for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>His words eased some of her nervousness. She smiled back. \u201cImagine how it was for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing works.\u201d</p><p>He rose and pulled off his socks, then quickly unfastened his belt, then his trousers. Seconds later he was naked. Katie shifted back on the bed, all the while watching him. She liked his body, the swirls of dark hair on his chest and the narrow pattern that seemed to lead the eye directly to his groin.</p><p>He was hard, ready, and big enough to please. Despite her ten-point-three on the orgasm scale, just looking at his arousal made her insides clench in anticipation.</p><p>He opened the nightstand drawer and drew out a condom.</p><p>After he slipped it on, he moved onto the bed. She opened her arms, then drew him close. His erection brushed against her leg as her thigh slipped between his. He shifted so she was draped over him.</p><p>One of his hands traced patterns across her back while the other cupped her breast. The second his thumb brushed against her nipple, she felt an answer quiver between her legs. She rocked her wetness against his leg.</p><p>\u201cReady again?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can wait if you need me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManful, but unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>She expected him to move into place, but instead he put his hands on her hips and urged her to straddle him. Katie didn\u2019t hesitate. She moved over him, then reached between them to guide him inside.</p><p>His thickness stretched her deliciously. As she came down so he filled her fully, he reached for both breasts and began to gently squeeze her nipples. The combination, her sliding up and down and his attention to her breasts, was too much. She felt the first rippling clench deep inside.</p><p>Zach caught his breath. Having Katie\u2019s slick heat surround him was one thing, but feeling her climax was another. The thick contractions gripped him tightly from base to tip and about squeezed the control right out of him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop,\u201d she gasped as another contraction shuddered through her. \u201cOh, Zach!\u201d</p><p>She rode him, moving faster and faster. Every third or fourth stroke brought another release. The increased pace shattered his control. The swaying of her breasts, the pleasure on her face, the scent of her body all conspired to make him want more.</p><p>He dropped his hands to her hips and dug in his fingers. Plunging faster and deeper, he claimed her and his orgasm, burying himself in her and exploding into pleasure.</p><p>Katie awoke sometime after midnight. There was no second of confusion, no wondering where she was. She knew the exact location and even why she was currently naked. In this case, clarity was not a blessing.</p><p>She\u2019d had sex with Zach Stryker. Zach\u2014the man who had promised to do anything he could to get her to change her mind about Mia\u2019s engagement. Zach, who was her newest client for the biggest contract she\u2019d ever had, her sister\u2019s divorce lawyer, and a potential in-law. The man who was determined to break her sister\u2019s heart.</p><p>She supposed that in the scheme of things, this was probably not the smartest thing she\u2019d ever done. Nope, it probably wasn\u2019t even going to make the top ten.</p><p>She turned her head and saw Zach sleeping next to her. He\u2019d been a great lover, and a stellar host. He\u2019d offered her one of his T-shirts to sleep in, plus a brand-new toothbrush, and had taken her order for breakfast. A girl could get used to this sort of treatment.</p><p>Make that...\u201cA woman.\u201d A mature woman who handled sexual relationships with the ease of handling a tricky scheduling conflict. A sophisticated woman who understood the rules of the game and occasionally bent them for her own benefit. Someone savvy. Someone together.</p><p>Someone not Katie.</p><p>Feeling anything but sophisticated and mature, Katie did the only thing that made sense under the circumstances.</p><p>She ran.</p><p>12</p><p>A light rain fell as Brenna walked through the north vineyard where the Cab grapes were grown. Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with a little Cab Franc for blending. Now, in early April, there were only small signs of life. She spotted a few tiny buds that would soon bring forth green leaves and heavy grapes.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath, inhaling the scent of damp earth. Come late summer the fragrance of the grapes would be nearly as intoxicating as the wine itself. Today there was only the gray of the sky and the brown of the earth, but in time the landscape would be an artist\u2019s palette of colors. Blue and green and gold and purple. She closed her eyes, imagining what it would be, then opened them again. To her, even the barren plainness was beautiful.</p><p>For the first time in several weeks, she felt as if she could breathe. As if she, like the vines, was coming back to life.</p><p>Carefully, so as not to accidentally kick a plant, she bent down and examined the fastenings that held the vine in place. She touched the small tubing that provided life-giving water. Her fingers curled into her palms as she ached for all she\u2019d missed these years. All she\u2019d lost. All Jeff had taken away.</p><p>She knew that in time she would accept his leaving, her stupidity, and the other woman. But she would never, ever forgive him for wanting to lay claim to the land, the vines and the dream she\u2019d given up for him. Rage didn\u2019t describe what she felt, nor did fury. She didn\u2019t just want Jeff to back off, she wanted him destroyed. Any thoughts she\u2019d had about being reasonable had ended the second he\u2019d threatened Marcelli Wines.</p><p>She straightened and raised her face to the rain. Cool drops trickled down her face like tears. Yet this moisture healed. It brought life\u2014to the vines and to her.</p><p>She\u2019d given herself heart, body, and soul to her husband and in the end he\u2019d had no use for the gifts. Obviously her body was hers once again, and while she had no need for her heart\u2014love was not going to be in her future, ever\u2014she desperately had to find her soul if she was ever to reclaim the person she used to be.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Marcelli to your bones. You always come back to the vines.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward the familiar voice and saw Grandpa Lorenzo walking toward her. He wore a heavy jacket and a cap on his white hair. Sometime while she hadn\u2019t been paying attention, he\u2019d become an old man. Time had bent his back and gnarled his hands. Still, when he stood close to her, she felt safe, just as she had when she\u2019d been a little girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about the vines,\u201d she said, staring out at them. \u201cI can\u2019t escape them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even when you try. I heard about your husband. That he tried to claim some of this for himself. That will never happen. This is only for family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Grandpa.\u201d His words made her feel guilty, as if Jeff\u2019s greedy grasping were her fault. \u201cI should never have married him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. We all thought he was a different kind of man.\u201d</p><p>Brenna wasn\u2019t so sure anyone had thought anything except relief that she had married right on schedule. Even at eighteen she\u2019d felt the pressure to marry young and produce a son. She thought of how the current circumstances would have affected a child.</p><p>\u201cAt least we were smart enough not to have babies,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter that they not go through this. Plus Jeff would have been tied to the family forever.\u201d</p><p>She expected a word of agreement, but instead Grandpa Lorenzo sighed heavily. \u201cI would have forgiven many sins for a grandson.\u201d</p><p>Anger flared inside of her. \u201cYou need to get over your gender bias, Grandpa. It\u2019s the new millennium. Women are just as capable as men, and they\u2019re finally getting a chance to prove it.\u201d</p> <p>The old man looked at her. \u201cThey may be capable, but are they as loyal? You left. You went away and the vines were forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d she protested. \u201cYou wanted me to get married. All my life I\u2019d been told my duty was to have a husband and a family. I did what I was supposed to do, and now you\u2019re blaming me for leaving?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the question. \u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo asked.</p><p>\u201cGet a job.\u201d She turned to him. \u201cI want to work here.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI think there\u2019s an opening in the gift shop.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back as if he\u2019d slapped her. Tears sprang to her eyes, but she blinked them away. He would be expecting weakness. She had to be strong to prove herself.</p> <p>\u201cExcept for you, no one knows more about the vines than I do,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou knew. Nine years ago. What do you remember?\u201d</p><p>She thought about her years in an office job she hated, and how at night, when she wasn\u2019t at her second job, she\u2019d studied. She\u2019d used money they\u2019d needed for things like food to buy textbooks from the UC Davis Viticulture and Enology Department. She\u2019d continued her education, even when Jeff had fumed at her, not understanding why it was so important to her.</p><p>\u201cI remember everything,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Her grandfather looked at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s to keep you from running off with the next man who asks?\u201d</p><p>The unfairness of the question fueled her temper. He wanted it both ways\u2014great-grandsons and a promise never to leave.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019ve learned my lesson,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in being stupid a second time.\u201d</p><p>He studied her, staring into her eyes for several seconds before turning away. \u201cThere might be something. Come into my office in the morning and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded without speaking because her throat had tightened and she didn\u2019t think she could form words. When he left, she stayed where she was, raising her face to the light rain, letting the cool drops wash away her tears.</p><p>Finally, when the cold seeped into her bones, she forced herself to head back to the house. As she turned in that direction, she caught sight of a distant hillside, also covered with dormant vines. But this land wasn\u2019t part of the Marcelli legacy. Instead it belonged to Wild Sea Vineyards.</p><p>Marcelli wines had an excellent reputation for quality. They consistently received high scores and won medals. But Wild Sea Vineyards was an international success that dwarfed its neighbor. The two wineries had been founded together, by best friends as close as brothers. Until sixty years before, when there had been a falling out between the Marcelli and Giovanni family.</p><p>Wild Sea had grown big enough to dominate the valley. One by one small family wineries faded into bankruptcy or were swallowed up by larger labels\u2014not just here, but in Napa and Sonoma. The days of the \u201cgentleman vintner\u201d were numbered.</p><p>Did her grandfather know? Had he recognized the changes coming?</p><p>She told herself that in time they would speak of it. Or she would talk, he would listen, then they would argue. It had always been that way with her grandfather.</p><p>Brenna walked toward the hacienda. She and her sisters had never paid attention to the feud, which, sixty years after it happened, still influenced Lorenzo Marcelli\u2019s every action. They\u2019d listened to the grown-ups talk and had rolled their eyes. But her grandparents had taken it seriously, as had her parents. So when she\u2019d turned sixteen and had fallen in love with Nicholas Giovanni, she hadn\u2019t told a soul.</p><p>A lifetime ago, she reminded herself. Back when she had been young and idealistic, and had thought that love would last forever.</p><p>Zach made notes on the file in front of him, but it was difficult to concentrate with the beat of loud music swirling around him. He glanced at the ceiling, toward David\u2019s bedroom. His son was home for a few days, recovering from finals, and he\u2019d invited a few friends over to help him celebrate temporary freedom. While Zach enjoyed having his son around, even for a short time, the teenagers and their loud music made him feel old.</p><p>He glanced at his watch, then at the phone. He hadn\u2019t seen Katie or spoken with her since she\u2019d disappeared from his bed three mornings before.</p><p>Sneaking out before dawn was usually his job, he thought ruefully. As a rule, he preferred to be the guest rather than host so he could end the date when he was ready. That hadn\u2019t happened with Katie, and when he\u2019d awakened to find her side of the bed cold and not a trace of her in the house, he\u2019d had a moment of compassion for all the women he\u2019d treated in the same way.</p><p>\u201cPayback\u2019s a bitch,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He knew she\u2019d enjoyed their time in bed, as had he. He guessed the physical connection had left her as rattled as it had left him. So they both needed time to regroup. Not a problem. He could wait her out.</p><p>But the cool confidence of his thoughts didn\u2019t keep him from glancing back at the phone and wondering why the hell she hadn\u2019t called him.</p><p>He returned his attention to his notes. He was involved in a particularly tricky case between a software multimillionaire and his high-school sweetheart turned soon-to-be ex-wife. This time he represented the husband who had found out that the love of his life hadn\u2019t just been screwing the pool boy. She\u2019d also had a torrid affair with the maid and the maid\u2019s husband.</p><p>\u201cTo each his own,\u201d he muttered as he checked a few minor points of law.</p><p>Sometime later David turned off the music. Zach barely noticed. However, he did look up when he heard footsteps on the hardwood floor. The kids trooped toward the front door. A couple paused to yell out thanks for allowing them to visit.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Zach told them.</p><p>David came downstairs last, a pretty redhead walking with him. They were deep in conversation.</p><p>Zach made a few more notes in the margin. He and David were going to go grab an early dinner, then take in a movie. Mia had some plans with a club on campus, so he and David were just going to be a couple of wild guys on the town.</p><p>Real wild, Zach thought with a grin. Dinner and a movie, home before ten.</p><p>A soft giggle caught his attention. He glanced up and saw David still talking to the redhead. She leaned against the wall by the front door. One hand toyed with a long strand of hair, the other rested on his son\u2019s chest. David stood pretty damned close and looked cozy enough to make Zach feel as if he were spying.</p><p>Zach swore. What the hell was his kid up to?</p><p>He slammed the law book shut and they both jumped. David glanced at him over his shoulder, then opened the front door. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk Julie to her car, Dad. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>Zach watched him go. This wasn\u2019t his business, he told himself. Except David was supposed to be engaged\u2014something Zach was still trying to change\u2014and if there was another young woman in the picture, then there were even more reasons the marriage shouldn\u2019t take place.</p><p>Indecision held him in his seat for nearly fifteen seconds, then Zach rose and crossed to the front window. Julie had already climbed into her car. The door was open and David had crouched next to her.</p><p>They were talking, Zach could see that much, but he had no idea about what. Nor was he sure what happened when David leaned forward slightly. Shit. Had he kissed her? Was David cheating on Mia? Was his problem solved? Or was David going to take after his grandfather and be a cheating spouse? The possibility of the latter made Zach\u2019s stomach clench.</p><p>Annoyed with both David for acting like an ass and himself for witnessing it, Zach returned to his seat. David strolled back into the house a minute or so later and slumped down on the sofa across from Zach\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s work going?\u201d his son asked, jerking his head at the pages on the table.</p><p>\u201cSlow, but I\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to be a lawyer. Too much boring reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of that.\u201d Zach couldn\u2019t decide if he should say anything or not. If he pushed, David could dig in his heels. Maybe a more neutral topic would be safer.</p><p>\u201cHave you given any thought to what you would like to do?\u201d</p><p>David shrugged. He wore a UCLA sweatshirt and jeans. As usual, his hair was too long. At least the kid had never been into earrings or tattoos. He thought briefly of Francesca in her fake tattoos and shuddered. Going around dressed up like that was a strange occupation for a woman in her late twenties.</p><p>No. It was a strange occupation for anyone.</p><p>\u201cWhat classes do you like?\u201d Zach asked. \u201cI was never interested in math, but your mother\u2019s father was an engineer. You might have inherited some aptitude from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He shifted in the sofa, stretching out. His head practically rested on the arm of the sofa. \u201cBiology has been kinda interesting, but I hate the lab. I dunno.\u201d</p><p>Zach picked up a pen and turned it over in his hands. \u201cYou still have a lot of time to decide.\u201d He glanced back at David. \u201cIs Mia pressuring you to pick something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d David straightened. \u201cNo. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I just wondered. Katie said Mia has known what she wanted from school for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia\u2019s like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Julie?\u201d</p><p>David grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s like me. She doesn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems nice.\u201d</p><p>David glanced out the window. \u201cShe is. We\u2019re friends. We were just talking about some stuff.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p><p>Zach wondered if he should pursue the \u201cJulie\u201d line of conversation, then decided to let it go rather than tip his hand. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout school and stuff. I\u2019ve been thinking that I might want to transfer to a different school in a year or two.\u201d</p><p>It took Zach a couple of seconds to realize what he\u2019d heard. \u201cYou want to leave UCLA?\u201d</p><p>Leave? But that was the only college David had ever wanted to attend. They\u2019d been going to football games and basketball games together for years. Now David went with his friends more than his father, but he still went.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Zach said. \u201cDon\u2019t you like your classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve made friends. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>David looked as if he\u2019d just tasted liver. \u201cWhy does there have to be a problem? I\u2019m doing great. I really like UCLA. I don\u2019t want to leave, I just\u2014\u201d He studied the floor. \u201cMia is going to be graduating next year, and she really has her heart set on going to Georgetown for her master\u2019s.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>David wanted to change his life for one girl while possibly screwing another? Damn it all to hell.</p><p>Zach told himself that exploding at his son would only end the conversation and put them on opposite sides of the issue, but it was hard to keep from shouting in frustration.</p><p>Instead he forced himself to sound calm as he said, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Mia get her master\u2019s at UCLA? If it took her two years, you\u2019d both finish at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>David looked uncomfortable. \u201cWe\u2019ve, um, you know, talked about that. The thing is, she wants to go into the State Department and being in Washington will make that easier. She\u2019ll meet people, get an internship, that sort of thing. We had dinner with some guy she met last summer. He works there now and he\u2019s gonna help her.\u201d</p><p>David shrugged again. His hair fell across his forehead, hiding his expression. \u201cMia really wants to do this.\u201d</p><p>Zach drew in a deep breath. \u201cMia\u2019s fortunate to have such a clear view of her future,\u201d he said, trying for light, and not sure he was succeeding. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>David grinned. \u201cIt sort of seems like under the circumstances that not having a major is a good thing, huh?\u201d</p><p>Zach mentally grabbed on to his self-control with both hands. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about transferring at the end of your sophomore year, you\u2019ll have to declare a major to be accepted, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess. I could just take poli sci, like Mia. It might be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun? David, we\u2019re talking about your future. What do you want to do with your life? While I\u2019m not suggesting you pick a career that\u2019s boring, I would think you\u2019d want to put a little more thought into a major than the fact that it\u2019s what your girlfriend is studying.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cYou said it didn\u2019t matter that I didn\u2019t have a major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. Not now. But it will matter soon. It will matter a lot if you switch schools. What if what you want to study isn\u2019t available at Georgetown? I don\u2019t object to you transferring, if it\u2019s in your best interest. But simply to follow Mia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married. I can\u2019t marry her and live on the other side of the country.\u201d</p><p>Something snapped. Zach heard the audible sound as his frustration and concern exploded into temper.</p> <p>\u201cDammit, David, this entire situation is crazy. You\u2019re barely eighteen years old. You don\u2019t have a clue as to what you want for your future, so why are you so fired up to get married? If you and Mia are so hot to be together, then move in with her. Sharing an apartment for a few months will take the bloom off the rose. You\u2019ll both figure out that there\u2019s more to love than sex.\u201d</p><p>David flushed, but he didn\u2019t look away. Instead he slid forward in his seat and jerked out his chin. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be proud of me wanting to marry her instead of just living together. Isn\u2019t marriage the right thing to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If you\u2019re ready. If you\u2019re sure. You and Julie looked chummy. Want to tell me what\u2019s going on there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d But David didn\u2019t look at him as he spoke. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you kissed her?\u201d</p><p>David glared at him. \u201cYou were spying on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was concerned.\u201d And apparently right.</p><p>His son stood. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou made it my business when you said you wanted to get married. You\u2019re so in love with Mia that you\u2019re going to marry her and transfer across the country, yet four months before the wedding you\u2019re kissing some other girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that. I love Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what love is.\u201d Zach stood to face his son. \u201cMia is your first girlfriend, David. You don\u2019t have a job. Marriage requires commitment and responsibility. It requires fidelity. What do you know about working out problems, organizing a budget, paying bills, while working and going to school? You\u2019re overwhelmed by your current schedule. What happens when it gets worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll learn together.\u201d</p><p>Zach played his trump card. \u201cAnd if I refuse to pay for your college?\u201d</p><p>David stiffened. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d do that, but I can\u2019t stop you.\u201d He glared at his father. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. You\u2019ll never understand. I love her. You\u2019ve never loved anyone in your whole life, so you can\u2019t know what that feels like. You get involved for a few weeks, then you walk away. To you marriage is just something that ends in divorce, but it doesn\u2019t have to be like that. I know you think Mia and I are going to fail, but you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>His voice rose until he was practically shouting. David\u2019s strength and determination marked his first foray into manhood. It was a hell of a time for his kid to start growing up.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what love is. What I don\u2019t have is your rosy view of the future. You can say what you want about me, but know this. I love you and I have always been there for you. Whatever it took, whatever it cost, I was there. And I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll stand by and watch you screw up your life.\u201d</p><p>David blinked several times as if holding back tears. \u201cIt won\u2019t be like that. Why can\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been there. I was seventeen when I married your mother. I know what it\u2019s like to be your age and drowning in responsibility. It sucks big time.\u201d He clenched his fists as he remembered the daily hell of wondering how much he could screw up the fragile life he\u2019d been given to care for. Being David\u2019s father in those early years had been terrifying.</p><p>\u201cI would have given anything to walk away from it all, but I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Zach continued. \u201cFirst you\u2019re married, then she turns up pregnant and everything changes. I don\u2019t want that for you.\u201d</p><p>The second the words were out, he wanted to retract them. But it was too late. David took a step back. He bumped into the wingback chair and moved around it. His gaze never left his father\u2019s face.</p><p>The anguish in his son\u2019s eyes made Zach want to throw himself in front of a truck. \u201cDavid, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that the way it came out.\u201d</p><p>Tears spilled down David\u2019s face. \u201cYou did,\u201d he said, his voice harsh. \u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Zach moved toward him, but David held out a hand. \u201cStay away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d made your life a living hell. You should have told me before that I was such a pain in the ass. I would have stayed out of your way.\u201d He angrily brushed his hands across his face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t bother you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, wait.\u201d</p><p>But his son was already bolting for the door. Zach hurried after him, but before he could catch up with him, David was gone. The front door slammed shut. Seconds later he heard the sound of his son\u2019s car starting. Zach ran outside anyway, just in time to see David driving away. He stood there for a long time before he realized it was raining and that he needed to go back inside.</p><p>13</p><p>K atie picked up the phone, then set it down. She picked it up again, dialed three numbers and hung up, then buried her head in her hands. This was much worse than the time she\u2019d invited Steve Klausen to the Backwards Dance in high school and he\u2019d made her wait for an answer while he found out if he had to work that night. One would think that at her age she would have learned maturity, poise, and grace. Unfortunately, one would be wrong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a business call,\u201d she told herself, trying to sound both firm and in control. \u201cI have information to share with a client. It is, in fact, my obligation to keep my client updated on what is going on.\u201d</p><p>Which was nearly the truth, but not completely. The missing factor was, of course, that she and Zach had made love last week. They\u2019d gotten naked, done the wild thing, then she\u2019d crept out in the middle of the night without even leaving a note.</p><p>That could have been recoverable if they\u2019d spoken since. But they hadn\u2019t. She should have called, but she\u2019d been scared and embarrassed and definitely out of her comfort zone. She\u2019d wanted him to make the first move and when he hadn\u2019t, she\u2019d felt...icky.</p><p>Now she felt awkward and confused about calling him at work. Normally she never sweated getting in touch with a client, but Zach was the first one she\u2019d ever slept with, so the rules of engagement weren\u2019t all that clear.</p><p>She dropped her hands to her desk and leaned back in her chair. She was going to have to get over this and start acting like a sensible person. Baring that, she was simply going to have to suck it up and call Zach because she had to move forward with the fund-raiser.</p><p>And she would like to take this moment to remind herself that she had only herself to blame. She could have said no. She could have walked away while still fully dressed and then not have had to worry about postcoital etiquette. This uncomfortable, slightly embarrassed, definitely weird sensation in her midsection was something to remember the next time a tempting client walked into her life and tried to get past first base.</p><p>Determined to be brave and professional, she picked up the phone and dialed Zach\u2019s office number. Dora picked up on the first ring and immediately put Katie through.</p><p>\u201cStryker,\u201d Zach said in a deep, masculine voice that made her go weak at the knees\u2014never mind that she was sitting down.</p><p>\u201cHi, Zach, it\u2019s Katie. I\u2019m calling with some good news about the fund-raiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. His response didn\u2019t have the enthusiasm level she\u2019d been hoping for. Nor did he seem to be in a rush to gush enthusiastically about their night together. Had he forgotten already? Or was he so used to one-night stands that this one didn\u2019t matter?</p><p>The silence stretching between them was its own response, so she ignored the feeling of being a complete fool and retreated to the safety of business.</p><p>\u201cAs you know, the, ah, invitations went out two weeks ago. Already we\u2019ve had positive responses from more than fifty percent of those invited.\u201d She consulted her notes. \u201cOf the five hundred we invited to the party-within-a-party, three hundred have said yes. Not only will the rooms be delightfully teeming with guests, but if all goes according to plan, we\u2019re on target to beat last year\u2019s charitable proceeds by at least twenty-five percent.\u201d</p><p>She paused and waited for the applause. Or at least a \u201cwell done.\u201d Instead she heard silence.</p><p>\u201cZach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really great, Katie. You\u2019re doing a fine job.\u201d</p><p>A fine job? The man had seen her naked, made her scream with pleasure, and \u201ca fine job\u201d was the best he could do?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cDid I call at a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. I\u2019m in the middle of prepping for court.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened as if he\u2019d slapped her. The implication of his words being that his work was far more important than hers.</p><p>Bitter regret burned on her tongue. His rejection couldn\u2019t have been more plain. She swore silently as she realized that once again she\u2019d risked believing the best about Zach only to have the worst proved to her.</p><p>She\u2019d thought he was a real person. She\u2019d thought they were establishing a connection. She thought their night together had mattered. Damn if she hadn\u2019t been wrong on every count.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t keep you, then,\u201d she said, forcing her voice into a bright, cheerful \u201cyou don\u2019t matter because I\u2019m doing fine\u201d tone. \u201cI\u2019m very excited by the positive response to the party and wanted to let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cDon\u2019t feel you have to give me regular updates. Until I hear otherwise, I\u2019m going to assume everything is going great.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In other words\u2014Don\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll call you.</p><p>Her eyes burned, her chest hurt, and she wanted to curl up in a ball and sob. Instead she clutched the phone more tightly.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. Good-bye, Zach.\u201d</p> <p>She hung up without waiting for him to respond.</p><p>It took several minutes for her ragged breathing to return to normal. A few tears escaped, but she congratulated herself on only needing two tissues. He wasn\u2019t worth more than that.</p><p>When Katie had gathered at least a facade of control, she placed her hands on her desk and told herself she\u2019d been lucky.</p><p>Zach wasn\u2019t for her. He never had been, but she kept forgetting that. Jumping into bed with a man she wasn\u2019t emotionally involved with had never been her style. For reasons she didn\u2019t understand, she\u2019d slept with Zach, and now she was paying the price.</p><p>It hurt. It hurt bad. But in time the pain would ease and she would be grateful not to be taken in by a good-looking guy in a six-hundred-dollar suit. Yes, he was funny and smart and fun to be with. And a good father. Oh, and a great kisser and dynamite in bed. But he didn\u2019t care about her. She was a means to an end. One in a long line of women he\u2019d conquered. He used women, then tossed them aside.</p> <p>If she felt confused and out of sorts, well, so what? She would get over it. People healed from broken hearts all the time. Not that her heart was broken. The fact that he was more than a pretty face and that she hadn\u2019t responded like that to a man since...okay, since never...was interesting but not significant. She would get over him in a flash because she had nothing to get over. Nothing had happened. She\u2019d learned a cheap lesson, and now she was going to move on.</p><p>Zach drove slowly through the UCLA campus and circled up toward the dorms. It had been three days and he still hadn\u2019t heard from David.</p><p>He\u2019d called dozens of times, left at least ten messages, and not had one of them returned. Zach was done waiting. He would find his son and make him understand that he had never been anything but the best part of Zach\u2019s life.</p><p>Careless words, he thought as he parked and climbed out of his car. How many relationships were destroyed by careless words?</p><p>He entered the dorm building and spotted several kids hunched over a video game. A couple looked familiar. Zach walked toward them. One of the boys looked up, frowned slightly, then smiled.</p><p>\u201cMr. Stryker?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Who was this kid? Jackson? Jason? Oh, yeah. \u201cJustin, I\u2019m looking for David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s playing pool. Just back there.\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded. \u201cI know the way. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He walked down the back hallway to the rec room. Three pool tables sat in the center of the huge room. There were vending machines along one wall and ratty sofas along the other. All three tables were in use. One had a group of girls, another had guys in sports jerseys playing, while the third had only a young couple at one end.</p><p>The girl laughed and turned. As she moved, the overhead light glinted off her long red hair. Zach stopped just inside the room. There was no mistaking Julie, nor his son. David smiled, then slipped his arm around the girl and pulled her close. She welcomed him with an easy familiarity that made Zach\u2019s gut tighten. They kissed, slowly and deeply, losing themselves in the passion.</p><p>Victory, he thought. The engagement would end and life would go back to normal.</p><p>He waited to feel relieved. Happy. But there was nothing except for a hollow emptiness and disappointment in his son\u2019s behavior. He didn\u2019t care how many girls David slept with, but he hadn\u2019t been raised to cheat.</p><p>Zach backed up and returned to the hallway. He wanted to talk to David, but not under these circumstances.</p> <p>As for Julie\u2014and Mia\u2014Zach didn\u2019t know what the hell he was going to do. There was no way the marriage could take place\u2014not with David sniffing after someone else. But what was he going to say and to whom? He didn\u2019t want to be the one to tell Mia what was going on. That was David\u2019s responsibility.</p><p>\u201cA hell of a mess,\u201d he muttered as he walked back to his car. And he didn\u2019t have a clue as to what he was going to do about it.</p><p>The hacienda kitchen was empty for once. Francesca glanced around in surprise, then headed for the refrigerator. She was about to drive to Los Angeles for one of her experiments and wouldn\u2019t have time to eat once she arrived. Not if she wanted to be in place by the time people were leaving work and hurrying home.</p><p>She dumped some leftover pasta into a bowl and stuck the bowl into the microwave. While her food heated, she bent over and studied the tattoos on her ankles. While she planned to carry an umbrella, the rain might still splash on her legs. Unfortunately in the fake-tattoo world, water was not her friend.</p><p>Still, she would have to take a chance. She\u2019d pulled on a relatively short skirt and pumps, leaving her legs bare. A long vine-with-roses tattoo wrapped around one ankle, while a butterfly hovered on the other. She\u2019d put another butterfly on the back of her thigh, just at her hemline, so anyone watching her walk would catch glimpses of the design. With luck, she would get some great reactions today.</p><p>The microwave beeped. She drew out her bowl and fished a clean fork from the drawer by the dishwasher. Then she headed for the kitchen table. Unexpectedly a door slammed in the house.</p><p>Francesca put down her bowl and headed for the noise. A subtle tension seemed to thicken the air, making her heart rate increase.</p><p>As she made her way down the hall, she could hear voices coming from the library. Although the door was closed, muffled words became more distinct as she approached.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis God\u2019s punishment,\u201d quiet Grammy M said with a force Francesca had never heard from her. \u201cIt was wrong thirty years ago and it\u2019s still wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod has no reason to punish this family,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo roared. Something heavy, probably a book, slammed on the desk. \u201cWe\u2019ve been good Catholics for generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes that isn\u2019t enough to please the Almighty,\u201d Grammy M said.</p><p>Francesca\u2019s father spoke next.</p><p>\u201cThis is an old argument that doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d His voice sounded frustrated. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a day that goes by that Colleen and I don\u2019t regret what we did? Do you think there\u2019s a day we don\u2019t think of him?\u201d</p><p>Francesca froze. She didn\u2019t want to hear any more, but she couldn\u2019t seem to tear herself away. She heard the sound of crying and would guess her mother had given in to tears. Grandma Tessa said something, but was too quiet to be audible.</p><p>\u201cI should have been stronger. I should have run away rather than agree.\u201d</p><p>Francesca heard her mother\u2019s words and cringed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all to blame,\u201d Grammy M said, her voice heavy with pain. \u201cWe all carry the burden.\u201d</p><p>Francesca took a step back, then another. She didn\u2019t know what her family was talking about, but she didn\u2019t like it. She grabbed her purse and hurried toward her truck. Once she was inside, she turned on the engine and cranked up the stereo as loud as it would go. Maybe the pounding beat would drive everything she\u2019d just heard from her head.</p><p>Katie paced through her small house. Normally she found the space cozy rather than confining, but not tonight. Even more frustrating, she could no longer fool herself about the nature of her discontent. Restlessness when combined with excess ice-cream consumption could only have one cause: heartache.</p><p>She thought about pounding her head against the wall, if only to experience the relief when she stopped, but how would she explain the bruising?</p><p>Obviously her little crush on Zach had become something more when she hadn\u2019t been looking. While she knew she wasn\u2019t in love with him, she was willing to admit to some slight...infatuation.</p><p>It was the naked thing. If she hadn\u2019t had sex with him, she would be fine. She drew in a deep breath. Okay. She\u2019d learned her lesson. She was a mature, adult woman who empowered herself and her life and...was there any ice cream left?</p><p>Rather than risk the last pint of fudge brownie, she made her way to the bedroom and glanced at her tennis shoes tucked in a corner. Maybe she should go to the gym. A fast-paced aerobics class or some strength training would give her a strong moral backbone, not to mention acting as a counterbalance to all those ice-cream calories she\u2019d consumed. Of course, she didn\u2019t actually have a gym membership. Maybe she could join a gym. Or clean out her closet. That always comforted her. There was something about perfect orderliness that made her life seem complete.</p><p>Rather than face actual sweat at a gym, she moved toward her closet, only to have someone ring her doorbell. She glanced at her watch and frowned. It was seven in the evening, midweek. To the best of her knowledge, her family members were all accounted for. So who would come calling?</p><p>The answer to that question stepped across her threshold when she opened the door. He was tall, dark, and very dangerous. He also made her palms sweat, her breath quicken, and her hormones begin a quick salsa step through her midsection.</p><p>\u201cZach,\u201d she said unnecessarily, because it wasn\u2019t as if they both didn\u2019t know who he was. But she couldn\u2019t think of anything better to mutter. Not when she was still stinging from his dismissal earlier in the week.</p><p>He leaned against the wall, looking both appealing and far too good-looking for her mental health.</p><p>\u201cI figured one of us had to be mature, and I got tired of waiting for it to be you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Outrage pushed aside confusion. \u201cWhen was I not mature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you ducked out the morning after. No note, nothing. A guy would think you were just using him for sex.\u201d</p><p>She genuinely didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cIf I was, it would serve you right. How many times have you just walked away in the past?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cEvery time. It\u2019s what I do. But we\u2019re not here to talk about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s your favorite topic.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou have a temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called and you blew me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called about the party and that\u2019s what we talked about.\u201d</p><p>Good point. \u201cYeah, well, if you\u2019d taken fifteen seconds to listen, I might have gotten to something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in trouble for not reading your mind?\u201d</p><p>She ground her teeth together. \u201cWhy exactly are you here?\u201d</p><p>The corners of his mouth twitched. \u201cI thought I\u2019d let you apologize for leaving so rudely.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI...You...But you...\u201d She glared at him. \u201cIf I thought I could get away with it, I\u2019d strangle you right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t. Because I\u2019m sorry, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019m accepting your apology. That\u2019s the kind of guy I am.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t apologized. At least she didn\u2019t think she had. Her head was starting to spin and she couldn\u2019t be sure of anything.</p><p>She led the way to the living room and sat on her floral-print sofa, then waited until he took the club chair opposite. Her thoughts slowly collected and organized. \u201cI should have left a note,\u201d she said cautiously.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he said with just enough cheer to make her hair hurt. \u201cAnd I...\u201d His voice trailed off and his humor faded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the phone call. I had some things on my mind. David mostly.\u201d</p><p>She instantly went on alert. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a fight. He stalked out of the house and I haven\u2019t been able to talk to him since. When you called, I was caught up in a hellish divorce case and worrying about him.\u201d</p><p>That she could understand. Zach was the kind of father who worried.</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ve both apologized,\u201d she said. \u201cWant me to open a bottle of Marcelli private reserve as a peace offering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rose and started toward the kitchen. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d she asked before she could stop herself. Dear God, she was turning into her grandmothers.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She collected a bottle of Marcelli Cabernet, an opener, and two glasses, then returned to the living room.</p> <p>Zach had settled back in the seat, looking male and completely out of place in a house of floral prints, candles, and too many pillows. He half rose when she entered the room. She waved him back to his seat.</p><p>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll let you wrestle with the cork,\u201d she said, handing him the bottle.</p><p>He studied the label. \u201cMust be nice to have an in with the owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA family perk.\u201d</p><p>While he opened the wine, she seated herself across from him. He poured, then handed her a glass, took one for himself, and held it out toward hers.</p> <p>\u201cTo our complicated relationship,\u201d he said.</p><p>She touched the rim of her glass to his and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYour place is really nice,\u201d he said.</p><p>She glanced around at the dollhouse-size proportions of her house, at the feminine furnishings and the pastel colors. \u201cI doubt it\u2019s much to your liking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed, but it suits you.\u201d</p><p>He set his glass on the coffee table between them.</p> <p>He\u2019d obviously come straight from the office. He still wore his suit slacks and a white shirt. The jacket was gone, as was the tie. Stubble darkened his jaw and his eyes looked weary.</p><p>Zach reached for his wine, then dropped his hand to his lap. \u201cI\u2019ve been his father for eighteen years. You\u2019d think I\u2019d do a better job of parenting.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI was just thinking I happen to know you\u2019re a terrific father.\u201d It was one of the things she liked about him, when he wasn\u2019t making her want to kill him.</p><p>\u201cNot lately.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI was scared to death when he was born, but excited and happy. He was so damn small. Ainsley was useless. She barely got out of bed for the first two weeks, then claimed to always be too tired to take care of him. She didn\u2019t want to try breast-feeding. So it was up to me to do the bottle thing. My mom helped out when she had time.\u201d</p><p>Katie couldn\u2019t imagine a woman turning her back on her newborn...or any child, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you still in college?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. And working. Money from my trust fund really helped with things like rent and medical insurance, but it didn\u2019t cover everything.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cNone of that mattered. David was worth it.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned toward him. \u201cThen why are you beating yourself up? You obviously love your son. You\u2019ve made countless sacrifices, you\u2019ve always tried to do the right thing. That\u2019s what matters. Grammy M is always telling us that we can only do our best. No one can expect more. The rest is in God\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d He straightened slightly and reached for the wine. \u201cA couple of days ago David told me he wanted to talk about transferring to a different college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he really enjoyed UCLA. Why would he want to do that?\u201d</p><p>Then she knew, but before she could say anything, Zach spoke.</p><p>\u201cNothing against your sister, Katie. She\u2019s a great girl with a lot of potential. She knows what she wants in life, and while I respect that, I think it\u2019s wrong for David to have to give up his dreams to follow hers.\u201d</p><p>Katie didn\u2019t know what to say. Mia\u2019s plans had been set for years. But David was two years behind Katie, and when she graduated, the choices would be either not being together or one of them giving up what he or she wanted. Katie knew her sister had never been very good at compromising her own plans.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re so damn young,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWhy can\u2019t he see that? Why can\u2019t he see that he\u2019s potentially screwing up his entire life?\u201d He drank some wine and looked at her. \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s what I said to him. I pointed out that I knew exactly what came from taking on responsibility too early. He thinks I blame him for screwing up my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d she said sympathetically. \u201cThat can\u2019t have gone over well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. The hell of it is, I didn\u2019t mean it that way. I don\u2019t regret David or anything that has happened because of him.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWith the possible exception of marrying Ainsley. But he didn\u2019t stick around to hear that. Instead he took off and I haven\u2019t heard from him since.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the dark lines and exhaustion made sense. \u201cYou\u2019ve been worried about him,\u201d she said, making it a statement rather than a question.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not worried that something happened to him, but I hate us not being in contact.\u201d He returned his wineglass to the coffee table. \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ll grow up together. My parents did. They fell in love in high school and they\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t all live in Fantasy Land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt beats your constant pessimism. You could be wrong about this, you know. They may be blissfully happy for the next seventy years.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted. \u201cRight. Or they could just screw up their lives in four months and have seventy years of regret.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been basking in the warmth of having him confide in her, but as usual, Zach\u2019s cynical attitude chilled the happy right out of her.</p><p>\u201cNot every marriage ends in disaster. Yes, a lot of marriages fail, yes, a lot of young marriages don\u2019t make it, but maybe, for once, you could give your son and my sister the benefit of the doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? If you see a car coming, don\u2019t you step out of the road rather than get hit?\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re assuming. You don\u2019t know anything for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know David\u2019s seeing someone else.\u201d</p><p>Katie stiffened, then sucked in a breath. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Zach swore and reached for his wine. \u201cForget I said that.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him. \u201cI can\u2019t. What do you mean he\u2019s seeing someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. There\u2019s this girl. Julie. She\u2019s in one of his classes. She was at the house with a bunch of his friends celebrating the semester break. They looked cozy. Later I saw them kissing.\u201d</p><p>Cozy? Right. Zach was a smart, smarmy lawyer who would do anything to win his case. She\u2019d wondered why he\u2019d stopped by and now she knew. He would do anything to end the engagement.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just hire some digital photography studio to doctor naked pictures of David in bed with the entire cheerleading squad?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be easier? It\u2019s much more a sure thing.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cYou think I\u2019m lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. You told me once you\u2019d do anything to keep David and Mia from getting married and you\u2019d do anything to convince me. I figure this is just part of the show.\u201d</p><p>He stood and glared at her. \u201cI\u2019m not lying. I haven\u2019t lied about anything. I told you David and I had a fight. He didn\u2019t call me back, so I went to see him at his dorm.\u201d</p><p>Katie stood and glared right back. \u201cLet me guess. You found them in bed together. Like I believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found them in the rec room. They were kissing and it looked damned friendly to me.\u201d He raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cDo you think I wanted it to end like this? I like Mia. If David were older and more together, I\u2019d be grateful he\u2019d picked her. I don\u2019t want her hurt.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s sincerity and his concern about her sister made Katie wonder if he might be telling the truth. And if he was...then what?</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say when you confronted him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I left and drove around. Eventually I ended up here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to think or what to believe. If Zach were any other man...if he didn\u2019t love his son quite so much...if he hadn\u2019t told her he would do anything to stop the wedding...</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I thought you might have some ideas.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and tried to read the truth in his blue eyes. \u201cYou won\u2019t tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d think what you do. That it\u2019s just a ploy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you blame her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t blame you, either.\u201d</p><p>He reached out his hand toward her, then shoved it in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna head home,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She watched him walk to the door and let himself out. When she was alone, she sank back onto the sofa and drew her knees to her chest.</p><p>Just when she thought things couldn\u2019t get more complicated, they took a turn for downright confusing. Was David cheating on Mia? If Zach was lying, then he was a worse weasel than she\u2019d thought and she should get herself sanitized after having intimate contact with him. If he was telling the truth, then he was even better than she could have hoped and letting him walk out of her life made her fourteen kinds of stupid.</p><p>The worst of it was she didn\u2019t know if sleeping with her had been a spontaneous response to passion, or just one more part of his master plan.</p><p>The trick was separating fact from fiction. So where was a crystal ball when she really needed one?</p><p>14</p><p>M ia sat on the floor in David\u2019s dorm room and watched him pace the small space from the desk to the door.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even remember how it started,\u201d David admitted, then crossed to the opposite bed and flopped down on his back. \u201cThen we were just arguing.\u201d</p><p>Mia had a feeling that David remembered exactly how the fight with his dad had started, but for some reason he didn\u2019t want to tell her. The fact that he was keeping it a secret bothered her. It wasn\u2019t as if she was going to go all hysterical and start screaming or something. That so wasn\u2019t her style. She also wasn\u2019t pleased that David had taken nearly a week to tell her what was wrong.</p><p>She\u2019d known instantly there was a problem, but he\u2019d denied it for the first three days and had refused to talk about it for the next three.</p><p>\u201cHe said that he didn\u2019t want me screwing up my life the way his life had been screwed up,\u201d David admitted miserably.</p><p>Mia crossed to kneel next to the narrow bed. She placed one hand on his chest. \u201cYou know what he was trying to say. He\u2019s worried that we\u2019re getting married too young. He wasn\u2019t telling you that you\u2019d ruined his life. David, your dad loves you. Everyone can see that. He\u2019s happy when you\u2019re with him and he\u2019s proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He turned his head toward her. Tears glistened in his eyes, but he blinked them away. \u201cIt hurt right then, you know. But I\u2019m okay with it now. The thing is I kinda thought he was coming around. About the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s not,\u201d Mia said flatly, wondering why she hadn\u2019t figured that out before. Now that David said the words, she realized it was so incredibly obvious.</p><p>For a second she thought about getting mad. It was totally insulting in a way.

Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Mia stared at him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to him, have you?\u201d</p><p>David wouldn\u2019t meet her gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cHas he tried to talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he might have called. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Translation\u2014Zach had been trying to get in touch with his son for days.

If you want to show him you\u2019re ready to get married, then act like a grown-up. After a big fight you can\u2019t just ignore the whole thing. You have to own up to what happened. At least call and say you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s blue eyes flashed with determination. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he thinks I\u2019m a kid. I\u2019m over eighteen and he can\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>Mia clenched her teeth. If she allowed herself to say even one word, she would scream. David\u2019s \u201che can\u2019t tell me what to do\u201d statement made him sound about four years old. So much for making her point.</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t need him to approve.\u201d</p> <p>He sounded defiant enough, but Mia wasn\u2019t sure she believed him. David and his father had always been close and going against him would be very difficult. Besides, even though it made her feel disloyal to admit it, David wasn\u2019t exactly a poster child for the mature young adult. She loved him, but she wasn\u2019t blind to his flaws.</p><p>\u201cThe wedding is a long way off,\u201d she said. \u201cHe might come around.\u201d</p><p>David nodded but didn\u2019t look convinced. He flopped back on the bed and stared at the ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s weird not to talk to him for this long. We\u2019ve always talked.\u201d A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. \u201cEven when he was mad at me when I was a kid, he talked. Sometimes when he went on and on about something I\u2019d screwed up on, I used to wish he\u2019d just spank me so we could get it over with. But he never did. Not even once. But he talked for hours.\u201d</p><p>Mia sat back on her heels and let the love in David\u2019s voice chase away her doubts. One of the things she adored about her fianc\u00e9 was his ability to love with his whole heart.</p><p>\u201cHe was always good to me,\u201d David went on, turning his head to look at her. \u201cAfter my mom left, there wasn\u2019t much money. Dad was in law school and she\u2019d taken the rest of his trust fund. So we struggled. But he made sure there were lots of good times. He traded his car in for a truck with a shell on the back. We\u2019d take it up to the mountains or to the beach and go camping for the weekend. Just us guys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds like fun,\u201d she said and shifted into a sitting position. Her palm came down on something hard and pointed. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d David hung over the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She raised her hand, then ran her fingers through the shag throw rug David and his roommate had bought at the beginning of the school year. Something metal bounced when she hit it.</p><p>Mia picked up a small gold hoop. \u201cIt\u2019s an earring.\u201d</p><p>David reached for it, but she held it out of reach.</p><p>\u201cGive it here,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cNot until you explain it,\u201d she teased.</p><p>He pushed his hair out of his eyes. \u201cMia, get real. Brian has a new girlfriend every ten days. I have no idea which one of them dropped an earring in here.\u201d</p><p>She tossed the piece of jewelry onto Brian\u2019s bed. \u201cYou\u2019d better not be messing around on me, mister. If you do, I\u2019ll chop your legs off at the knees.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and David grinned. Then he looked away. For a split second Mia felt something cold clutch at her midsection. Then she dismissed the feeling and joined David on his narrow mattress, where he drew her close and told her how much he loved her.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay with my dad,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d she told him, because it was easier than speaking the truth.</p><p>\u201cOther people have milk with their cookies,\u201d Brenna said as she picked up another chocolate chip cookie from the plate.</p><p>Francesca waved her glass. \u201cThey\u2019re philistines.\u201d</p> <p>Considering the amount of wine the three sisters had already consumed that evening, Francesca\u2019s ability to pronounce a three-syllable word was impressive. Katie herself had passed coherent about thirty minutes ago and was now functioning in that pleasant state of being buzzed. The world might be spinning, but as she didn\u2019t have to go anywhere, what did it matter?</p><p>The sisters sprawled across the two double beds in the room that Brenna and Francesca had shared while they\u2019d both lived at the hacienda. Since moving back home after staying with Francesca, Brenna had started packing up memorabilia from high school, but had yet to tackle the excessively pink wallpaper both had loved as teenagers, along with the gaggingly sweet bedspreads, also pink, with flowers, hearts, and swirls of ribbon.</p><p>Brenna sat crossed-legged at the foot of the bed, a tray of cookies next to her. Katie sat on the same bed, with her back against the headboard, while Francesca lay in a rather undignified sprawl on the second bed, one arm hanging toward the floor, swinging her half-full wineglass.</p><p>\u201cYou always had your own room,\u201d Brenna said, turning to glare accusingly at Katie. \u201cI always thought that was unfair.\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s been nearly ten years. You need to let that go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even on a bet.\u201d</p><p>Francesca raised her head. Her straight, thick hair hung down, shielding most of her face. \u201cI thought you liked that we shared a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I just wanted one of my own, too.\u201d She grinned. \u201cNow that my lifelong dream has come true, I\u2019ll be decorating it in red velvet and black satin.\u201d</p><p>Katie shook her head. Had the wine affected her hearing?</p><p>Francesca looked equally confused. \u201cBecause you\u2019re going for the sleazy look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because I\u2019m the seductive one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeductive...\u201d Katie\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Brenna laughed. \u201cOh, but I did and it\u2019s so embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>She unfolded her legs, then set down her wineglass and slid off the bed. From underneath she pulled a shallow, open box. Inside were three bottles.</p><p>Katie saw them and winced. Years ago, after a long, boring weekend spent listening to their parents and grandparents plan the detailed wording of wine bottle labels, Katie, Francesca, and Brenna had decided to create their own. They\u2019d taken three unlabeled bottles from the storeroom and had carefully glued on pictures of themselves in full dress-up clothing. On the back they\u2019d applied hand-lettered labels, detailing the glory that was each of them.</p><p>Katie took the first bottle Brenna held out, glanced at the picture of an eleven-year-old Francesca, and passed it across to her sister. Francesca groaned.</p><p>\u201cThe Sassy One,\u201d she read, then gulped more wine. \u201cFrancesca Marcelli tosses her long hair in a gesture that marks her as not just the pretty one, but also the Sassy One. Bold, inventive, with just a hint of irrelevance\u2014\u201d She paused. \u201cI think that\u2019s supposed to be irreverence.... she is the essence of blossoming illocution.\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed as she took the next bottle and recognized a photo of herself. She was dressed in yards of tulle and lace. One of the more elaborate costumes she\u2019d made all those years ago.</p><p>\u201cThe Sparkling One,\u201d she read. \u201cKatie Marcelli is a carbonated combination of wit and charm. She dazzles, she sparkles, she shines. Like the champagne she embodies, she is only ever special, iridescent, and valued.\u201d Katie glanced up. \u201cI\u2019m iridescent?\u201d She looked at her arm, then held it to the light. \u201cI must have outgrown that.\u201d</p><p>Brenna giggled. \u201cAt least you get to be glowing colors. I\u2019m just a slut.\u201d</p><p>Francesca turned onto her stomach. \u201cRead on, O Seductive One.\u201d</p><p>Brenna sighed. \u201cBrenna Marcelli\u2019s sultriness proves that she is the Seductive One. Dark, sweet, and slightly mysterious, she is a gleaming testament to all young women on the verge of lush ripeness.\u201d</p><p>Brenna glanced at her sisters. \u201cI used to gleam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to hate boys,\u201d Katie reminded her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHormones. I turned eleven and suddenly they were really interesting.\u201d She set down her bottle. \u201cToo bad Mia is so much younger. She was still a baby when we made these. I wonder what she would have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Smart One,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>\u201cThe One Most Likely to Take Over the World,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Brenna smiled and climbed back on the bed. \u201cSo, Francesca, I was thinking we\u2019d show Katie\u2019s bottle to Zach the next time he comes over. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant idea.\u201d</p><p>Katie shook her head. \u201cNo way. I don\u2019t need to be humiliated in front of him again. I\u2019ve already had that pleasure, remember? The first time he came to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you recovered,\u201d Francesca pointed out. \u201cAnd you seem to be spending a lot of time together.\u201d</p><p>Katie felt heat on her cheeks. She told herself it was the wine, but she knew she was lying. \u201cI\u2019m working with the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Brenna picked up the bottle of Cabernet and topped up her glass. \u201cI wonder if there\u2019s more to it than that.\u201d</p><p>Francesca took the bottle. \u201cMe, too. All those late-night conversations could be leading to something interesting. He\u2019s good-looking, smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a divorce lawyer, he has a lot of heart,\u201d Brenna added. \u201cHe cares about his son.\u201d</p><p>More than either of them knew, Katie thought uneasily. \u201cWe work together. That means we have to keep things professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I was hoping you were going to tell us you\u2019ve already seen him naked,\u201d Brenna said.</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams,\u201d Francesca told her. \u201cAs if Katie would sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>It had to be the wine, Katie thought as her mouth opened and words formed. Because she\u2019d certainly planned to keep this particular piece of information to herself.</p><p>\u201cActually I didn\u2019t get a whole lot of sleep.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence, then both her sisters started screaming and laughing. Brenna recovered first.</p><p>\u201cNo way! You did not do it with your client, our baby sister\u2019s future father-in-law, and my divorce lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Katie grabbed the wine and drained the last few ounces into her glass. \u201cYou make it sound like group sex.\u201d</p><p>Francesca nearly choked. \u201cWhen? Where? Start at the beginning and talk slowly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went over to his place for a tasting dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were the entr\u00e9e?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>Francesca threw a pillow at her. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had sex in years, so your opinion doesn\u2019t count,\u201d Brenna told her.</p><p>\u201cWe actually had the tasting dinner,\u201d Katie said, ignoring them both. \u201cWe were talking, and then we were kissing, and then we were upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Brenna prompted.</p><p>\u201cIt was very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should have been a whole lot better than nice,\u201d Francesca grumbled. \u201cYou slept with David\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make him sound old. He\u2019s all of thirty-five,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cI\u2019m guessing all the important bits are still functioning just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Katie said primly.</p><p>Brenna collapsed on the bed and rested her feet on Katie\u2019s lap. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss sex. Not that I was having it all that much with my soon-to-be ex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Francesca asked.</p><p>Brenna shrugged. \u201cHe was busy, or gone. Or screwing the bimbo. I don\u2019t know. In the past few months we just never did it. I guess the flame had been dying out for a while, but I was too busy working all the time to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about him,\u201d Katie urged. \u201cYou\u2019ll only upset yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll think about sex instead. Having it, or not having it. I suppose the good news is that giving up sex with Jeff won\u2019t be a huge hardship.\u201d</p><p>Katie nearly dropped her glass. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brenna sat up enough to take a sip of her wine. \u201cDr. Jeff might be an up-and-coming cardiologist, but he doesn\u2019t know dick about a woman\u2019s sexual wants and desires.\u201d</p><p>Francesca struggled into a sitting position. She shifted so that her legs hung over the bed and stared at her sister. \u201cBrenna? What are you saying? How exactly would you know he wasn\u2019t good in bed?\u201d</p><p>Katie was also playing mental catch-up. She got there before her sister. \u201cYou had sex with someone other than Jeff?\u201d</p> <p>Brenna blinked several times. \u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Katie couldn\u2019t believe it. She thought she knew everything about her sisters\u2019 lives. Apparently she was wrong. \u201cDid you have an affair?\u201d</p><p>Brenna dropped her head back onto the bed. \u201cOf course not. I wouldn\u2019t cheat on Jeff. Only he did that. This was before.\u201d</p><p>Francesca nearly fell off the bed. \u201cYou weren\u2019t a virgin when you got married?\u201d</p><p>Brenna stared at her sister. \u201cWhat century are you in? You were the only bridal virgin I knew.\u201d</p> <p>Francesca reached for her wine and took a gulp, then turned her attention to Katie. \u201cDid you and Greg, well, you know?\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed. \u201cYes, we had sex, and I regret every drop of bodily fluid exchanged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t blame you,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cWho wants to be with a man who prefers death to marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why he went into the army,\u201d Francesca protested.</p><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>Francesca shrugged.</p> <p>Katie tried to laugh, but she couldn\u2019t. After all this time her lie should feel like the truth, but it didn\u2019t. Maybe it never would. That was the thing about lies\u2014they tended to live on forever.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Brenna said, reaching for another bottle and the corkscrew. \u201cYour turn, Francesca. \u2019Fess up. Did you have any secret lovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said primly. \u201cI was a virgin when I married Todd.\u201d</p><p>Brenna hooted. \u201cFigures. The family beauty is the only one who waited to get laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted my first time to be with my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about pressure,\u201d Brenna muttered.</p><p>\u201cI wanted the memory,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Brenna said.</p> <p>\u201cBut I regretted it,\u201d Francesca announced.</p><p>Katie felt her mouth drop open. Brenna pulled the cork out of the bottle and nearly dumped the contents onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cBeing a virgin on your wedding night?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, not exactly regretted it, but I do wish I\u2019d slept with Nic Giovanni.\u201d</p><p>Katie burst out laughing. \u201cNic? Our neighbor? Heir to the hated Wild Sea Vineyard? Francesca, I\u2019m shocked.\u201d</p><p>Francesca rolled her eyes. \u201cCome on, Katie. Nic was incredibly hot. That tall, dark, brooding thing he had going on was irresistible. Plus he rode a motorcycle and dated lots of girls who put out. I always knew he would be the perfect guy to lose my virginity to. He would make a girl\u2019s first time perfect.\u201d</p><p>Katie held out her glass to Brenna, then nodded. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll confess to Nic Giovanni fantasies, too. I ran into him once when he was home from college one summer. We were in town and he stopped to talk to me. I thought maybe he\u2019d ask me out, but he didn\u2019t.\u201d She sighed at the memory. \u201cI probably would have been willing to give it up for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sisters are sluts,\u201d Brenna announced.</p><p>Francesca grabbed the wine bottle. \u201cI refuse to believe you didn\u2019t have Nic fantasies, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had several,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cBut, as you said, we all fantasized about him. Who else do you wish you\u2019d slept with.\u201d</p><p>Francesca named a couple of guys Katie remembered from high school. Back then she\u2019d been more into romance than sex, so while she could list a bunch of guys she would have liked to have dated, she wasn\u2019t sure she could claim a willingness to have sex with them.</p><p>\u201cYou need to just go out there and do it,\u201d Brenna told Francesca. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long. Important parts of your body are atrophying.\u201d</p><p>Francesca rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re living like a nun.\u201d</p><p>Katie had to agree. \u201cFrancesca, you\u2019ve taken the whole \u2018be independent\u2019 thing way too far. Refusing to marry again is fine, but giving up on doing the wild thing is just plain stupid.\u201d</p><p>Francesca raised her eyebrows. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you of all people would say that to me. What happened to waiting for your handsome prince.\u201d</p><p>Brenna grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s still waiting, but in the meantime she\u2019s not adverse to a little hide the salami.\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed. \u201cHide the salami? That\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to be all superior and picky,\u201d Brenna grumbled. \u201cYou just got laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d Katie sipped her wine. \u201cI remembered what I\u2019d been missing.\u201d She turned her attention back to Francesca. \u201cWhich is my point. I\u2019m not suggesting you fall in love or anything, but give some guy a chance.\u201d</p><p>Francesca didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cJust some guy? Should I randomly pick one off the street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Brenna leaned toward her. \u201cI want you to have sex with the next single, reasonably good-looking guy you run across, and I\u2019m not pouring you any more wine until you agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>Brenna looked at Katie. \u201cAre you with me on this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred percent. Francesca needs a man.\u201d</p><p>Francesca groaned. \u201cFine. I\u2019ve probably been out of the game for too long. I\u2019ll look around and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brenna cut her off with a shake of her head. \u201cThe next single guy. That\u2019s the rule. Or no more Marcelli reserve in your glass.\u201d</p><p>Francesca sighed. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll do it. But the consequences are your responsibility.\u201d</p><p>The three sisters leaned forward and clinked glasses.</p><p>When Katie straightened, she rested against the foot-board. All this talk of young love and lust made her think of Mia and David, and what Zach had told her. The more she considered what he\u2019d said, the more she came to believe him. But should she tell her sisters what Zach saw between David and that other girl? If she did, they would want to tell Mia, and did she want that?</p><p>She didn\u2019t have an answer, and until she did, she decided she would keep quiet.</p><p>\u201cAll those lost opportunities,\u201d Brenna said mournfully. \u201cOur secret lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad have secrets.\u201d</p><p>Francesca\u2019s unexpected comment silenced Brenna. She and Katie looked at each other, then at their sister.</p><p>Francesca swallowed uncomfortably. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I should say anything. I tried to forget what I overheard, but it\u2019s been bothering me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brenna asked. \u201cIs it the winery? Is there something wrong with the vineyards?\u201d</p><p>Francesca shook her hair off her shoulders. \u201cThere\u2019s more to life than grapes, Brenna. No, it was something else.\u201d She explained how she had come home unexpectedly and overheard their parents and grandparents talking in the library.</p><p>\u201cGrammy M said the family is being punished by God,\u201d she finished. \u201cDad said not a day goes by that he doesn\u2019t think about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat him?\u201d Katie asked. \u201cWhat on earth are they talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be the feud,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cMaybe thirty years ago something bad happened with Wild Sea Vineyard and the Giovanni family.\u201d</p><p>Katie thought about the family history. \u201cHow is that possible? The feud started in the late forties, right after the Second World War. Dad wasn\u2019t even born then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cPlus Grammy M was the one saying we were being punished, and she didn\u2019t become a part of the family until Mom and Dad got married\u2014which was what? Twenty-nine years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said they said thirty years ago,\u201d Brenna reminded Francesca. \u201cWhatever it was happened thirty years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Katie asked. \u201cWhat could anyone have done? There hasn\u2019t even been the hint of a scandal. No whispers or rumors. I always thought we were boringly normal.\u201d She turned to Francesca. \u201cCould you have misunderstood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked at Brenna, who shrugged. They both seemed to be waiting for her to make a decision. She thought about the fund-raiser and the upcoming wedding. Not to mention the thousands of beads yet to be attached on Mia\u2019s gown, and the mysterious redhead, and Katie\u2019s confusing relationship with Zach.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s give it a few weeks and see if anything happens,\u201d she said. \u201cIf not, we\u2019ll bring it up at a family dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d Francesca said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the one celebrating my divorce from Jeff,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cOr the one where we tell the family how we convinced him to back off on the winery.\u201d</p><p>Katie was surprised. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard from him about that? The last I knew was that he was determined to pursue the inheritance angle, despite there not being one.\u201d</p><p>Brenna and Francesca exchanged looks. Katie recognized the combination of guilt and excitement immediately. \u201cAll right, you two. What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Francesca said, careful to avert her gaze.</p><p>Katie zeroed in on Brenna. \u201cSpill it, now. Every word. Start at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Brenna sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. Jeff called to tell me that if I backed off on getting repaid for putting him through school, he\u2019d let go of the inheritance. I told him to go screw himself. If that requires him cutting off certain body parts in the process, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get back at him,\u201d Francesca announced, then covered her mouth and looked horrified.</p><p>Katie groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Brenna held up the bottle. \u201cMore wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want the truth. What are you planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trapping the bastard at his own game,\u201d Brenna said gleefully. \u201cFrancesca\u2019s going to meet with him. Play the mourning sister-in-law who completely understands why he left his bitchy wife.\u201d</p><p>Katie was confused. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Francesca leaned toward her. \u201cHe\u2019s slime. I\u2019m going to dress sexy, see if he comes on to me, and tape the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he come on to you?\u201d</p><p>The twins exchanged a look. Brenna shrugged. \u201cJeff got drunk once and admitted that he\u2019d always had a thing for Francesca. I didn\u2019t think anything about it, except then I saw he was always kind of watching her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Francesca admitted, \u201cuntil Brenna told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now she can use it against him. She\u2019ll tape the conversation. When he\u2019s trapped himself, we\u2019ll threaten to send the tape to the bimbo. Either Jeff gets off the winery or his new girlfriend finds out he\u2019s a real sleaze.\u201d</p><p>Katie couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cThat\u2019s illegal. Zach can\u2019t know about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Although I think he\u2019ll be impressed when I tell him.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked at her sisters. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. This is wrong. It\u2019s tacky and horrible and puts you on Jeff\u2019s level.\u201d</p><p>Brenna\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cThat bastard is not getting one square inch of this winery, and by God he\u2019s going to pay me what he owes me. Quit spoiling the fun, Katie.\u201d</p><p>Katie held up her free hand. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll admit that Jeff needs his comeuppance, but this is not the way to do it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you have a better plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but have you thought this through? Won\u2019t Jeff coming on to Francesca be another knife in your back? I love you and I want Jeff punished, but not if you\u2019re going to get more hurt in the process. I refuse to rub salt in your wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. This idea is brilliant and if you can\u2019t see that, we don\u2019t need you.\u201d</p> <p>Katie took another drink of wine, but her buzz was gone and in its place was a sense of something important having just been lost.</p><p>\u201cYou have a visitor,\u201d Dora said through the speakerphone. \u201cIt\u2019s your son.\u201d</p><p>Zach dropped his pen and rose. \u201cSend him right in,\u201d he said, then headed for the door himself.</p><p>It had been nearly two weeks since their fight. His son had finally left a message that he was fine, but he\u2019d said that he needed time to think about what had happened and would be in touch later. Apparently later was now.</p><p>David opened the door and stepped into the office. He wore baggy jeans and a worn sweatshirt. As usual, his blond hair needed cutting. He looked tall, lanky, and sheepish.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself.\u201d</p><p>They stood about three feet apart, both looking at the other, both hesitating. Finally Zach moved toward David and held out his arms. His son stepped into his embrace.</p><p>The ache around Zach\u2019s heart eased. Tension fled his body as his world righted itself. Maybe he\u2019d screwed up a time or two, but all in all, David was the best part of his life.</p><p>He moved back enough to grasp David\u2019s upper arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you or to imply that you were anything but a joy for me. You were never in the way. Given the chance, I wouldn\u2019t change anything. I love you. I hope you know that.\u201d</p><p>David nodded. He ducked his head, sniffed, then swallowed. \u201cYeah, Dad. I know. I was kind of a jerk. You know? You got frustrated and I got mad and it seemed easier to split rather than figure out how to make it work. I\u2019m sorry, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApology accepted.\u201d</p><p>Zach released him and they both headed for the sofas. David sprawled across one while Zach took the other.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>\u201cGood. The new quarter started. I got a letter saying I need to be thinking about declaring a major. Especially if I want to go into one of the impacted majors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe really popular ones. Classes fill up fast and it\u2019s hard to get a good schedule. At least, that\u2019s what the letter said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny more thoughts on what area interests you?\u201d Zach asked the question carefully, wanting to appear interested without being pushy.</p><p>David slouched lower in the sofa. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated before asking, \u201cHow are things with Mia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He looked at Zach and grinned. \u201cHell if I know why, but we can\u2019t finish getting registered for our wedding gifts. Every time we go to pick out china or something, we have a big fight. I guess we\u2019re gonna have to use paper plates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>Zach wanted to say a lot more, but he didn\u2019t. Bringing up Julie when he\u2019d just made up with his son was a dumb plan. Eventually they\u2019d have to talk about her and the importance of fidelity, but not yet.</p><p>His son\u2019s humor faded. \u201cLook, Dad. I know you\u2019re worried about me and I appreciate that. But you\u2019ve got to give me some space here. I need a chance to grow up. If that means making a mistake, then I\u2019ll have to deal with it. But let me screw up before you start yelling at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Zach took a deep breath. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, David. I\u2019m your father and I want to do everything in my power to protect you from the world. It\u2019s like when you were first learning to walk. I went around the house and made sure there was nothing that could hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not learning to walk, Dad. I\u2019ve been walking for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But the instinct is damn strong. So I have to bite my tongue to keep from telling you what I think will keep you from getting hurt. Sometimes I forgot that\u2019s not my job anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me,\u201d David said. \u201cJust so long as you don\u2019t expect me to listen.\u201d</p><p>His son grinned. Zach laughed. \u201cAs you get older, you\u2019re supposed to think I\u2019m smarter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never gonna happen, Dad. You need to let it go.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>A s Zach drove along the road leading to the hacienda, he could see changes from his last visit. The leaves on the vines were bigger and darker green. At some point the grapes would begin to form. Later they would be picked and, through some process, be turned into wine. That pretty much exhausted his knowledge on the topic. Maybe he should ask Katie for a few of the details, the next time he saw her\u2014assuming she didn\u2019t kick him in the head first.</p><p>The actual seeing would be in a matter of minutes, he reminded himself. She was supposed to be at the hacienda. For reasons of physical safety, he\u2019d considered messengering the papers to Brenna instead of delivering them by hand, but he refused to be chased off by a woman. Especially not one he found charming, sexy, and a worthy adversary. Besides, he\u2019d seen her naked.</p><p>The latter thought made him smile...and want. The memory of her anger, not to mention her accusations that he\u2019d made up the story about David kissing Julie, tempered his pleasure. He understood why she didn\u2019t trust him, but he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Zach pulled his car to the side of the hacienda, then stepped out into the warm spring afternoon. Brenna met him at the front door. For once she didn\u2019t look as if she\u2019d been blindsided.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, sounding surprisingly cheerful. \u201cI swear I\u2019m going to start driving down to L.A. to get my own papers. I feel bad about making you come all this way.\u201d She took a step back to let him in the house.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, following her inside. \u201cGrandma Tessa invited me to dinner. How could I resist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer pasta has that effect on people.\u201d She grabbed his arm and pulled him into the sitting room, then closed the door to the foyer. After glancing around the small space, as if checking to see that they were alone, she spoke.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing. Francesca and I have come up with a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get nervous when clients have plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is a really good one. Remember I told you about Jeff\u2019s call? That he said he\u2019d back off on wanting a piece of the winery if I backed off on repayment for putting him through school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but his lawyer denies Jeff ever made that call. It would be your word against his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man\u2019s a sleaze and his word can\u2019t be trusted. Which is why we have to get him another way.\u201d</p><p>She quickly outlined a plan of setting up Francesca to \u201cchat\u201d with Jeff in a bar. \u201cHe\u2019s always had a thing for her. So we\u2019re hoping he\u2019ll get drunk, say more than he should, and we\u2019ll have him on tape.\u201d</p><p>Zach was willing to give her points for creativity, if nothing else.</p><p>\u201cKatie doesn\u2019t want us to do it,\u201d Brenna continued. \u201cShe says it\u2019s tacky and probably illegal and that I\u2019ll get hurt, but I think it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right about the illegal part. As your lawyer I have to tell you that it\u2019s not something you should do. The law frowns on that sort of thing. There\u2019s also the can of worms you could be opening. Do you really want to hear Jeff coming on to your sister? Is that going to make you feel any better?\u201d</p><p>Brenna shook her head. \u201cYou sound like Katie, which is both weird and unattractive. But I know what you mean. What she meant. Do I want to know exactly how horrible Jeff is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. But assuming I want to go forward with it, do you think it will work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs your lawyer\u2014\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cZach, be a regular guy for once. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know you slept with my sister.\u201d</p><p>He took a step back and bumped into the sofa. He hadn\u2019t blushed since he was about fourteen, but he would almost swear he felt heat climbing his neck.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t\u201d\u2014he swallowed\u2014\u201cKatie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpilled the beans. Details and all. We were tr\u00e9s impressed.\u201d Brenna laughed. \u201cStop looking so horrified. I\u2019m teasing. She said you guys did it and that was all. Despite the large quantities of wine we had all consumed, she kept to generalities. Neither Francesca nor myself would be able to pick you out naked in a lineup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He might never have had a sibling, but if he had, he doubted he would have shared this much of his life with him or her.</p><p>\u201cNow that I can blackmail you in front of my grandmothers, answer the question. Do you think my plan to use Francesca against Jeff will work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna, I can\u2019t commit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes or no?\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>She clapped her hands together. \u201cI knew it!\u201d She gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re the best. Now go be tortured by my grandmothers. I\u2019m going to call Francesca and tell her it\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>Brenna hurried out of the sitting room. Zach followed more slowly. While he applauded her ingenuity, he hoped her plan didn\u2019t jump up and bite her in the ass.</p><p>He headed for the kitchen, then stopped when he spotted Katie in the living room. He entered through the arched doorway and found her sitting on the floor. Stacks of beaded lace flowers stood in piles all around her. As he watched, she counted out groups of ten and placed them next to those already counted. With each group of ten, she made a note on the pad of paper resting on her right thigh.</p><p>He glanced around the room. Bags of lace flowers stood by the rust-colored leather sofa. Small containers of beads cluttered together on the glass-and-wood coffee table.</p><p>Plans for the wedding, and the dress, were moving forward. He\u2019d expected to have it stopped by now. But David and Mia hadn\u2019t broken up, and the wedding date crept closer.</p><p>A lace wedding gown lay draped over the loveseat. He frowned, not realizing Katie had already started sewing the dress.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said as he approached. \u201cThey let me in the house. Want to run and grab the pepper spray?\u201d</p><p>She turned toward him. For a second her expression didn\u2019t change, and he wondered if she was still mad.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d go for anything that boring,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead I\u2019d attack you with pruning shears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the risk of being rude, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>He sat down. \u201cI have some papers for Brenna.\u201d He frowned as he realized not only had he left them in the car, but they hadn\u2019t talked about them. \u201cGrandma Tessa found out I was driving up and invited me to stay for dinner.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019m in love with her cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill mad?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at you. David\u2019s not one of my favorite people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cheating on my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was just one of those things\u2014cold feet, a last hurrah.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat hardly makes it all right. He\u2019s cheating or just cheated that one time. Neither is acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you believe me?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t have guessed that was possible.</p><p>\u201cI finally realized you wouldn\u2019t lie. You\u2019re way too upfront for that. Why slip in a side door when you\u2019re willing to blow up the main entrance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn interesting metaphor choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an interesting woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, you are. Interesting, beautiful, exciting. Desirable.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cZach, this is my grandfather\u2019s house. You can\u2019t possibly have sexual thoughts under this roof. If you do, your pride and joy will shrivel up to the size of a walnut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be tragic for all of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to say yes. You already think too highly of yourself.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who was screaming that night.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head. \u201cA gentleman would never bring that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought my bringing it up was the entire point.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitched. \u201cYou\u2019re evil.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tempting. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and decided to give them both a break. Mostly because this was her grandfather\u2019s house and he didn\u2019t want to risk his dick.</p><p>He pointed at the piles of lace stacked around the room. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out where we are, numbers-wise, with the lace flowers. Everyone is complaining about being tired of beading, but we still have a long way to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you start sewing the dress?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI haven\u2019t. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll get it started next week. I made an under-dress first.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed at the finished gown draped over the love seat. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She followed the direction of his finger, winced slightly, then ducked her head to focus her attention back on the lace flowers. \u201cInspiration. It\u2019s an old dress Grammy M made. I wanted to study some of her workmanship.\u201d She made two more piles of ten, then returned her attention to him. \u201cSo how are things with you?\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was a trick of the afternoon light, but he would swear he could see flecks of gold in her brown eyes. She wore a sweater that hugged her curves, and tight black jeans. The combination made it difficult to follow the conversation.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said when his brain finally kicked in. \u201cDavid and I had a long heart-to-heart. Things are better now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said sincerely, then finished her counting with a sigh. \u201cJust like I thought. We\u2019re not keeping on schedule. I guess everyone has so much going on.\u201d She grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose now that you and David are speaking that you\u2019d be willing to bead a flower or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the doorway, then at him. \u201cAny more news on Julie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t seen her around, but I don\u2019t see much of David.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to talk to Mia about it, but I don\u2019t know how without telling her what you saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having the same problem with him. I was thinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he could continue, he heard voices in the hallway. Both grandmothers swept into the room. He rose automatically, then wished he hadn\u2019t when he found himself hugged, kissed, and cheek-pinched. Grandma Tessa might not be twenty anymore, but she had a grip that could snap metal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too skinny,\u201d Grandma Tessa said, poking a finger at his midsection. \u201cWorking too hard, eh? Not getting proper meals. Katie, why aren\u2019t you cooking dinner for Zach? He\u2019s family. We have to take care of him.\u201d</p><p>Rather than answer, Katie only smiled, but Zach saw her lips moving and suspected whatever she was saying would cause her grandmother to dive for her rosary.</p><p>Grammy M clapped her hands together when she spied the wedding dress draped over the love seat.</p><p>\u201cOh, Katie, did you show this lovely gown to Zachary? Lookin\u2019 at it still brings a tear to my eye.\u201d She brushed her hands over the lace. \u201cHours we spent on this, but it was no trouble a\u2019tall. We knew our Katie would be a beautiful bride.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa muttered something in Italian. She turned her dark gaze on Zach. \u201cI\u2019ve been good all these years, never cursing that boy\u2019s name, but I\u2019ve been tempted.\u201d</p><p>Katie stood up and grabbed the dress from Grammy M. \u201cI got this out to study how beautifully you put it together, Grammy M. Not because I was feeling nostalgic. As for the curses, Grandma Tessa, don\u2019t bother. All Greg is guilty of is changing his mind. That\u2019s still allowed, right?\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa didn\u2019t look swayed by her argument. Zach studied the dress in question with renewed interest. So this had been made for Katie, much the same way she now painstakingly sewed a dress for Mia. With luck it would be unworn as well.</p><p>Grammy M sighed. \u201cWhat will you be thinkin\u2019, Zachary?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly all the attention in the room telescoped on him. Trapped didn\u2019t begin to describe the sensation. He could see many minefields and lots of pits, but few escape routes. He went for the truth.</p><p>\u201cThe dress is beautiful and the guy who walked out on Katie was an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Tension eased between the women as the Grands exchanged smiles. Grandma Tessa winked broadly at Katie and not-so-subtly said they needed to leave \u201cthe young people to themselves.\u201d</p><p>Katie watched them go, then turned to him. \u201cNice save,\u201d she said, then sighed. \u201cThey make me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I was telling the truth. Second of all, you adore them.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cTrue enough. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have fantasies about being an orphan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father, Antonio Marcelli, was a second son,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo told Zach that night at dinner. \u201cHe could have worked the land in Italy, but he would never have been in charge. Sometimes a second son is content, but sometimes a fire burns in here.\u201d He thumped his chest with a fist. \u201cFor my father, the fire grew until he had to leave all he had ever known and travel far away. He came here and found this place. It was 1923.\u201d</p><p>Zach listened, fascinated as Grandpa Lorenzo detailed the history of Marcelli Wines.</p><p>\u201cThis was virgin land,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo continued. \u201cHe broke the land himself, with a little help. Then he planted the vines he had brought with him from Italy.\u201d A smile tugged at the corner of his thin mouth. \u201cHe might have gone into France for a sample or two before coming here.\u201d Then he chuckled and touched a finger to his lips to show that was a family secret.</p><p>Zach figured it would have to be. Stealing clippings from a vineyard had to be a serious offense.</p><p>\u201cAt the time he had a good friend. Salvatore Giovanni. He, too, was a second son. Their land is next to ours, stretching out in the opposite direction. Together the two men tended their crops and waited for God to work his magic. In time they sent for wives, and a dynasty was born.\u201d</p><p>Zach frowned. The name Salvatore Giovanni sounded familiar, but he couldn\u2019t place it. Brenna, sitting next to him, leaned close.</p><p>\u201cThe Giovannis own Wild Sea Vineyards. We\u2019re mortal enemies now. Don\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>He wondered how many times Grandpa Lorenzo told the story of the founding of the winery. The family would know every word by heart, yet he suspected they didn\u2019t mind hearing the tale again. In time, when Lorenzo was gone, Katie\u2019s father, Marco, would do the telling. And so it would continue through the generations. Perhaps the story would change, perhaps it would stay true to history. Regardless, the heart of the adventure would remain, reminding this family of who they were and where they had come from. He envied them that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to protect all this,\u201d Lorenzo said, staring directly at Zach.</p><p>Zach straightened. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgainst that jackal. Brenna\u2019s husband. We won\u2019t give him anything!\u201d</p><p>Brenna leaned back in her chair and grinned. \u201cNot to worry, Grandpa. Francesca and I have a plan.\u201d</p><p>The old man looked interested.</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t think Brenna should share the details with her parents and grandparents, but before he could make that suggestion, Katie tossed her napkin on the table.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious about this,\u201d she said. \u201cBrenna, it\u2019s awful. You\u2019re going to be swimming in regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe your exact words were tacky and illegal,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cBut who cares, as long as it works?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d Marco asked. \u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and quickly filled him in on the basics of the plan.</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo looked thoughtful, but Grandma Tessa appeared to have bitten into a lemon.</p><p>\u201cJeff said that about our Francesca?\u201d She reached into her pocket and pulled out her rosary.</p><p>Brenna brushed off her comment. \u201cSo what? Now we can use this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, dear, what\u2019re you objectin\u2019 to?\u201d Grammy M asked.</p><p>Katie sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s illegal for one thing. And it\u2019s just plain wrong. This puts the whole family on Jeff\u2019s level. Let him be slime by himself. But the worst of it is, I think Brenna\u2019s going to get hurt more. She can\u2019t want to hear that Jeff is interested in her twin. I refuse to be party to cutting open another vein and watching her bleed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to agree to disagree about this,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cLet\u2019s change the subject.\u201d</p><p>Katie nodded gratefully. She didn\u2019t want to fight with her family. It was never a pleasant experience.</p><p>Her mother glanced at her father. \u201cWe have some exciting news. Marco and I are buying Mia and David a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brenna asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo help them. They\u2019re young and just getting started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t need your money,\u201d Zach said flatly.</p><p>Katie mentally winced. He wouldn\u2019t like the implication that he couldn\u2019t take care of his son.</p><p>Her mother turned to him. \u201cOh, Zach, please don\u2019t take this the wrong way. There\u2019s a small house that just came up for sale. It\u2019s on the edge of the property, so they\u2019ll have privacy but still be close. We know David and Mia have been having difficulties working out their plans for next year, after Mia graduates.\u201d</p><p>Her father touched his wife\u2019s hand. \u201cUC Santa Barbara would be a good compromise for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re buying them a house?\u201d Brenna said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t buy Francesca and Todd a house. You didn\u2019t buy me and Jeff anything. You said we were on our own.\u201d</p><p>Marco frowned. \u201cThis is different, Brenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Francesca asked.</p><p>Katie understood her sisters might think the situation was unfair, but that wasn\u2019t what bothered her. \u201cHave you discussed this with Mia? She\u2019s really set on going to Georgetown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia will do what\u2019s right for the family,\u201d her grandfather announced. \u201cShe\u2019s a good girl. She\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t know your granddaughter,\u201d Katie told him. \u201cThis is crazy. You can\u2019t plan her life, or David\u2019s. They have the right to decide where they want to go to school and where they want to live.\u201d</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t look pleased with her stand. \u201cWe\u2019re being more than generous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right,\u201d Brenna muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being high-handed and dictatorial,\u201d Katie said. \u201cThis is crazy, Mom. Why are you planning Mia\u2019s life without even asking if this is what she wants? Which I happen to know it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything,\u201d her grandfather said loudly.</p><p>\u201cLorenzo has a point,\u201d Grammy M said.</p><p>Katie turned on her. \u201cYou\u2019re in this, too? Is it a conspiracy? Don\u2019t any of you care about Mia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe family,\u201d her grandfather began.</p><p>\u201cScrew the family,\u201d Katie said loudly, then could have kicked herself.</p><p>There was a collective gasp as everyone turned to stare at her. Only Zach looked sympathetic.</p><p>Her grandfather pushed to his feet. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he demanded, his voice booming. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was shaking inside. Shaking, but determined. She tossed her napkin on the table and jumped to her feet. \u201cYou heard me. You\u2019re thinking of what you want, not what\u2019s right for Mia. Don\u2019t any of you care about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mock the family. You disrespect all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she told him. \u201cI care about everyone. But I respect that each of us has the right to choose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEither you support the family or you don\u2019t,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo told her.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to offer blind support to something I know is wrong. Mia is my sister and I love her. I\u2019ll stand against all of you before I let you force her to do something that will break her spirit.\u201d</p><p>Her grandfather began muttering in Italian. She knew what that meant.</p><p>She glanced around the table. \u201cIt\u2019s always been this way with the family. There\u2019s no room for personal opinion. There\u2019s only ever one right way. One philosophy that fits. Grandpa\u2019s. Sometimes that doesn\u2019t work. You can\u2019t force feelings. You can\u2019t make someone want what you want. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has been decided.\u201d Her grandfather glared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not a part of us. You\u2019re no longer a Marcelli.\u201d</p> <p>Katie felt as if she\u2019d been slapped.</p><p>\u201cPop, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Marco said. \u201cKatie\u2019s entitled to her opinion.\u201d He glanced at his daughter. \u201cEven if it\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Katie turned to him. \u201cYou\u2019re getting to be just like him. You used to encourage us to think for ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where he went wrong,\u201d her grandfather said. \u201cYou should listen and do what you\u2019re told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorenzo!\u201d her mother said. \u201cStop it. Katie will come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d Katie said. She looked at Brenna. \u201cWhile I\u2019m being thrown out, I\u2019m going to tell you one last time that you\u2019re wrong about what you\u2019re doing to Jeff. You may get what you want, but in the end you\u2019ll regret it. And when you\u2019re curled up and hurting, I\u2019ll be there because I love you, even when you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d She turned back to her parents. \u201cDon\u2019t make Mia choose, because if she accepts that house, you\u2019ll have lost her forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet out!\u201d her grandfather roared. \u201cNever come back. You are not my granddaughter. You\u2019re not anyone I want to know.\u201d</p><p>Pain sliced through her. No one stood against him. Not one spoke up for her. She swallowed, then left the room.</p><p>Zach watched her go.</p><p>Marco faced his father. \u201cThat was unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe already knows plenty,\u201d Zach said as he stood. \u201cShe\u2019s loyal, loving, and a whole lot more caring than any of you deserve.\u201d</p><p>He tossed his napkin on the floor and headed toward the kitchen. From there he walked outside and found Katie seated on the bottom step.</p><p>He crouched next to her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head.</p><p>He pulled her arms away from her knees, and she raised her chin. In the light from the porch he could see the dampness on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHe threw me out,\u201d she said, her voice cracking slightly. \u201cHe\u2019s never done that to me before. To Brenna and Francesca when they were teenagers, but I was always the good granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does right now. Later he\u2019ll calm down, but it may take a while. Besides, do you see anyone but you out here? They\u2019ve all turned their backs on me. They\u2019re wrong about Mia.\u201d</p><p>Tears spilled from her eyes. Zach sat next to her on the step and held open his arms.</p><p>She hesitated, then leaned against him. He held her close. \u201cThey\u2019ll come around. You were right. They\u2019ll figure it out eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a long time. No one will call me. They won\u2019t leave messages, they won\u2019t check on me. I\u2019ll be alone. It\u2019s like being dead.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to tell her that she was confident and capable, but knew that wasn\u2019t what she wanted to hear. Instead he stroked her back and said it would be all right.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBy Thursday.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, then sniffed. \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t promise that.\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cI know. I appreciate you trying to make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d She glanced past him to the house. \u201cThey\u2019ll talk about it among themselves. The Grands usually support me, but they want Mia and David to move close, so this time they won\u2019t. Obviously my folks want that, too. Brenna and Francesca are already mad because of Jeff. Mia...I don\u2019t know what she\u2019ll think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you defended her.\u201d</p><p>Katie looked at him. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not enough to get her to stand against the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back inside and talk to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. My grandfather said I wasn\u2019t a part of the family. I\u2019m not welcome back until that changes.\u201d</p><p>More tears spilled onto her face. Zach brushed them away, then kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWant to ride home with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll follow you home. I want to make sure you get there safely.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stood. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t bother unpacking my car.\u201d She pulled her keys out of her pocket, then looked at him. \u201cYou\u2019re missing dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really sweet.\u201d She wiped the back of her hand over her cheeks. \u201cI guess this whole scene kind of proves your point about relationships. Maybe you have the right idea about walking away before things get messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just hate this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how to help, so he put his arm around her and led her to her car. \u201cCome on, Katie. Let\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>K atie drove back to L.A. with the comforting glow of Zach\u2019s headlights in her rearview mirror. By the 405 freeway she\u2019d convinced herself that her Grandfather wouldn\u2019t take more than three weeks to get over being mad. The longest one of his rages had ever lasted had been a month. So by the time the fund-raiser was over, her life would be within a week of getting back to normal.</p><p>Great. The good news was she would be so busy over the next couple of weeks that she wouldn\u2019t even miss talking to her mother or her sisters. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t believe a word of it.</p><p>She cried through the next ten miles, then got herself under control by the time they reached her exit. She\u2019d expected Zach to keep going down toward the beach, but he surprised her by following her into her driveway, then stepping out of his car and walking up the drive.</p><p>He might be tough, mean, and determined, but he was also kind. He cupped her face.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to stay?\u201d</p><p>Stay?</p><p>He pulled her close. \u201cI\u2019m talking about holding you, Katie, not trying to get in your pants.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head and looked at him. \u201cWhat if I want you there?\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cAll right, but only because you\u2019re begging me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou make me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen my work here is done.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, he did hold her for a long time. Secure in Zach\u2019s arms, Katie sprawled across her bed and cried her heart out. When she was finally finished, she blew her nose and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou were probably hoping for something more romantic,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just to be here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a line.\u201d</p><p>She stared at his dark eyes and knew that she wouldn\u2019t mind getting lost in them. When everyone she loved had turned their backs on her, he\u2019d come through. Funny how he was the last one she would have expected that from. Sometimes he was a real bastard and sometimes he was the world\u2019s nicest guy.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cFor everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other. She waited for him to make his move and when he didn\u2019t, she realized he wanted her to be sure. That if she\u2019d changed her mind about wanting to make love, he wouldn\u2019t complain. He would just hold her.</p><p>The thought nearly sent her into another crying jag, but instead of giving into tears, she moved close and kissed him.</p><p>His lips were warm, his arms strong as they came around her. Within the tender confines of his embrace she forgot her family, her pain, her loneliness\u2014everything except being with Zach. His tenderness reached inside and gently nudged her romantic heart into wakefulness. His touch excited her body. The combination made her slip closer and press herself against him.</p><p>While she\u2019d initiated the kissing, he quickly took over. His head angled as he licked her bottom lip. She parted for him, wanting him to excite her, pleasure her, heal her. He placed a hand on her side and gently urged her onto her back. Her long hair spread out on the pillow, and he toyed with several strands.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>She opened her eyes and looked at his face. Concern darkened his irises, passion thickened his voice.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her cheek. \u201cDespite my reputation, I don\u2019t travel with protection. Any condoms in this girly place?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAn unopened box in my nightstand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like a woman who plans ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He leaned close and pressed his mouth to hers. She wrapped her arms around him, surrendering to the sensations that flooded her. He moved his hand from her face to her stomach where his long fingers rested lightly on her sweater. His tongue slipped into her mouth and brushed against hers.</p><p>He kissed her deeply, thoroughly, erotically, until she couldn\u2019t breathe. Slow kisses went on forever and made her bones melt. Teasing kisses that made her squirm. Passionate kisses that sucked the will right out of her and left her wanting to beg. Kisses that made her feel she\u2019d never been kissed before. Not like this.</p><p>Slowly he moved his hand, sliding up her belly, along her rib cage, and between her breasts. She found herself touching him back. Tracing the width of his shoulders and the powerful muscles in his back.</p><p>Zach stroked her arms, returned to her stomach, then repeated the circuit. Up and over, between her breasts to her shoulder, her arm, crossing her stomach, slipping close to the apex of her thighs without actually slipping between them.</p><p>She found it difficult to keep breathing. Her skin seemed tight, and if her breasts swelled any more, she was going to spill out of her bra. She wanted to start screaming instructions. And then something amazing began to happen. The anticipation took on a life of its own.</p><p>Because she knew that eventually he would touch her in every place she wanted to be touched. As their kiss went on and his hands continued to move, she thought about him touching her breasts or between her legs and the tension grew.</p><p>When he reached for the hem of her sweater, she nearly moaned in relief. He tugged off the garment and tossed it onto the floor, then flicked open the front hook on her bra. The lace sprang free, leaving her breasts exposed to the evening air. For a second her heart stopped. She froze in anticipation. Then he touched just the tip of one finger to her hard, tight nipple.</p><p>The sensation was exquisite. She almost bit her tongue as fire shot through her. Before she could fully comprehend the feeling, he gently pinched her nipple between his thumb and forefinger. She gasped. Then his mouth was on her other breast, and she had her fingers in his hair urging him on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she breathed, surrendering to the wanting.</p><p>He continued to caress her until she alternately clung to the bedspread, then to him. Tension increased, impossible tension that had only one cure.</p><p>When he finally lifted his head, she wanted to cry out in protest. Fortunately he went right to work on unfastening her jeans. While she kicked off her shoes, he pulled down the zipper. Jeans, panties, and socks came off in one easy push that left her naked.</p><p>She made a halfhearted gesture toward his shirt, as if maybe she would undress him. Bless the man, he never gave her a chance. Instead he slipped between her knees and kissed her stomach. Muscles tightened in anticipation. He stroked the length of her legs, then bent low and licked the inside of her knees.</p><p>He\u2019d done this before, she thought, already finding it difficult to think. He\u2019d done it and done it well.</p><p>She tried to sigh, but the sound came out more like a purr. This time, when he moved slowly and deliberately, she abandoned herself to the reality that was his fingers, his mouth, and his tongue. She didn\u2019t urge, didn\u2019t plead, didn\u2019t do anything but let him seduce her into sensual mindlessness that made every cell in her body stand up and applaud.</p><p>He rubbed her thighs, moving closer and closer to her waiting heat, but not quite touching her there. He licked and nibbled and sucked on her skin, moving north, always moving north, but again, not touching there.</p><p>She arched her hips slightly in invitation, her legs parted, but he ignored her. The man had his own pace and he would not be rushed.</p><p>She soon found that pace suited her just fine. Slowly, and slowly, inching up until she could feel his hot breath on the apex of her thighs. Need, want, and desire collided. She trembled and he hadn\u2019t even touched her intimately. Not yet. But soon. Very soon.</p><p>Finally he slipped his fingers along the seam of her outer lips and gently drew them apart. The cool air contrasted with her hot skin. He put his mouth on her and gave her an openmouthed kiss that sent a scream of satisfaction racing through her body.</p><p>Katie stiffened and melted all at the same time. He licked the length of her, then found nature\u2019s magic place and reintroduced himself.</p><p>Quick flicks and slow sucking robbed her of free will and left her gasping. He inserted one finger inside of her, touching her from below. His finger and his tongue circled in perfect harmony, once, twice...and she was lost.</p><p>The release caught her off guard, sending her flying. She found herself coming endlessly as her body shuddered, sending waves of pleasure crashing through her. Zach read her mind, or maybe just her body, continuing to touch her perfectly until there was nothing left but a gentle hum of contentment.</p><p>When it was over, he kissed his way up her body, first her stomach, then her breasts. Finally his head was level with hers. She had a feeling she looked as wiped-out and two-dimensional as a badly drawn stick figure. Zach had that expression of male superiority that claimed he\u2019d just pleased his woman. Frankly, Katie thought he\u2019d earned it.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she whispered because she didn\u2019t have the breath left to talk any louder. \u201cThat was really\u2014\u201d</p><p>Words failed her. She gestured with her hand, flicking her wrist and then touching his cheek. He smiled.</p><p>\u201cWow works,\u201d he said.</p><p>She stared at his face, at the lines by his eyes, and the firm set of his jaw. For the rest of her life, whatever happened, she would remember this moment, this night, this time with him. Even if she had to face him over breakfast at family Christmases for the next forty years, she couldn\u2019t find it in herself to be sorry.</p><p>She reached for his shirt, but found she didn\u2019t have the strength to do much more than lay there.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d like to get naked,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I would.\u201d</p><p>He stood. While he unfastened his shirt, she reached in her nightstand for the promised box of condoms.</p> <p>\u201cJumbo size?\u201d he joked as he unfastened his trousers.</p><p>\u201cSuper colossal.\u201d</p><p>He pulled off his trousers, then his socks. Finally his briefs joined the pile.</p><p>She studied his naked body. He had long legs, narrow hips and an impatient erection that seemed to demand her attention. He looked as good as she remembered.</p><p>She shifted onto her knees and moved to the edge of the bed. Once there, she wrapped one arm around him, drawing him close, and slipped her other arm between them so she could touch his hardness. He responded by cupping her rear and squeezing.</p><p>Something about touching him made her start to tremble. When he kissed her, she found herself frantic. He responded in kind, sucking on her tongue, cupping her breasts and teasing her nipples.</p><p>She released his penis and ran her hands up and down his chest. The contrast of cool hair and hot skin delighted her. She slipped lower to cup him, then parted her legs, wanting him inside.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, young lady,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She rolled onto one hip, then onto her back while he opened the box of condoms and pulled out a plastic packet. He ripped it open and slipped on the protection, then moved between her knees.</p><p>He deliberately pushed her knees farther apart so that he could see all of her. She looked at him looking at her. A shiver rippled through her. Being with Zach was more intimate than being with anyone else. There weren\u2019t any secrets between them, no masks or disguises.</p><p>When he rubbed a finger against her dampness, he shifted his gaze so he could watch her reaction. She bit her lower lip and groaned. He moved again. She wanted to close her eyes, but she wanted to watch, too. She\u2019d never watched before. At least not so obviously.</p><p>He continued to touch her, stroking faster and faster until she started breathing heavily and straining toward him. Tendrils of excitement moved through her; tension increased. She could feel herself getting wetter, swelling, needing.</p><p>Faster and faster, rubbing over and around. She pulsed her hips in time with his movements. Then she felt something thick and hard pushing into her. Even as he continued to touch her, he filled her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe the sensations he created within her. He withdrew and plunged into her again. Her release was just out of reach. She pulsed faster, her breath coming in gasps.</p><p>\u201cZach!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what she wanted from him. Maybe that he wouldn\u2019t stop. Maybe that this would go on forever.</p><p>Zach watched the passion flare in Katie\u2019s eyes. He could feel the tiny shudders building inside of her. Every part of him screamed out to simply bury himself inside of her and have his way, but he couldn\u2019t. Not yet. Not when she was so close.</p><p>So he gritted his teeth and thought about the baseball card collection he\u2019d had when he was a kid. If he\u2019d kept it, it would have been worth a fortune. Except then he started thinking about Katie in a baseball jersey and nothing else, and her perched on a counter while he plunged his hard, throbbing c\u2014</p><p>Math. Times tables. Seven times seven was\u2014</p><p>She gasped. He felt the hard knot of nerves pulse, and suddenly she contracted around him. He groaned as she milked him, making her sweet, slick body impossible to resist. He continued to touch her until the shudders stopped, then he leaned forward and dropped his hands to the bed.</p><p>In and out he pumped, feeling the pressure build and build. Her eyes locked with his. Her legs came up around his hips. Suddenly her hands were on his ass, her nails digging in as she pulled him deeper and deeper. Her head arched back and the contractions began again. This time she screamed.</p><p>It was as if her entire body conspired to send him over the edge. The pressure was unbearable and the point of no return was a heartbeat away. He squeezed back as hard as he could, waiting until the last of her contractions faded. Only then did he give in to the rush of release that exploded out of him like a bullet.</p><p>When rational thought returned, he wrapped his arms around her and shifted them both onto their sides. Katie stared at him wide-eyed and flushed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t learn that in law school,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI did. It was extra credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you study? There weren\u2019t any classes like that at UCLA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure there were. You just have to know what they\u2019re called.\u201d</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>Zach kissed the tip of her nose, pulled back the covers, and waited for her to slip under them before sliding next to her. When they were settled, he turned out the lamp on the nightstand.</p><p>Katie rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cI guess it\u2019s your turn to sneak away in the night,\u201d she said teasingly. \u201cI promise not to take offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a seven A.M. meeting. My leaving won\u2019t be about you.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou say the sweetest things.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close. \u201cI mean them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>While her breathing slowed, he stared into the darkness. He did mean them. In this case, if he didn\u2019t have an early meeting, he would be content to stay in her bed and wake up with her. He could imagine a long time spent in the shower while they discovered just how limber each of them could be, followed by breakfast at her small, painted table. Surrounded by plants and candles and too many pillows, he would listen to her plans for the day and talk about his own schedule.</p><p>The concept of domestic bliss usually sent him screaming for the hills, but not this time. This time he didn\u2019t want to walk away, and for the life of him, he couldn\u2019t say why.</p><p>Katie watched the clock slowly ticking off the hour. She stared at the lining for Mia\u2019s wedding gown that she\u2019d spent most of yesterday sewing together, then back at the clock.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked aloud, more than a little annoyed that her baby sister couldn\u2019t be bothered to show up on time for the very first fitting of her wedding gown.</p><p>Katie paced the width of her small living room. She had a thousand and one details to take care of for the fund-raiser. There were phone calls to make, details to confirm, prizes to be picked up, and inventories to go over.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need this,\u201d she muttered and headed for her phone. She punched in her sister\u2019s number, then clenched her teeth when she heard the familiar message.</p><p>\u201cHi! It\u2019s me, and if you don\u2019t know who \u2018me\u2019 is, then you probably have the wrong number. Leave a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia, it\u2019s Katie. I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t show up for the very first fitting of your wedding dress.\u201d She tightened her grip on the phone. \u201cDammit, Mia, I was defending you and your right to have your own life. I understand the rest of the family not talking to me, but you have no right to be mad at me.\u201d</p><p>There was so much more she wanted to say, but what was the point? She was being given the cold shoulder. Only time would fix things. She hung up and reached for her ever-present briefcase. With the countdown to the fund-raiser beginning, she had plenty of work to keep her occupied.</p><p>17</p><p>B renna pulled her hair into a ponytail and secured it with an old elastic band she\u2019d found in her jacket pocket. She was having a bad hair day\u2014probably because she hadn\u2019t bothered to shower that morning. Actually she hadn\u2019t done much more than wash her face, brush her teeth, and put on clean underwear.</p><p>She looked like hell, which suited her mood because she felt like hell. Whoever said change was good was either an idiot or had never been through a divorce. She alternated between blinding rage and numbing depression\u2014not that she liked either state. She wanted to feel normal again.</p><p>She wanted not to be fighting with Katie.</p><p>She still felt badly about what had happened last week. While she didn\u2019t agree with her sister\u2019s stand, she understood why Katie was worried about her. In truth, she kind of liked her concern, which meant not talking to her was really stupid. But calling meant admitting Katie might be right, and Brenna hardly wanted to have that conversation.</p><p>The truth was, she missed her sister, and now that Francesca had contacted Jeff and arranged to meet him, Brenna was having second thoughts. Did she really want her ex-husband to come on to her twin? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rather than dwell on the mess that was her life, Brenna raised her face toward the sun and breathed in the sweet spring air. It was May\u2014a busy month at the vineyard. Training had begun a week ago in the southernmost fields.</p><p>Speaking of which...she squatted down to examine the vines more closely, then fingered the sturdy plant. Already green leaves covered all the new growth and much of the old. Tiny clusters of flowers danced in the afternoon breeze. Green tendrils found their way toward the sun.</p><p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d she said, tugging on one tendril, then pulling it free of the stem.</p> <p>Training the vines was both an art and a science. Each plant produced an excess of leaves, flowers, and new growth. Skilled workers came through and stripped off what wasn\u2019t needed, leaving the most healthy and strong growth to produce the best grapes. If too much was removed, the harvest would be small and disappointing. Not enough removed, and the grapes wouldn\u2019t grow and ripen as well as they could. Sun and air needed to flow through the vineyard, rolling across like a wave from the sea.</p><p>Brenna straightened and arched her aching back. They were well into their first week of training, and she had the sore muscles to prove it. The ache was like an old friend\u2014almost forgotten, but still a bit of a lingering memory. She knew that Grandpa Lorenzo had insisted on the manual labor to test her determination. Brenna wasn\u2019t worried; she refused to fail.</p><p>She touched another leaf. Here in the southern part of central California, frost wasn\u2019t an issue, but it could cause damage in their northern vineyards. Every day she spoke to the managers there as she slowly returned to the rhythm of the vineyards.</p><p>She headed toward the property line. For the past couple of weeks she walked a different portion of the land to refamiliarize herself with what had once been her entire world. When she allowed herself to consider all she\u2019d lost by marrying Jeff, she wanted to raise her fists to the sky and demand justice. Unfortunately she had no one to blame but herself. She had chosen what seemed like the safe path because any other was out of the question. Unfortunately she\u2019d chosen a selfish man who had taken advantage of her devotion and left her with nothing to show for giving away her very soul.</p><p>She reached the edge of the property and checked on the railings. The posts sat securely in the ground. She was about to return to the east fields when she saw someone walking toward her. Someone on the other side of the fence. The evil, Wild Sea Vineyard side.</p> <p>She wanted to run for cover for a number of reasons, one of which being that she was dressed like a day hire, the second being the fact that she\u2019d gained five pounds in the past six or seven weeks. The combination of self-pity and the Grands\u2019 cooking had done nothing good for her hips and thighs.</p><p>The third and perhaps most important reason was that he was the last person on the planet she wanted to see when she wasn\u2019t at her best.</p><p>But there was no way she could escape. Not without seeming like an idiot. Brenna figured she\u2019d done enough of that in the past nine years without continuing the pattern. So she squared her shoulders, took a breath for luck, and turned to face the man her grandfather thought of as the devil incarnate.</p><p>Nicholas Giovanni. Nic to his friends.</p><p>At one time Brenna had known him well enough to call him Nic. She\u2019d called him a lot of other things, too, depending on her mood and the circumstances. Sometimes he\u2019d laughed, sometimes they\u2019d fought, and sometimes they\u2019d simply lost themselves in sensual lovemaking that had left them both breathless.</p><p>The sun was in her eyes, making it difficult to see details. She saw a tall, powerful silhouette walking toward her. The man from her past had always dominated the landscape. Too arrogant, too handsome, too many things. It was pathetic to think that at the ripe old age of twenty-seven there had only been two men in her life. She really needed to get out more.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t seen Nic in nine years, and she didn\u2019t doubt time had been kind to him. Sure enough, as he approached, she saw that he looked good enough to be served with marinara and some fresh focaccia bread.</p><p>The passing years had added a few lines around his dark brown eyes, which only made them more appealing when they crinkled as he smiled that easy smile that had once kept her up nights. Stubble darkened his jaw, making him look dangerous and incredibly sexy. His clothes were as worn as hers, but somehow they looked better on him. Wasn\u2019t that always the way?</p><p>\u201cI heard you were back,\u201d he announced when he came to a stop by the fence that separated their property.</p><p>That was it\u2014five words and a welcoming smile. As if he wasn\u2019t angry. As if the past didn\u2019t matter. And then she realized it probably didn\u2019t. Based on Jeff\u2019s treatment of her, she hadn\u2019t made an impact on him, and they\u2019d been married for years. Why would she have been more than an uninteresting blip on Nic\u2019s radar screen?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working the vines,\u201d she said, because saying why she was back was simply too depressing. Besides, while there might be acres between houses, this was still a small community. She didn\u2019t doubt that word of her divorce had spread quickly. Except if she didn\u2019t say she was getting a divorce, he might think she thought he didn\u2019t know and that she was hiding the fact. Which would make her look stupid.</p><p>Her mind whirled around a couple more times before she decided to face things head on and blurted, \u201cI\u2019m getting a divorce.\u201d</p><p>Nic\u2019s steady gaze never left her face, which was a good thing, because she could feel every one of those additional five pounds clinging to her thighs like Francesca\u2019s padding. Unfortunately her padding didn\u2019t unzip and was probably there to stay.</p><p>\u201cI heard. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you?\u201d she asked before she could stop herself.</p><p>\u201cSure. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>Of course, she thought, wanting to smack herself in the head. After all this time, why would Nic give a damn?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting our largest harvest ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill in the volume business, Nic?\u201d She mentally winced. Okay, she\u2019d just turned into a bitch queen. Time to tone it down.</p><p>His dark eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the wine business. The market is changing. Elitist boutique wineries are being gobbled up by large, successful companies. Like mine.\u201d</p><p>Her worry, depression, and ill-temper faded. No need to tone it down. Not if Nic was going to fight back.</p><p>\u201cElitist?\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re proud of the quantity you produce. Here at Marcelli, we worry more about the quality of the harvest. There\u2019s a reason every reserve we\u2019ve produced has been a winner at competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the end it will come down to economic survival. I\u2019m confident of mine. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll survive. Some people will even like what you produce. But you\u2019ll never make anything special or significant. What you have is mass produced with so much mechanization that the grapes can go from bud to bottle without being touched by a single hand. Kind of like making a cola drink.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. Tension crackled in the air. \u201cThe Hendersons are throwing in the towel. I bought them out last week.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known. Regret filled her. As much as she hated to admit it, Nic was right. The economic climate was changing. Small vineyards were being lost, or bought up.</p><p>\u201cLike a circling vulture looking for carrion,\u201d she said easily. \u201cAre you going to keep the grapes or replant? You need the Cab Franc for blending,\u201d she continued before he could speak. \u201cOf course, their vineyards aren\u2019t as tidy as yours. You might actually have to send people in to pick the grapes.\u201d She gasped and pressed her hands to her chest. \u201cWhatever will happen to that so important bottom line?\u201d</p><p>His dark gaze never left her face. Brenna waited for the snappy comeback. Arguing with Nic left her feeling more energized than she had in weeks. Funny how despite the years they\u2019d been apart, their ability to drive each other crazy hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>But instead of taking the bait, he simply shook his head. \u201cI thought you might have mellowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close. You haven\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMaybe not, but I\u2019m a lot richer.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t doubt that. In the past nine years Nic had taken Wild Sea into the stratosphere. In the same amount of time she\u2019d worked at a series of tedious jobs and a bad marriage. How depressing.</p><p>\u201cRich enough to be a contender,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this.\u201d He jerked his head toward the Marcelli Vineyards.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. My grandfather would never sell to you.\u201d</p><p>Nic shrugged. \u201cMaybe not, but word on the street is, he\u2019s going to sell to someone.\u201d</p><p>Brenna stalked into the main offices of the winery and headed for her grandfather\u2019s office. She found the old man sitting behind his desk, studying an order form.</p><p>\u201cNic Giovanni says you\u2019re going to sell the winery,\u201d she announced.</p><p>Her grandfather looked up slowly. \u201cWhat are you doing talking with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was walking the fence line, he was doing the same. We met, we talked, he said you were selling. Is it true?\u201d</p><p>He had to tell her no, she thought desperately. The winery was the only thing left in her world that mattered. Okay, yes, there was family, but she was talking about work. About losing herself in something she\u2019d always loved.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she told him when he didn\u2019t speak. \u201cThis is a part of all of us.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to everything you hear, Brenna. Nicholas Giovanni is our enemy. He only wants to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>His phone rang and when he reached for the receiver, Brenna knew he\u2019d said as much as he was going to. She turned and left.</p><p>She wanted to take his reassurances to heart. Marcelli Wines was her grandfather\u2019s life. He would never abandon all that he\u2019d worked for. And she supposed a case could be made that Nic was the enemy.</p><p>Except he\u2019d never cared about the feud. They\u2019d had that in common. And he\u2019d never been vindictive\u2014even when no one could have blamed him.</p><p>Nine years ago she\u2019d promised to love him forever. Yet when he\u2019d proposed she\u2019d walked away from him. Within six months she\u2019d been married to Jeff. Was that why Nic had said the winery was for sale?</p><p>Surely he wouldn\u2019t carry a grudge all this time. Why would her childish actions still matter? She didn\u2019t doubt he was more than capable of making up a story about her grandfather selling, just to upset her, but only with good reason. And she couldn\u2019t think of a single one.</p><p>So somebody was lying. Either Nic or her grandfather. Which left her with two questions: Which one? And why?</p><p>\u201cOkay, but what about when the state gets involved, eliminating voters supposedly for legal reasons, but really to make sure the election goes the way the party in power wants?\u201d Carol Rumstead asked. As she spoke, she flipped her long dark hair out of her eyes.</p><p>Mia exchanged a look of frustration with her friend Tina. Every time they discussed campaign reform, Carol brought up the exact same issues. It was so incredibly boring.</p><p>She was saved from having to make a response by a quick knock on her front door. She was halfway across the living room when the door opened and David stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, crossing to her and giving her a kiss. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She accepted the kiss, but barely. \u201cMy poli sci study group is having a meeting. I told you.\u201d</p><p>David frowned. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d He glanced at his watch and frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly seven. We talked about going to a movie tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we? Gee, I guess I forgot.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder at the small group sprawled across her sofa and love seat, then drew him into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou never forget stuff like that,\u201d David said as he leaned against the counter. \u201cMia, you\u2019ve been acting strange lately. What\u2019s up?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I\u2019m really busy. Why don\u2019t you take someone else to the movies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t have anyone to go with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Annoyance turned to anger. She folded her arms over her chest. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard. Let me give you a word of advice, David. When you\u2019re engaged, it\u2019s a really stupid idea to take another girl to a club and then spend the entire night trying to suck out her tonsils. People talk. Word gets around. It gets back to me.\u201d</p> <p>David flushed but didn\u2019t retreat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. There\u2019s no other girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this Julie person is just a close friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hang out.\u201d</p><p>He was so lying, she couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cJust get out of here. I don\u2019t want to talk to you right now.\u201d</p><p>His face paled. \u201cMia, no. We have to talk. I love you.\u201d</p> <p>She could feel the warm gold of her engagement ring. As she turned it and squeezed her hand closed, the small diamond cut into her palm.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my definition of love.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her for a long time, then shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about me. I love you more than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>Nice words, she thought, trying to harden her heart to them. The problem was, even though he\u2019d acted like an ass, she still cared about him. She wanted to forgive him. But wanting and being able to were two different things.</p><p>He walked out of the kitchen. Seconds later the front door opened, then closed. Mia dropped her head and told herself to let it go for now. She would take some time and think about what she wanted, then meet with David again. Together they would come to some rational, logical decision.</p><p>Which sounded good, but didn\u2019t do a thing for the knot in her stomach and the ache in her heart. First Jeff had cheated on Brenna and now David had cheated on her. Were all men lying weasel dogs?</p> <p>Fifty hours until show time, Katie thought as she walked through the main ballroom of the hotel. The tables were in place, but not set. The tents were up, as were the game booths. She had already toured the gardens, which were in perfect shape. The morning of the party, the gardeners would give the area a once-over, tidying any wayward bushes, sweeping the paths and raking the leaves.</p><p>She compared the table layout with the master diagram on her clipboard and carefully counted. Exactly right, she thought when she finished. The decorations were in place, the lighting had been fixed so that no one had to suffer with a spotlight in his or her eyes. The stage had been pushed into the corner and the various bands and musical groups had been confirmed. Check, check, and triple check.</p><p>She walked toward the kitchens to go over the food one more time. She pushed open one of the swinging double doors and found most of the kitchen staff gathered around three large workstations. All the head chefs were there, as were their assistants.</p><p>Jerome looked up and saw her. \u201cKatie!\u201d he said with delight. \u201cAlways compulsively thorough.\u201d He pressed his hands to his chest. \u201cWorry shortens the life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry so my clients don\u2019t have to. In my line of work, compulsively thorough means \u2018wildly successful\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to one of the other chefs and moved toward her. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll volunteer to go through the food with you before you even ask me,\u201d he said, taking her arm. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice of you. Most brilliant chefs are far more temperamental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. My goodness is a curse. People take advantage of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd then you threaten them with a deboning knife.\u201d She glanced back at the crowd of kitchen workers. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? You haven\u2019t booked another big event, have you? Jerome, there\u2019s not room for\u2014\u201d</p><p>He plucked a perfect strawberry from a tray and pressed it between her lips.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d he commanded. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry. There are no other parties scheduled until Sunday afternoon, and by then you\u2019ll be long gone. This tonight\u201d\u2014he motioned to the collection of people gathered around the work tables\u2014\u201cis our menu tasting. We\u2019re working on developing some new dishes for the hotel\u2019s fine dining room. I like to get opinions from all the staff before making the final decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than okay. We\u2019ll be so inspired by our tasting that for the next forty-eight hours, we\u2019ll work feverishly to make your party brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting a little deep in here, Jerome, and I\u2019m wearing open-toed shoes.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, took her free hand in his, and kissed her fingers.</p><p>She followed him to the huge refrigerators. He opened several doors, showing her trays of meat waiting to be cut into the right size for grilling on skewers. Two more refrigerators contained the vegetables, as well as fruits for chocolate dipping. Against the far wall, seven-foot dollies held trays to deliver the various courses. In the pantry the chocolates from around the world were waiting to be cut into chunks suitable for melting, while several hundred fondue pots were stacked on more dollies.</p><p>\u201cThe wine has been pulled from the cellar,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hard liquor will be delivered in the morning.\u201d He cupped her chin, squeezed, then released her. \u201cFear not, bright angel. Nothing will go wrong. I promise to make your party perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d she told him. \u201cI do my best to stay calm before big events, but this one is downright huge. I want to make it a success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both have a lot on the line. I won\u2019t let you down, my darling girl.\u201d He grinned. \u201cNow, is there any way I can convince you to join us for the tasting? I promise you, the food is amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d She tapped her clipboard. \u201cI have four million lists to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to get some sleep in the next couple of days. You want to be beautiful for your client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. Thanks for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>She closed the cover on her clipboard and waved goodbye as she headed back for the kitchen. She made her way to her car. There was nothing more to be done tonight. In the morning there was a whole new to-do list, phone calls, and the beginning of the countdown. In the morning it would be less than thirty-six hours until show time.</p><p>Francesca entered the popular West Side eatery shortly after seven in the evening. In honor of her meeting with Jeff, she\u2019d pulled out one of the only two nice outfits she owned, a sleeveless summery linen dress with a matching short jacket. Forty-five minutes and a very interesting conversation with a man named Earl at a survivalist-spy store in the San Fernando Valley had steered her toward the lightweight personal recorder she\u2019d tucked into her purse. She\u2019d pinned the tiny, voice-activated remote microphone to the neck of her dress, where it was concealed by the edge of the jacket.</p><p>Earl had promised three hours of recording time, given her tips on increasing clarity, and offered to help her put on the microphone. She\u2019d refused the latter.</p><p>Now, as she made her way through the crowded bar, she tried to convince herself that this was just another one of her psychology experiments. Her entire purpose was to see how someone responded to her, based on appearance. But instead of dressing in a fat suit, or like the great tattooed lady, she was a slightly vampy version of herself.</p><p>She\u2019d suffered through an entire day of rollers to get her long hair to cascade in thick curls. Makeup accentuated her green eyes, lip liner made her mouth look bigger, and she\u2019d enhanced her natural assets with a push-up bra.</p><p>All a disguise, she thought, trying not to feel sick to her stomach. What had seemed like a great idea at the time, was becoming more and more problematic. Had Katie been right? Should she and Brenna have thought this through more?</p><p>Before she could decide, she spotted Jeff at a table by the window. He saw her as well, stood and waved. She waved back and walked through the crowd.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen her brother-in-law since Christmas. He was still pleasant-looking with sandy-colored hair and pale blue eyes. The mustache was new, as was the absence of a wedding band. Only a couple of inches taller than her own five feet nine, Jeff wasn\u2019t a big guy. With her wearing heels, they were the same height.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca,\u201d he said, sounding delighted. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased you called.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to take the hands he offered and squeeze them. When he leaned close, she did the same and let him kiss her cheek. The light contact made her skin crawl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been way too long since I\u2019ve seen you,\u201d she said, sliding into the seat across from him and smiling. \u201cOkay, you and Brenna are splitting up, but after having you as a part of the family for nine years, I didn\u2019t want to let you walk away without saying something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feelings exactly.\u201d</p><p>The waitress appeared. Francesca ordered white wine. When they were alone, she smiled at Jeff. \u201cHow\u2019s business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Frantic, but I\u2019m learning more every day. There are amazing advances in cardiac medicine. The practice is one of the biggest on the West Side. All those lawyers and movie producers. Excellent insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to get paid,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>His pale eyebrows rose slightly. \u201cWas that a crack?\u201d</p><p>No, but she wouldn\u2019t mind thwacking him over the head with a heavy book. \u201cWhat? Oh, sorry.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNo. Of course not. You know me\u2014I can\u2019t ever be subtle. Besides, I\u2019m still a struggling grad student. I\u2019m impressed by those who can make the big bucks.\u201d She leaned toward him. \u201cYou worked hard, Jeff. All those years of study and the long hours. You deserve your success.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed and patted her hand. \u201cThanks. I\u2019m glad you understand. I figured the entire family would be talking about hiring someone to rub me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather maybe, but the rest of us understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I mean, I really love my sister, but she\u2019s not the easiest person in the world to get along with.\u201d Francesca gave a laugh. \u201cI shared a room with her for eighteen years. I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>The waitress appeared with her wine, which was really lucky because Francesca was close to gagging. She\u2019d always liked Jeff, but those feelings had faded. Now she thought he was smarmy and self-important.</p><p>She sipped her wine, then stared deeply into his eyes. \u201cAre you doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean...really. I\u2019ve been worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s pale eyes brightened. \u201cSo you haven\u2019t written me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. We\u2019ve always had a special relationship.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cLike brother and sister.\u201d</p><p>She carefully put her hand back on the table, palm down. Jeff covered it with his. She managed not to jerk away.</p><p>\u201cMore than that,\u201d he said.</p><p>She wanted to gag. She wanted to throw her drink in his face. Instead she sighed softly.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s your love life?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPathetic.\u201d At least that much was true. \u201cBetween school and teaching and studying, I don\u2019t get out much. That\u2019s why I\u2019m really excited you wanted to see me tonight.\u201d</p><p>His thumb moved across the back of her hand. \u201cYou should come down to L.A. more often. We could hang out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to get in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could never do that.\u201d He stared at her. \u201cFrancesca, you\u2019re so beautiful. I might have been married to Brenna, but that didn\u2019t stop me from looking.\u201d</p><p>Oh, man. She could feel his slime oozing across the table. Blech. This was disgusting. She swallowed the need to spit, and smiled instead. \u201cAt me? But I\u2019m so skinny and awkward. Brenna was always the Earth Mother. Those damn curves of hers. I wanted what she had.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>Francesca wished she could fake a blush, but she didn\u2019t know how. Instead she straightened and pulled her hand free. \u201cJeff, I heard you\u2019re seeing someone. I\u2019m not the kind of woman who gets involved with taken guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taken,\u201d he said easily.</p> <p>\u201cBut Brenna said there was someone else.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI date. There\u2019s no one special in my life.\u201d</p><p>She happened to know he was living with the bimbo, but she wasn\u2019t about to let him know.</p><p>\u201cOh. Wow. That\u2019s...interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p> <p>She heard the hook snap as he took the bait. \u201cJeff, come on. Of course it\u2019s interesting. After nine years of watching you with my sister, this is exactly what I wanted to hear. You\u2019re my fantasy.\u201d</p><p>For a second she thought she might have gone too far, but after sucking in a breath, Jeff grinned. The idiot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my fantasy, too,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for years for you to tell me you wanted me, too. Come on. Let\u2019s go get a hotel room. I want to fuck your brains out for the next three days.\u201d</p><p>Bingo. Francesca shook her head. \u201cNo, thanks. Amazingly enough, I\u2019m going to have to turn down that very romantic offer.\u201d She picked up her purse and started to slide out of the booth.</p><p>Jeff looked confused. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving. I have what I came for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Careful not to disturb the tape recorder in her purse, she pulled a second one out of her pocket. Earl had suggested the duplicate. They had made her feel twice as secure.</p><p>She punched the rewind button for a couple of seconds, then shifted to Play. Jeff\u2019s voice was tinny but clearly audible.</p><p>\u201cI date. There\u2019s no one special in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman you live with will probably find that really fascinating,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m guessing the \u2018fuck your brains out\u2019 remark is going to be the real kicker.\u201d</p><p>Jeff turned pale. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying dirty. Back off on the winery, or the bimbo gets a copy of the tape. Clear enough?\u201d</p><p>Jeff swore, then lunged for her. Francesca might have only made it to a green belt, but she knew enough to sidestep him and turn gracefully while he tumbled to the ground. In the process he bumped several patrons who were trying to balance their drinks in the crowded bar area. There were cries of \u201cWatch out!\u201d and \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>While a tall, burly guy who looked very unhappy and very wet grabbed Jeff by his shirt, Francesca made her way to the exit.</p><p>She\u2019d given the valet an extra twenty to keep her truck handy. Now she climbed into the cab and headed for the freeway. Ten minutes later she was driving north, back for home. Mission accomplished. The winery was safe, Brenna could go after Jeff for repayment of her effort to put him through school, and Francesca had done her good deed for the week. She was thrilled...and fighting the need to throw up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d David said miserably.</p><p>Mia paced the length of her living room. It was late\u2014after midnight\u2014and they\u2019d been at this for hours.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he told her for the hundredth time.</p><p>Forty-eight hours after denying his relationship with Julie, David had showed up on Mia\u2019s doorstep and come clean. Claiming it was little more than prewedding jitters, he\u2019d confessed to hanging out with her, some kissing, and nothing else. Mia had yet to decide if she believed him.</p><p>\u201cIt meant something to me,\u201d Mia told him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just cheat, you were sloppy, you publicly humiliated me, and then you lied. In the face of all that, \u2019I\u2019m sorry\u2019 seems feeble.\u201d</p><p>She continued to pace. As she walked past him, he reached out and grabbed her. \u201cMia, you\u2019ve got to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She glared at him. \u201cGive me one good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you still love me.\u201d</p><p>She did\u2014because she was a fool. She still loved him and wanted to marry him. She wanted to move to Washington and explore the city with him. She wanted to get her graduate degree, a great job with the State Department, and have David in her life. She had a plan, and he was as much a part of it as anything else.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I ever trust you again?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He hung his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. How do I earn that back?\u201d</p><p>How did he? Was it possible? Could something broken and shattered be put whole again?</p><p>He stepped close and gathered her against him. \u201cDon\u2019t send me away,\u201d he begged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you. I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p><p>She believed him. At that moment he would do anything. But what about in a few weeks, or a year? What about the next time things got difficult? Would he work it out or would he run?</p><p>\u201cAre you really sure you want to marry me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He stared deeply into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so sure of anything in my life. You\u2019re my world, Mia. Only you.\u201d</p><p>He picked her up and she let him...mostly because being in David\u2019s arms was where she belonged. Because she loved him. Because it seemed that Marcelli women were destined to make fools of themselves over the men they cared about.</p><p>The phone rang shortly before nine the next morning. Katie munched on toast while she reviewed her to-do list. There were exactly twenty-seven items, which should take her about six hours. That left plenty of time for last-minute things she might have forgotten. She had already had a forty-minute conversation with one of her staff, and a conference call with three others.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, her attention mostly on her list.</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>She froze. There was something horrible about the voice. Familiar, but horrible. Apprehension crawled up her spine, leaving her suddenly very, very cold.</p><p>\u201cYes, this is Katie Marcelli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jerome.\u201d</p><p>Her throat closed. \u201cJerome? What\u2019s wrong? You sound awful.\u201d</p><p>In the background she could hear voices, then a low groan.</p><p>\u201cKatie, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Jerome sucked in a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe it was the fish. Something.\u201d</p><p>Her tight throat made it difficult to talk. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>He swore softly. \u201cWe\u2019re all sick. The entire kitchen staff has food poisoning. They\u2019ve just admitted me into the hospital. All the chefs are here. They\u2019re going to keep us at least a couple of days. There\u2019s some concern that we\u2019ve ingested parasites. We should all be fine, but we won\u2019t be back to work for nearly a week.\u201d</p><p>The panic grew and her hands began to sweat. Fish? There wasn\u2019t any fish on her menu. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had the tasting dinner last night,\u201d he said weakly. \u201cRemember? For the new restaurant menu. I\u2019m sorry, Katie. There\u2019s no kitchen staff. At least not at the hotel. They\u2019re all here, or at other hospitals.\u201d</p><p>He continued talking, but she wasn\u2019t listening. No kitchen staff? None? She had a party to put on in less than thirty-six hours. Over two thousand really well-dressed people were going to be expecting a fancy meal and fine service and what the hell was she going to do?</p><p>18</p><p>\u201cZ ach, you have a call on line three,\u201d Dora said. \u201cIt\u2019s Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Zach punched the Off button for the intercom, then picked up the receiver and leaned back in his chair. \u201cHey, gorgeous,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cThirty-three hours and counting. Are you nervous?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d expected a laughing response from Katie, or a smart crack. What he got was silence.</p><p>\u201cKatie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Do you have a second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Something in her voice made him sit up straight and hold on to the phone a little tighter. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been an unexpected problem,\u201d she said, her words more clipped than usual. \u201cLast night the entire hotel kitchen staff had a tasting for the new menu for the hotel\u2019s fine dining room.\u201d She paused and cleared her throat. \u201cUnfortunately they seemed to have cooked up some bad fish. Most of the kitchen staff is in the hospital, including Jerome.\u201d</p><p>Zach opened his mouth to respond, but couldn\u2019t think of a single thing to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already spoken with the hotel manager along with the events manager,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to do whatever it takes to honor our contract with them. Outside staff can be brought in. Between that and my own staff, I\u2019m reasonably confident that everything can be worked out in time. However, under the circumstances, I can\u2019t guarantee that it will be perfect.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled heavily. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThere\u2019s a clause in our contract with the hotel that allows us to pull out at the last minute when they have a disaster like this. They wouldn\u2019t be happy with that decision, but they can\u2019t stop us. They would return all moneys paid to date. We would have the option of rescheduling there or at another location in the future. I\u2019ve already contacted a temp agency. I can have a phone bank up in less than two hours. Anyone we can\u2019t reach by phone will be visited in person. The hotel will cover that cost. Also, they\u2019ll pay for dinner at a nearby restaurant for anyone who slips through the cracks and shows up anyway.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. \u201cEveryone is sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Actually Jerome sounded awful. He\u2019s in the emergency room right now, but we\u2019re keeping in touch by phone.\u201d</p><p>Zach swore under his breath. He glanced at his watch. It was nine-fifty. \u201cWhen did you find out about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I got right to work on the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p><p>Katie had put together a rescue operation with options in less than fifty minutes. Why was he surprised? She gave a hundred and ten percent.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that. You\u2019re the client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe party is as much yours as it is the firm\u2019s. We\u2019re all in this together. What does your gut say we should do? Can you pull it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get all the elements together,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cWill it be what it would have been? I\u2019m not sure. Will anyone know there was a problem?\u201d She hesitated. \u201cCan I get back to you on those odds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was \u2018Katie, the owner of Organization Central\u2019s\u2019 answer. Now give me the \u2018Katie, the person\u2019s\u2019 response. What can I do to make this situation easier for you? Do you want to cancel or bluff?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOh, Zach, it\u2019s a nightmare. I can\u2019t believe Jerome and his staff got sick less than two days before the party. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>He heard her writing on a piece of paper, then she cleared her throat. \u201cLet\u2019s go for it.\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head to cradle the phone between his ear and his shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s my vote, too. No one is going to want the hassle of rescheduling. Plus canceling at this late date may make the firm look flaky. Not exactly the image we want when we\u2019re raising money for charity. It\u2019s not going to help you, either. Let\u2019s move forward and make it work. If there\u2019s a problem, I\u2019ll take responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you hired me, right?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cIf something goes wrong, the responsibility is mine, Zach. I\u2019m the one who agreed to plan the party. While it\u2019s not my fault the entire kitchen staff is sick, the buck stops with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He figured they could argue that point if it became a problem.</p><p>\u201cI have every confidence in you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, although the sound was more strangled than humorous. \u201cHow are you in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fast learner.\u201d He flipped through his calendar. \u201cI\u2019m in court most of today, but I\u2019ll clear tomorrow. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you can give me would be great.\u201d</p><p>When this was over, they were going to have to lock her up in a nuthouse, Katie thought later that afternoon. Or she would have a heart attack, right there in the middle of the kitchen.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t think her heart had stopped pounding since she\u2019d received Jerome\u2019s phone call earlier. There were fourteen thousand details to take care of, not the least of which was the reality of getting a kitchen staff in place in time to prepare the food for the dinner tomorrow.</p><p>Her cell phone rang again.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, automatically reaching for the pad of paper she kept with her at all times.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerome!\u201d The man sounded as if he\u2019d spent most of the day barfing his guts up...which he probably had. \u201cTell me you\u2019ve got news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a grill chef for you. Madison. Just Madison. No last name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike Madonna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. She\u2019s great, and she owes me.\u201d He gave her a number. \u201cIf she gives you any trouble, just tell her I said to mention Barbados.\u201d</p><p>Katie scribbled it all down. Great. Code words. She was beginning to feel as if she were living in a very bad spy movie. All she would need next was a herd of elephants trampling through the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve checked the inventory, like you said. Everything is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get people cutting up the meat and vegetables. It takes time. Then prepare the marinade. Beef in tonight. Chicken in tomorrow. Shrimp goes in an hour before cooking. The vegetables have their own marinade schedule.\u201d</p><p>She dutifully wrote down everything he said. As the conversation progressed, his voice got weaker and weaker. Finally she took pity on him.</p><p>\u201cThis is enough for now,\u201d she said. \u201cGive me a couple of hours and I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll have to talk about the chocolate next. You can\u2019t just throw it in a pot over an open flame and expect it to be wonderful. I had plans for the chocolate.\u201d There was a gagging sound. \u201cI have to go throw up.\u201d</p> <p>The phone disconnected before she could say anything.</p><p>Katie tried not to think about Jerome\u2019s afternoon activities. As she organized her notes, her phone rang again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your favorite florist,\u201d a voice said cheerily. \u201cThe roses were tr\u00e9s ugly, so I want to make some changes. Same cost, but you\u2019ll have to approve things. I\u2019m sending a sample over right now. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, the events manager walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve set the first table. Want to take a look, Katie?\u201d</p><p>She motioned for him to give her a second, then finished her phone call. A quick glance at her watch told her that the booths were being set up and that she\u2019d promised to stop by and check on that. There were also the last-minute prizes to be picked up.</p><p>She already had her staff running in forty-seven directions. Taking on the party was one thing, but filling in for the kitchen staff\u2014especially Jerome, who coordinated everything about the food\u2014was another.</p><p>\u201cI need a signature for the liquor delivery,\u201d a voice called from the doorway.</p><p>Katie looked at the uniformed man. \u201cDid anyone go over the inventory with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Were they supposed to?\u201d</p><p>She had an overwhelming urge to start pulling out her hair. Instead she said, \u201cYes. Give me two minutes. I\u2019ll be there to go over it with you.\u201d Then she looked at her cell phone.</p><p>She was out of options and out of time. Under normal circumstances, she wouldn\u2019t think twice. But she\u2019d been disowned from the family, and to the best of her knowledge, no one was speaking to her.</p><p>Still, she punched the buttons on her cell phone and listened to the ringing.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m in trouble and I really need help.\u201d</p><p>Zach arrived at the hotel shortly after six the morning of the fund-raiser. He\u2019d tried to get Katie several times the previous evening, but she hadn\u2019t been home. By the time he\u2019d realized she was staying at the hotel and that he should try her on her cell, it had been too late. If she was getting any sleep at all, he didn\u2019t want to wake her.</p><p>He headed for the front desk and got directions to the kitchen. He half expected to find the place deserted, but even before he pushed open the door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY he heard the pounding of loud music and the sound of voices.</p><p>He wandered into organized madness. Several people were slicing vegetables. A tall Amazon-like woman in a chef\u2019s hat dropped thousands of wooden skewers in a vat of water.</p><p>\u201cZach! Shouldn\u2019t you still be asleep?\u201d</p><p>He turned toward the voice and was amazed to see Grandma Tessa standing in front of a six-burner stove, stirring a giant pot.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone was speaking to Katie.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and shrugged. \u201cWe were angry, now we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Just like that? \u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie needed help. Now come say hello properly.\u201d</p><p>Still considering what she had said, he crossed to her, bracing himself for the hug, kiss, and cheek-pinch greeting she\u2019d turned into an art form. Grandma Tessa didn\u2019t disappoint.</p><p>As he rubbed the welt she\u2019d left on his skin, he leaned over to get a peek at what was in the pot.</p><p>\u201cRavioli,\u201d she announced, then waved at the rest of the kitchen. \u201cAll of this is fine, but when Katie told me what had happened, I knew I had to bring pasta. First I cook it in the water, then later, I fry it.\u201d She kissed the tips of her fingers. \u201cDelicioso.\u201d</p><p>He saw dozens of bags of frozen ravioli lined up on the counter behind her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just make this last night, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI keep it frozen, for company. There\u2019s marinara sauce, too. Sometimes we have a party.\u201d</p><p>There was probably enough ravioli to feed an army. \u201cSome party,\u201d he said. \u201cInvite me next time.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re family. You\u2019re always invited.\u201d</p><p>Family. Grandpa Lorenzo had been furious. The rest of them had stood with him. Was all that over because Katie had asked for help?</p><p>He continued to walk through the kitchen. The CD playing changed to an old Beatles album. After seeing Grandma Tessa, he wasn\u2019t surprised to find Grammy M and Brenna cutting up chocolate.</p><p>\u201cLike I need to be near something fattening,\u201d Brenna grumbled when she saw him. \u201cI wanted to work on the salad, but no.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cEveryone is speaking now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Grammy M nodded, but Brenna frowned.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI already apologized to Katie. Tricking Jeff was my own business. I shouldn\u2019t have dragged Francesca into it. Or Katie.\u201d</p><p>Zach thought about Katie\u2019s pain and tears. \u201cDid you tell her that? She was really upset.\u201d</p><p>Brenna raised her eyebrows. \u201cYes, I did. I\u2019ve apologized and we\u2019re fine now. Sisters fight and then we make up. Oh.\u201d She wiped her hands on a dishcloth, then pulled open several drawers until she found the one containing her purse. She dug around, then held up a small audiotape.</p><p>\u201cCatch,\u201d she said as she threw it to him. \u201cI know, you can\u2019t be party to anything illegal. So I\u2019m not telling you what\u2019s on that tape. Just keep it safe.\u201d</p><p>He pocketed the small reel. \u201cDid Francesca get what you needed?\u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded. \u201cThe good news is Jeff isn\u2019t coming after the winery anymore. That should make your job easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about easy\u2014I want to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy kind of guy.\u201d Brenna nodded in the direction of several giant refrigerators. \u201cThe general is over there.\u201d</p><p>Zach turned and saw Katie talking with some kitchen workers. Before he could get to her, he saw Colleen and Marco mixing up huge batches of marinade and Mia hovering over a jumbo container of rice.</p><p>He crossed to Mia. \u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d</p><p>The teenager yawned. \u201cActually I haven\u2019t been to bed. Once I got Katie\u2019s call, I couldn\u2019t sleep, so I just came over here.\u201d She stirred the pot. \u201cTwo thousand people eat a lot of rice.\u201d</p><p>He watched her add a cup of some kind of spice.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could cook.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI can\u2019t, but how hard could rice be, right? And Madison is helping me, even though she\u2019s a grill chef and thinks that cooking rice is way below her.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cShe only works with meat stuff. She told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>As Madison looked big enough and tough enough to take anyone in the room, Zach figured he wasn\u2019t going to argue with her.</p><p>\u201cSo the whole family\u2019s here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYup. Well, except for Grandpa Lorenzo. He\u2019s still crabby. And Francesca. Katie left a message for her, but she has yet to turn up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs David coming?\u201d</p><p>Mia poured another cup of spices into the simmering rice. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t call him. He\u2019s really busy with school and stuff.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound right, Zach thought. But before he could pursue the matter, Katie saw him and came over.</p><p>She wore jeans and a tank top that had an assortment of interesting stains. A scarf covered her hair, and there wasn\u2019t a speck of makeup on her face. She obviously hadn\u2019t slept or showered.</p><p>Funny, he thought as a strange twang bumped up against his heart. She\u2019d never looked more beautiful.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up so early?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to help.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved up in a weary smile. \u201cI\u2019m too desperate to turn you down. Do you want to cut up vegetables or get involved with the chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do veggies.\u201d</p><p>He took his place in the kitchen. Madison gave him a mean-looking knife and a few minutes of instruction on the proper way to cut up vegetables. He hadn\u2019t known there was a wrong way. While John Lennon serenaded them, he worked his way through enough onions to make a football team sob and then started in on eggplants. Amazingly, they were even more weird-looking on the inside.</p><p>Katie moved through the kitchen like a general inspecting troops. She stepped in when there was a problem and took continual calls on her cell phone. She never got frustrated, never snapped at anyone, never lost her cool. His admiration clicked up a couple of notches and his attraction...well, it had always been fairly high.</p><p>At eight-fifteen Dora arrived with breakfast for everyone. \u201cBagels, cream cheese, coffee, and fruit salad,\u201d she called as she walked into the kitchen followed by two of the clerks from the law firm. \u201cI figured you\u2019d all be so busy that you\u2019d forget to eat.\u201d</p><p>Grateful sighs competed with the music. Zach headed toward his secretary, but Katie beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver,\u201d she said, taking a bag of bagels and passing it around. \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by food and there\u2019s nothing for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could have had ravioli,\u201d Zach teased.</p><p>Katie swatted at him. \u201cThat\u2019s for tonight. Don\u2019t you know all the best parties have grilled delicacies and pasta?\u201d</p><p>There was a faint edge of panic to her voice. Zach moved close and put his arm around her. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d he breathed in her ear. \u201cThe party will go off without a hitch. Just keep telling yourself that by this time tomorrow, it will all be over.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before she could respond, the main kitchen doors opened again. A tall, overweight dark-haired woman entered. She carried a small paper bag, which she waved around.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t check for messages. Sorry, Katie. But I brought my garnish knives. What do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>The CD player chose that moment to switch to a different disk, so the kitchen went silent. Everyone stared at the intruder.</p> <p>The woman stared back.</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I was already dressed for an experiment when I played my messages.\u201d</p><p>Katie gasped. \u201cFrancesca?\u201d</p><p>Zach stared. Francesca? Katie\u2019s sister? Katie\u2019s pretty, skinny sister?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fat suit,\u201d Brenna said, coming up and grabbing a bagel. \u201cShe can unzip the extra fat. Doesn\u2019t that just make you want to slap her?\u201d</p> <p>Francesca ignored her. \u201cI\u2019m here to do garnishes.\u201d</p><p>Katie shook her head. \u201cOkay. Great. I don\u2019t care what you look like. You\u2019re a lifesaver. We need as many garnishes as you can make. Let me get you a workstation.\u201d</p><p>Zach watched them walk away. Francesca?</p><p>Brenna leaned close. \u201cShe took this garnish-making class. Frankly, I think she\u2019s taken every craft class known to mankind. I mean, the woman can tat lace.\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t know what that was, but then, he didn\u2019t want to. He stared at her unflattering slacks and shirt, and the brunette wig that should have been tossed a couple of years ago, then remembered Francesca showing up covered in tattoos. Why would a normal person do things like that?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with her,\u201d Zach said before he could stop himself.</p> <p>Brenna handed him a bagel. \u201cYou know\u2014I\u2019ve been thinking that same thing for years.\u201d</p><p>The first guests arrived shortly before seven. Katie had already spent the previous hour touring the gardens and ballrooms and seeing to final preparations. The serving staff had shown up promptly at four, and the musicians had followed at five-thirty. Now several small combos played in different corners and alcoves, while uniformed servers offered champagne, appetizers, and explained the evening\u2019s menu.</p><p>Despite her need to check everything one last time, Katie had abandoned her clipboard and briefcase. Instead she kept a mental list, ticking off twinkle lights, the floral arrangements, and individual grills being fired up.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, this was all going to work out. For the first time since nine yesterday morning, she allowed herself to relax a little.</p><p>She heard a footstep on the stone path, but before she could turn, someone lightly cupped her bare upper arms and planted a kiss on the back of her neck.</p><p>Shivers danced down her spine. She smiled as Zach slipped an arm around her and drew her close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking all over for you,\u201d he said, giving her a quick once-over. \u201cFor someone who is supposed to be my date, you\u2019ve been avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I told you I had to work.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cAnd I told you I like to watch.\u201d He winked. \u201cBut that\u2019s for later.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back and looked her over. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. Not that I\u2019m surprised. You do the transition from \u2018upwardly-mobile professional\u2019 to \u2018stunning\u2019 very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She eyed his tailored black tux. \u201cYou look very nice yourself. Traditional, yet elegant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>She allowed herself to lean against him for a couple of seconds. Weariness dogged her, but she refused to give in. Not until the party was over. Then she could collapse for a few days and attempt to figure out how she\u2019d made it all come together. Assuming it did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just come from the front of the hotel,\u201d he said, drawing her toward one of the bars set up under a large tree. \u201cThere are limos lined up around the block.\u201d</p><p>She touched a hand to her stomach. \u201cI know that\u2019s really good, but it doesn\u2019t help me not be nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great. No one ever needs to know there was any kind of a glitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d She ordered a glass of club soda. \u201cThis is when I tell you that Grandma Tessa insisted on serving her fried ravioli. She didn\u2019t want to trust it to anyone else. Even as we speak she\u2019s holding court in one of the tents. Now, if that doesn\u2019t make you quiver with fear, you\u2019re far stronger than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>He led her toward the main ballroom. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d she told him. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about it.\u201d</p><p>They chatted for a few minutes before Zach saw some clients he needed to speak to. Katie excused herself so she could check on the details.</p><p>As she headed for the kitchen, she caught sight of herself in one of the ballroom mirrors. Her sleeveless black dress was dressy enough to allow her to fit in, yet not so fancy that she stood out. With the help of seventeen bobby pins and enough hairspray to lacquer a battle cruiser, she\u2019d managed to secure her hair in an upswept style that looked elegant and stayed out of the way. She had applied two layers of concealer to hide the dark circles that came from not having slept in over thirty-six hours.</p><p>Across the room she spotted her parents chatting with a TV sitcom star and his wife. Somewhere in the growing crowd Francesca was probably breaking hearts (assuming she\u2019d chosen to dress like herself for once) and Brenna would be tasting the wine Katie had ordered. While Zach had extended an invitation to her entire family, she\u2019d given them strict orders to stay out of the upscale party. No fishing for diamond bracelets.</p><p>In the kitchen she found controlled chaos. Rolling carts filled with trays were moved into position. As she watched, members of the serving staff lined up to take them to the various grilling stations. Mia was already manning one of the dessert tents, where she would no doubt charm everyone into dipping with a smile.</p><p>She crossed her fingers and gave a little prayer that somehow disaster had been averted.</p><p>Three hours later the party seemed to be doing well. Katie cruised through the smaller ballroom and watched CEOs and multimillionaires bob for baubles or try a ring-toss for the chance at a ski trip. She calculated how many prizes were left, then figured there would be enough for an impromptu auction later.</p><p>Zach caught up with her by the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to mention the fact that while her shoes were stylish, they hadn\u2019t been designed for anything close to comfort. After tonight she would probably walk with a limp for the rest of her life, but at least she knew her ankles looked slender.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you have to see,\u201d he said, taking her arm and leading her out into the garden.</p><p>\u201cShould I be nervous?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>He led her toward the bright blue tent illuminated by several spotlights. Her heart sank. \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>Zach laughed. \u201cBeing wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Katie appreciated the kind words, but she wasn\u2019t convinced. Sure enough as they entered the tent, she heard Grandma Tessa demanding,</p><p>\u201cSo, young man, what do you do for a living?\u201d</p><p>The \u201cyoung man\u201d in question had to be pushing fifty and wore a suit that cost close to the GNP of Nebraska. Katie winced.</p><p>Her wince turned into a moan when the \u201cyoung man\u201d answered, \u201cI run a movie studio.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa\u2019s gaze narrowed. Katie braced herself to perform some kind of intervention when her grandmother went off on a tirade on R-rated movies with too much sex and bad language.</p><p>Instead she leaned across the counter and smiled. \u201cSo tell me. Why aren\u2019t there any stars like Sophia Loren anymore? She is such a beauty, even now. These kids today\u2014they\u2019re nothing like her.\u201d</p><p>The studio executive slid onto a stool in front of the counter and nodded earnestly. \u201cI agree. The stars from the old days had something really special.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa used a pair of tongs to slide several fried raviolis onto a plate, then scooped up marinara sauce into a small bowl. She handed the man both.</p><p>\u201cI remember the first time I saw her in a movie. Or Cary Grant. He was really something. Not Italian, of course, but still a very nice-looking man.\u201d</p><p>Zach drew Katie back out of the tent. \u201cShe\u2019s been doing that all night,\u201d he murmured in her ear. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the guests are part of the cleaning staff or billionaires. She has something to say and they love her. It gets better over here.\u201d</p><p>They walked toward one of the dessert tents. Katie had nearly relaxed when a very loud, very drunk-sounding chorus of \u201cIrish Rover\u201d drifted through the night. She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cGrammy M\u2019s been serving whiskey, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d she asked in a whisper, already knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cFor at least the last hour.\u201d Zach grinned. \u201cEveryone\u2019s plastered. They\u2019re having a terrific time.\u201d</p><p>Before she could figure out what she wanted to do, Zach led her away. \u201cThere\u2019s someone who wants to meet you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can take any more.\u201d</p><p>Which was true. The combination of no sleep and tremendous stress was catching up with her. Even as they walked down one of the twinkle-light-lit paths, she could feel her brain dissolving.</p><p>\u201cJust over here,\u201d he said.</p><p>They entered one of the private spaces created by trimmed hedges and trees. Several couples sat around a large table. When Zach and Katie appeared, a man stood, then turned to help his very pregnant wife to her feet.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d the woman said as she waddled over. \u201cYou must be Katie. I\u2019m Sara.\u201d She patted her stomach. \u201cAs you can tell, I wasn\u2019t faking the whole baby thing to get out of doing the work.\u201d</p><p>Katie may have murmured a greeting, but she couldn\u2019t remember exactly what. The woman looked pregnant enough to be having an entire basketball team. Were there really only two babies in there?</p><p>John shook her head. \u201cWonderful job,\u201d he said. \u201cSimply wonderful. We\u2019ve heard nothing but compliments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Sara said. \u201cI loved all the grilled food and that fried ravioli. I don\u2019t want to think about the calories, but you must get me the recipe. It was divine.\u201d</p><p>She nodded at her husband, who led Zach away. Sara slipped her arm through Katie\u2019s and drew her close. \u201cI was wondering,\u201d she said confidentially. \u201cDo you arrange smaller events? John and I would like to host a couple\u2019s shower for the babies, and I would very much like you to plan it.\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>T he last guest left shortly before two, and the staff had cleared out by two forty-five. Katie sat at a table by the kitchen door and punched numbers into her calculator. The problem was she was almost too tired to see the answer. She squinted, then scribbled down a number.</p><p>It looked way too large, so she did the math again. The results didn\u2019t change. If her weary eyes were reading things correctly, the fund-raiser had exceeded expectation by more than thirty percent.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said, exhausted but pleased. She had a feeling that the auction for the extra prizes might have been what pushed them over the edge. Well, the auction taking place after Grammy M did her best to get everyone drunk hadn\u2019t hurt, either.</p><p>To cap off the evening, she had fourteen business cards in her small but tasteful satin clutch. She\u2019d been asked about planning everything from a wedding to a restaurant grand opening. Organization Central had arrived in the big league.</p><p>She allowed herself a brief fantasy about a larger staff, new quarters, and an on-site day-care center when she realized her feet didn\u2019t just hurt, they throbbed. She shifted so she could ease off her shoes. Unfortunately the pain didn\u2019t go away, which wasn\u2019t a surprise. What she needed was to get to her car and drive home. Once there she could collapse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, that meant actually walking out of the hotel, not something she wanted to do. But before she could whip herself into a frenzy and try to move, Zach stepped into the ballroom and headed toward her.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever plan on leaving?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Right now.\u201d She handed him the paper with her scrawled figures. \u201cIf I can still add correctly, the fund-raiser was a success.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI already know it was. Come on.\u201d</p><p>He collected her papers, her shoes, and her purse, then pulled her to her feet. She winced and they headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too tired to drive,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take you home. We\u2019ll deal with getting your car tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured, because it was too much trouble to argue. \u201cIt was really nice of the hotel manager to put up my family for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to regret it. Last I saw, he and Granny M were drinking in the bar. I suspect come morning, he\u2019s going to wish he was dead, while Grammy M will chuckle all the way home.\u201d</p> <p>Katie smiled at the visual. \u201cI do have a great family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cThey came through for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you surprised?\u201d</p><p>She thought about the phone call she\u2019d made and that her mother hadn\u2019t hesitated. \u201cWhen I was dialing the number, I would have told you I was terrified. But the second I heard my mother\u2019s voice, I knew she\u2019d do anything she could. They\u2019re my family.\u201d She glanced at Zach. \u201cLike you and David are family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly yours is louder.\u201d</p> <p>They made it to the front of the hotel, where the valet had Zach\u2019s car waiting. Katie climbed inside, secured the seat belt, then curled up in the seat and rested her head against the window.</p><p>\u201cI think the party was really good,\u201d she said sleepily. \u201cI did a good job.\u201d</p><p>Zach laughed as he started the car. \u201cI agree. I\u2019m happy to write you any recommendation you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019d never done a job that big before. I was a little scared, but then I got the hang of it. But when Jerome called me, I thought I was going to die. I could see my whole career going up in flames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if they continued talking, nor could she remember what was said if they had. One minute they\u2019d been pulling out of the hotel; the next they were turning into her driveway.</p><p>Before she could open her door herself (when exactly had door handles gotten so tricky?), Zach came around and helped her out. But instead of letting her walk to the front door, he picked her up and carried her.</p> <p>The combination of floating and sleepiness made her head spin. Katie wrapped her arms around his neck and breathed in the scent of him. The man was clever enough to have fished her key out of her purse, because the door opened without her having to do anything.</p><p>She smiled to herself. She liked that Zach was clever. She liked many things about him. She\u2014</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said as he bumped the front door closed with his hip, then slowly lowered her to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I\u2019m clever.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually say all that aloud, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what all you were thinking, but you mentioned that I was clever and that you like that...along with other things. Care to talk about specifics?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cNot even for money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I like it when you compliment me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re the center of your own universe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Yet another of my charming features.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming? You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou adore me.\u201d</p><p>She was saved from having to respond by his kiss. A good thing, because she did adore him. How could she not?</p><p>He\u2019d turned out to be a whole lot more than just a pretty face. He wasn\u2019t just smart, successful, and a great father. He was also warm and caring. Under that cool sharkskin beat the heart of a genuine nice guy, although Zach would be furious if he knew she thought that.</p><p>Whatever else happened, she would always remember how he\u2019d stood up to her family for her, how he\u2019d been there afterward. How he\u2019d cared about her.</p><p>The kiss deepened and all rational thought fled. Her exhaustion faded, as if it had never been, leaving behind only growing desire. She curled her fingers against his head, feeling the cool silk of his hair. Their heartbeats seemed to be pounding in a rhythm of sensual desire. Her breasts swelled, and between her legs she felt the telltale ache of liquid need.</p><p>All this and he hadn\u2019t even made it to first base. She had a feeling that if the man did something wild like touch her bare skin, she might actually start to unravel.</p><p>\u201cKatie,\u201d he murmured, then licked her lower lip.</p><p>He eased lower, nibbling his way to her jawline, then moving toward her ear. He licked the sensitive flesh under her lobe, which made her cling hard and forget how to breathe.</p><p>He traced the outside of her ear, which both tickled and delighted, then returned to her mouth, where he entered without warning. He claimed her with deep, passionate kisses that empowered her into responding in kind. She circled his tongue with hers and followed his retreat to claim him.</p><p>Somewhere along the way she remembered to breathe again, because when he broke the kiss, she found herself panting.</p><p>Tension filled her. Every place they pressed together made her want more. She felt the hardness of his erection and longed to slip her hand between them so she could touch him. She wanted to be naked, in bed, making love. She wanted the night to never end.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, cupping her face in his hands and staring at her with his deep, dark blue eyes. \u201cThis is where I stop so you can tell me you\u2019re too tired?\u201d</p><p>She kept her gaze on him. \u201cI\u2019m not wearing any underwear.\u201d</p><p>Instantly his pupils dilated and his breath caught in his throat.</p><p>\u201cJust checking,\u201d she said casually, pulling free of his embrace and heading for her bedroom. \u201cActually I am wearing underwear, but I trust you\u2019ll know what to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Katie rolled over and blinked at the clock. Her eyes focused, but her brain was a little more reluctant to believe. One-thirty?</p><p>She glanced at the window, only to see bright sunshine. She\u2019d slept until one-thirty in the afternoon?</p><p>She flopped on her back and stared at the ceiling. Considering she didn\u2019t get to sleep until close to three, she was actually still pretty tired. But in a good way. In a talk-about-a-couple-of-hours-of-incredible-lovemaking kind of way.</p><p>A smile tugged on her mouth. She turned over and placed her hand on the empty side of the bed, where Zach had been. His body heat had long since faded from the sheets, but his scent lingered. She glanced at his pillow and saw a piece of paper there. She grabbed it and quickly read.</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous. You needed the rest, so I didn\u2019t want to wake you when I snuck out this morning. Call me at the office when you wake up. Thanks for last night. I\u2019m going to have a hell of a time concentrating today. Instead of clients, I\u2019ll be thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, contentment filling her. Back when she\u2019d first met Zach, she\u2019d thought he was a player. A heartless, egocentric, all-around slimy guy. She couldn\u2019t have been more wrong about him.</p><p>He was everything she\u2019d ever wanted. He was\u2014</p><p>Katie sat up and gasped. Everything she\u2019d ever wanted? As in...as in...She flopped back on the bed and pulled the covers up over her head. No way. She could not possibly have fallen in love with Zach. It was impossible. It was crazy.</p><p>She was the closet romantic who had once kissed a frog in the hopes of attracting a prince on a white horse. She still had the very first Valentine she\u2019d ever received from a boy. She was hearts and flowers and Zach was anything but.</p><p>Except when her entire family had turned their collective back on her, he\u2019d been there for her. She might not agree with his tactics, but he was determined to keep his son from making what he saw as a mistake. He was ruthless, yes, but also giving and kind and holy shit, she had it bad.</p><p>All these years of waiting for \u201cthe one.\u201d The right guy. The man who made her hear bells. Last night she\u2019d heard at least a tinkle or two.</p><p>Katie pushed down the covers and studied the note. She had to call him and she certainly wasn\u2019t going to say anything. What was there to say? \u201cHi Zach. Last night was great, by the way, I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d Yeah, right. Hardly a well-conceived plan.</p><p>She would say nothing, she told herself. She would act completely normal and keep her personal information to herself.</p><p>She supposed a case could be made for telling him the truth and giving him the chance to respond in kind. That was probably really mature. Except she wasn\u2019t feeling especially grown-up and strong right now.</p><p>Four months ago she would have said that Zach Stryker had the emotional attention span of a gnat, that he wasn\u2019t interested in anyone but himself, and that she would never fall for a guy like him. She\u2019d been wrong on every count. But was she wrong about him wanting what she wanted? Could the cynical divorce lawyer ever find a way to believe in happily-ever-after, marriage, and kids? Was she more to him than just a flavor of the week, or would he walk away from her the way he\u2019d walked away from everyone else?</p><p>Too many questions, she thought, and not an answer in sight.</p><p>After sitting up, she pulled on her robe and glanced back at his note. She rubbed her finger over his signature, then reached for the phone.</p><p>Dora picked up on the first ring. \u201cZach Stryker\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Dora. It\u2019s Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi! How are you doing? You won\u2019t believe what\u2019s happening here. The phones are going crazy. Everybody\u2019s calling. They loved the party and the food and your grandmothers. In Style magazine wants to get the ravioli recipe for a spread they\u2019re doing. The partners are thrilled about the proceeds, and I\u2019ve been fielding calls from dozens of people who are trying to get in touch with you so you can plan their next event.\u201d</p><p>Katie\u2019s head spun. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better start. I think you\u2019re going to need a bigger staff. So, is working for an event planner more interesting than working for a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>Katie laughed. \u201cZach would kill me if I stole you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust between you and me, I wouldn\u2019t leave, but I may hint a bit. Just to keep him humble.\u201d Dora chuckled. \u201cSpeaking of His Nibs, he\u2019s waiting for your call. I\u2019ll put you through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>There was a click, then Zach came on the phone.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re finally up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. I\u2019m awake, but still tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take you a couple of days to get back to normal.\u201d His voice lowered a little. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She smiled. \u201cGreat. I got your note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to just head out without saying something, but I hated to wake you. We have that history of running out on each other after sex. Oh, wait. Only you did that.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThanks for the reminder. So you\u2019re not a forgive-and-forget kind of guy. That surprises me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgive, but I don\u2019t forget until I\u2019ve gotten all the mileage I can out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResourceful? I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible was more what I was thinking. How\u2019s work?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI have no idea. I should have stayed in bed with you. I\u2019m not getting anything done.\u201d</p><p>His confession made her feel all shivery inside. \u201cReally?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely. You\u2019re a distraction.\u201d</p><p>The same could be said about him. Katie\u2019s body still hummed with pleasure, even several hours after the lovemaking. Zach had done things to her and with her that had left her feeling more like his sexual slave than a bed partner.</p><p>\u201cInstead of trying to function on zero sleep, I gave myself and my staff the day off,\u201d she said. \u201cAs this is my first free weekend in weeks, I\u2019m heading up to the hacienda this afternoon. We\u2019re having a beading fest. Want to come along? You don\u2019t have to actually bead if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou read my mind,\u201d he teased. \u201cNot about the beading, but about the weekend. I have an official invitation for David and myself. We\u2019re coming up first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I look forward to seeing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. And if you look out front, you\u2019ll find your car waiting there. The keys are under the mat by your front door.\u201d</p><p>She clutched the phone more tightly as her heart gave a little ping of pleasure. \u201cYou went to all that trouble for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I took the keys when I left this morning and had it delivered. Hey, this is L.A. You can\u2019t not have wheels.\u201d</p> <p>Katie sighed. Zach might not have a white stallion, but he was still pretty decent prince material.</p><p>\u201cI need to let you get back to work,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure. I can read this file for the third time and see if my powers of concentration have returned, now that I\u2019ve heard your voice. And Katie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night was really special for me.\u201d</p><p>Oddly enough, her eyes began to burn. \u201cFor me, too. Not just making love, but the way you looked out for me. It meant a lot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to take care of you. Scary, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>David overslept the following morning, which wasn\u2019t unusual but, for the first time in years, annoyed Zach. He sat on his son\u2019s too-small bed in the dorm room he shared with another freshman and waited while David had his twenty-minute shower. Finally he was ready, with his overnight bag and a backpack full of textbooks.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of homework,\u201d David grumbled as he slid into the front seat of Zach\u2019s BMW. \u201cI have this project due next week and finals are in three weeks.\u201d</p><p>Zach pulled out of the parking lot. \u201cI\u2019m sure Mia has the same pressure. You can study together.\u201d</p><p>David didn\u2019t say anything. Instead he stared out the front window, looking sullen.</p><p>Zach frowned. \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t want to go up to the hacienda, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d He would be happy to return David to the dorm and continue on his own.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d David said, slumping down in his seat. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of stuff going on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>David shrugged, which could mean yes, no, or maybe.</p><p>\u201cIt is school?\u201d</p><p>Another shrug.</p><p>\u201cMia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>David spoke the right words, but his flat tone said otherwise. Was it the redhead? Were David and Mia fighting?</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason Mia didn\u2019t want to drive up with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left yesterday. After the fund-raiser.\u201d His son glanced at him. \u201cSo how did it go? Mia said something about everyone getting sick. Were they like throwing up on the dance floor?\u201d</p><p>Zach accepted the change of subject for now. When the kid was ready to talk, he would.</p><p>\u201cThe guests were fine,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead it was the kitchen staff barfing their guts out.\u201d</p><p>He explained the details.</p><p>David frowned. \u201cHow come no one called me to come help? I had some free time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Zach admitted. \u201cDoes Katie have your number? Maybe she thought Mia would let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything more. After a few minutes he leaned forward and clicked on the radio. He pushed the far left station-set button, which filled the car with loud country music. Zach grinned. He and his son were closet fans, although they would rather have their toenails pulled out than admit it.</p><p>A rowdy Montgomery Gentry song had them both singing along. When they merged onto the freeway, Zach opened the sunroof and David cranked up the stereo.</p><p>There weren\u2019t going to be many more times like this, Zach thought as they cruised north. David had his own life, his own interests. Soon he wouldn\u2019t come home on breaks. He would have his own life, and Zach would be by himself.</p><p>He\u2019d never much thought about life after David grew up. There\u2019d been too much day-to-day insanity to distract him. But now that time was fast approaching, and Zach\u2019s life wasn\u2019t looking as full as it had. He felt a longing for something more. Something...meaningful.</p><p>Zach snorted. Right, meaningful. That and a tofu taco would get him enlightenment.</p><p>He pushed the ridiculous whisper of restlessness away and concentrated on the drive.</p><p>The morning was warm and perfect. The kind of June weather that makes the blue sky look like a computer-enhanced image. He was careful to keep no more than seven miles above the speed limit because getting a ticket would only delay his arrival at the hacienda. Even so he found himself wanting to be there now.</p><p>He wanted to see the Grands and Colleen and Marco, and even Grandpa Lorenzo. He wanted to look at the vineyards and examine the changes from the last time he\u2019d been there. But mostly, he wanted to be with Katie.</p><p>He\u2019d been unable to get her out of his mind and he couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d been unable to forget a woman. He\u2019d had plenty of sex in the past few years, but nothing that...intimate. Being with her was different\u2014better. She made him laugh. She made him see possibilities and a future. Which should have sent him running for the hills. He was willing to admit it scared the crap out of him. But not enough to leave. So if he didn\u2019t walk, what was he going to do?</p><p>He and David arrived at the hacienda shortly before noon. When he pulled up next to the three-story house, Mia was waiting on the front porch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d she said as she danced down the steps to the car.</p><p>David climbed out. Zach waited for her to fly into his embrace, but instead they only stood staring at each other. In a way, their intensity made the moment seem more intimate than a kiss, and Zach turned away to give them privacy.</p><p>He went around to the trunk. David and Mia finished whatever silent Zen thing they\u2019d been doing and joined him.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is inside,\u201d she said. \u201cJust go on in. They\u2019re all talking about the fund-raiser and how much fun it was. Did Grammy M really get everyone drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone,\u201d Zach told her. \u201cA few escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed that,\u201d she said, then grabbed David\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d</p><p>David allowed himself to be led away, leaving Zach to mount the front steps by himself. The door stood open, so he entered and shut it behind him. Once inside, he put down the luggage, then followed the sound of voices to the living room.</p><p>All the women of the family sat together sewing. The Grands were there, and Colleen, Francesca (looking normal for once), and Katie. Only Brenna was missing. And Mia, who had gone off with David.</p><p>He saw the stack of completed flowers in bags by the coffee table and boxes of beads yet to be attached. Once, not so long ago, he\u2019d seen these women together just like this and had thought they were spiders out to snare his son. Now he realized he\u2019d been wrong. They weren\u2019t spiders and this wasn\u2019t a web. Instead each fine stitch assembled a part of a safety net.</p><p>Had this been another time, had David been older, more ready, more mature, Zach couldn\u2019t have asked for better in-laws. He would have considered him and his son incredibly lucky to be a part of this amazing family.</p><p>But David wasn\u2019t any of those things. As much as he loved his son, Zach saw his faults clearly. The marriage was destined for failure and most of the blame would be David\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d he said easily as he took a seat.</p><p>\u201cZach!\u201d The women greeted him. Katie gave him a quick smile, then ducked her head.</p><p>\u201cHow was the drive?\u201d Colleen asked. \u201cDid you bring David with you?\u201d</p><p>He sat in the chair and stretched out his legs in front of him. \u201cThe drive was fine. Yes, David is here. He and Mia went for a walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Grandma Tessa asked. \u201cWe\u2019re having lunch in a hour, but if you need a little something...\u201d</p><p>He reached over and patted her wrinkled hand. \u201cI can wait. I wouldn\u2019t want anything to spoil my appetite.\u201d</p><p>Francesca picked up Mia\u2019s half-finished lace flowers. \u201cWant to help?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSewing isn\u2019t really my thing. I practically destroyed a sewing machine when I took that quilting class. I keep telling Katie that I constantly prick my finger. I\u2019m getting blood all over the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get blood out a whole lot easier than I can bead everything myself,\u201d Katie retorted without missing a stitch.</p><p>\u201cSo is the dress about finished?\u201d he asked, not sure why he wanted to know.</p><p>Katie gave him a quick glance. \u201cDon\u2019t even bring it up. I\u2019m heading for panic mode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding invitations are due any day now,\u201d Colleen told Zach. \u201cI think Mia said we had your list of names. We\u2019ll be addressing them in the next week or so. In the old days they had to go out six weeks in advance, but now everyone says just a month is enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Brenna?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Grandma Tessa frowned. \u201cShe said she had to go to Santa Barbara, but didn\u2019t say for what. She\u2019ll be back in time for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Katie rose. \u201cIt\u2019s too beautiful to stay inside. I\u2019m going to follow Mia\u2019s lead and take Zach for a walk. We\u2019ll be back in an hour.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cIf that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been alone with her since Thursday night.</p><p>\u201cGreat idea,\u201d he said, coming to his feet.</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Colleen said, not taking her gaze from her beading.</p><p>When they were out on the porch, Zach pulled Katie close and lightly kissed her. She responded, holding on to him and sighing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cSame here. I missed you.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. Zach suddenly wanted to say more, although he didn\u2019t know what. He also wanted to take her upstairs and make love with her, which wasn\u2019t possible. Instead, he took her hand in his and started down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll start speculating about us right away or will they give us a head start?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes at the most,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m torn between going for the walk I promised you and sneaking back around to eavesdrop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling that would embarrass us both. Let\u2019s take that walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Have you seen the tasting room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go that way.\u201d</p><p>As they headed for a path that circled left around the house, Zach tried to figure out why he didn\u2019t mind that Katie\u2019s sister, mother, and grandmothers were talking about them. He generally didn\u2019t like people butting into his private life, but this time it was different. Not that he could say why. For now it was enough just to be with Katie on such a beautiful day.</p><p>They strolled past acres of vines, then turned again. A mile or so ahead he saw a beautiful two-story building, surrounded by impressive gardens. Dozens of cars were parked in front and on the side. Obviously the public part of Marcelli Wines.</p><p>\u201cWhy so quiet?\u201d he asked her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still a little tired,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd I have a lot on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re thinking about me?\u201d</p><p>She turned toward him and swatted his arm with her free hand. \u201cYou are not the center of the universe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the center of yours.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou and that ego. It\u2019s amazing you have room for anyone else in your life.\u201d</p><p>He bumped her shoulder with his. \u201cCome on. You\u2019re impressed by me. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cKatie, you\u2019re amazing at a lot of things, but you\u2019re a lousy liar. Besides, you\u2019ve had a thing for me since the second we met. Don\u2019t forget, you told your family I was hot.\u201d</p> <p>She stopped in the center of the path, pulled her hand free, and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cNumber one, I\u2019ve told you before\u2014I never used the word hot. Number two, you\u2019re not all that. Number three, the only reason I mentioned you at all to my family is that they were bugging me about not having a boyfriend. I pretended to be attracted to you so they would get off my back and I could have a pleasant weekend. The only flaw in the plan was you showing up ten minutes later.\u201d</p><p>She planted her hands on her hips and narrowed her gaze. \u201cIs any of this sinking in?\u201d</p><p>Temper flared from her brown eyes. Annoyance colored her cheeks. But under that was amusement and affection. He saw it in the way the corner of her mouth twitched slightly.</p><p>She was beautiful. Funny. Smart. A hell of a lover. A hell of a woman.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNope,\u201d he said as he put his arm around her. \u201cYou adore me. Now let\u2019s go to the tasting room and you can buy me a drink.\u201d</p> <p>20</p><p>\u201cT ry this,\u201d Katie said, pouring from another open bottle. \u201cIt\u2019s a table wine, which means it\u2019s a blend. We do a Cabernet Sauvignon\u2013Merlot blend, with a bit of Cab Franc thrown in for interest.\u201d</p><p>Zach sipped the wine she offered. \u201cI like it. I still like the straight Cabernet Sauvignon best, but this would be good for casual dining.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to tell my grandfather. Considering this little table wine for casual dining sells for about seventy-five dollars a bottle, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be thrilled with your assessment.\u201d</p><p>Zach winced. \u201cOkay. So I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him. \u201cThere is no wrong, just personal preference. Frankly, I\u2019m a white wine drinker, which is blasphemy in this family. When Brenna found out, she threatened to never speak to me again.\u201d</p><p>Katie smiled as she spoke and her light brown eyes glinted with humor. She wore her hair long and loose. She was so beautiful, he thought suddenly.</p><p>He crossed to a large set of arched glass doors. A well-manicured lawn stretched out for about sixty or seventy feet. At the far end two women were on step-ladders decorating a gazebo. White chairs had been set up in rows.</p> <p>\u201cA wedding?\u201d he asked as Katie came to stand next to him.</p><p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re scheduled all through the spring and summer. Upstairs there\u2019s a whole suite of rooms for the use of the wedding party. If the reception is held here, it has to be outside, but once we\u2019re into June weather isn\u2019t usually a problem.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cIt\u2019s a romantic setting.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhere are the family weddings held?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the private garden.\u201d She dropped her gaze.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what she was thinking, but he sensed her uneasiness. The topic of Mia and David\u2019s engagement was still a sensitive area of conversation. It was time to come to an understanding.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t get married,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cEven if Mia\u2019s ready, David isn\u2019t. Not by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>Katie sighed. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already mentally outlined his verbal strategy, but her quiet response caught him off guard.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re right. As much as I didn\u2019t want to believe you when you first told me about your concerns, I remembered them. I\u2019ve been watching Mia and David together. At the beginning they were happy, but something has changed. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve been fighting or if she found out about Julie or what. I guess the reason doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou agree with me?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIs that all you got out of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the most important part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach! We\u2019re talking about the future happiness of my sister and your son. Isn\u2019t that slightly more important than my agreeing with you?\u201d</p><p>He considered the question. \u201cIt\u2019s a close second. Come on.\u201d</p><p>He opened one of the glass doors and drew her outside.</p><p>She leaned against him. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we talk to Mia and David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. If David gets stubborn, he\u2019ll tune it all out. What about Mia?\u201d</p><p>Katie shrugged. \u201cShe hates to admit when she\u2019s made a mistake, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be willing to get married just to be right. I agree we should talk to them. If we\u2019re logical and rational\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so I\u2019ll be doing the talking,\u201d he said, cutting her off.</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cRemind me to toss you in a fermenting vat when we get back to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and what army?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be tough.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cSure you can, Katie. Tough and mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. So we have a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ll corner the unsuspecting couple and talk them into submission.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll go first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with this? Us tackling them together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Which surprised him. He\u2019d always done everything alone, especially with respect to his son. He had to admit that after eighteen years of being a single parent, it was nice to have someone to share things with.</p><p>\u201cSo what are the odds of me getting struck by lightning if I sneak into your room tonight?\u201d he asked as they headed back for the house.</p><p>Katie raised her eyebrows. \u201cGee, nearly all of my extended family will be under the same roof with us, including my very crabby grandfather. And let\u2019s not forget that I have two grandmothers who take a trip around the beads at the drop of a hat. Lightning is the least of your concerns.\u201d</p><p>He considered the embarrassment of getting caught\u2014literally with his pants down. \u201cGood point. I\u2019ll keep to my side of the house.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI figured you\u2019d say that. So I\u2019ll sneak into your room.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the house twenty minutes later to find the place in an uproar. Grandma Tessa was in tears, Colleen kept saying it would be fine, while Grammy M was pouring a drink. Mia huddled over someone sitting in a chair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brenna,\u201d Mia said, looking more amused than upset.</p><p>\u201cWas she in a car accident?\u201d Katie asked instantly. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cShe went to Santa Barbara to get her hair cut.\u201d</p><p>Zach waited for the rest of the story. Like in Santa Barbara she\u2019d been attacked or, at the very least, been caught up in a bank robbery, but there was no more information.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s it. She cut her hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Katie patted his arm. \u201cI know. Just try to fade into the woodwork. You\u2019ll never understand and trying to will just give you a migraine.\u201d She glanced at Mia. \u201cThey got over you streaking your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m the rebel. Brenna is about to be divorced. How is she supposed to catch a man if she has short hair?\u201d</p><p>Katie groaned and stepped toward her relatives. Zach felt as if he\u2019d stepped into an alternative universe. So Brenna had cut her hair? If no one liked it, wouldn\u2019t it just grow back?</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Brenna said, and stood up. Her long hair was gone. In its place was a short style that grazed her chin.</p><p>Zach studied her. She had a rounder face than her sisters, and bigger eyes. Somehow the layered cut flattered her features, making her look sexy.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d he said, before he could stop himself.</p><p>Katie and Mia looked at him with something like pity, but the Grands and Colleen turned on him instantly.</p><p>\u201cHer crowning glory is gone,\u201d Grandma Tessa said as she brushed away her tears.</p><p>Grammy M sighed and took a sip of her drink. \u201c\u2019Twas lovely hair.\u201d</p><p>Colleen simply muttered something about \u201cMen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Zach said, \u201cas a man I think it looks good on her.\u201d</p><p>Mia moved close. \u201cAnd you looked so bright, too,\u201d she whispered in his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was attractive before and she\u2019s still very attractive,\u201d he insisted, ignoring the sensation of falling into a pit where he would be trapped forever.</p><p>Brenna sighed. \u201cOkay, enough everyone. I agree with Zach. I like it. If I decide I don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll grow it out. In the meantime, my hairstyle is off limits. Does everyone understand?\u201d</p><p>Grammy M and Colleen nodded. Grandma Tessa sniffed.</p><p>Brenna muttered something under her breath, then grabbed his arm and drew him down the hall. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a private conversation with my lawyer,\u201d she yelled back. \u201cIt will take about ten minutes. That should be enough time for you to recover from the shock and finish getting lunch ready.\u201d</p><p>They entered the library and she slammed the door shut behind them.</p><p>\u201cFamily,\u201d she said with exasperation. \u201cSometimes I want to run away and never come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d he said, studying her. There was something different about Brenna today. Something that didn\u2019t have anything to do with her new haircut. An energy and a purpose.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she admitted, sinking down on one of the leather sofas. \u201cI love them all and would be lost without them. But every now and then they really get on my nerves.\u201d She fluffed her newly shorn hair. \u201cThis would be one of those times.\u201d</p><p>He settled on the other sofa. \u201cFair enough. So did you really want to talk to me about something or did you just need to escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have an actual thing. When you called to tell me that Jeff\u2019s lawyer had been in touch to formally withdraw the question of the winery inheritance, you told me to think about what I want from Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come up with a wish list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but little of it is legal. As I already pushed the limits of the law with the taping stunt, I\u2019m not going to try it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut getting Jeff on tape worked.\u201d</p><p>Brenna fluffed the ends of her hair and shrugged. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe backed off. Isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s just...\u201d She shrugged again. \u201cKatie was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancesca. I wanted her help and I\u2019m glad to have the tape, but listening to my husband saying he wanted to fuck her brains out didn\u2019t exactly make my day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you doing the talking. I know Francesca would never have anything to do with him, but it still makes me feel weird.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNone of which is your problem. My actual point for having this conversation is to tell you I don\u2019t have a wish list. All I want from Jeff is repayment for putting him through school. You showed me that chart before, remember?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe state has a schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s fine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI could probably get you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019ve been tacky enough for one divorce. Plus, if I\u2019m out for blood, that means I\u2019m still putting energy into our relationship. The whole situation makes me sad and angry and frustrated, but I want to move on. He doesn\u2019t matter anymore. I want to act like that\u2019s actually true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your call,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll do exactly what you say.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cNow see? If Jeff had acted more like that, our marriage might have worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go wishing for miracles. I\u2019m only agreeable because I work for you.\u201d</p><p>Her smile broadened. \u201cSo the secret is to pay someone to be my husband and then he\u2019ll do exactly what I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>After his meeting with Brenna, Zach stepped out of the library and found Katie waiting for him. They\u2019d agreed to try and corner Mia and David before lunch.</p> <p>\u201cThe Grands have already announced lunch is ready,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to do this after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you want what you want when you want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d He wanted to get the conversation over. He wanted to know that the engagement was off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lunch,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cHow long could it take? Besides, they\u2019re already engaged. What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have an answer for that, but something in his gut told him time was important. If he waited too long, the situation might be unrecoverable.</p> <p>She grabbed him by the arm. \u201cListen to me, Zach. Look into my eyes and listen very carefully. You have to wait. You can\u2019t take this on during lunch. Not with my family there. For one thing, the loud shrieks will be a distraction. For another, it will get very ugly. Remember what happened when I pissed them off? This is way more important and serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cSomehow I don\u2019t believe you. Do you promise you\u2019ll wait to talk to them privately?\u201d</p><p>He bent down and brushed her mouth with his. Brenna walked out of the library just in time to see.</p><p>\u201cGet a room,\u201d she told them with a grin.</p><p>Katie leaned against Zach. \u201cYou only need a room if there\u2019s tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYuck. Don\u2019t be talking about that sort of thing with me.\u201d Brenna shuddered. \u201cAt least not with Zach standing right there. How can I ask any really good questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d he said, walking toward the dining room. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to have this conversation behind my back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChicken,\u201d Brenna called after him.</p><p>Katie watched him go, then looked at her sister. \u201cYou doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I hesitate to actually admit this, but you were right about taping Jeff. Francesca got what we needed, but I feel weird about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You were trying to protect me, but would I listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee. If only you\u2019d let me run your life, things would go much smoother.\u201d</p><p>Brenna raised her eyebrows. \u201cBecause your life is so perfect?\u201d</p><p>Katie was surprised by the question. \u201cThings are going really well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say? So what\u2019s up with Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cWe\u2019re\u2014\u201d Deep breath, try again. \u201cThings are fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. So you have no idea where your relationship stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re too afraid to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! And you want to run my life. I think not.\u201d Brenna linked arms with her and steered her toward the kitchen. \u201cSo he\u2019s the one?\u201d</p><p>Katie wasn\u2019t ready to admit that. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBells?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA faint ringing sound.\u201d</p><p>Brenna squeezed her arm. \u201cSo long as it\u2019s not an alarm.\u201d</p><p>Lunch with the Marcelli family was a casual, intimate affair. There was less wine than at dinner, more pasta, and enough salad to make an entire colony of herbivores vibrate with ecstasy.</p><p>Zach found himself seated on Grandma Tessa\u2019s left and Colleen\u2019s right, with Katie across from him. While he wanted lunch to end so he could corner Mia and David, he couldn\u2019t complain about the view.</p><p>After the food had been passed around the table and the Grands determined that everyone had more than enough, conversation turned to the recent fund-raiser.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very proud of you, Katie,\u201d Marco told his daughter.</p><p>Katie smiled. \u201cThanks. Weeks of hard work and preparation laid low by a single fish. It\u2019s a little scary to think about. But the family came through for me.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa dismissed her statement with a wave of her hand. \u201cWe cooked a little, talked a little, you did the hard work.\u201d A sharp elbow jabbed his ribs. \u201cA smart, successful young woman.\u201d Grandma Tessa nodded knowingly. \u201cSurprising that no one has snapped her up.\u201d</p><p>Katie briefly closed her eyes and muttered something under her breath. Zach didn\u2019t doubt that the exact words would have Grandma Tessa reaching for her rosary. He held back a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt is surprising,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Katie opened her eyes and glared at him. He could read her thoughts\u2014she wanted to know what the hell he was doing, playing along with her grandmother.</p><p>He winked.</p><p>\u201cA man shouldn\u2019t be alone forever,\u201d Grandma Tessa told him. \u201cDavid is already in college. Your big house gets empty.\u201d</p><p>Zach raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019ve told them about my house?\u201d he asked Katie.</p><p>She opened her mouth, then closed it. The glare became lethal. \u201cNot a single word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve been spending so much time there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not!\u201d</p><p>He glanced around the table\u2014everyone was watching with interest. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, sounding as if he\u2019d just figured it all out. \u201cThey weren\u2019t supposed to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cMaking you squirm.\u201d</p><p>He enjoyed teasing her, ruffling her usually perfect self-control. He liked that he could push her buttons. He liked the direction the conversation was going. Hell. He liked her.</p><p>Something brushed against his leg. \u201cAre you trying to put your foot on my lap?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Katie jumped. \u201cI was trying to kick you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie, darlin\u2019, if you\u2019re tryin\u2019 to get Zach\u2019s attention, you should work on your aim,\u201d Grammy M said with a wink.</p><p>Katie nodded. \u201cMy grandmother thinks I should kick you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is with you two?\u201d Mia asked.</p><p>Brenna leaned toward her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so busy with your own happily-ever-after that you\u2019ve not been paying attention. Your future father-in-law has been making the moves on your sister.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cZach? Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Zach picked up his wine. \u201cGreat lunch.\u201d</p><p>The Grands grinned, Katie obviously still wanted to kill him, Grandpa Lorenzo was giving him the once-over, and David looked stunned. Apparently Mia wasn\u2019t the only one who hadn\u2019t noticed the sparks between Katie and himself.</p><p>Colleen took pity on them and asked Brenna about a particular vineyard. Grandpa Lorenzo announced his opinion on the subject. Marco spoke with his youngest. Zach watched Katie and realized that sometime when he hadn\u2019t been looking, he\u2019d started to care.</p><p>Not just about her, he thought as he glanced around the table. All of them. They weren\u2019t perfect, but they were good people. He relished the sense of belonging. They accepted him and welcomed him. It felt...good.</p><p>A faint knocking interrupted the conversation. Colleen excused herself and went to answer the door. She came back holding a large box.</p><p>\u201cThat was Milly from up at the office. These were delivered and she knew we\u2019d all been waiting.\u201d She smiled with delight. \u201cThe invitations. Marco, pass me a knife.\u201d</p><p>She set the box on a spare chair, then took the knife her husband offered and cut through the tape.</p><p>Zach glanced at Katie, who shook her head. He knew what she was trying to tell him\u2014not now. Not in front of the family.</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Colleen said as she pulled out a stack of embossed heavy card stock. \u201cSo lovely and elegant.\u201d</p><p>She handed an invitation to her husband, who passed it on to Grandma Tessa. Marco walked another one around to Mia. Rather than study the writing or the graphic, Zach watched Mia and David.</p><p>His son glanced at the invitation, then at Mia. His eyes darkened and his mouth pulled into a straight line. Mia\u2019s identical expression of suffering made Zach\u2019s gut clench.</p><p>Holy hell. He didn\u2019t have to break them up. They\u2019d already done it themselves.</p><p>Apparently he wasn\u2019t the only one watching them. Grammy M picked up an invitation.</p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong, darlin\u2019?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re lovely,\u201d Mia said, shifting in her seat.</p><p>\u201cWhy not tell them the truth,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>Mia looked at him. Her eyes widened. \u201cI d-don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do. It\u2019s time, Mia. The situation is only going to get more complicated. You want to have this conversation after three hundred of these have been mailed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach,\u201d Katie warned. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was right; he knew he should wait. But he couldn\u2019t. Not with both David and Mia looking miserable and trapped.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re old enough to get married, you\u2019re old enough to admit you\u2019ve changed your mind about getting married,\u201d he told them. \u201cGo ahead and tell the family you\u2019re not engaged anymore.\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>M ia ducked her head. David looked as if he wanted to crawl under the table. Grandpa Lorenzo\u2019s fist crashed down next to his plate.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d the old man demanded, his voice rising with every word.</p><p>\u201cMaking sure this is what David and Mia really want,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo\u2019s thick eyebrows drew together. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to break them up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to. They made the decision on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Colleen asked, staring at him incredulously.</p><p>Katie shook her head. \u201cI warned you,\u201d she murmured just before conversation exploded at the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Lorenzo demanded.</p><p>\u201cMia, what is this about?\u201d Marco asked at the same second.</p><p>\u201cWe should all calm down,\u201d Grandma Tessa urged.</p><p>\u201cCalm?\u201d Colleen echoed. \u201cThe invitations are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d Brenna asked.</p><p>\u201cThis is no time for shoutin\u2019,\u201d Grammy M warned.</p><p>Katie reached for her wine, while Zach watched the show.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want them to marry?\u201d Colleen asked him, then rose to her feet. \u201cZach, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Zach stood as well. \u201cI thought the engagement was a mistake from the beginning. Mia is David\u2019s first girlfriend. They\u2019re both too young to be settling down. David still has two years of college left. Mia wants to go to Georgetown.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the kids, who both looked miserable. Grandpa Lorenzo roared for everyone to be silent.</p><p>He stared at Zach. \u201cYou come into our family. We welcome you with open arms, but you\u2019re not what you seem. You\u2019re a traitor and a thief.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zach recognized the beginning of the tirade. He braced himself for a lot of bluster.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t dictate to me,\u201d he told the older man. \u201cI worry about my son as much as you worry about your family. Katie had it right before. You pick a side or an opinion and you expect everyone to embrace it, to put it on, no matter how ill-fitting it may be. You have no respect for personal differences. You want what you want, not what they want. If they agree with you, they\u2019re smart. If they don\u2019t, you badger them. That\u2019s not leading the family, that\u2019s being a bully.\u201d</p><p>A collective gasp shot from the family.</p> <p>Color flared on Grandpa Lorenzo\u2019s cheeks. He muttered something in Italian, then pushed himself to his feet. \u201cYou are not welcome here. You\u2019re a snake and we don\u2019t tolerate your kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the truth,\u201d Zach said. \u201cEveryone at this table can see David and Mia are miserable. But you don\u2019t care about that. Having more heirs is more important than your own granddaughter\u2019s happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a child. What does she know of what is right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s a child, Pop,\u201d Marco said, \u201cthen she\u2019s too young to be getting married.\u201d</p><p>Zach was surprised by the unexpected support.</p> <p>\u201cGet out!\u201d Lorenzo roared. \u201cBoth of you!\u201d</p><p>Marco shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s always your solution, isn\u2019t it? Get rid of the dissenters. Soon you\u2019ll be living here all by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Colleen gripped her husband\u2019s hand. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You can\u2019t talk to my dad that way,\u201d David said, coming to his feet. \u201cHe\u2019s right. You tell Mia and her sisters what to do, but you don\u2019t listen to what they want.\u201d</p><p>Mia clutched his arm. \u201cDavid\u2019s telling the truth, Grandpa. Why can\u2019t you see it?\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo ignored her and turned his attention to David and frowned. \u201cIf you defend your father, then you can go with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. I will.\u201d David looked across the table. He shrugged. \u201cBecause you\u2019re right, Dad. I\u2019m not ready to get married. Neither is Mia. We\u2019re not engaged anymore. We broke up yesterday. We just didn\u2019t want to tell anyone yet.\u201d</p><p>There was a second explosion of conversation. Zach ignored all of it. He looked at his son and nodded, proud that David had made a stand.</p><p>\u201cYou okay with that?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>\u201cBreaking up or making everybody mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re mad at me, not you.\u201d</p><p>David smiled ruefully. \u201cI think that just changed.\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t care about that. What was important to him was keeping David safe. That\u2019s all he\u2019d ever wanted. Now his son had a chance to grow up and find out what he wanted to do with his life, without the added responsibility of a family.</p><p>Katie looked at Mia. \u201cThat\u2019s why you didn\u2019t show up for your fitting. You were having second thoughts about the engagement. I figured you were mad at me about the house.\u201d</p> <p>Mia moved close and hugged her. \u201cNo way. I knew you just wanted me to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy?\u201d her grandfather asked. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not getting married?\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cGrandpa, you\u2019re going to have to get over it.\u201d</p><p>The older man glared at her.</p><p>Zach looked at them all. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said loudly, to be heard over the cacophony. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care for us?\u201d Lorenzo asked. \u201cYou care only for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d Katie said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going anywhere and no one is being thrown out of this family ever again.\u201d</p><p>Zach shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time. He\u2019s not going to change.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo pointed to her. \u201cYou\u2019re to have nothing to do with this man. Ever. He\u2019s not welcome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>Zach cut her off. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just leave,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSure I can. It will end the fight sooner.\u201d</p><p>He headed for the door.</p><p>Katie watched him go. Her heart tightened as he walked down the hall, then turned and was lost from view. She couldn\u2019t blame him for not wanting to be a part of this right now. He\u2019d never been one for families, and hers could try the patience of a saint. Walking away made sense. He\u2014</p><p>She caught her breath. He\u2019d left. That\u2019s what Zach did in his relationships, and he\u2019d just walked out on her.</p><p>He was gone. The thought repeated itself over and over again. She wanted to run after him, but shock rooted her in place.</p><p>She loved him and she\u2019d never told him. How could she blame him for treating her like any other woman when she\u2019d never told him how she felt?</p><p>Her grandfather turned on Mia. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? Once again, like your sisters, you disappoint me. I have no granddaughters.\u201d</p><p>That was the final straw for Katie. She threw her napkin on the table and stood. \u201cDammit, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>The Grands gasped and her grandfather nearly swelled with rage. But her parents moved next to her and nodded at her to continue.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and braced herself to face the storm. \u201cLeave Mia alone,\u201d she told her grandfather.</p><p>\u201cYou will not speak to me this way. I am in charge of this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe. And you know what, Grandpa? You\u2019ve done a lousy job. You\u2019re trying to get what you want, without considering what will make us happy. Can you honestly tell me that Mia marrying someone she doesn\u2019t love is your dream for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of my granddaughters should marry and produce babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why should we do that? Because it will make us fulfilled? No. Because it\u2019s what you want. If you want babies in this house so badly, go adopt them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Brenna said, coming to stand next to her sister.</p><p>He turned his attention on her. \u201cBe careful. Your place here isn\u2019t secure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Brenna asked. \u201cYou rule by fear, Grandpa, not by love. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>Katie took her sister\u2019s hand and squeezed it, then turned back to her grandfather.</p><p>\u201cYou should be proud of Mia. She\u2019s only eighteen years old, yet she\u2019s together enough to know what she does and doesn\u2019t want. She\u2019s also brave enough to stand up to everyone she loves and say no. Even though it will disappoint her family. I can\u2019t believe you would push her into something that is obviously wrong for her. You should celebrate her honesty, because she\u2019s telling the truth. And that\u2019s the one thing I could never do.\u201d</p><p>Katie hadn\u2019t meant to say that. Somehow the words had slipped out, and suddenly they took on a life of their own. The room went silent as everyone stared at her.</p><p>So here it was...after all these years. Her chance to come clean. How many times had she wondered if she would? One thing was sure\u2014she\u2019d never pictured it taking exactly this format.</p><p>She turned her attention to her parents. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quietly, trying not to think how much she was about to disappoint them with her confession. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to lie, but I didn\u2019t have the strength to tell you the truth.\u201d She sucked in a breath. \u201cGreg didn\u2019t break off our engagement all those years ago. I did.\u201d</p><p>Her mother gasped. Her father looked as if she\u2019d hit him. But Katie didn\u2019t retreat. This was her one chance to get it all said.</p><p>\u201cThe closer it got to the wedding, the more scared I got. I couldn\u2019t sleep or eat, I was having panic attacks, and I knew deep down inside that I didn\u2019t want to marry Greg. I couldn\u2019t imagine spending an entire week in his company, let alone a lifetime. But so many things had already been set in motion. The wedding was planned, the invitations had been sent out. I knew if I told you, you\u2019d try to convince me that it was just pre-wedding jitters.\u201d</p><p>She paused to brush her cheeks. It was only when she touched moisture that she realized she was crying. She didn\u2019t take her gaze from her parents.</p><p>\u201cSo I broke up with Greg without telling anyone. When he said he wanted to go into the military and left the next day, I used that to my advantage. I lied.\u201d</p><p>Her mother began to cry as well. \u201cKatie, we never wanted you to marry someone you didn\u2019t love. You could have told us the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t strong enough, and I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t love me if you knew what really happened. I didn\u2019t go to work in the winery. I didn\u2019t get married and have children. I felt like a failure. Mia\u2019s not like that. She\u2019s brave.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Mia was hugging her. Their parents joined them. Katie felt drained, but also strangely light. As if a burden she\u2019d been carrying around for years had suddenly fallen away.</p><p>\u201cWe love you,\u201d her father whispered. \u201cNo matter what, Katie. You have to know that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded because it was too difficult to speak.</p><p>He touched Mia\u2019s hair. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure about David, that\u2019s okay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all right with me,\u201d her grandfather said. \u201cYou\u2019re all crazy.\u201d</p><p>Marco straightened. \u201cYou know what, Pop? Get over it. You\u2019ve been ruling this family with an iron fist ever since your father died. I remember when I was little, I would hear you talking to Mama about him. How he controlled things. How he was a bully. You hated him as much as you loved him, yet you turned out exactly like him.\u201d</p><p>The room went silent. Katie raised her head and looked at her grandfather. He paled, then sat heavily in his seat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMy father was a hard, cruel man.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa reached for her husband\u2019s hand. \u201cLorenzo, you\u2019re a good father. A good husband.\u201d</p><p>In a matter of seconds he seemed to age twenty years. Katie\u2019s throat got tight as she watched his skin turn gray. His broad shoulders seemed to shrink.</p><p>\u201cYou all stand against me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cPop, it\u2019s not that dramatic,\u201d her father said.</p><p>Brenna sniffed. \u201cYeah, Grandpa. We all really love you, but sometimes you\u2019re a giant pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Brenna slapped her hand over her mouth. Katie sucked in a breath. Grandma Tessa reached for her rosary. Grandpa Lorenzo turned his attention to Brenna, and the life returned to his face in the form of blotchy red color.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cYou can be a real pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Katie braced herself for the tirade, but instead she heard an odd sound. Almost a choking. She blinked. Her grandfather\u2019s mouth was open. He was...laughing.</p><p>Laughing?</p><p>She and Brenna looked at each other, then at him.</p><p>\u201cPop?\u201d Marco asked cautiously.</p><p>Grandpa Lorenzo slapped the table. \u201cI wish I\u2019d told my father that,\u201d he said, still chuckling. \u201cFine. I\u2019m a pain in the ass, but I\u2019m still in charge of this family. You, Mia.\u201d</p><p>She jumped. \u201cYes, Grandpa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more engagements until you\u2019re sure. And maybe older.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie\u2019s right. It\u2019s time to stop throwing people out of the family.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few pleasures I have in my old age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a hobby.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and held open his arms. Brenna flew toward him and they embraced. Katie swallowed, knowing she would be next. She felt a little like Dorothy, about to face the great and all powerful Oz. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sure enough, her grandfather released Brenna and turned his attention on Katie. \u201cWhat have you to say for yourself?\u201d</p><p>Everyone else was being brave, so she supposed she would have to suck it up as well.</p><p>\u201cThat you better get over being mad at Zach because I\u2019m in love with him.\u201d</p> <p>It had been an hour for announcements and stunned silences, she thought as everyone stared at her.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s true.

That\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazingly nice guy you\u2019re thrilled to have in the family.\u201d</p><p>Katie gasped and spun around when she heard Zach\u2019s voice. He stood in the doorway to the dining room, casually leaning against the door frame. She couldn\u2019t believe it. Oh, God! How much had he heard?</p><p>Brenna recovered first and asked the question for her. \u201cHow long have you been standing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while. I got halfway to my car when I realized I didn\u2019t want to walk away. Not this time.\u201d He straightened and started toward Katie. \u201cYou stood up for me.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. He\u2019d heard everything? Even her declaration of her feelings? And he hadn\u2019t bolted for Montana?</p> <p>She was hopeful, embarrassed, excited, and terrified.</p><p>His blue eyes darkened with an emotion she couldn\u2019t read. \u201cYou told your whole family that you loved me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should have told me first?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lower lip. \u201cI was going to call you on your cell phone as soon as we were finished here.\u201d</p><p>He touched her cheek. \u201cI had this big plan when I met you, Katie Marcelli. I was going to use you for my own purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even subtle about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not subtle about many things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t what I expected.\u201d</p><p>She felt some of her confidence returning. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t cave to your demands? Because I stood up to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and because you tricked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you made me fall in love with you. I don\u2019t believe in relationships, remember? I don\u2019t believe in happily ever after or forever, or even the next morning.\u201d</p><p>Her throat got all tight, but in a good way. She started shaking. \u201cZach...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I believe in us. You and me.\u201d He smiled. \u201cDo you really hear bells when we\u2019re together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a knight on a white horse. I\u2019m a hard-assed lawyer. Cynical, stubborn, set in my ways.\u201d His expression softened. \u201cBut I love you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d</p><p>Katie threw herself at him. Zach caught her and pulled her close. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d she whispered, just before his lips claimed hers.</p><p>\u201cThis is romantic,\u201d Brenna said as she picked up one of the invitations. \u201cYou know, we could still use these. We could just scratch out David\u2019s and Mia\u2019s names and put in Zach\u2019s and Katie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Just then a tall, pregnant woman walked into the room. \u201cHi, everyone. What did I miss?\u201d</p><p>Brenna stared at her twin and shook her head. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Francesca held up her hands. \u201cWhat? I was working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not about your studies. This is a sickness. You need a twelve-step program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ignoring you.\u201d Francesca looked at Katie and Zach. \u201cThey\u2019re kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re getting married,\u201d Brenna said.</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s great. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad found out they\u2019d had sex and threatened Zach with a machete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d Francesca grabbed a couple of grapes from the fruit salad. \u201cKatie, I\u2019m really happy for you.\u201d</p><p>Katie, still lost in Zach\u2019s kiss, waved at her sister.</p><p>Brenna grinned at her twin. \u201cYou know what this means, don\u2019t you? Another dress to bead.\u201d</p><p>Francesca patted her stomach. \u201cNot in my delicate condition.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
