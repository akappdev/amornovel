When the blonde\u2014Lanae, or was it Renee?\u2014grabbed the brunette\u2019s head, trying to force her to take more of her nipple into her mouth, the brunette\u2014Leah, or was it Gia?\u2014smacked her ass.</p> <p>\u201cRhea,\u201d the blonde whimpered, \u201cthat hurt.\u201d</p><p>So the brunette was Rhea. Check.</p><p>Rhea fisted her hand in the blonde\u2019s mane, gaining her full attention. \u201cEvery time you touch me without permission, I\u2019ll stop what I\u2019m doing, Janae. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Ah, so that made the blonde Janae.</p><p>And people said he was bad with names.</p> <p>Janae\u2019s nod of assent earned her a reward from Rhea. A kiss. A deep, openmouthed kiss, with lots of glimpses of flashing pink tongues and feminine moans.</p><p>Damn. That was freakin\u2019 hot.</p><p>But not as hot as watching Rhea\u2019s hand gliding down the center of Janae\u2019s body.</p><p>Chase\u2019s dick stirred\u2014a happy surprise as he\u2019d already received the duo\u2019s oral worship. Talk about a tandem effort\u2014French kissing with the head of his cock between their warring tongues and lips. Then Janae jacked his shaft while Rhea\u2019s hungry mouth milked him to orgasm, but Rhea didn\u2019t swallow. He watched, panting and wide-eyed as Rhea kissed Janae, sharing his come with her.</p><p>Yeah, that\u2019d been something new for him. But not for them apparently.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been selfish,\u201d Janae cooed, adding a husky, \u201cyour turn.\u201d</p> <p>As he sank into a blissful place where embarrassing buck-off times were a bad memory, and two sets of soft, talented hands caressed him, he heard the door open and then slam into the wall.</p><p>\u201cChase? Honey? Are you okay? I\u2019ve been so worried...\u201d A gasp. Then another. Louder. More horrified and theatrical than the first. \u201cAnd to think I came here because...\u201d The length and pitch of her sobs escalated.</p><p>Fucking awesome.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name is going on here?\u201d boomed an outraged male voice.</p><p>Chase\u2019s impassive gaze zoomed from Sheree Bishop\u2014her triumphant eyes filled with crocodile tears\u2014to her father, Lou Bishop, then to Winnie, his PBR publicist, and Elroy, his PBR liaison.</p><p>Hail! Hail! The gang\u2019s all fucking here.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get a goddammed key to my room?\u201d Chase demanded.</p><p>\u201cSee, Daddy? He isn\u2019t even the least bit sorry for being caught red-handed with...\u201d Sheree gasped dramatically. \u201cAre there two of you?\u201d</p> <p>Janae waggled her fingers at Sheree as Rhea said, \u201cHey. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Chase might\u2019ve laughed if he wasn\u2019t so incensed.</p><p>Sheree burst into tears.</p><p>Lou Bishop patted his daughter\u2019s heaving back as she fell into a fit of hysterics. \u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors about you, McKay. And you\u2019ve outdone yourself this time.\u201d Lou glared at Elroy. \u201cThe PBR condones this behavior from riders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Elroy assured him, \u201cbut I think we all oughta take a deep breath and a big step back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, feel free to take a big step right the hell outta my room,\u201d Chase snapped.</p><p>Lou stabbed his sausage-shaped finger at Chase. \u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t knock you on your ass, punk, for your smart mouth and for what you\u2019ve done to my Sheree.\u201d</p><p>The absurdity of this situation was the only thing stopping Chase from leaping out of bed and laying Lou Bishop out cold.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, please,\u201d Sheree sniffled. \u201cLet\u2019s just go.\u201d In a calculated move that so perfectly defined the type of manipulation Sheree Bishop specialized in, she yanked a ring from her finger and threw it at him. \u201cYou can have this back, Chase McKay. We\u2019re done. For good.\u201d Wailing, she ran out, Winnie close on her heels.</p><p>Lou\u2019s fury pulsed through the room. Without taking his burning gaze away from Chase, he spoke to Elroy. \u201cI want this handled. Tonight. You know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d After aiming one more death glare at Chase, he lumbered after his daughter.</p><p>Trying to remain calm, Chase picked up the ring and slid it to the first knuckle of his pinkie finger.</p><p>\u201cMcKay.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at Elroy.</p><p>\u201cMeet me in the parking lot. After you put on some clothes.\u201d Elroy glared at the women who were hurriedly getting dressed. \u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>Chase let his head fall back against the cheap headboard after the door slammed. \u201cFuck.\u201d This was the last thing he\u2019d needed tonight. He never should\u2019ve gotten mixed up with Sheree Bishop.</p><p>Or maybe you shouldn\u2019t have comforted yourself about your disappointing buck-off time by instigating a threesome.</p><p>Probably true. But it pissed him off that Elroy and his publicist had just burst in on him, like he was some delinquent kid who needed constant supervision. What he did off the dirt was nobody\u2019s business but his. No matter who they were.</p><p>Chase slid his jeans up his naked flanks. Zipped, buttoned and buckled, he reached for his shirt. \u201cYou ladies goin\u2019 someplace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want us to go?\u201d Janae said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they did, but I sure as hell don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat woman wasn\u2019t your wife...or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d He jammed his feet in his boots without socks\u2014God he hated that\u2014and snagged his hat off the nightstand. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d they cooed in unison.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d He ran his fingertip up the inside of Rhea\u2019s left arm, mirroring the motion on Janae\u2019s right arm. \u201cI\u2019m sure you two can find interesting ways to entertain yourselves while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>Snagging a keycard from the dresser, he slipped into the humid night. The parking lot was nearly empty. He\u2019d chosen this motel for its off-the-beaten-path location, which made him wonder if Sheree had planted a tracking device in his truck. He wouldn\u2019t put it past the psychotic broad.</p><p>Chase stopped ten feet from where Elroy paced in front of a big semi emblazoned with the PBR merchandise logo.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. It\u2019s an extreme solution.\u201d Elroy gestured wildly. \u201cBecause sponsors shouldn\u2019t have that kind of power\u2014\u201d He hung his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t do it. I said I didn\u2019t agree that it needed to be done at all. Fine. Your call.\u201d He poked a button and let the phone dangle by his side.</p><p>Chase ambled across the asphalt. \u201cGetting your ass chewed by the big boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, McKay. Ya think?\u201d Elroy rubbed the skin between his eyebrows. \u201cI can\u2019t fix this for you. Lou Bishop is threatening to pull every penny of PBR sponsorship money if we don\u2019t take action against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of action?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLou wants you suspended from competition.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s blood boiled. \u201cI\u2019m getting suspended because Lou Bishop barged into my private room and didn\u2019t like that he\u2019d caught me in bed with two women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of the women in question was his daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the fuck what? I\u2019m not with Sheree.\u201d</p><p>Elroy cocked his head. \u201cDoes Sheree know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell kinda question is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFYI, McKay, Sheree\u2019s been blabbing to every bull riding mag and pro rodeo blog that you two are practically engaged.\u201d</p><p>He never read those magazines. It pissed him off that some \u201cexpert\u201d asshole gave commentary about how to improve a specific bull rider\u2019s riding percentage. Yeah, Chase had an idea how to improve too\u2014stay on the damn bull for the full eight seconds. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why\u2019d she throw the ring at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d He held up his pinkie. \u201cYou think I gave her this ring? I\u2019ve never given a woman a piece of jewelry in my life.\u201d Chase tossed the ring to the ground and pulverized the cheap piece of shit beneath his boot heel. \u201cBesides, no one believes her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father believes her. That\u2019s our biggest problem.\u201d</p><p>Chase froze. Our. Not his.</p><p>Elroy started pacing. \u201cI told you not to get mixed up with her, Chase. Told you not to take her to dinner. Told you not to encourage her. Told you whatever you do\u2014don\u2019t sleep with her. But did you listen? No. Women like Sheree get what they want. Period. For some reason, she set her sights on getting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince she can\u2019t have me, she causes a scene with Daddy as a witness to get me tossed off the tour.\u201d He hadn\u2019t a clue a total lunatic lurked beneath the surface of polished Sheree Bishop, former Miss Rodeo USA. Sheree was on the hunt for a husband\u2014a bull rider husband. His biggest mistake was ignoring her, believing she\u2019d switch her affections to another rider once she got wind of his extracurricular sexual activities. But Sheree\u2019s determination had only increased.</p><p>\u201cSo this incident, coupled with the one in Lubbock last week...\u201d</p><p>His thoughts rolled back to his last PBR performance. He\u2019d bucked off at two point four seconds and decided to drown his sorrows at a local honky-tonk. Some dumbass redneck made a remark about the superiority of Texas bull riders. Given Chase\u2019s shitty mood and four shots of Chivas, he let loose on Texas cowboys being soft, jeering they wouldn\u2019t last a single winter day in the real West. Then he added a crack about butt-ugly Texas longhorn cattle not being good for nothing but trophy heads. Two Texas guys took offense. They dragged him outside, puffed up with Lone Star pride, intent on teaching a Wyoming sheep fucker a lesson.</p><p>Chase beat the living shit out of them.</p><p>Three other guys jumped in the fray. When Chase got control of his rage, five men were moaning in the dirt, mopping blood from their bruised faces, and he was still standing. Wobbling a little, but still standing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until the cops tackled him, cuffed him and threatened to arrest him for assault. But ten minutes later they released him, because not a single man came forward to press charges. They all claimed to be too drunk to remember who\u2019d taken the first swing.</p><p>But the truth was no man wanted to admit that five-foot-seven-inch Chase McKay had taken on five Texas tough guys, all who topped the six foot mark...and won.</p><p>Luckily no one had uploaded streaming video to YouTube of PBR bad boy Chase McKay busting heads. But his ass smarted after Elroy ripped him a new one the following day.</p> <p>And it was more of the same tonight.</p><p>Elroy said, \u201cThis attitude isn\u2019t helping you. And we both know this situation has been building for a while, because you, my friend, like to fight and fuck. Not necessarily in that order.\u201d</p><p>Through the haze of anger, he demanded, \u201cHow\u2019d you guys get a key to my room anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheree told the manager you were despondent about your bad ride and she feared you\u2019d do something drastic like kill yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch thought of everything, didn\u2019t she?\u201d he muttered. \u201cI get why the big bosses would be upset by what happened in Lubbock. I screwed up. In public. But tonight? I was in my private room. If Sheree lies believably enough to break in there, why wouldn\u2019t Lou suspect she was lying when she told him we were practically engaged?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo clue. But it changes nothing.\u201d Elroy sighed. \u201cBottom line: you\u2019re off the tour.\u201d</p><p>Fury lit his insides and Chase got right in Elroy\u2019s face. \u201cThis is bullshit and you know it. I have fans. Those fans bring revenue to the PBR. And what do you plan to tell the blogs and trade mags about my abrupt disappearance? Because if this \u2018incident\u2019 is presented to the public as I\u2019m a discipline problem, then I\u2019ll fire right back about nepotism with the PBR\u2019s newest Daddy Warbucks corporate sponsor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst off, you signed a shitload of nondisclosure forms. Even if you\u2019re pissed\u2014and between us, yes, you have a right to be\u2014you can\u2019t violate the terms of the contracts. This is short term, Chase. Does this suck? Absolutely. That\u2019s why the PR arm will release news of a recurrence of your previous injury, which is a perfect excuse for why you rode so shitty tonight after being last year\u2019s defending champion. Fans should be happy to know you are recuperating until you\u2019re ready to ride again.\u201d</p><p>The PR spin machine thought of everything. \u201cTell me Winnie ain\u2019t gonna be involved in issuing the statement.\u201d He\u2019d been taunting Winnie, his assigned PR person, for the last year. The woman was too sharp, and saw right through his bullshit attempts to rattle and distract her. Plus, her comments, always softly spoken, grated on him, mostly because she was dead-on in her assessments. And he hated she saw things about him that he tried to hide from everyone else.</p><p>\u201cLook at it this way. The PBR goes on hiatus for two months. So you\u2019re really only missing three performances instead of eleven.\u201d</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t exactly relax, but he realized if he was going to fuck up, he\u2019d picked an ideal time to do it\u2014because he might actually have a chance to fix it. \u201cCan you guarantee I\u2019ll be on the roster come August?\u201d</p> <p>Elroy gave him a considering look. \u201cTwo things you need to do before I\u2019ll consider recommending you for reinstatement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of the damn spotlight. I don\u2019t wanna hear about you, I don\u2019t wanna read about you in the trade mags or see your naked ass on YouTube. No interviews, no drunken brawls, no excess of easy women, no Chase McKay sightings anywhere. You vanish. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Chase exhaled the breath he hadn\u2019t been aware of holding. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime...try to remember how to ride a damn bull, okay? Practice, relearn, do whatever the hell it takes to get back to the professional level where you belong. Give me your word that you\u2019ll figure out what you\u2019ve been doin\u2019 wrong and try and fix it.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. That fucking stung. He said, \u201cYou have my word, Elroy,\u201d and wondered how he was supposed to relearn something he\u2019d been doing for over a decade.</p><p>\u201cYou do those two things. Prove to me you can do them and I\u2019ll push for you to get back in as soon as the season restarts.\u201d</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t bother mentioning the break would put him out of contention for the world title this year because he wasn\u2019t even close to contention. In fact, if he didn\u2019t get his shit together, he\u2019d soon be off the PBR tour altogether.</p> <p>Helluva mess you got yourself in, McKay.</p><p>\u201cTry to behave, and I\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d Elroy said.</p><p>With nothing left to say, Chase started across the parking lot toward the motel. Lost in thought, he almost bumped into Winnie when she slithered from the shadows.</p><p>She blocked him like a sentry, arms crossed over her flat chest, her eyes strangely defiant behind glasses.</p><p>\u201cYou stick around to gloat?\u201d he taunted.</p><p>Winnie sighed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t enjoy this, but it\u2019s necessary to speak my piece while I have the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo go ahead and tell me I\u2019m the Antichrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go, putting words in my mouth.\u201d She held up her hand to stop his rebuttal. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need to hear for the umpteenth time that you\u2019d rather put something else in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me pegged, down to knowing exactly what I\u2019m gonna say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You aren\u2019t all that complex, Chase.\u201d</p><p>Low blow. \u201cYou calling me a simpleton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree things matter to you. Bull riding, sex and Chase McKay. That seems pretty simple to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d he spat.</p><p>\u201cI understand athletes at the top of their game are self-centered. Privileged. I worked with a pro baseball team before I joined the PBR staff.\u201d Winnie sneered at him. \u201cBetcha didn\u2019t know that. Know why? Because you didn\u2019t bother to ask. I never expected us to become BFFs, but I deserved your cooperation. I deserved your faith that I knew how to do my job just as well as you did yours. I deserved your respect. Whenever you called me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar tits?\u201d he supplied.</p><p>\u201cNothing about you calling me sugar tits is considered remotely respectable,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou know exactly where to strike to make me feel small, but that doesn\u2019t make you a big man, Chase McKay.\u201d</p><p>A flush rose up his neck. It\u2019d been an assholish thing to say and he had no excuse for it, besides lashing out from sheer frustration. Before he could buck up and apologize to her for a change, Winnie lit into him.</p><p>\u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s my job to know all about you. Because of your natural riding talent early on, everyone in your ranching family cut you slack, believing you were destined for great things, and you accepted it as your due. Maybe you did work hard initially at being the best bull rider around, but I\u2019ve seen none of that drive in the last year. Now you make excuses for your piss-poor riding averages.\u201d</p><p>She ticked off the reasons on her fingers. \u201cIt has to be the organization that\u2019s holding you back. Or the shitty bulls. Or the sponsorship commitments. Couldn\u2019t be that you\u2019ve become a slacker. Resting on your previous laurels. Using charm and your good looks to keep your sponsorships rather than utilizing the talent that should keep you at the top of the standings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe PBR ain\u2019t the only game in town,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>Winnie laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t think the PBR isn\u2019t aware that you spoke to the PRCA folks about jumping circuits. We didn\u2019t address it because, given how you\u2019ve been riding? Chances were high the situation would resolve itself and you\u2019d get kicked off the PBR tour anyway.\u201d</p><p>Chase fumed but kept his mouth shut as another layer of harsh reality settled in.</p><p>\u201cI tried to get you on track. Suggesting you focus on improving your average by going back to basics. By keeping distractions during the season to a minimum. And by distractions, yes, I meant women. You don\u2019t need me to tell you how good looking you are. But I\u2019ll point out that even the homeliest riders in the PBR are highly sought after. Those types of women want the thrill of riding a man who rides a bull. They dream of being the wives in the stands the cameras pan to when you get a hoof to the gut. They\u2019re star-fuckers. It\u2019s less about you personally than about the fact that you\u2019re on TV every week. Or you\u2019re talked about incessantly on the fan sites. Or your career is dissected in the trade mags. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget the potential for the top riders to make over a million bucks in a single season. That\u2019s mighty appealing to a woman who just has to show a little cleavage to garner your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a high opinion of the PBR fans, do you, Winnie?\u201d he half-snarled. \u201cBecause I\u2019ll remind you, they\u2019re paying your salary.\u201d</p><p>She shook her finger in his face. \u201cDo not twist this around, Chase. The fans are there to watch you ride. To get behind you in a good season. To stay behind you in a bad season. Ninety-nine percent of the PBR fans don\u2019t want to climb into your bed. So I find it ironic that you only give a crap about the one percent of fans that do.\u201d</p><p>Good thing the shadows hid the heat burning his cheeks and neck. He\u2019d never had a dressing down like this. Ever.</p><p>You need it.</p><p>The fact it came from mealy-mouthed Winnie, who normally wouldn\u2019t say shit if she had a mouthful? That seemed to make everything about this nightmare situation a hundred times worse.</p><p>\u201cYou have so much potential. You\u2019re wasting it. I hope to heaven that you use this time off to pull your head out of your ass before you start that downward spiral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really worried about me?\u201d he asked with total sincerity.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m worried about the image you project. An image the PBR doesn\u2019t need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat image is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoiled. You, Chase McKay, are a spoiled brat.\u201d With that, Winnie spun on her high-heeled boot and stormed off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Smarting from the dressing down, Chase waited until he heard her car roar away before he moved and sat on a bench.</p><p>She\u2019d called him a spoiled brat.</p><p>For Christsake, he was a twenty-eight-year-old man. He was too goddamned old to be a brat.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>How\u2019d you react tonight after getting your ass handed to you on an easy bull?</p><p>He\u2019d taken off to indulge in a threesome instead of sticking around to talk to the fans.</p><p>Yeah. That was kind of bratty.</p><p>How did you respond after being caught in bed with two women by PBR officials?</p><p>He\u2019d gotten indignant. Like he was being persecuted for his bad choices. Like he was being singled out.</p><p>Yeah. That was kind of bratty behavior too.</p><p>He scrubbed his hand over his face. This was all kinds of fucked up. But he wasn\u2019t too delusional or self-centered to admit the astute Winnie had a point. Several of them. He didn\u2019t have much farther to fall before he hit bottom.</p><p>And Winnie knew just where to strike the hardest blow\u2014when it came to his family. Maybe his parents had indulged him, given him leeway with ranch chores. His brothers Quinn and Ben hadn\u2019t minded. Had they?</p><p>Even if they had complained, it would\u2019ve been wasted effort.</p><p>What would he do if this \u201cbreak\u201d became permanent? Who would Chase McKay be if he wasn\u2019t a bull rider? What would he do?</p><p>Not go back to Sundance and ride the range looking for lost cattle with his brothers and cousins. He\u2019d sold his portion of the ranch to the McKays who wanted to keep the legacy alive for themselves and their children. Chase hadn\u2019t seen a life in Wyoming as something he wanted.</p><p>He\u2019d opted not to go to college or a trade school, but straight into the world of rodeo. He\u2019d never developed a hobby. He had nothing in his life he was passionate about except bull riding.</p><p>So why had he allowed his riding skills to erode to the point he was standing on the brink of losing everything that mattered to him? For another nameless piece of ass in a cheap motel in another stop along the tour?</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>He needed a plan.</p><p>He needed to get back to basics.</p><p>He needed to prove to himself he could get a handle on his own life.</p><p>He needed to make a decision and stick to it.</p> <p>And he really needed to stay away from easy women.</p><p>Hell, he needed to stay away from all women. Swear off women. Forever. Okay, maybe not forever. For at least a month.</p><p>At that moment, a star tumbled from the sky, which he took as a sign.</p><p>No women for a month. No sex. No exceptions.</p><p>Chase had never seriously abstained. Oh sure, he\u2019d bragged to his brothers and cousins he\u2019d gone for four months without sex\u2014but that\u2019d been a total lie. He\u2019d been too embarrassed to admit he had no willpower when it came to offers of free and easy sex and he\u2019d blown it within the first week. Not only that, he\u2019d fucked up his chance of ownership in a prize bucking bull because he couldn\u2019t keep his damn Wranglers zipped. Not even his buddy calling him a fucking pathetic man-whore had changed his love-\u2019em-and-leave-\u2019em ways. Goddamn. His life had been careening out of control for the better part of a year. He hadn\u2019t hit rock bottom, but he sure could hear his boots scrabbling for purchase on that ledge from where he was teetering.</p><p>Enough. Focus on the here and now.</p><p>Mind racing, he trudged back to the motel. He opened the door and tried not to goggle at the two women indulging in a mutual sixty-nine.</p><p>Janae lifted her head from between Rhea\u2019s thighs and grinned at him. \u201cChase! You\u2019re back. We\u2019ve been entertaining ourselves, like you asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that. And as much as I appreciate your...efforts, I\u2019m afraid, ladies, that I have some bad news.\u201d</p><p>Two weeks later...</p><p>Kane McKay answered the phone with a brusque, \u201cChase? Why\u2019re you callin\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to hear your voice too, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Lack of sleep makes me cranky. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a favor. And it\u2019s gonna sound really freakin\u2019 weird, so just hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a place to crash. I don\u2019t want anyone\u2014and yeah, by anyone I mean my folks, my brothers and the rest of the assorted McKays\u2014to know I\u2019m in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cYa ain\u2019t killed someone and are on the run from the law or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was suspended from the PBR. Mostly because of bullshit politics\u2014\u201d Still in denial, buddy? \u201c\u2014but I need time to figure out my next move. I can\u2019t do it with my family hovering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019d just be you?\u201d Kane asked skeptically.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sworn off women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain? What is that? The fourth time this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fuckin\u2019 hilarious. That\u2019s another reason I need to get away. Too many temptations of the female flesh around me, and I\u2019m willing to admit I\u2019m a weak, weak man.\u201d</p><p>Kane laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo is anyone living in your old trailer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Me\u2019n Red hang out there occasionally when we need a break from the kids. I\u2019ll ask Ginger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the other thing. Can we keep it strictly between us?\u201d</p><p>A sigh. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna lie to my wife. I\u2019ll do this much. I won\u2019t tell Ginger you\u2019re comin\u2019, but once you\u2019re here, I\u2019ll let her know. If she suspects someone\u2019s squatting in our love shack, she\u2019ll call Cam. Wouldn\u2019t want our cousin to shoot ya on accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to help. Though, I\u2019ll point out your folks and brothers will be pissed if they hear you\u2019re around and hiding from them. So if it comes up, you keep me out of it. We just straightened out the last of the family drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn and Ben tell me the new arrangement is workin\u2019 great.\u201d The older generation had officially retired the last few months, forcing changes in the way McKay Ranches were run, leaving his brothers and cousins in charge for the first time.</p><p>\u201cSo far,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>\u201cNo fistfights yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>Once again Chase was glad he\u2019d cashed out his portion of the McKay Ranch with the change in ownership. The financial windfall provided him options and freedom. Yet...he half-wondered if not having a burning need for that prize money contributed to him slacking off on tour.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you plan on bein\u2019 here?\u201d Kane asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll call you after I get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. There\u2019s a key under the bottom porch step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Kane, I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to help. Drive safe.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cAva! Over here!\u201d</p><p>Ava Cooper ignored the photographers snapping pictures as she waited for the valet to bring her Mazerati around.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d the photographer cajoled. \u201cGive us something. Anything.\u201d</p><p>She recognized the fat, balding man, the most aggressive of the paparazzi. In the not-too-distant past she would\u2019ve given him a sound bite. Now they circled her, waiting to swoop in and pick off the remaining bits of her dignity.</p><p>Fucking vultures.</p><p>\u201cAva. Open up to us. You know our readers are on your side. Don\u2019t you have anything to say to your fans?\u201d</p><p>Her black sports car rumbled at the curb. She skirted the back end, colliding with the valet. \u201cPardon me, Miss Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019m ready to get the hell out of here.\u201d Ava peeled out, burning rubber before she even buckled her seat belt.</p><p>The traffic was light on the freeway this time of day as she headed...where? Home? Most paparazzi were on to fresher stories, but a couple persistent buggers detailed her comings and goings on a Twitter feed. If she didn\u2019t leave her house for a few days, rumors would fly she was too depressed, too drunk, too emotionally eviscerated to be seen in public. If she ran errands, or met with her agent, or visited her friends and family, or dined out, she\u2019d put on a brave face through her personal heartache.</p><p>Ava wasn\u2019t sure when the ridiculousness of the situation occurred to her. She was a B-list actress. Why would anyone give a shit about her?</p><p>Because in the last month, her life, as she\u2019d known it, had been turned upside down, and everyone gawked at a train wreck. She hadn\u2019t been in a state of denial as much as shock. It wasn\u2019t every day a woman found out via press conference that the man she\u2019d been involved with for months was in a relationship...with another man.</p><p>Fucking Jake Vasquez. Talk about a double whammy\u2014he\u2019d betrayed her on both a personal and professional level.</p><p>They\u2019d met while filming a low-budget independent romantic comedy in which they\u2019d been cast in the lead roles. Jake was the most exquisite man she\u2019d ever seen. Dark black hair, dreamy golden eyes, a killer body comprised of sinewy muscle beneath an expanse of luminescent olive-toned skin. Their attraction was instantaneous, and by the end of the film shoot, they were lovers. After the movie wrapped, the fall TV taping season started. Jake\u2019s popular TV show was filmed in Vancouver; hers was filmed in LA. But never during those months they maintained a long-distance relationship had she suspected Jake preferred men in bed.</p><p>The suspicion didn\u2019t even kick in the night Jake showed up at her place, half-liquored up, with his new friend Decker. Jake\u2019s increasing sexual aggressiveness with her in front of his buddy had gotten Decker all hot and bothered, so Jake spontaneously suggested a threesome.</p><p>Growing up in California, Ava had seen plenty of kinky things and even experimented with a few. But she\u2019d shied away from a m\u00e9nage, mostly because men wanted girl-on-girl action. The thought of kissing and touching another woman did nothing for her.</p><p>But two guys catering to her? That\u2019d been a no-brainer. The three of them had spent all night and part of the following day in bed. Even now, Ava overheated recalling the erotic hedonism. Sandwiched between two hot men, bodies slick with sweat and pressed tightly together as they fucked to exhaustion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the time, she\u2019d been blown away by Jake\u2019s willingness to cede control to another man. To do anything and everything Decker suggested. Or demanded. Watching Jake\u2019s beautiful face lost in pleasure as Decker fucked him. Seeing how expertly Jake sucked Decker off. Finding their stamina as arousing as their unexpected tenderness in the aftermath of such aggressiveness. In retrospect, she should\u2019ve known Jake and Decker were too well attuned to each other.</p><p>The fact the paparazzi had caught Jake and Decker together in a full-body clinch at a gay club late one night in LA should\u2019ve warranted a warning phone call from Jake. But no.</p><p>Before either of their publicity teams were informed, Jake held a press conference, admitting he could no longer lie about his true sexual orientation. Then he\u2019d claimed both the movie studio and Ava had known their relationship was a sham to build buzz for the movie\u2014which was a total lie.</p> <p>She\u2019d been completely blindsided. The movie studio scrapped the entire publicity campaign for the movie a mere month from release. The movie tanked. Her phone rang off the hook with requests for interviews. Paparazzi camped out around her house, forcing her to hire security guards to keep the press off her private stretch of beach.</p><p>How did she bounce back from this? Did she even want to? The brutal truth was she\u2019d been frustrated in recent years with her acting career. Every role was supposed to be the vehicle for landing her a \u201cbig\u201d breakout role. Hadn\u2019t happened. Now her years of hard work were overshadowed by events beyond her control. With the scandal simmering in the backs of directors\u2019 and producers\u2019 minds, she\u2019d have to work twice as hard to prove herself.</p><p>To who?\u201d</p><p>Her parents had never gauged her worth by her public success; they believed pursuing an acting career was a waste. As an heiress to the Cooper fortune, which included a string of hotels, a tire manufacturing business and a line of power tools, her mother had hoped Ava would join the family business. But Ava knew being a bottom-line businesswoman would stifle her creativity, regardless of the avenue she followed after this latest debacle blew over.</p><p>Maybe she should run away and join the circus.</p> <p>As she waited in traffic, she happened to catch a glimpse of herself in the rearview mirror. Ugh. She looked like dog shit. She dialed her go-to guy for hair and makeup, cajoling him into squeezing her in immediately.</p><p>Hours later, when Ava exited the salon, she had an extra spring in her step because no one had recognized her.</p><p>Keeping up with her fab idea to run away, she needed to find someplace outside her normal haunts. Someplace nobody would ever think to look for her. Someplace remote. Unpopulated.</p><p>Hello, Wyoming.</p><p>Ava waited while the secretary patched her through to her long-time friend, the one person she\u2019d always been able to count on to help her out of a jam.</p><p>\u201cThis is Ginger Paulson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were going by Ginger McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva! I was just thinking about you. I\u2019m Ginger Paulson while I\u2019m at Paulson Law Office. But when it\u2019s me, Kane and the kids at home, I\u2019m...ah, hell, I\u2019m just mama. A frazzled mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are the McKay kiddos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHayden has developed a love of ranch work and has forgotten about his X-Box. Paul crawls as fast as a cockroach. Maddie is an angel, if you can overlook the death metal scream she\u2019s debuted in the last week.\u201d</p><p>Ava laughed. \u201cYou love it. And how is that smokin\u2019 hot hubby of yours?\u201d</p><p>Ginger sighed. \u201cAmazing. He can do physical labor all day, come home, diaper and care for two babies, help Hayden with school projects, play cards with my dad and still keep me purring like a contented kitten. So, amazing doesn\u2019t begin to cover how fabulous my Kane is. Anyway, what\u2019s up with you? \u2019Cause, sweetie, you rarely call me out of the blue anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She slipped out the patio door and gazed across the turbulent ocean. \u201cI\u2019m... I need to clear my head, Ginger. I thought this mess would blow over. It mostly has, but there\u2019s enough of it lingering I can\u2019t even have lunch in this town without being tracked down by the press. Which is why I need a break.\u201d</p><p>Ginger was quiet for just a beat too long.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking back to when your punkish seventeen-year-old self swaggered into my office. You had your career path all laid out. You couldn\u2019t wait to be the focus of the paparazzi.\u201d</p><p>Ava tilted her head to better catch the salty ocean breeze. \u201cI was so cocky.\u201d She grimaced with bitter remembrance. \u201cAnd I had no reason to be. No experience. Nothing but a solid belief in myself. If I\u2019d known then what I know now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve listened to your parents and gone into one of the family businesses?\u201d Ginger supplied with syrupy sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ava. It hasn\u2019t turned out so badly for you. You\u2019ve been in a critically acclaimed TV show and in a few movies. You\u2019ve done it mostly on your own. You should be proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Ava prompted.</p><p>\u201cBut the smart, savvy girl I met had ambitions of being more than a mere actress. You were writing screenplays, studying directing and cinematography, planning to start a production company to showcase projects you loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So what happened to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie. You got lazy. Rather than letting the money from the acting gigs fund those aspirations, using it as a stepping stone for bigger things, the last few years you\u2019ve allowed complacency to wedge you into a place you don\u2019t want to be.\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s ability to get to the heart of the matter was exactly what Ava needed. \u201cWell, letting an in-the-closet actor come out and annihilate my career is a stepping stone I would\u2019ve loved to skip.\u201d</p><p>Ginger laughed. \u201cSometimes what seems like the worst turn of events can turn into the best. And yes, I\u2019m speaking from experience, as you well know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I need new experiences. I need a change. I need to live something real.\u201d Ava breathed in the familiar scent of wet sand and exhaled slowly. \u201cI want to come to Wyoming. I know your life is beyond busy, and I\u2019d never presume to crash at your place. But a change of scenery will force me out of complacency. I need to stop being Ava Cooper for a while. Figure out who Ava Dumond is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with you, but no matter what name you use, you are a celebrity. You will be recognized even in the small burg of Sundance, Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Without makeup, designer clothes and my snazzy sports car, I doubt anyone would recognize me.\u201d She turned, checking out her reflection in the picture window. \u201cMy stylist reverted my hair to its original brown today. If his assistant didn\u2019t recognize me, and I\u2019ve dealt with him for years, I\u2019m pretty confident no one else will recognize me either. Besides, I\u2019m not being snobby when I say I don\u2019t want to mingle with the Sundance locals. Luckily, Kane\u2019s old trailer is out in the middle of nowhere. Have you rented it yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Finding adult alone time in a house with three kids and my dad is impossible sometimes. And Kane and I need a place to connect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you put your libido on hold for like a week and lend me your love lair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to Kane\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, I don\u2019t even want Kane to know I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Ginger demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause your gentleman hubby would fuss over me, stopping by every day to see if I needed anything. I\u2019d rather not put him in that position of feeling obligated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to tell him, Ava? I won\u2019t lie to him.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten cajoling didn\u2019t work on Ginger. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him I\u2019m coming, but once I\u2019m there, I\u2019ll swing by your place and let him know I\u2019m hanging out in Wyoming for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to play this card, but you\u2019re leaving me no choice. You and Kane spent your honeymoon at my house for one entire week. You owe me a week in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shoulda gone to law school. Fine. I\u2019ll put away the spanking bench and the ceiling restraints before you get here. Which is...when exactly?\u201d</p><p>Ava wasn\u2019t sure if Ginger was kidding about the marital aids. \u201cI\u2019m planning to fly into Denver and rent a car to drive the Wyoming leg. I\u2019ll call you when I arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll make sure the trailer is unlocked that morning. And if you really don\u2019t want anyone to know you\u2019re there, park in the barn.\u201d</p><p>Ava sagged against the weathered siding. \u201cThis is exactly what I need. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I can help. I know you\u2019ll figure it out, Ava. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>Next she called her dad.</p><p>\u201cAnd to what do I owe the pleasure of a phone call from my beautiful daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. Just calling to see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t wanna hear about the modifications we\u2019ve made to the latest test engine. So, as pleased as I am that charm school paid off, can the crap, Ava, and tell me what you want.\u201d He paused and puffed out air, which indicated he was outside on the patio smoking a cigar, which also meant her mother wasn\u2019t around.</p><p>Did she really only contact him when she needed something from him? Yes. But she\u2019d deal with that guilt later. \u201cI need to get out of LA for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea where? The resort in Mexico? Or the chateau in France? I hear the new Barcelona property is inspiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of the above. I\u2019m thinking about Colorado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe skiing won\u2019t be good this time of year in Aspen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, Dad. I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t need money, so why you calling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to borrow the Citation.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Ava blurted, \u201cPlease? The paparazzi are everywhere. They don\u2019t have access to the private air strip so I truly can just disappear.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Puff, puff. \u201cHow soon would you need to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thing tomorrow. That\u2019d give me time to figure out a way to slip the tabloid guys who are determined to be the first to report my suicide.\u201d</p><p>Her father chuckled. \u201cPeople are idiots if they believe you\u2019re still despondent over that cocksucker Jake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping out of sight, out of mind will cure lingering curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really doing okay, Ava Rose?\u201d he asked gruffly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been awful damn scarce since this whole thing went down.\u201d</p><p>Switching her phone to her other ear, Ava rested her elbows on the railing. \u201cThe last thing I wanted was you guys getting swamped by my shit storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, honey girl, that\u2019s what family does\u2014sticks together and flips the world the bird. I\u2019ll remind you that your mother and I\u2019ve been through a shit storm or two in the thirty years we\u2019ve been married. We\u2019re tougher than you give us credit.\u201d Puff, puff. \u201cFar as I know, your mom doesn\u2019t need the plane tomorrow. So I\u2019ll call and arrange it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKeep in contact. You\u2019re a big girl and all that, but we worry, okay?\u201d</p><p>Guilt swamped her. Her justification for shutting her family out was only partially true. They\u2019d never understood her pursuit of a show business career, and when she failed so publicly in that career and her personal life, she felt like an embarrassment and a disappointment. \u201cOkay. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too. Be safe, be well and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive \u2019em hell,\u201d she finished and hung up.</p><p>\u201cI love the Dumond family motto,\u201d a dry, female voice intoned behind her.</p><p>Ava turned toward Hannah, her friend/personal assistant/gal Friday. \u201cHey, Han. I didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI gathered that. Now what\u2019s this bullshit plan about you hiding out in some godforsaken Western state?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like it\u2019ll be permanent. Just seeing the sights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you going with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. Just me.\u201d</p><p>Hannah lifted one eyebrow in her usual imperious manner. \u201cOh really? That\u2019s surprising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you never go anywhere by yourself, Ava. Never.\u201d</p><p>Ava bristled. \u201cI do too go places by myself. I went to lunch by myself today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you met your agent for lunch.\u201d She raised her hand, stopping Ava\u2019s protest. \u201cAnd please don\u2019t think that driving four miles to lunch in your car counts as by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Shoot. Hannah knew her too well. \u201cI went to Madrid by myself last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flew to Madrid by yourself last year, in your parents\u2019 plane. As soon as your Manalos hit Spanish soil you had a translator, a stylist and a driver.\u201d Hannah cocked her head. \u201cCome to think of it, that is a small entourage for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Ava said crossly.</p><p>Hannah laughed. \u201cI make your schedule, so I know where you\u2019ve been and where you\u2019re going better than you do.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that was another part of the problem. Her decisions were all laid out for her. She hadn\u2019t done things for herself...well, ever. In addition to Hannah, she employed a housekeeper, a groundskeeper, a personal trainer, a stylist, a publicist, a part-time chef, a financial planner, an agent...and the list went on. Made her head spin. She curled her hands into fists by her sides and said, \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d Hannah asked, alarmed. \u201cStop what? Stop you from doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need to stop. All of this. I need to stop being Ava Cooper. I need to know if Ava Dumond is capable of taking care of herself, because it\u2019s obvious Ava Cooper can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Hannah was dead silent. Then she smiled. \u201cI know I should be worried about job security with your sudden identity crisis, but I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. So you\u2019re not going to try and talk me out of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Besides, I know you\u2019ll be back by the first week in August.\u201d Hannah\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou are scheduled to start filming the new Lynch movie in Mexico that week. And given that the contracts were signed before this shit went down with the movie studio and Jake, you absolutely cannot fuck that up, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Hannah pressed. \u201cYou know there\u2019s no warning when the casting director calls you in for a reading, so you\u2019ll need to be someplace where you can hop a plane at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. I doubt I\u2019ll be gone that long. I just need a break.\u201d She watched the frown lines deepen on Hanna\u2019s forehead. \u201cAre you rethinking that job security comment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Since getting far away from here is your idea, I believe it\u2019s something you need to do. I just want you to be careful.\u201d</p><p>Ava hugged her. \u201cI will. Thank you. You are the best, Han.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now will you at least let me help you pack and plan?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI need to do it all on my own. Like regular people do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the exception of flying commercial like regular people do,\u201d Hannah inserted.</p><p>\u201cExtenuating circumstances.\u201d Ava allowed a sheepish look. \u201cAh, can you tell me where I keep my suitcases?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the bed in the guest bedroom. I\u2019ll grab them.\u201d</p><p>As Ava flipped through her closet, she was torn. What to bring for clothes? Comfy. Casual. Weather appropriate. Did she own anything fitting that description?</p><p>Hannah set the luggage on the floor by the closet door. Ava\u2019s gaze strayed to the large duffel bag she\u2019d never used. If she had to haul her belongings everywhere by herself, she\u2019d need a manageable bag. She grabbed the gray duffel. \u201cI\u2019m taking this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva. You can\u2019t even get your shoes in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva Cooper can\u2019t get her shoes in that. Ava Dumond travels light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a glass of wine,\u201d Hannah said wearily.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d As Hannah left the room, Ava yelled, \u201cOh, on your way back from the kitchen, will you grab the box of condoms from the main bathroom?\u201d</p><p>Hannah poked her head back in. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about packing shoes, but you\u2019re packing condoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019m gonna find me a hot man and offer him unlimited, anything-goes sex\u2014no strings, no regrets, just lots of getting naked and getting loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re setting out to prove Ava Dumond is a sleazy ho-bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes to get my sexual confidence back where men are concerned? Then yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget a glass of wine, I\u2019m bringing back the whole damn bottle.\u201d</p><p>Ava laughed. Let her Wild West adventure begin.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Chase could barely keep his eyes open. Disoriented, he slowed his truck to a crawl on the gravel road, braking at the cattle guard that denoted the turnoff to Kane\u2019s place.</p><p>He parked by the deck and stumbled out of his truck, taking a moment to stretch his legs and adjust the crick in his neck. But anticipation of falling face-first into a puffy mattress and sleeping a solid twelve hours put a spring in his step.</p><p>Once he\u2019d unearthed the key and unlocked the door, he slipped inside the dark trailer and caught a whiff of flowers. Probably from cleaning supplies.</p><p>Too tired to shower, Chase stripped to his boxer-briefs in the living room and wandered to the kitchen sink to wash off the worst of the road grime. Rather than flipping on the lights, his fingers trailed along the hallway wall for guidance as he headed toward the back bedroom.</p><p>The bedroom door was closed. With as hot as it\u2019d been, the room would be stuffy, but he was too damn whipped to even open a window. He flopped on the mattress and stretched out, but his arm connected with something solid. And warm. And soft.</p><p>And moving.</p><p>Chase leapt out of bed the same time the high-pitched shrieking started.</p><p>He fumbled with the light, blinking against the sudden brightness. He kept blinking because he didn\u2019t trust what he was seeing. There was a nekkid woman in his bed. A nekkid, pissed-off woman who\u2019d jumped up and struck a Jackie Chan martial arts pose.</p><p>\u201cBack off, perv! I have a black belt in taekwondo and I will fuck you up if you take another step toward me.\u201d</p><p>Chase raised his hands in surrender, trying really, really hard to keep his eyes on hers. \u201cWhoa, there, crouching tiger. Let\u2019s just take this down a notch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet you\u2019d like that, fuckface.\u201d</p><p>Fuckface? Christ. Just his luck he\u2019d come across another psychotic woman. \u201cMaybe you oughta tell me why you broke in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t break in, you moron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, enough with the name-callin\u2019,\u201d he snapped. \u201cMaybe I oughta call the deputy and let him deal with your lyin\u2019 ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, enough with the name-callin\u2019,\u201d she mimicked flawlessly. \u201cGo ahead and make the call.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. He had no guarantee Cam was on duty tonight. And did he really want to try and explain...this?</p><p>\u201cHah! Called your bluff, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she sneered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, honey pie, you sure did. I\u2019m just wondering if the rash of shit I\u2019ll get from my cousin\u2014who is the deputy I\u2019d call\u2014is worth the hassle at two o\u2019clock in the fuckin\u2019 mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hands and studied him. \u201cWait a second. Your cousin is a local deputy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck me. You\u2019re one of the two hundred McKay men Ginger always talks about.\u201d</p><p>That startled Chase. \u201cYou know Ginger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think invited me to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we have a problem because my cousin Kane said I could stay here.\u201d As Chase tried to stay focused on her eyes, he realized something about this woman was very familiar. His gaze wandered. Drool-worthy tits. Tiny waist. Curvy hips. Long legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEyes up here, buddy.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t exactly hurry his gaze as it tracked her curvaceous body from the bottom up. Goddamn, the woman had it going on. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know you?\u201d she shot back sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. Were you in Playboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your idea of flattery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re sporting a helluva centerfold body, sugar t\u2014\u201d Shit. He was supposed to stop saying stuff like that.</p><p>Not bothered at all by her total nakedness, she pushed up the pink satin eye mask that kept slipping down. \u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing you at Ginger and Kane\u2019s wedding. Which McKay are you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase. I wasn\u2019t at the wedding. Mind tellin\u2019 me your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva Cooper is my stage name. Ava Dumond is my real name.\u201d</p><p>Stage name. With a body like hers and zero modesty she had to be a stripper. \u201cWell, Ava, it appears we\u2019re roomies, at least for tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t respond. Her gaze was glued to his belly. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Chase glanced at his stomach and touched the bruise beneath his rib cage. \u201cThat\u2019s what fifteen hundred pounds of pissed-off bull will do to ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull? As in a male cow? Were you doing ranch work or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was trying to ride the damn thing, but he didn\u2019t wanna be rode. Threw me on my ass and stomped on me for good measure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that a lot? Ride bulls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cReally? That\u2019s an actual job? You get paid and everything?\u201d</p><p>He scowled at her. \u201cReally. And look, no offense, but I\u2019m dead on my feet. I\u2019ll take the couch tonight. We\u2019ll talk about the rest of this in the mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not a serial killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d Chase offered a smug smile. \u201cSweet dreams.\u201d</p> <p>When Ava saw the half-naked cowboy sprawled on the couch, snoring softly, she knew last night hadn\u2019t been a dream.</p><p>She rested her shoulder against the partition separating the hallway from the living room and looked her fill.</p><p>The man, quite simply, was stunning. And living in California, surrounded by the best-looking men in the world, she knew stunning. Sculpted cheekbones that emphasized the leanness of his cheeks. A broad, masculine jaw. Full, ripe lips. His nose was slightly crooked, but it worked centered among the rest of his perfect features. His dark eyebrows were drawn together in a frown, even as he slept. His hair, a striking shade of coal black, held a hint of curl.</p><p>Her gaze meandered south, over the flare of his thick neck, to his bare chest, packed with muscles. More dark hair highlighted his defined pectorals, trailing down to bisect his ripped abs. The damn blanket hid his lower half from his hip to his knee, but one bare calf and foot poked out.</p><p>Probably creepy to gawk at him when he was unaware, but he\u2019d seen her naked body last night, so tit for tat.</p><p>He\u2019d thrown his left arm above his head, which drew her eye to his\u2014holy crap\u2014mammoth biceps and meaty forearm. Her gaze dropped to his crotch. Chances were high he had a little dick. Beautiful men like him always had one physical flaw, and since she couldn\u2019t see any others...</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed and swept down the length of his body. His feet didn\u2019t reach the end of the couch. Which made him short. At least three inches shorter than her. Not that it made a damn bit of difference in her mind. They\u2019d still be eye to eye when they were having sex missionary style. And it wouldn\u2019t matter at all when she was on top.</p><p>Stop gawking before he catches you, perv. You\u2019re acting like you haven\u2019t seen a half-naked man in years, not months.</p><p>She started a pot of coffee, lamenting the fact there weren\u2019t any Starbucks within two hundred miles, and turned on her laptop, shooting a glance at the still-sleeping cowboy. Last night he\u2019d claimed to be some kind of...rodeo riding guy.</p><p>Hello, Google search.</p><p>Ava was shocked by all the links that popped up when she typed in Chase McKay. This guy was a big deal in the Professional Bull Riders world. He had a website. He had a fan page on Facebook. She scrolled down. Hey. Chase McKay had more \u201cLikes\u201d than she did. But she noticed no new posts since the announcement he planned to take time off to heal a recurring injury.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look injured.</p><p>She continued to cyber stalk him, fascinated by a world she knew nothing about. She found pictures of Chase McKay with mayors and governors. Other bull riders. Country singers. Stock contractors. PBR officials and sponsors. Close-up stills of his best rides and his worst wrecks.</p><p>But most of the pictures were of the hot cowboy with women. Lots of women\u2014young, old, fat, skinny. Rodeo queens and other rhinestone-wearing women who weren\u2019t queens but sure looked the part. The other odd thing? Not a single woman was taller than him.</p><p>Ava followed a link that directed her to articles about Chase. Happy as she was to hit pay dirt, the consensus in the last year of rodeo sports experts? Chase McKay was washed up. His riding percentage\u2014whatever that meant\u2014was rock bottom. Rumors abounded about the trail of broken hearts he left across the country. A couple of snarky reporters dubbed him \u201cChase\u2019n Tail McKay\u201d since his personal life overshadowed his professional career.</p><p>Welcome to the club, bub.</p><p>The next series of articles, dated the last three months, hinted at Chase settling into a relationship with Sheree Bishop, daughter of Lou Bishop, billionaire owner of Bishop\u2019s Sporting Goods, the PBR\u2019s new sponsor. During one interview, Sheree admitted she and Chase were \u201cserious\u201d but Chase neither confirmed nor denied Sheree\u2019s claim. In fact, there were no pictures of Chase and Sheree together.</p><p>Were they keeping their relationship on the down low? Or was there nothing to report?</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve found some interesting reading,\u201d Chase drawled behind her.</p><p>Ava jumped. Heat rushed to her face and she fought the urge to slam her laptop shut. \u201cCan you blame me for being curious? Since you were sleeping in the next room and wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny you\u2019re a serial killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not. But you coulda just asked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were asleep.\u201d She watched him pour himself a cup of coffee. He wore athletic shorts, no shirt, apparently perfectly comfortable half-dressed with a woman he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Like you have room to judge. You were naked in front of him last night.</p><p>And wowza. With a slamming body like that? The man should waltz around naked all the time.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d He pursed his lips and blew across his coffee. \u201cDid you find proof I\u2019m not a serial killer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But it sounds like you\u2019re some kind of lady killer.\u201d</p><p>Chase rolled his eyes but didn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll plead total ignorance on what it means to be a bull rider, so I did some research. All the rest of this stuff popped up.\u201d Ava bit back a girly sigh when his beautiful blue gaze connected with hers. \u201cAre you really off the PBR tour because of an injury?\u201d</p><p>Chase held her gaze long enough to make her heart speed up. Just when she thought he wouldn\u2019t answer, he said, \u201cNope. I\u2019m suspended indefinitely for inappropriate behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d Another one of his intense eye locks. But he didn\u2019t seem inclined to answer this time, so she tossed out, \u201cI\u2019m no stranger to PR nightmares. Regardless if I was the one at fault. If you\u2019re looking for someone to commiserate with? That\u2019d be me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. And holy fuck was it a smile that unlocked the gates of heaven.</p><p>Or the devil\u2019s door. Which quite frankly, she preferred.</p><p>\u201cShort version? Two weeks ago I was caught in a compromising position with a couple of ladies. I ain\u2019t gonna make excuses, it was what it was, and I\u2019m paying the price. I suddenly found myself with time off while I wait for the PBR to call me back. My folks and brothers live here, but I didn\u2019t want to deal with their pity, so I asked Kane if I could hang out and make plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re reading a page out of the story of my life.\u201d Ava typed her name into the search engine and spun the laptop around. \u201cHave a look.\u201d</p><p>Chase scooted out the chair across from her and sat. His fingers clicked on the keyboard. His eyebrows went up a couple of times. But he didn\u2019t speak for a few minutes.</p><p>She refilled their cups and braced herself when she sensed him staring at her.</p><p>\u201cYour ex was gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It was quite a shock to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have shocked me at all. He looks gay.\u201d</p><p>Ava bristled. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell that by looking at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I can.\u201d Chase spun the laptop around and enlarged the photo of Ava and Jake at an Emmy Awards after-party. He pointed at Jake\u2019s feet enclosed in white patent leather clogs decorated with brightly colored polka dots. \u201cNo straight man ever wears shoes like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShows what you know. Those are high-couture shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are highly gay shoes.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to laugh, she really did. It\u2019d been ages since she\u2019d met a man so willing to speak his mind. \u201cShoes are your gauge for determining sexual preference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the best indicator is sex. How often did you have sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how that\u2019s relevant,\u201d she snipped.</p><p>Chase leaned closer. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s relevant. Because if he wasn\u2019t dragging you to bed at least twice a day, the man was either a fuckin\u2019 moron or totally gay. Probably both.\u201d</p><p>That was kind of sweet...in a caveman sort of way. \u201cNot everything has to do with sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? If that\u2019s true, then this Jake guy wouldn\u2019t have left you to have sex with a dude, would he?\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cShit. Sorry. That came out wrong. What I meant\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t.\u201d She placed her hand on his arm. \u201cI think you\u2019re the first person who\u2019s been totally honest with me.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed.

Think again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were dead-on with the sex question. One of the reasons I\u2019m here? To find a guy I can get wild with. To prove I\u2019m hot between the sheets. To prove I can keep a man sexually satisfied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d he drawled.</p> <p>Her brain slipped into seductress mode as she channeled the femme fatale she\u2019d played on TV for two seasons. \u201cMaybe...you\u2019re the man who can help me with that.\u201d</p><p>Bad karma is coming back to bite you in the ass, McKay.</p><p>Of all the times to have sworn off sex, this had to happen? Now? When the hottest woman on the planet sat right across from him? Burning him alive with her smoldering eyes? Oh, and she wanted to prove\u2014with him\u2014that she was a tiger between the sheets.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He wondered why God hated him.</p><p>He wondered if it was too early in the day to start drinking.</p> <p>He wondered if Ava had any condoms because he hadn\u2019t brought any.</p><p>No, no, no. He would not break the vow he\u2019d made to himself. He\u2019d been making excuses for his behavior for far too long. This \u201cbreak\u201d was supposed to get him back on track, not drive him off the rails completely.</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He tore his mind from the image of her oh so curvaceous body twined around his as he fucked her blind. \u201cAh, well, that\u2019s the thing. See, after the last...incident, I swore off women.\u201d</p><p>She blinked with confusion. \u201cForever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. For a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>He started to say two months to remove all temptation to get down and dirty with her, but amended it to, \u201cA month.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI take it that\u2019s a big deal for you, going without sex for a month?\u201d</p><p>Chase nodded. \u201cGo ahead and call me a dog. I deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the no-judgment zone, remember? But I\u2019ve gotta admit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m disappointed.\u201d</p><p>His dick decided to show disappointment at the lack of recent activity by instantly going rock hard.</p><p>\u201cI am too, Ava. More than you can imagine. Any other time in my life I\u2019d be stripping you to skin right where you stood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not helping, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. But we seem to be getting along. Can we be friends while we\u2019re both hiding out here?\u201d</p><p>Ava said, \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d but her sneaky smile said, Wanna take bets on how long you can hold out on that \u2018friends\u2019 thing, cowboy?</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not kiddin\u2019, Ava. I am not sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. We won\u2019t be getting nekkid together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally your call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. We will not be havin\u2019 sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I get it. Hands off. No hugs, no kisses, no holding hands, no hot looks, no copping a feel. No chance for a hard, fast, sweaty, screaming, raunchy fuckfest against the wall, or on the floor, or in the shower, and definitely not on the bed.\u201d</p><p>For fucking Christsake.</p><p>\u201cBut I am curious as to how long you\u2019ve been on this abstinence kick.\u201d</p><p>Tempting to lie. But he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m two weeks in.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. And Chase swore she was marking off the remaining calendar days in her mind with big red X\u2019s.</p><p>Change the subject. \u201cDo you have plans for today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Thought I might go for a walk. Take in the clean air and the big sky. Moo at any livestock I happened by during my nature stroll. Run from the bulls. They are easy to tell apart from cows, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. She was funny in that offbeat way that appealed to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI hafta make a call this morning. I figured I\u2019d hop on a four-wheeler and take a spin later.\u201d He frowned. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have to be careful where I go, so as not to run into any of my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I tag along? There\u2019s room for two riders on most ATVs, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>New images unleashed in his brain. Ava\u2019s slim thighs gripping the outside of his legs. Ava\u2019s crotch nestled against his butt. Ava\u2019s arms circling his waist as they descended a steep slope. Ava\u2019s bountiful tits pressing into his back. Ava\u2019s breath teasing his ear. Ava\u2019s fragrant, windswept hair drifting across his face. Ava flat on her back in the mud as he hammered into her.</p><p>No way could they ride double. No way. So he was shocked to hear, \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d tumbling from his traitorous mouth.</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll just get ready so we can go whenever you are.\u201d</p><p>Chase ended up dressing in the living room and brushing his teeth in the kitchen. When the shower kicked on, flashes of Ava\u2019s wet, naked body had him fleeing outside.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>He wandered behind the barn and gazed across the pasture. Heavy winter snow allowed for green grass, a boon in the cattle business. Even the sagebrush had lost the dusty silver shimmer and looked brighter. The scrub oaks lining the creek bed were leafed out with dark green foliage. A few patches of wildflowers dotted the landscape, hues ranging from brilliant yellow to soft purple.</p><p>Stop admiring the posies and make the call, chickenshit.</p><p>Chase blew out a breath and dialed. As he listened to the rings, he paced in front of the fence.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Cash. It\u2019s Chase McKay. Remember me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase! \u2019Course I remember you. How you doin\u2019? I heard you were on the PBR\u2019s injured list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not really.\u201d He forced a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story. One we\u2019re keeping on the down low, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why you callin\u2019 me, hey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then, \u201cTell you what. You give me the truth about what\u2019s really goin\u2019 on with the PBR and I\u2019ll let you know if I\u2019m willin\u2019 to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fair.\u201d Chase let fly.</p><p>When he finished, Cash whistled. \u201cAin\u2019t nothin\u2019 the rest of us weren\u2019t doin\u2019 on the road, but things are different now. But I\u2019m confused on how you think I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get my ridin\u2019 back on track. It seems I\u2019m doin\u2019 everything the same way I always have, but that ain\u2019t the case or my scores would be better, or at least on par, not completely in the shitter like they are now. I wondered if you\u2019re still holding a bull ridin\u2019 school?</p><p>\u201cNow and again. Why? You lookin\u2019 to go back to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Chase slumped against the barn. \u201cAnd before you get pissy and think this is a joke, I\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m dead-ass serious. I need an expert to look at my ridin\u2019 objectively and help me figure out what the devil I\u2019m doin\u2019 wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpert.\u201d Cash snorted. \u201cBut an old-timer like me ain\u2019t immune to such smooth bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Chase grinned. \u201cYou had a good run, what? Almost twenty years as a pro? With my buck-off average, I\u2019ll be goddammed lucky if I make it another two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when you thinkin\u2019 you wanna get started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBein\u2019s I have time off and you\u2019ve got a ranch to run, I\u2019ll work around your schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t have another training session scheduled until the end of next month. That probably don\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Not only that, Chase didn\u2019t want to train in front of rookies. Maybe it was an ego thing. A bratty thing. But he wanted one-on-one attention to his riding issues.</p><p>Before he could say thanks and hang up, Cash said, \u201cBut if you can get here in two days, I\u2019ll put you on as many bulls as you can handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That would be great. I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d...ah, take offense to me offering to pay for a private session.\u201d</p><p>Cash\u2019s laughter boomed. \u201cMcKay, if I didn\u2019t think you could afford it I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve suggested it, because it ain\u2019t gonna be cheap. But there\u2019s one other thing.\u201d</p><p>Seemed there always was a catch. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing your cousin Colby in on this. He\u2019s been off the rodeo circuit for a while, but he\u2019s still a pro to the core and I trust his judgment. Two sets of eyes would be better than one, doncha think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d Of all his cousins, Colby was the second least likely to blab to other family members, right behind his cousin Kane.</p><p>\u201cGood. There\u2019s a bunkhouse if you need a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work. Thanks, Cash, I appreciate it more than you know. I\u2019ll see you in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>Soon as he hung up, Chase let out a whoop and spun around.</p><p>Ava stood in the open space between the barn and the fence. Her hands jammed in the front pockets of her hoodie, sunshine glinting off her hair. Looking so drop-dead gorgeous he almost forgot to breathe.</p><p>\u201cThat was a pretty enthusiastic whoop,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>\u201cI got some good news for a change.\u201d</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t ask him to elaborate. \u201cYou ready to rip it up on the ATV?\u201d</p><p>Chase shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta eat first. Is there any food in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the basic stuff I brought. Coffee, creamer, grapes, salad, bread and a couple cans of soup.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you call food? Please tell me you ain\u2019t one of them actresses who starves herself to look like a heroin addict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I starve myself?\u201d</p><p>His gaze might\u2019ve lingered on certain curves longer than polite. \u201cNo, Hollywood, you look exactly like a woman ought to. Let\u2019s head to town. The Shell station has the best chilidogs I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo they have tofu dogs?\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s smile fell. \u201cOh hell no. You\u2019re not a vegetarian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I was?\u201d she intoned sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take it as my sworn duty as the son of a cattleman to send you packing off McKay land immediately.\u201d</p><p>There was that little sexy smirk again. \u201cRelax, cowboy. I\u2019m a carnivore to the core. I seriously doubt Wyoming can boast the best chilidog, but I\u2019m willing to give it a fair shake.\u201d She pointed at him with her car keys. \u201cYou brag, you buy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>When Ava started to jerk on the handle to open the barn door, Chase gently moved her aside. He wasn\u2019t sure if he expected to see her ripping it up in a Ferrari, but the vehicle behind the door was a letdown. A black four-door RAV4. With Colorado plates. \u201cYou didn\u2019t drive here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI flew to Denver, rented this and drove the rest of the way. So I really don\u2019t care if you spill chili and cheese all over the seats.\u201d</p><p>There was another glimpse of her bizarre sense of humor, which made her seem normal and not movie starish.</p><p>In Sundance, Chase pulled his sweatshirt hood over his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to go inside and load them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you help?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFamily. Fans. I\u2019m on the down low, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly am I slathering on these dogs besides chili?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMustard. Onion. A couple of squirts of that fake cheese.\u201d Chase dug a crumpled twenty from his front pocket and pressed it into her hand. \u201cAnd anything else that strikes your fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I leave the car running in case you need to make a quick getaway from your adoring fans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I tell you what. I\u2019ll keep it running in case you do,\u201d he shot back.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re quite the pair, huh?\u201d</p><p>Chase slumped into the seat, trying to stay inconspicuous.</p><p>After almost ten minutes, the car door opened. \u201cCareful, those are hot and oozing stuff out the sides.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat means you did it right.\u201d Chase peeked inside the bag she\u2019d dropped on his lap. Two bundles wrapped in white parchment paper, two single-serving packages of nacho cheese Doritos and two Heath bars. When she shoved two bottles of grape soda in the beverage holders, he gave her a dubious look. \u201cHow\u2019d you know this is exactly what I would\u2019ve gotten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky guess?\u201d She twisted the top on a bottle of soda. \u201cOr maybe there\u2019s an index card that lists Sundance\u2019s own PBR bull rider Chase McKay\u2019s favorites! on the wall by the hot food section.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. That\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere to now?\u201d she asked with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cFollow the signs to Devil\u2019s Tower.\u201d They started the twisty ascent out of Sundance. After a few miles they entered a valley and he said, \u201cTurn left and take the road until it stops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is considered a road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Wyoming? Yes.\u201d</p><p>Once they came around the last bend, Ava said, \u201cOh wow. Look at that view.\u201d</p><p>Devil\u2019s Tower jutted up, the land surrounding it a rainbow palette of red dirt, dark green pine trees, caramel-colored buttes against the backdrop of a cloudless blue sky. \u201cYou like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s spectacular. I\u2019ll bet most tourists don\u2019t even know this view is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome stumble on it. But it\u2019s mostly a local secret.\u201d Chase tossed her a bag of Doritos and a hot dog.</p><p>As he slowly unwrapped his food, the familiar scent of spicy chili, creamy cheese, tangy mustard and onion caused a sharp pang, not of hunger, of homesickness. It\u2019d been ages since he\u2019d taken time to stop at the Shell station that\u2019d at one time been a constant in his life.</p><p>Ava released a long, deep moan. A moan that sounded like a woman about to come undone by pure pleasure.</p><p>Chase shot her a sideways glance. Her beautiful face had a dreamy look best described as post-orgasmic. From sucking on a hot dog?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best chili dog I\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d Ava kept making throaty groans.</p><p>His brain overloaded. He imagined dragging her across the console and giving her another reason to moan. Pushing down her sweatpants and pressing her legs wide open. Burying his face between her thighs. Turning her moans into screams of ecstasy as she came against his mouth in a wet rush.</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>He jumped at the closeness of her voice in his ear and snapped, \u201cJesus, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re just squeezing that chili dog so hard I thought the meat might shoot straight out of the bun.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. He eyed the balled-up wrapper in her hand. \u201cYou finished yours? Already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hungry,\u201d she retorted. \u201cAnd for all your grumbling about being starved, you sure were looking at that hot dog like you wanted to eat something else.\u201d</p><p>You have no idea. Chase took a bite and chewed.</p><p>\u201cCan we skip the ATV thingy today and check out the countryside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And will you drive so I can film?\u201d</p><p>Thank God. Nothing he hated more than being a captive passenger on a trip without purpose. \u201cSure. You want me to choose our route?\u201d</p><p>When her extraordinary aquamarine eyes lit up, Chase was nearly struck stupid by her beauty.</p><p>\u201cThat would be awesome! But I need footage of this spot before we go.\u201d She snagged her cameras off the backseat and hopped from the car.</p><p>Chase ditched his hoodie and exited the SUV. Slipping on his shades, he parked his backside against the front quarter panel and watched her.</p><p>She\u2019d videotape, then grab her camera and click off a few still shots. The elegance of her movements, even simply crouching down in the gravel were naturally graceful. Several strands of glossy brown hair blew around her face, but she didn\u2019t swipe them away. In that moment, Chase wished for a camera to capture the loveliness of Ava\u2019s profile.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cBored yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. It\u2019s a gorgeous day, I\u2019m hauling around a gorgeous...ah, friend. What more could a man want?\u201d</p><p>Her sultry look said a real man should want more. A lot more. Like hot kisses and frantic touches that led to bare skin rubbing on bare skin. Like bodies slamming together, hard breathing and moans of raw pleasure. But Ava didn\u2019t give voice to that image. She didn\u2019t have to. Every thought was right there on her beautiful face.</p><p>Movement on the edge of the ridge caught his eye. \u201cQuick, get your video camera.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the equipment and said, \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Chase pointed to the sky. \u201cThere. Two red-tailed hawks are hovering on a thermal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see them.\u201d They didn\u2019t speak, just watched the grace of the birds. Circling higher, swooping down, then floating, remaining so still they\u2019d look like blots on the horizon to the casual observer. After the birds drifted away, she shut off her camera and faced him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing observant.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ruin the moment and confess if he hadn\u2019t been observing her, he wouldn\u2019t have noticed the birds. He smiled back. \u201cNo problem. You ready to move on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Seeing the long line of tourists at the Devil\u2019s Tower entrance, he suggested an alternative.</p><p>\u201cHow much of this is McKay land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of it.\u201d All of it for the last ten miles in fact. But he knew she couldn\u2019t grasp the enormity of McKay land holdings.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how the ranch succession works. Do you, or will you own part of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since I opted out.\u201d He settled in the driver\u2019s seat and stole glances at her when she talked about expectations of family businesses. \u201cHow does the succession work in yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom was an only child, so she inherited everything. She\u2019s been at the helm of the Cooper Hotel chain and the other businesses in the Cooper conglomerate since before I was born. Since I\u2019ve no interest in running it, my brother has been learning the ropes, but I still own a chunk of it by default.\u201d</p><p>She was an heiress to the Cooper conglomerate, which meant she was loaded. Like really fucking loaded. \u201cThis might sound weird, but as an actress, did you purposely use Cooper as your last name because of...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis Hilton? Yep. Worked for her, didn\u2019t it? But while I\u2019m on sabbatical, I\u2019m Ava Dumond.\u201d</p><p>He drove, although it seemed they stopped every two miles so she could get out and film something new. Everything from gnarled fence posts to different breeds of cows, to clusters of scrub oak. She got a huge kick out of the frolicking calves and the bovine mamas mooing a warning at her.</p><p>Chase noticed the calves were awful young for the time of year. He squinted at the mile marker at the end of the gravel road. Near as he could tell they were near the Glanzers\u2019 place. He\u2019d heard through the McKay grapevine the trio had increased their acreage the past five years and were experimenting with different breeds. He didn\u2019t want to stick around and find out if these late-born calves were theirs.</p><p>Ava put the video camera away. \u201cHow far are we from the closest town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Bored already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Sundance, I\u2019m not bored. Geez. Give me some credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSundance. Funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to use the facilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Chase stopped the car on the edge of the road. He pointed across the field. \u201cSee that tree? It\u2019ll offer some privacy, but be careful when you climb over the barbwire fence. Watch out for snakes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ava\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019ve never... I don\u2019t even know...\u201d</p><p>Chase burst out laughing. \u201cYou oughta see your face, Hollywood. It\u2019s too bad you didn\u2019t give me the camera so I capture your look of horror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking a city girl feel like an idiot at first opportunity?\u201d She sent him an accusatory glance. \u201cDo you treat all your friends this way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t want to be your friend.\u201d</p><p>Same goes, honey pie. \u201cWe\u2019re only about ten miles out of Moorcroft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat because now I\u2019m hungry too.\u201d</p><p>Chase parked up front at the C-Store and Ava jumped out. It occurred to him when he saw the familiar dark-haired woman lingering by the front door that he should\u2019ve chosen the back lot.</p> <p>When Ava slid back into the seat, Chase wrapped an arm around her shoulders, hauling her close, nestling his face into the base of her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look, but my cousin Keely is standing by the door and she\u2019s awful damn interested in us. Just stay like this for a sec, okay? Looks like were making out and hopefully she\u2019ll trot her snoopy self into the store.\u201d</p><p>Ava angled her head until her lips brushed his cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware, but I\u2019m a method actor. Which means I prefer we make out for real so I can get into character.\u201d</p><p>Chase groaned. \u201cYou are the devil, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Her low, sexy chuckle vibrated against his jaw. \u201cThat\u2019s me, Ava the evil temptress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTalk about tempting.\u201d Against his better judgment, he let his nose follow the sweetly scented arch of her neck. \u201cDamn, woman, do you smell great right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I actually smell like that all over.\u201d</p><p>Before he stupidly demanded she prove it and strip down to skin, he kissed the hollow of her throat. Then he peered over her shoulder. \u201cCoast is clear. Let\u2019s go while we can.\u201d He threw it in reverse and they were back on the road.</p><p>Ava waved a piece of red licorice at him. \u201cWant some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really a fan of licorice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite sweet besides a Heath bar?\u201d</p><p>Chase settled in now that Moorcroft was in the rearview mirror. \u201cActually, I\u2019m not a big sweets eater.\u201d</p><p>She jammed a piece of licorice in her mouth and reached for her camera. \u201cSo, friend, can I ask you a question?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn who you plan on showing the answer to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoken like a man who\u2019s been burned by camera-phone video capabilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see that clip on YouTube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one? The one where the blonde chick is riding you like a jockey while her friend is giving commentary and taping? Or the one where you\u2019re on the receiving end of serious oral worship?\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cNot that I gave either clip more than a brief glance.\u201d</p><p>Chase scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s why I make sure no one\u2019s cell phone is within reach anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So it didn\u2019t change your behavior with the ladies, just changed your behavior with technology?\u201d</p><p>Shrewd woman. \u201cGetting off track here, Hollywood. My question was who gets to view this?\u201d</p><p>Ava lowered the camera, but Chase knew it was running. \u201cMe. It\u2019s a personal video diary of how I spent my summer vacation.\u201d</p><p>He grudgingly said, \u201cOkay, but if any part of this video diary is made public, I will hire Ginger\u2014or worse\u2014to sue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, that\u2019s mean. But understood.\u201d She fiddled with the camera. \u201cMy first question is, what\u2019s the best thing that ever happened to you? On a personal level or on a professional level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne and the same for me.\u201d Did that make him sound one-dimensional? \u201cThe best thing was when I won the Man of Steel competition last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the worst thing that ever happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting kicked off the PBR Tour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d pick something else. Something tragic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone has tragedy in their lives that defines them.\u201d And even if he did, he\u2019d never share it. \u201cSame questions back atcha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest thing was landing a role on Miller\u2019s Ridge. Worst thing? When my Grandpa Cooper died. All people talked about was my inheritance. Like I was so greedy and entitled I\u2019d blow every penny he\u2019d worked so hard for on stupid shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stupid shit?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>A beat passed. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize my battery is low. Enough for today.\u201d She yawned. \u201cI think I might take a nap when we get back.\u201d</p><p>Interesting how quickly she shut down his questions. He let it slide. This time. \u201cSounds good. I\u2019m dragging a bit myself.\u201d</p><p>The remainder of the drive was quiet. At the trailer, Ava grabbed her laptop and retreated to the bedroom.</p><p>Chase was restless. He\u2019d left his phone and saw he\u2019d missed a call from Elroy. And from his former traveling partner, Justin Donohue. And from his brother Ben. None left messages.</p><p>Probably because they know you won\u2019t call them back.</p><p>With nothing else to do, he brought up the search engine on his phone and typed in Ava Cooper, just to see what shook loose.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Ava downloaded her footage to her computer. Groggy from the heat in the trailer, she stripped, stretched out on the bed and fell sound asleep.</p><p>She woke at eleven o\u2019clock at night feeling refreshed. After slipping on her clothes, she wandered into the kitchen.</p><p>Oh, looky there. The delicious dish known as Chase McKay sat on the counter, looking good enough to eat.</p><p>Why yes. I\u2019d love to be your appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert. One serving of hot, hunky cowboy coming right up.</p><p>Behave, Ava.</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d gone to bed,\u201d Chase said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I did crash for a while. Before that I had some things to catch up on. Takes a boatload of time to download everything from my cameras into the right folders on my laptop. Then I transferred the notes I jotted down so I don\u2019t forget things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds tedious. Why are you doin\u2019 this again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying my hand at having a hobby,\u201d she said sardonically. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m not getting paid. Don\u2019t you ever do something just because you\u2019ve always wanted to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say as I have. In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite. I find myself doin\u2019 stuff I don\u2019t wanna do all the damn time.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s smile vanished. \u201cYou could\u2019ve said no if you didn\u2019t want to squire me around today.\u201d She turned and walked away.</p><p>A thump sounded and then strong hands circled her waist, spinning her around. He got in her face, as much as he could despite her height advantage. \u201cWill you let me finish? I wasn\u2019t talking about you. Or today. Today was great, Ava. I had a blast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. Seems I never do things like that. At least I don\u2019t take the time to do them because I\u2019m so busy doin\u2019 other things I don\u2019t wanna do. These last two weeks off have shown me I\u2019m not really living my life. I\u2019m just killing time between bull ridin\u2019 events. And I don\u2019t make the best decisions on what to do with that free time.\u201d</p><p>Mollified and surprised by his honesty, Ava forced her hands to remain at her sides. She freely gave casual affection to friends and lovers alike, but something about Chase\u2019s body language cautioned her to hold back, afraid he\u2019d misread her friendliness as a sexual come-on. Didn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t flirt her ass off with him, but touching without invitation was a definite no-no. \u201cDon\u2019t you have buddies you hang out with when you\u2019re not rodeoing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Truth is, I\u2019m a little low on friends. So, thanks for today.\u201d</p><p>Did Chase show anyone this sweet side? Probably not. Why that filled her with warmth was stupidly juvenile. \u201cYou are welcome. I\u2019m a little low on friends myself, so I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t kill you with a karate chop to the head last night.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDeath by nekkid ninja don\u2019t sound so bad.\u201d</p><p>Do not give me false hope you\u2019ve been imagining me naked. \u201cWhat have you been doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. I sat outside and watched the sunset. You really oughta tape it tomorrow night. I was rummaging in the cupboards for food and found this.\u201d He reached around her and waggled a bottle of Maker\u2019s Mark whisky.</p><p>\u201cOoh. Liquid dinner? I\u2019m all over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. \u2019Cause there\u2019s really no food, but I did find a six-pack in the vegetable drawer.\u201d</p><p>Ava stood on tiptoe to reach two shot glasses from the top shelf. She spun around and Chase didn\u2019t bother to pretend he hadn\u2019t been ogling her ass. After they sat at the table, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s have a toast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>To the sexy way your hat shadows your face. To your full lower lip that looks so succulent I wanna take a bite out of it. To your hands, big and scarred, and how that rough flesh would feel dancing across on my skin.</p><p>\u201cAva?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed her escalating lust. \u201cOh, I dunno. We could toast to Kane and Ginger for allowing us to hide out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Ava poured them each a shot. They held the shot glasses aloft. \u201cTo Kane and Ginger.\u201d</p><p>He chinked his glass to hers and threw back his whisky.</p><p>She followed suit. The alcohol disappeared down the hatch, leaving a trail of fire, and she sputtered.</p><p>\u201cThe second one will be better.\u201d Chase refilled their glasses and passed out two bottles of Coors Light.</p><p>\u201cAnother shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. I thought you were a wild party girl, Hollywood. Least, that\u2019s what the tabloids say about you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd I thought you\u2019d have me tied to the bed with your bull rope by now, making me scream your name as you rode me hard,\u201d she retorted sweetly. \u201cThat\u2019s what the rodeo mags say about you, Chase\u2019n Tail McKay.\u201d Ava leaned forward, gifting him with an excellent view of her cleavage. \u201cDid you Google me while I was sleeping, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>Took a second for his eyes to meet hers. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo juicy YouTube videos of you caught in indecent sex acts. But I did check out your website. I realized I had seen you in something a while back. A TV movie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one where you played a prep school girl hooked on...some kinda drugs and you sold your body to feed the addiction. Until a young priest rescued you, setting you back on the straight and narrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Naughty Girl by Night. One of my first roles. I\u2019m surprised you even know what Lifetime TV is, say nothing of catching the \u2018ripped from the headlines\u2019 drama every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was killing time one afternoon before a PBR event, and I distinctly remember I kept watching just to catch a glimpse of your legs in them short miniskirts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a leg man?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSugar,\u201d he said with a silky rasp, \u201cI\u2019m an everything man. Any woman I find attractive? Every single part of her is sexy to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still going to give this abstinence thing a whirl?\u201d</p><p>His face turned somber very quickly. \u201cI have to. My career is at stake. I\u2019ve worked too damn long and hard to be forced out because I fucked the wrong woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says with a bitter edge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. We\u2019ve gotten off track. My turn to make a toast. But I\u2019ll warn ya, I\u2019m not very original.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA toast to both of us reigniting that magic spark so we can continue to do what we love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot original, my ass,\u201d she mumbled and sucked down the liquid in a single gulp, releasing a heartfelt, \u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood stuff. If we keep this up, we\u2019ll owe Kane a full bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s keep going.\u201d</p><p>He raised both eyebrows. \u201cYou sure? It\u2019s kinda late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like either of us has to get up early. And besides, I\u2019m not tired. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Since we\u2019re both licking our wounds from a lie in one form or another, let\u2019s play a game called Truth or Lie.\u201d</p> <p>Chase looked at her suspiciously. \u201cWhat kinda game is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell you something about myself, and you try to figure out if it\u2019s a lie or the truth. If it\u2019s a lie and you call it as such, I drink. If you make a wrong call either way, you drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aiming to get shitfaced tonight, Ava?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNo one around here but us, Sundance. And since we\u2019ve decided to be friends\u2014\u201d she emphasized the word with a hiss because it stung her pride this beautiful, rugged, manly man didn\u2019t want to take her for a test ride, \u201c\u2014I think we should get to know each other better. I\u2019ll even go first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how this is fair, you bein\u2019 a professional actress and all,\u201d Chase grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou might as well have called me a professional liar, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the stiletto fits...\u201d He dodged her kick under the table. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny bein\u2019 an actress gives you an advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck it up, cowboy. I\u2019m betting your poker face is damn impressive when you\u2019re in pain and showing the fans and your sponsors you\u2019re feeling just fine.\u201d</p><p>He sipped his beer. \u201cPoint taken. Okay, Hollywood, daze and confuse me with a page from the book of Ava.\u201d</p><p>What to start with? \u201cI posed nude early in my career and the photos caught the eye of a producer who ended up giving me my first acting job.\u201d</p><p>Chase cocked his head, studying her. \u201cLie. You might\u2019ve had nekkid pictures done, but my guess is no one has seen them.\u201d</p><p>Ava couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d lost the first question. \u201cBusted. Your turn.\u201d</p><p>He topped off her glass. \u201cBefore I ever got on a bull, I practiced my skills by ridin\u2019 sheep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard the joke\u2014Wyoming: where men are men and sheep are nervous. You\u2019re trying to trip me up, McKay, so I\u2019m gonna say...lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Truth. The rodeo event \u2018mutton bustin\u2019 is a kid\u2019s precursor to bull and bronc ridin\u2019. That\u2019s where a lot of riders get their first taste of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot. I\u2019m gonna be hammered in no time flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you this was your idea. But I\u2019m thinking we should alternate beer with whiskey.\u201d</p><p>Ava held the shot glass between her palms. Maybe Chase wouldn\u2019t notice if she didn\u2019t drink it right away.</p><p>\u201cDrink up so you can ask your question,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>Dammit. She tossed the amber liquid into her mouth, suppressing a shudder. Time to put on her game face. \u201cTruth or lie: my younger brother\u2019s name is Axel because my mother heard \u2018Sweet Child O\u2019 Mine\u2019 on the radio in the delivery room when she was in labor with him.\u201d</p><p>Chase was quiet for a moment, then he laughed. \u201cEasy. Lie. I doubt your mother has heard of the band Guns N\u2019 Roses, let alone knows who the lead singer is.\u201d</p><p>She nudged the full shot glass at him. \u201cBottoms up. Truth. My brother\u2019s full name is Axel Rose Cooper Dumond. My mom heard the song, which is one of her all-time faves, in the throes of labor. And since my middle name is Rose, she believed it was a sign to name her baby boy Axel, after Axel Rose. FYI, Mom is a total rocker chick and a huge fan of \u201980s metal bands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d Chase drank his shot. \u201cSo, Ava Rose, what did your dad have to say about naming his son Axel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he is a mechanic, so it fits. But it was way better than the name he had picked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFestus Merle.\u201d</p><p>Chase frowned. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d Ava challenged. \u201cOr are you afraid you\u2019ll have to drink again?\u201d</p><p>A cocky smile spread across Chase\u2019s face and heat curled in her belly. Oh, she so didn\u2019t want to be just friends with this beautiful man. She wanted to taste that smirk on his lips. Suck the whisky from his tongue. And when he laughed? She could almost picture her head on his chest as she listened to that deep rumble.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t afraid because I call bullshit on that one too.\u201d</p><p>Ava splashed beer in his glass. \u201cHave another. Because it\u2019s one hundred percent true. My dad wanted the name Marshall Dillon Dumond. Since my mother vetoes his first suggestion on anything, he came up with Festus Merle, knowing she\u2019d be horrified. Then when he sprang Marshall Dillon on her, she\u2019d agree it was much better and he\u2019d get his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad is a big Gunsmoke fan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We watched westerns every day after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents don\u2019t sound at all like I\u2019d pictured them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you picture them?\u201d</p><p>He stretched out in his chair. \u201cLike the rest of them rich, slick, skinny plastic people on TV who live in California. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t want for much growing up, but they kept a close eye on my brother and me. My dad is proud to be blue collar and refused to let us turn into rich-kid brats.\u201d She sipped her water. \u201cWhat are your parents like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad\u2019s a rancher, my mom\u2019s a ranch wife. They\u2019ve been married a long time. But they almost didn\u2019t get married at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s dad was a preacher and didn\u2019t want his daughter runnin\u2019 around with one of them \u2018wild McKay boys\u2019 so he packed up their whole family and moved them from Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Chase smirked. \u201cYou tell me. Or are you afraid you\u2019ll have to drink again?\u201d</p><p>Fifty-fifty chance. She studied his face. Too impassive. The last thing he\u2019d told her had been the truth, so this one had to be... \u201cLie. I\u2019ll bet your mom and dad were high school sweethearts and haven\u2019t been apart since they met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. Drink up.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and swallowed the beer in one gulp. \u201cOkay. Now tell me the whole story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently my grandfather thought my dad\u2019s family was a bunch of immoral heathens. He sent my mom away to a private Christian high school in Colorado when it looked like my mom and dad were getting too serious. As soon as he found a replacement preacher for his parish in Hulett, they were long gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how did your mom and dad get back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to my dad, they\u2019d lost contact and she just showed up in Sundance one day, four years later. He took one look at her and knew why he hadn\u2019t settled down. They were married within the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomantic ain\u2019t the first word that comes to mind when I think of my folks. How about your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom wrecked her car. She took it to a repair shop and my dad chewed her out for her casual disregard of such a beautiful piece of machinery. Sparks flew. Literally. Dad was welding. They disliked each other intensely, yet somehow they ended up sneaking off to Vegas a month later to get married. They\u2019ve been together ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? That\u2019s romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver come close to dropping to one knee and popping the question?\u201d</p><p>Chase shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t found a woman who doesn\u2019t drive me crazy after two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Ava lifted her eyebrows. \u201cYour longest relationship has been two weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive or take.\u201d He gazed at her from beneath the brim of his hat. \u201cWhat about you? Been planning your wedding since you were a little girl?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m all for a secluded beach wedding with no one around except the officiant and my intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your longest relationship?\u201d he asked.</p><p>At least they\u2019d slowed down on the shots. Her head was getting muzzy. \u201cJake, the bastard switch-hitter, and I were together for six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether as in...living together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019d been in Vancouver for most the TV season.\u201d</p><p>Chase frowned. \u201cSo you had no idea what he was doin\u2019 when he was away from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t see him. I flew to Vancouver or he came to LA. When he came back to LA, I was dealing with my show getting cancelled and didn\u2019t think anything of him spending so much time with his new friend Decker.\u201d She groaned. \u201cMaybe the tabloids were right. How didn\u2019t I see they were so into each other? I\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He curled his hand around hers. \u201cHey. Sometimes we see what we want to. Doesn\u2019t make you an idiot, Ava. In my mind, it makes you a victim. He lied to you. Used you. Set you up. It sucks that it was played out in public. You\u2019re handling it better than most would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Chase smiled and squeezed her hand, peering at her closely. \u201cYou still wanna play this game?\u201d</p><p>For a second, she hoped he\u2019d meant the game they were playing, pretending not to be wildly attracted to each other. But when he kept staring at her, she understood he was referring to the actual drinking game. \u201cAh. Sure. My turn, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Think, Ava. Something...sexy. \u201cIn an episode of Miller\u2019s Ridge, I shared a steamy onscreen kiss with my female costar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I don\u2019t watch TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans you have a fifty-fifty chance of guessing...wrong.\u201d When she glanced up and saw his gaze focused on her lips, she knew he\u2019d been imagining that girl-on-girl liplock. In full detail.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cSorry. A total lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He was a bit slower knocking that one back. But when he looked at her again, he had a glimmer in his eye. \u201cMy turn. First time I rode a bull, my cup damn near pinched off my balls.\u201d</p><p>She winced in sympathy. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll bet that hurt.\u201d Her eyes roamed his angular face, noticing the color spreading across his cheekbones. Talking about it embarrassed him. She permitted a small, smug smile. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>His wicked grin appeared and he topped off her glass. \u201cLie. Bull riders don\u2019t wear a cup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit. I am so not playing poker with you.\u201d Ava sucked in a breath and held it while she slammed the whisky. She let out a stream of air that sounded like a hiss.</p><p>\u201cAre you starting to feel the effects of your losing streak, Ava Rose?\u201d</p> <p>God she loved the husky way he drew out her whole name. \u201cLosing streak? I believe we\u2019re tied.\u201d Or maybe Chase was right. Maybe she was losing because the shots were blurring together. Ava squinted at him. \u201cAre you feeling the whisky at all? Or am I just a lightweight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feelin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>She tried really hard to concentrate on those tempting lips and smoky-blue bedroom eyes, but his handsome face kept swimming out of focus.</p><p>\u201cAva? You okay?\u201d</p><p>Instead of admitting No, I am totally wasted, she offered him the charming smile she was known for. \u201cJust thinking about the subject of lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest lie you ever told?\u201d</p><p>That I\u2019m not gonna sleep with you.</p><p>Jesus. Where had that come from?</p><p>The booze, probably.</p><p>Ironic, they\u2019d been talking about alcohol-fueled mistakes. No way would Chase let his whisky throw-down with her become an excuse to take her to bed.</p><p>Besides, Ava Cooper, TV star, was out of his league. Way out. The rich girl bombshell wouldn\u2019t have looked at him twice if they hadn\u2019t accidentally ended up hiding out at the same place. Plus, her feminine pride and sexual self-esteem had taken a blow because of her asshole gay ex-boyfriend, so naturally she wanted to prove her sex appeal to a man. Any man. He just happened to be convenient.</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t like being convenient.</p><p>\u201cHey, cowboy, are you ignoring me because I\u2019m drunk?\u201d Ava clapped a hand over her mouth and giggled.</p><p>\u201cI think we oughta call it a night, Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine by me.\u201d She stood. Swayed. And would\u2019ve hit the floor if Chase had slower reflexes.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, there. Not so fast.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled deeply. Exhaled gustily. \u201cYou know today when you said I smelled great? Well, I\u2019ll bet you smell great all over too.\u201d She nuzzled the side of his head.</p><p>\u201cStop sniffing me. It tickles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else are you ticklish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feet.\u201d</p><p>Ava frowned. \u201cLie. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re most ticklish behind your balls. I bet I can prove it.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re on. Let\u2019s test your theory right now.</p><p>No. No. No. No.</p><p>\u201cAh, Ava, we\u2019re not playing the game anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Shoot. Everything is spinning anyway. I just really need to go to sleep now. Nighty night.\u201d She started down the hallway, stripping clothes as she bounced from wall to wall like a slow-moving pinball.</p><p>The seven\u2014or was it eight?\u2014shots hit him full force. The hallway became a tunnel-like funhouse mirror. Distorted. Sideways. He stretched his arms into a T and put one wobbly foot in front of the other.</p><p>He had to stop and grip the doorframe leading to the bedroom when he saw Ava sprawled face first on the mattress. Would you lookit that. He might be drunk, but he wasn\u2019t fuckin\u2019 blind.</p><p>The sweetest, tightest, most delectable ass he\u2019d ever seen\u2014and he\u2019d seen more than his fair share of nice asses\u2014just begging to be caressed. Kissed. Squeezing those perfectly round globes as he hiked her hips up and slid his cock inside her.</p><p>As he took another step, he tripped over a shoe, or his own damn feet, and went skidding across the carpet. The room spun as he rolled to his back, blinking at the ceiling.</p><p>The bed jiggled. Soft, fragrant strands of hair teased his chest and then an angel\u2019s face was suspended above him.</p><p>\u201cCowboy? You all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need help getting up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I never need help getting it up. That\u2019s my problem.\u201d He laughed. Hard. No idea why because it wasn\u2019t particularly funny, but Ava must\u2019ve seen the humor because she busted a gut right along with him. After wiping the tears from his blurred vision, he mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m actually pretty comfy. I might just crash here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Come up on the bed. There\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>Chase rolled to his knees. Clambered on the bed. The last thing he remembered before he passed out was Ava slurring, \u201cPillow fight!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell is goin\u2019 on here?\u201d</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t recognize the voice, the loud voice, reverberating in her skull like a jackhammer. She shifted on the mattress and felt the warm weight of something on her butt.</p><p>Turning her head required effort, but somehow she managed and found herself staring into Chase McKay\u2019s handsome face. Wait a second. How had she ended up in bed with the sexy cowboy? When he\u2019d reiterated that he wouldn\u2019t sleep with her?</p><p>\u201cEarth to Ava,\u201d a feminine voice trilled.</p><p>Now that voice she recognized. Ginger.</p><p>Ava reached down and removed Chase\u2019s hand from her ass and rolled onto her back. Bright sunlight from the window stabbed her retinas and she groaned.</p><p>Chase stirred. His leg repeatedly rubbed against hers, sending goose bumps dancing up her thighs.</p><p>\u201cChase. We have company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet rid of \u2019em. Christ, I have a headache.\u201d</p><p>She poked him in the ribs until he turned over.</p><p>Kane was crouched by the bed, looking slightly amused. \u201cServes you right, Chase, for drinkin\u2019 all my goddamned whisky.\u201d</p><p>Chase jackknifed, and his hands flew up to cradle his head. \u201cOw. Fuck. Yell in my ear again, cuz, and I\u2019ll give the whisky right back to you in another form.\u201d</p><p>Kane laughed.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been here a day and you\u2019re already sleeping together?\u201d</p><p>Ava finally looked at Ginger. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Ginger arched an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI know what it looks like. But Chase and I are just friends. Right, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you and me ain\u2019t never drinkin\u2019 together again.\u201d</p><p>Her answering laugh sent a spike of pain to her brain.</p><p>Chase scooted back to rest against the headboard and glared at Kane and Ginger. \u201cWoulda been nice if you\u2019d told us that we\u2019d be roommates. Teenage Ninja Turtle over there almost killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please.\u201d Ava yanked the sheet to her waist as she sat up. \u201cLike it wasn\u2019t ten kinds of scary for a city girl to be out in the middle of nowhere, woken up in the dead of night by a half-naked guy wearing a big hat and carrying a duffle bag that has ropes in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as shootin\u2019 didn\u2019t have on my cowboy hat when I was headed for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how I saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you saw anything since your eyes were half-covered by a fancy piece of pink fluff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call bullshit on that. You\u2019re just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kane whistled shrilly and both Chase and Ava winced. \u201cEnough. Don\u2019t be blaming me or my wife, because we kept your secrets. We only realized this morning what\u2019d happened, which is why we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Ava looked at Chase. She didn\u2019t like scruffy whiskers on men, but on him? A whole \u2019nother story. Gave him a harsher edge. Toned down his almost too-perfect good looks.</p><p>Why don\u2019t you just write the man a fucking sonnet?</p><p>God. What was wrong with her? She never got moon-eyed over a guy. Never.</p><p>Chase frowned at her. \u201cWhy are you starin\u2019 at me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lie. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a serious case of bedhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou oughta talk. Your hair looks like you stuck your hand in a bug zapper,\u201d he shot back.</p><p>She reached for the ponytail holder on the nightstand and began to twist her unruly hair into a messy bun. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p> <p>But Chase\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t on her makeshift hairdo. His gaze was firmly glued to her breasts shifting beneath the tight tank top. He swallowed hard. But he didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>Aha. So the cowboy was a breast man. She\u2019d live in cleavage-enhancing shirts if it\u2019d make him rethink his \u201cjust friends\u201d mindset.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we oughta get dressed,\u201d Chase suggested, staring at her nipples. \u201cIn long sleeves. It appears to be cold in here.\u201d</p><p>Damn smartass man.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Kane said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in the kitchen.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d forgotten Ginger and Kane were in the room.</p><p>Chase set his feet on the floor and scooped up his clothes. He muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t remember getting undressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>He squinted at her over his shoulder. \u201cI take less time in the bathroom so I\u2019ll go first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Soon as she heard the bathroom door close, she jumped up. Ooh. Too fast. Made her woozy. She slipped on a pair of Capri-style yoga pants and her Santa Clara community college sweatshirt.</p><p>As she passed the bathroom, she paused. Her mouth tasted like ass. The shower was running and Chase probably wouldn\u2019t notice if she just popped in and grabbed her toothbrush and toothpaste.</p> <p>Ava turned the door handle. Unlocked. She slowly pushed the door open and came face-to-face with a completely nude Chase. Her eyes followed the dark line of hair\u2014his treasure trail\u2014stopping when she hit the mother lode. Wow. Chase was aroused. And well hung. Very well hung.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Hollywood. Do you not understand privacy at all?\u201d</p><p>Rather than reminding him the door had a lock, she said, \u201cI need my toothbrush.\u201d</p><p>He stomped closer, which caused his dick to jump against his belly. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Chase, relax. It\u2019s just a penis. And here\u2019s a newsflash for you. I\u2019ve seen other penises, so it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Such a liar, Ava.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal to me,\u201d he snarled. \u201cGet the fuck out of the bathroom and wait your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me grab my toothbrush and toothpaste and I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your eyes off my junk and you\u2019ll see that I have your toothbrush and toothpaste in my hand.\u201d</p> <p>Oh shit. She raised her gaze only high enough to see, yes indeed, Chase was holding her oral hygiene supplies. She snatched them from him and exited the bathroom.</p><p>The door slammed behind her. She heard the lock click and some pretty choice swear words.</p><p>She stopped outside the kitchen upon seeing Kane and Ginger in a private moment. His lower back rested against the counter with the front of Ginger\u2019s body pressed to his. He had one hand fisted in her hair as he kissed the side of her neck and he\u2019d jammed his other hand in the back pocket of her jeans. Everything about the way they were entwined together screamed love, not just lovers.</p><p>Despite Ava\u2019s joy that Ginger found a man who loved her so completely, Ava felt a smidgen of jealousy. Would she ever find that total love and acceptance for herself?</p><p>She cleared her throat and the couple parted.</p><p>Kane grinned unrepentantly. \u201cI tend to get carried away when I have alone time with my beautiful wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine,\u201d she said distractedly, staring at the section of skin where Ginger\u2019s blouse had slipped down. \u201cSince when do you have a tattoo?\u201d</p><p>Ginger\u2019s fingers brushed her left shoulder. \u201cI got it after the twins were born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe McKay brand.\u201d Ginger rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, don\u2019t look so appalled. It\u2019s not a symbol of ownership. It\u2019s become a tradition for the women who marry into the McKay family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho started the tradition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely. When she was the only McKay girl. After she married Jack Donohue, she insisted that he, like the other spouses who married into the family, should be tattooed with the McKay brand. Jack refused\u2014not surprising if you knew Jack\u2014and insisted Keely tattoo his initials on her body, since she was no longer a McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d that work out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely had India put Jack\u2019s initials below the pair of lips tattooed on her butt.\u201d Kane shook his head. \u201cAnd Jack thought once they were married she\u2019d become docile. That girl is about as tame as a mountain lion.\u201d</p><p>Ava grinned. \u201cI knew I liked her. Now if you\u2019ll step aside, I need to use the sink.\u201d</p><p>Kane squinted at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird. Watchin\u2019 you on TV you always look so much smaller. I forget how tall you are in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look short on Miller\u2019s Ridge because my costar, Alex Summers, is six foot six. He\u2019s the first man who makes me look petite.\u201d But he\u2019s not the first guy who made me feel small.</p><p>Dammit. No negativity today.</p><p>After she washed her face and brushed her teeth, Ava started a pot of coffee. A jolt of caffeine would lessen the pounding in her head. She stared out the window, lost in thought, and only roused herself when she heard Chase join Kane and Ginger\u2019s conversation about other McKay family members.</p><p>Ginger sidled up next to her. \u201cSorry about the Chase mix- up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t give you a choice. And I really do appreciate you guys letting me crash here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you figured anything out?\u201d</p><p>She gave Ginger a wry look. \u201cBesides that I\u2019m never drinking Maker\u2019s Mark again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m shooting things that interest me with my video camera. Don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do with any of it, but that\u2019s the whole point. Trying to figure some of this out. Who I am when I\u2019m not in Hollywood. What I want to do when I go back, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I hope you\u2019re not factoring Chase into your plans for the time you\u2019re here.\u201d Ginger dropped her voice. \u201cChase is a great guy for the most part. A little too self-involved to the McKays\u2019 liking. But they\u2019re all so damn proud of him they\u2019ll forgive his neglectful behavior. That said, Ava, do not get mixed-up with him. Woman trouble follows him everywhere and you don\u2019t need that after what you\u2019ve dealt with lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Kane giving Chase the same advice? Don't get mixed up with Ava because man trouble follows her everywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Ava, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to worry because nothing is going on between us. I swear. We\u2019re just friends. We had a blast hanging out yesterday. And to be honest, Chase understands better than anyone what I\u2019ve gone through with the press since he\u2019s gone through the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Ginger seemed surprised by Ava\u2019s observation. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you still see me as the clueless seventeen-year-old girl who stumbled into your law office by mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Ginger bumped Ava with her hip. \u201cWhile you\u2019re contemplating life and your place in it...do something about that chip on your shoulder, eh?\u201d</p><p>Ava laughed. But it felt forced, not that Ginger noticed. \u201cSo, tell me all about the McKay brood.\u201d</p><p>Kane and Ginger were enamored with their offspring but clearly exhausted. Maddie\u2019s temper was a testament to her red hair. Hayden had christened the corkscrew tufts on Maddie\u2019s head her \u201cmean curls\u201d and lamented the fact Paul was a climber and constantly pulled the chess board to the floor. Since Ginger\u2019s father lived with them, he was a big help to keeping some semblance of order in the house. But the way they described it, it sounded more like a zoo.</p><p>\u201cOh, before I forget, Ava, did you leave your car parked out front yesterday?\u201d</p><p>Ava looked at Kane. \u201cOnly for about five minutes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase\u2019s brother Ben passed by and wondered if someone was staying here. He called this morning, so I had to tell him you were in town, but to keep it quiet.\u201d Kane looked at Chase when he opened his mouth. \u201cI told them about Ava to cover your ass, cuz, so no complaints from you. But I suggest you keep your truck outta sight.\u201d Kane stood and held his hand out to Ginger. \u201cCome on, Red. I need your help checkin\u2019 that gate before we head home.\u201d</p><p>Ginger looked confused. \u201cWhat gate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, the gate we talked about on the way over here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh! That gate.\u201d She blushed. \u201cAh, sure. I\u2019d be happy to help.\u201d Ginger paused at the door. \u201cIf you need anything, call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the door shut, Chase snickered. \u201cFixin\u2019 a gate, my ass. Kane is fixin\u2019 to have his way with his wife in his pickup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs \u2018gate\u2019 some kind of country euphemism for sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But I believe our bein\u2019 in their love nest has forced them to get creative for their marital activities.\u201d</p><p>She really had no response for that.</p><p>\u201cEver done it in a pickup, Hollywood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Don\u2019t ask. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s I-can-rock-your-world grin turned her knees weak. \u201cI was born and raised in Wyoming. Never had any vehicle that wasn\u2019t a truck...so what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think imagining you and me fogging up the windows and rocking the wheels until the suspension squeaks isn\u2019t helping get sex off my brain.\u201d Ava set her coffee cup on the table. \u201cMy turn in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>He yelled, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to lock the door.\u201d</p><p>Doubtful he saw her flip him off.</p><p>Later that evening, they were playing a rousing game of Go Fish when headlights swept the kitchen window.</p><p>\u201cWere you expecting someone?\u201d Chase said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not from around here, remember?

He grabbed Ava by the elbow and dragged her out of sight.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing, Chase?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shush me.

Don\u2019t know if you remember me, but we met at Kane and Ginger\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>Ava smirked at Chase and yelled, \u201cOf course I remember, you, Ben. Hang on, let me throw on some clothes and I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you fuckin\u2019 serious?\u201d Chase hissed in her ear. \u201cYou cannot let my brother in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I can. And if you don\u2019t want to be found out as my dirty little secret, you\u2019d better stay in the bedroom.\u201d Ava sidestepped him, slipped on her Juicy jacket and fluffed her hair. Then she made a shooing motion at him. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this,\u201d he muttered, stealthily snagging his duffel bag. He left the bedroom door ajar, hoping the hallway had decent acoustics.</p><p>\u201cBen! Wow. You look great. Thanks so much for taking the time to check on this poor city mouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble. Just bein\u2019 neighborly.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. Ben lived twenty-five fucking miles from here. Maybe Ben would see Ava was fine and skedaddle on home. Chase just hoped Ava wouldn\u2019t offer him a beer.</p> <p>\u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d Ava asked with entirely too much cheer for Chase\u2019s liking.</p><p>\u201cA beer would be great.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. They sat in the easy chairs, which meant Chase had no way to see them and could only hear his brother making charming small talk with Ava.</p><p>\u201cKane and Ginger swung by today, and told me you\u2019d seen my car out front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta admit I was surprised that we had a beautiful celebrity in our midst again.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. When Ben spewed that lame bullshit, he actually got laid? Unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cMore like a fugitive than a celebrity since I\u2019m on the lamb from my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read about that nasty business with your ex. You okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGetting there. Needed time to clear my head and there\u2019s too much smog in LA to do that, so I headed for wide-open spaces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not finding it too isolated out here?\u201d</p><p>Why don\u2019t you just come out and ask to spend the night so you can keep her safe?</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get bored or lonely, or hell, just hungry, call me. I\u2019m a decent cook and I get tired of cooking for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ben, I may do that.\u201d</p><p>Their voices dropped. All Chase could hear were Ben\u2019s deep murmurs and Ava\u2019s occasional trills of laughter. He fumed, wondering how Ben\u2019s impromptu visit had turned into an extended stay.</p><p>Then Ben\u2019s voice reached him, clear as a bell. \u201cYou might as well come out, Chase. I know you\u2019re back there. I recognize that damn cologne you bathe in. And your boots are by the door.\u201d</p><p>Chase wandered out of the bedroom and faced his older brother. Even as a kid Ben owned an air of fortitude. Since Ben smiled and laughed more than their oldest brother, Quinn, everyone assumed Ben was easygoing. Laid-back.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t. Not by a long shot. Ben had a level of intensity that could be downright scary. Luckily Ben hadn\u2019t inherited the tendency to use his fists to solve problems, a trait some of their McKay cousins shared. He didn\u2019t mince words, didn\u2019t have time for bullshit or lies. When a man was defined by how hard he worked, Chase always thought of Bennett McKay first.</p><p>\u201cWould you excuse us?\u201d Ben asked as he stood. \u201cI need to talk to my little brother outside for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Ava tossed off a breezy, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Ben exited the trailer. He kept walking until they were by the barn. Then he faced Chase, hands on his hips, his tone as cold as steel. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? You come home and stay at Kane\u2019s place and don\u2019t let any of your family know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s brain started to form a lie, but his mouth wouldn\u2019t give voice to it. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry? You too good for us now? Do your country kin embarrass the big time PBR bull rider?\u201d</p><p>Shame made heat flare in his cheeks. \u201cGoddammit, Ben, no, I ain\u2019t that way, you know that. I got kicked off the tour and didn\u2019t want you guys to know because I don\u2019t want any of you to think less of me than you already do.\u201d</p><p>Ben stared at him. Hard. With such a mix of emotions swimming in his eyes that Chase couldn\u2019t look away. Then he said curtly, \u201cThe truth about what went down. All of it. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Chase relayed everything.</p><p>His brother walked to the fence. Gazed across the pasture. Walked back. \u201cOkay. I believe you.\u201d</p><p>That stung. Ben\u2019s first thought was he\u2019d been lying? Right. Ben had caught Chase in lies more times than he cared to admit.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t get to toss off the \u2018think less of you\u2019 bullshit comment because that\u2019s a total lie. We\u2019re all proud of you, Chase. But the fact is, you ain\u2019t proud of yourself. And I get sick and tired of us\u2014your family\u2014bein\u2019 dead last on your list of priorities. You should\u2019ve come to us first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Last time I came home, I ended up staying with Tell because Mom was having the entire inside of the house repainted, Quinn and Libby\u2019s kids were sick, and you had \u2018plans\u2019, so don\u2019t give me that I should\u2019ve come to you first crap. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like not to have a home you can go to whenever you feel like it.\u201d</p><p>Ben seemed surprised by Chase\u2019s explanation. \u201cRegardless. Mom is worried about you because of the injury announcement, and you weren\u2019t forthcoming about it.\u201d He pointed at Chase. \u201cThen no one hears from you for two weeks? Beyond the \u2018I\u2019m fine, more later\u2019 texts you\u2019ve sent to all of us. That\u2019s bogus and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suck, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a big fuckin\u2019 shocker,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAre they pissed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as they might\u2019ve been in the past. A whole lot changed between them after Aunt Joan left Uncle Casper.\u201d</p><p>His aunt and uncle being Splitsville after so many years of marriage was hard to believe. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno, I don\u2019t...\u201d Ben sighed and studied his boots. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re in a honeymoon phase. That sounds stupid, but whenever I see Brandt and Jessie, I realize Mom and Dad are acting just like them. Maybe it has to do with Dad retiring.\u201d</p><p>Not realizing things had changed in his family made Chase feel guiltier yet.</p><p>\u201cAs far as you sneaking into Wyoming because you thought I\u2019d judge you? Yeah, I probably would\u2019ve chewed your ass. Reminded you that when things go to hell you don\u2019t run from your family, you\u2019re supposed to run to them. Reminded you that we talked about some of this distraction shit last year. You didn\u2019t listen to me. Or Quinn. But I figure I\u2019m entitled to givin\u2019 you what for now, bein\u2019s I\u2019m the older, wiser brother and all.\u201d</p><p>Chase grinned. \u201cThought I saw some new gray hair on that stubborn head of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me.\u201d Ben\u2019s smile faded. \u201cI\u2019ve said my piece. But there\u2019s one thing I ain\u2019t letting you off the hook for.\u201d</p><p>He expected Ben to bring up Ava and braced himself. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna make a \u2018surprise\u2019 visit to Mom and Dad before you leave.\u201d Ben frowned. \u201cI\u2019d call first just to make sure they\u2019re not goin\u2019 at it on the living room floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that mental picture, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I got to see the live version, so consider yourself lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Way. Mom and Dad? Doin\u2019 the nasty on the floral rug we weren\u2019t even allowed to walk on?\u201d</p><p>Ben nodded. \u201cThey didn\u2019t see me and I backed away quietly when I saw them. Then went home and drank until I passed out. Quinn wasn\u2019t happy I was worthless the next day. So I gave him a much more graphic version of what I\u2019d seen than what I\u2019m telling you. And while you\u2019re out and about, stop and see Quinn, Libby and the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never gonna get outta town tomorrow,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re leaving. I hoped you had a better plan than holing up in this trailer and spending the summer sulking.\u201d</p><p>He knew Ben was worried, and the way he showed concern was to provoke him. Weird, but it always worked.</p><p>\u201cWhere you off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash Big Crow is gonna help me figure out what I changed in my ridin\u2019 style. Guess I\u2019ll be getting on a lot of bulls to try and fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart. Then what?\u201d</p><p>Chase couldn\u2019t tell his \u201cdon\u2019t lie\u201d brother about his bogus PRCA card and his intent to ride as many bulls as possible in the next month. \u201cHonestly? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m gonna try like hell to stay off the radar. Maybe the PBR will commute my sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe interesting to see what happens. Just don\u2019t keep me outta the loop, okay?\u201d</p><p>He had the sense there was more to it. Was Ben somehow...lonely? \u201cSo. You been winning at the McKay poker games?\u201d</p><p>Ben shrugged. \u201cSome. Dalton\u2019s poker face is for shit. Tell\u2019s been working on his professional face since he became a licensed rodeo judge. Truth is, the games have tapered off, despite our married cousin\u2019s claims they wanted to join in. Hell, even Brandt can\u2019t be away from Jessie for a night of cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatcha been doin\u2019 with yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis and that. Spending time in Gillette. Building furniture. Got a bed and breakfast joint in Jackson Hole that ordered eight complete bedroom sets. But they want eight different designs, so that\u2019s been a challenge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ben had turned his talent for building log furniture into a nice sideline. \u201cThat\u2019s great. But I know you ain\u2019t sawing logs all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha. That\u2019s still not as funny as the first fifty times you said it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seein\u2019 anyone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m working with a couple of ladies. Won\u2019t be anything long term. Speaking of short term...What\u2019s goin\u2019 on with you and Ava?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 goin\u2019 on because I swore off women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Ben rolled his eyes. \u201cHow long this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot any money or a share in a bull ridin\u2019 on it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. My career is ridin\u2019 on it.\u201d</p><p>That gave Ben pause.</p><p>\u201cLook, Ava is beyond beautiful. She\u2019s got a body that don\u2019t quit. Yet she ain\u2019t at all the phony, snooty, rich TV star I figured she\u2019d be. She\u2019s funny. And smart. Curious as a damn cat. And she\u2019s...real. I like her. We\u2019re friends. Which is why I ain\u2019t gonna sleep with her.\u201d</p><p>You trying to convince him or yourself?</p><p>A strange expression crossed Ben\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, she is taller than you, so according to your dating rules, she don\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Chase shot back.</p><p>\u201cIn all seriousness, I\u2019ve gotta admit, I already see some changes in you. I hope you can sustain them and get your bull ridin\u2019 mojo back. But I\u2019d like to offer you a piece of advice when your good intentions with Ava go straight to hell.\u201d</p><p>His brother assumed he couldn\u2019t keep his dick in his pants, which only strengthened his determination to do just that. \u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Ben locked his gaze to Chase\u2019s. \u201cBe a man.\u201d</p><p>Chase bristled. \u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you in action with women over the years. Pains me to admit this, but you\u2019re too damn good-lookin\u2019 for your own good and charming to boot. All\u2019s you gotta do is smile and the ladies fall at your feet and into your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad thing...why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t hafta work for a woman. Once you\u2019ve got her in bed, I\u2019m betting she\u2019ll do anything to impress you.\u201d</p><p>How had Ben figured that out? But in Chase\u2019s own defense, he wasn\u2019t the lazy dude who relaxed in a pile of pillows and let women service him. He was an active participant in sex. He was a good lover. Respectful. Made sure his partner got off. And he hadn\u2019t had any complaints.</p><p>The women aren\u2019t around long enough to complain.</p><p>\u201cI assume this has a point?\u201d he said brusquely.</p><p>\u201cYou have a sense of entitlement. You look at a conquest and think, what can she do for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Ben, that\u2019s normal. All guys are like that.\u201d</p><p>Ben flashed his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m not. I see a woman I want and I think, what can I do to her that\u2019ll give her what she needs? Give her what no other man has?\u201d</p><p>That was too much information from his closemouthedf brother. \u201cYou sayin\u2019 I need to be more...giving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sayin\u2019 you need to be more forceful in proving to Ava you can be the man that finally sees beyond the surface. As a Hollywood princess, she\u2019s also used to being worshiped and not having to work very hard at it. Ava doesn\u2019t need a man to pet her and stroke her. To wait for her signal. She needs a man to take charge. No excuses, no apologies, no holding back. In essence, be a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be that man?\u201d Chase asked a little testily.</p><p>\u201cI am that man.\u201d Ben\u2019s gaze never wavered. \u201cThe thing is, you are that man too. As long as you\u2019re working on getting your bull ridin\u2019 mojo back, get that other male mojo back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you not hear me? I\u2019m celibate. Sworn off women, remember?\u201d</p><p>Ben laughed and clapped him on the back. \u201cLemme know how that works out for ya. In the meantime, just think about what I said, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hand out this advice often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Only to those who need it. Like you. And Quinn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take the credit for him and Libby stayin\u2019 together, but I know my talk with him prompted a different way of thinking.\u201d</p><p>Huh. He\u2019d wondered about the changes in Quinn. He seemed a lot more confident in recent years, especially when it came to Libby.</p><p>Ben walked to his truck and Chase fell in step beside him. \u201cSay goodbye to the lovely Ava for me. And keep in touch, goddammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Thanks, Ben. For givin\u2019 me an ass kickin\u2019 when I needed it.\u201d He pulled his brother in and hugged him hard.</p><p>Ava wondered why Ben had spirited Chase away.</p><p>Some super-secret family discussion?</p><p>To warn him to keep his eyes on the prize and not on his accidental roommate?</p><p>While they\u2019d been having their little he-man powwow, she\u2019d crafted a list of reasons why Chase should let her come along with him tomorrow.</p><p>The screen door slammed. Ava looked up to see Chase grinning at her. Damn him and that funny tickle in her belly his smile caused. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Sorry to put you on the spot with my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. But I\u2019ll admit, Ben is a little...forceful. In a quiet way. This is sort of embarrassing to admit, but one time when I looked in his eyes? I had this overwhelming urge to do whatever he told me. No matter what it was.\u201d</p><p>Chase froze. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Ben is unbelievably sexy in that Tarzan, \u2018me man, you woman\u2019 way. Normally that type of blatant maleness has the opposite effect on me and I want to run. But I had the perverse idea that if I did run? I\u2019d really enjoy having him chase me. And catch me.\u201d She thought back to the dark heat in Ben\u2019s eyes. His invasive look that let her know if he ever touched her, he\u2019d get inside her head, push her limits, and she\u2019d be grateful for every second of it. Talk about pure sexual power.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ava, wipe that dreamy look off your face,\u201d Chase growled. \u201cHe\u2019s my fucking brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what? He\u2019s off limits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ava sighed heavily. \u201cYou\u2019re off limits. He\u2019s off limits. What\u2019s a girl gotta do to get laid around here?\u201d</p><p>His mouth opened. Closed.</p><p>\u201cChase. I was kidding.\u201d She patted the couch cushion next to her. \u201cPlease sit. I want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He plopped down next to her. \u201cTalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re leaving tomorrow. And I overheard your conversation about where you\u2019re going and what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Chase scowled. \u201cAin\u2019t polite to eavesdrop, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the man who practically fell out the door trying to hear what your brother and I were discussing,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAnyway, I know you\u2019re going to a private bull riding school. If I came along with you, we could help each other out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got to thinking while I\u2019ve been taping other stuff that it\u2019d be helpful if you had someone to video your rides so you can break them down, frame by frame, to see what you did right and what you did wrong. I humbly offer my services as your videographer, if you\u2019ll allow me to tag along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t seem like your thing, bein\u2019 behind the camera instead of in front of it.\u201d</p><p>How could she explain this without coming across as pathetic? Or worse, one of those hanger-ons she deplored? She pinched the piping in the couch seat cushion as she tried to find the best way to phrase it.</p><p>Chase sweetly clasped her restless hand in his and her belly jumped. \u201cNo judgment, remember? I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Buoyed by his encouragement, she continued. \u201cMy offer to help isn\u2019t entirely selfless. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve never done anything like this in my life\u2014gone off on a road trip with a duffel bag, my video camera and no agenda with a man I hardly know. But God, it\u2019s something I want to do. I want to be a part of something real. To experience life as it unfolds. Unscripted. Where the corrals aren\u2019t on some sound stage and the rodeo contestants aren\u2019t stunt men. Where I\u2019m just a woman on an adventure. Where I\u2019m just...normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva. Darlin\u2019, I don\u2019t know how to say this without you taking it wrong. But you\u2019re fucking hot as hell, you\u2019re a TV star, and you\u2019ve been in movies, so I don\u2019t think incognito is an option for you. No offense, but I don\u2019t need to be worrying that people will recognize you. That\u2019d put us both back in the spotlight, right where we don\u2019t wanna be.\u201d</p><p>Ava tried not to read too much into the continual stroking of Chase\u2019s ragged thumb across her knuckles. \u201cWhat do you have planned? Because it sounds more involved than you heading to River Bend to test bulls for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d He dry-washed his face and heaved a long sigh. \u201cRemember during the truth or lie game when you asked me the biggest lie I ever told?\u201d</p><p>Ava nodded.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fess up because this one is huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you kill someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you make a deal with a crossroads demon to give you five years of success for your soul? And now the five years are up and he\u2019s coming to drag you to hell?\u201d</p><p>Chase gaped at her as if she\u2019d sprouted horns. \u201cJesus, Ava. Where do you come up with this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, hello? I was on a TV show that dealt with supernatural beings and otherworldly issues. I always think along those lines. Anyway. Proceed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I turned eighteen and started competing professionally, everyone commented I was a natural. One of the best rookies to come along in years. But the truth was I had two years experience. I\u2019d been competing in bull ridin\u2019 in the PRCA since I was sixteen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ava\u2019s eyebrows drew together. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy using another name. My buddy Jet lent me his older brother\u2019s birth certificate so I could register and get my PRCA pro card. Every weekend Jet and I raced to the closest event if I\u2019d scraped up enough entry money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut doesn\u2019t everyone around here know everyone else? And aren\u2019t the McKays infamous in the rodeo world?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI kept a low profile. Plus, I sucked.\u201d He groaned. \u201cBad. I got the hang of it after a dozen events. Started putting some jingle in my pocket. But that wasn\u2019t the best part. The best part was I finally got to do what I\u2019d always dreamed: ride bulls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat name were you riding under?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s the ironic thing. Jet\u2019s last name was Chase. His brother\u2019s name was Bill Chase, so we figured it was meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no one besides Jet knows you did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell my family or my friends. Back then it was all about getting on as many bulls as possible and learning the basics. That\u2019s what I need to relearn now.\u201d He slipped his wallet from his back pocket and thumbed through a stack of cards until he found the one he wanted. \u201cI\u2019m still a member of the PRCA. So I figured it\u2019s time to bring out Bill again.\u201d</p> <p>Ava angled closer and pushed up the brim of his hat. \u201cAh, hate to break it to you cowboy, but this face you got going on? Ain\u2019t exactly forgettable. I\u2019ll remind you that you\u2019ve been on TV. And you\u2019ve built a sizeable fan base. You are recognizable. You should worry about PBR fans recognizing your megawatt smile. And this beautifully chiseled face. And this remarkably distinctive hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy fix. I\u2019ll frown all the time. I\u2019ll grow a goatee. I\u2019ll even shave off my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really serious about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. Never been more serious in my life.\u201d</p><p>She removed his hat, setting it on the table\u2014upside down, as she\u2019d seen him do. She fingered the ends of his hair, then sifted her hand through the soft strands to stroke his scalp. \u201cI\u2019d hate for you to cut this. Even though the length reminds me of a swashbuckling pirate and not a cowboy.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t back away from her touch. \u201cIt\u2019ll grow back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure about hacking it off, and if you own a pair of clippers, and if you\u2019ll let me come along on the road with you, I\u2019ll cut it for you.\u201d</p><p>Chase looked at her oddly. \u201cYou\u2019re a barber too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAxel went through a punk stage and I got pretty good at trimming up the sides of his Mohawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou close to your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe avoids being seen with me in public these days because of the bad press.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s why Chase was dragging his heels. Ava slowly let her hands drop and glanced away.</p><p>But Chase grabbed her chin, forcing her to meet his eyes, and that little show of force thrilled her. \u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed to be seen with you, Ava. Far from it. But it will reflect badly on you in the press if I get caught impersonating another bull rider and you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a chance I\u2019m willing to take. What will happen to you if you get caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Which is why I have to be damn careful that no one recognizes me.\u201d His eyes turned a hard. \u201cThis is more than an adventure for me, Ava. This is my life, my livelihood. My entire future is at stake. You understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I promise not to do anything to jeopardize this chance for you, Chase. But please, I\u2019m asking for the same chance. Let me be someone else for a while too.\u201d</p><p>Just when she thought he\u2019d remind her of his \u201cno sex\u201d decree, Chase retreated. \u201cFine. You\u2019re in. Before we take off tomorrow, I need to stop in and see my folks. And my brother and his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. That\u2019ll give me time to burn a CD of road tunes.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI\u2019m already regretting this and we haven\u2019t left yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this will be the soundtrack to our buddy trip. Like Thelma and Louise. Or those old Bob Hope and Bing Crosby movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Mel Gibson in The Road Warrior.\u201d</p><p>Ava bumped her knee to his. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t count. He had no buddies. He just drove around killing people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll wanna kill each other after a few weeks on the road together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHighly unlikely because we are gonna be the best friends in the history of the world.\u201d She tacked on a fake smile. \u201cHow far is the bull riding boot camp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two and a half hours.\u201d</p><p>Something occurred to her. \u201cWill the people putting you up have a place for me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Chase grabbed her hand again. \u201cYou wanted an adventure, Ava. Part of that is learning to go with the flow. Things ain\u2019t always gonna be planned out to the letter. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can try.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Chase suspected Ava would chatter the entire way to the Bar 9. But she was absorbed with the scenery and writing in her notebook. Occasionally she\u2019d ask a question, or make an observation. Since Chase spent the majority of his time on the road alone, he appreciated her company, but also long stretches of silence.</p><p>They\u2019d gotten a later start than he\u2019d planned. His folks had been pleased to see him. Especially after he gave them more information on his professional life and how he intended to get it back on track. Neither pointed out the errors of his previous ways, as they\u2019d been prone to do in the past. Which was the first outward first indication they\u2019d changed.</p><p>Chase about fell off his chair when his dad rose from the table to help his mom serve butterscotch cake. And he got a bit choked up when his father followed him out to his truck and talked about not allowing past mistakes to affect his future. How the true measure of a man was learning from those mistakes, not dwelling on them.</p><p>So Chase had been introspective when he dropped by Quinn and Libby\u2019s. Five minutes with the rambunctious Adam cured that. The kid talked a mile a minute. Ran everywhere instead of walked. Barked a stellar dog impression. Then Adam was in his baby sister Amelia\u2019s face, much to Amelia\u2019s squealing delight. Amelia had grown so much since the last time he\u2019d seen her, that once again Chase felt a pang of guilt for not being part of his niece and nephew\u2019s lives.</p><p>After they\u2019d dropped off Ava\u2019s rental car in Spearfish, they grabbed a bite at McDonald\u2019s. Chase had purposely chosen the always-busy restaurant as a test to see if anyone recognized Ava. A couple guys sent appreciative glances her direction, but that was it. Wearing workout clothes, her hair secured in a ponytail and a Devil\u2019s Tower ball cap on her head, she looked nothing like a glamorous Hollywood actress. That was a mark of true beauty in Chase\u2019s mind; dressed up or dressed down, Ava looked exactly the same\u2014amazingly beautiful.</p><p>The landscape changed dramatically from the pine-tree-dotted hills, red clay and sweeping vistas. Here the land was flat until a deep rock-ridged canyon appeared. Scrub oak abounded, as did several different kinds of sage. The wooden snow fences scattered at random intervals, set at odd angles and varying heights, piqued Ava\u2019s curiosity. Chase pointed out one covered in tumbleweeds and told her the patterns of blowing snow were predictable across the high plains desert, so the snow fences were permanent fixtures across Wyoming.</p><p>About ten miles to the turn-off to Gemma and Cash\u2019s ranch, he said, \u201cAlmost there.\u201d</p><p>Ava stowed her notebook and faced him. \u201cYou excited? Nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. I\u2019ve met Cash a few times over the years, but I don\u2019t know him. My dad and uncles have dealt with Cash\u2019s wife Gemma, but I don\u2019t know her either. Here\u2019s where it gets tricky. My cousin Carter is married to Macie, Cash\u2019s daughter from a previous relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably met Carter and Macie at Kane and Ginger\u2019s wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. If there\u2019s a family celebration, all the McKays are there.\u201d Except for me.</p><p>\u201cSo this really is a friend of a friend of a friend situation for you? With the exception of your cousin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes me feel better.\u201d</p><p>Chase felt her studying him. \u201cTell me what\u2019s on your mind, Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re showing up with me. How do we explain that? I mean, would it be simpler if we told them we\u2019re in a relationship?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d considered that and shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s tell them the truth. We\u2019re friends, you\u2019ve never been out West and I\u2019m giving you insight you need for your project. In exchange, you\u2019re helpin\u2019 me out by taping my rides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that would be best too. Just don\u2019t...ditch me, okay?\u201d</p><p>Seeing her shy smile, and a glimpse of vulnerability, kicked some unknown instinct to protect her. And that confused the hell out of him. \u201cI won\u2019t ditch you, darlin\u2019, but you\u2019d better be prepared to spend a lot of time on the dirt.\u201d</p><p>Chase turned down the gravel road leading to the ranch. When they parked in front of the house, dogs raced down the steps.</p><p>As soon as he climbed out of the truck, a boy skidded to a stop. He wore beat-up boots, dirty jeans and a huge, toothless grin. \u201cAre you really Chase McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, I really am. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyder Big Crow.\u201d</p><p>Chase stuck out his hand. \u201cGreat to meet you, Ryder.\u201d</p><p>Ryder shook his hand and wouldn\u2019t let go. \u201cI watch you every week on TV. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re at my house!\u201d He yelled, \u201cDad! Look who\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>Cash ambled over. \u201cI see that.\u201d He offered his hand so Ryder had to relinquish Chase\u2019s. \u201cGood to see you, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to be here, Cash. I appreciate you fitting me in to your busy summer schedule.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d Cash\u2019s gaze strayed and Chase knew what\u2014who\u2014had caught his attention.</p><p>Chase smiled at her approach. \u201cCash and Ryder Big Crow, this is my friend Ava. She\u2019s here to help me out.\u201d</p><p>Cash\u2019s smile didn\u2019t falter, but something passed through his eyes as he offered his hand. \u201cAva. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMan, my mama will be happy you\u2019re here,\u201d Ryder said. \u201cShe always complains there ain\u2019t never enough girls.\u201d</p><p>Ava laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see about getting you two settled in the bunkhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, it\u2019s this way,\u201d Ryder said, taking off at a run.</p><p>\u201cYou sure it isn\u2019t an imposition for me to stay here, Mr. Big Crow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall me Cash.\u201d He slung Ava\u2019s duffle over his shoulder as they started to walk. \u201cNo. We\u2019ve got room. Without sounding like a prude... Since our kids are around and curious as little monkeys, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll insist you two stay in separate sides of the bunkhouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Chase inserted. \u201cMe\u2019n Ava are just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just friends,\u201d Ava reiterated. \u201cI\u2019ve never been out West and Chase is my tour guide in exchange for my videotaping skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s smart, havin\u2019 a record of your rides so you can go back and look at them.\u201d Cash said.</p><p>\u201cHey, every little thing helps, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. We\u2019ll get started in the mornin\u2019 after I finish chores.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good. When is Colby coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDay after tomorrow when the stock is scheduled to arrive. Might be a long couple days for you, Chase, with the amount of stock I\u2019d like you to test out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait. Seems I\u2019ve been in a holding pattern for too long.\u201d</p><p>Cash nodded. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good to find your seat again.\u201d</p><p>Then Ryder was jumping up and down in front of them. \u201cCan I help ya pick a bunk? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But no top bunk, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay,\u201d and he was off like a shot.</p><p>\u201cRyder is a little enthusiastic about you bein\u2019 here, if you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d Cash glanced at Ava. \u201cAny questions?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne that I hope isn\u2019t too weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the bunkhouse have Wi-Fi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Them young bucks that come here can\u2019t be away from the cyber world for two whole weeks.\u201d</p><p>A planked porch ran in front of the bunkhouse. Two doors denoted the two sides. One door was open and Ryder popped his head out. \u201cGot it all picked out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool beans.\u201d Chase ducked inside. The room was rustic. No air conditioning. No running water. A ceiling fan spun above and another fan placed in front of the window pulled cool air from outside. \u201cThis is a great place, Cash. Same set up on the other side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. A communal bathroom with showers on the back side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really have sixteen bull riders here at a time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re always booked, since I only have sessions four times a year.\u201d</p><p>Ryder sat on the bed farthest from the window. \u201cI\u2019m hopin\u2019 maybe my dad will let me sleep out here on this bunk tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Cash held up his hand and Ryder\u2019s protest died before it began.</p><p>Chase wandered to the other side of the bunkhouse to see how Ava was faring. He doubted she\u2019d ever stayed in a place like this.</p><p>But she\u2019d picked a bunk and set the lamp on the table, closer to the window.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019 in here?\u201d</p><p>Ava whirled around. \u201cGreat! I feel like I\u2019m at camp. I might sneak a flashlight and read under the covers tonight just to make the experience complete.\u201d</p><p>Cash stuck his head in. \u201cAnything you need, Ava, just let Gemma know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind, Cash, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to do a quick cattle check if you wanna ride along,\u201d Cash said to Chase.</p><p>\u201cAnd open gates for you,\u201d Chase said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come?\u201d Ava asked. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to open gates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe more the merrier.\u201d Cash patted Ryder\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCome on, son, load up the dogs.\u201d</p><p>Ava asked a million questions, none of them the invasive ones ranchers hate, such as: how many head of cattle do you run, or what\u2019s the size of your acreage. She and Cash had been so engrossed in conversation Chase had gotten stuck opening gates. But he didn\u2019t mind. With Ava focused on listening to Cash, he could focus on her.</p><p>Beautiful, vivacious, funny, he wondered if she ever felt out of place. She slipped into any situation with ease. Although he tried to ignore the voice of reason that reminded him Of course she adapts easily because she\u2019s an actress, Chase couldn\u2019t discount it completely. Still, Ava seemed genuine. She hadn\u2019t batted an eye at crawling in Cash\u2019s dirty feed truck. He\u2019d even caught her ruffling the dog\u2019s ears as she\u2019d talked to Ryder. The woman absolutely knocked him for a loop. She was unlike any woman he\u2019d ever met.</p><p>Why was that? He\u2019d been involved with beautiful women before. Did he find Ava so appealing because they\u2019d agreed to just be friends? He didn\u2019t try to be charming just so he could get into her pants? He could really be himself? Chase had racked his brain trying to remember if he\u2019d ever been just friends with a woman. Not in the last decade, that was for damn sure. Yet, he knew if he gave the signal, she\u2019d be all over him and their budding friendship would end.</p><p>See? That\u2019s your problem. You automatically put her in the role of the aggressor\u2014even when the choice to change the parameters of your relationship...is yours.</p><p>Was he really that passive when it came to sex?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Ben\u2019s advice, Be a man, still rankled. Mostly because it was true.</p><p>Hard to swallow, that he wasn\u2019t as aggressive in all areas of his life as when he was on the back of a bull.</p><p>But right now, for the next few days, his time spent on a bull was all that mattered.</p><p>Later that night, a cool breeze drifting from the window, the sound of crickets and the occasional garbled hoot from an owl lulled Chase to sleep.</p><p>A series of loud knocks jolted him from slumber. The door creaked as he peeled his eyes open.</p><p>\u201cChase? Are you awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Rapid footsteps on wood were his only warning before Ava jumped on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d She burrowed into him, shaking from head to toe. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared. I kept hearing these weird noises. Things brushing against the side of the bunkhouse under my window. Then this spooky howling started, followed by the most god-awful shriek. And I thought, what if it\u2019s a mountain lion and it jumps right through the open window to attack me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey now, take a couple of deep breaths.\u201d Chase tucked her into his body, pulling the blanket over them, lightly running his fingertips up and down her spine.</p><p>Her chest pressed against his as she inhaled. A soft puff of air teased his chest when she exhaled.</p><p>As she concentrated on breathing, her tremors slowed. And finally stopped. She snuggled into him and he couldn\u2019t resist brushing his lips across the top of her head.</p><p>They remained entwined for several long minutes.</p><p>She spoke first. \u201cYou probably think I\u2019m a wuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? A wuss? Ain\u2019t you the woman who threatened to kick my ass just a couple days ago while you were buck-ass nekkid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a bluff. I was scared out of my mind, seeing a strange guy in my room, and I blurted out the first thing that popped into my head.\u201d</p><p>His hand stopped the stroking motion on her back. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have a black belt in taekwondo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I once played a character who rocked at martial arts. I trained the minimum amount so it\u2019d look like a pro onscreen.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou really thought I could hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Damn fine actin\u2019 job, Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am a professional.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled.</p><p>Ava rubbed her cheek against his pectoral. \u201cThanks for not laughing at me, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that kinda guy.\u201d He started caressing her back again. \u201cThat said, please don\u2019t ever use your actin\u2019 talent on this gullible cowboy, okay?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and said, \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d then snuggled into him.</p><p>Chase closed his eyes, enjoying Ava\u2019s soft curves melting into him and smelling her orange blossom scented lotion. After he\u2019d seen the bottle in the bathroom at Kane\u2019s place, he told himself he wasn\u2019t perverted if he picked it up and sniffed it a couple of times.</p><p>\u201cSo have you told any of your LA friends about your big adventure out west?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds weird. You\u2019d think I\u2019d have a multitude of friends, right? Since I\u2019m a Native Californian, a TV actress, a tabloid target. Ooh, and let\u2019s not forget a rich girl.\u201d She shifted slightly, almost as if she intended to get up.</p><p>Chase pressed his palm between her shoulder blades as a sign he didn\u2019t want her to run out, and surprisingly, that seemed to calm her. \u201cSo why are you rolling in dough but not friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got nowhere to be, darlin\u2019, so why don\u2019t you help me understand.\u201d</p><p>She struggled for a minute before she spoke. \u201cThe girls I went to school with are all married with families or they\u2019re focused on their careers. It\u2019s gotten harder and harder to connect with them. Other actresses are so damn competitive that I\u2019m never sure of their motivations for befriending me because it\u2019s always\u2014and I mean always\u2014been for some shady reason. Not to mention the blatant remarks about how I don\u2019t need to work as an actress since I\u2019ve got money in the bank, and I should just bow out and make room for them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWomen say shit like that to you?\u201d</p><p>Ava huffed out a sigh. \u201cAll the time. Which is why I love the camaraderie on movie sets. But that disappears after the film wraps. I doubt I\u2019ll remain in touch with any of the actors from Miller\u2019s Ridge, because it was just a job. That\u2019s the other thing. Shooting a weekly TV show is grueling. When we\u2019re wrapped up for the week, I usually fall comatose in my bed because I haven\u2019t been home and the last thing I want to do is to go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are events I\u2019m obligated to attend. Those aren\u2019t so bad. It\u2019s the industry after-parties that make me question people\u2019s honesty and their friendly intentions. Like, are they going to a club with me because they like me and want to spend time with me? Or are they going because they know I\u2019ve got money and expect to party on my dime? Or are they hanging out with me hoping to wind up in one of the trade rags? I mean, my celebrity isn\u2019t worth a whole lot, but it\u2019s worth something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that makes you question your worth?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d A pause and then she laughed softly. \u201cI know I sound horribly neurotic. Or ungrateful for the advantages I have simply because of my birthright. I\u2019m not that callous or jaded. It makes it hard to blindly trust people. I end up spending a lot of time alone, sort of trapped by my own mediocre success.\u201d Her fingers traced the ridge of his collarbone. \u201cMy so-called issues pale in comparison to what most people have to deal with in their lives, and I feel like a big whiny spoiled baby even talking about it. But I don\u2019t talk about it because I\u2019ve got no one to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re talkin\u2019 to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my blathering doesn\u2019t make you rethink being my friend?\u201d</p> <p>Not in the way you\u2019re thinking. \u201cNope. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re friends, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here. I\u2019m relieved to have a break from all that crap for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI start shooting a movie in Mexico in August. I\u2019m on standby for readings, costumes, all that stuff.\u201d</p><p>Chase frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they call me, I have to go back to LA immediately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo between me waiting for a callback from the PBR, and you waiting for a callback from a movie studio, either of us could hafta leave at any time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like it. So we\u2019d better make the most of our time together.\u201d</p><p>The old Chase would\u2019ve suggested they spend all that time between the sheets. The new, improved Chase...kept his mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your friends like in the PBR?\u201d Ava asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t call them all friends. The majority are good guys, for the most part. Then there are the ones who act one way in the spotlight and after the cameras are gone, act totally different. They talk a good game about their religious beliefs and the cowboy way, and then they\u2019re out at the honky-tonks after every performance trying to rack up as many sin points as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if their bad behavior gets them more airtime than me.\u201d</p><p>Ava lightly punched him in the stomach. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am too. I think who we are in public, to some extent, should be the real us, or at least the polished version of ourselves the PR people want us to project. But I also think the most private part of who we are shouldn\u2019t be out there. We should save that part so we have something special about ourselves to share with the people who matter most to us.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, just lifted her head and studied him with those big, startlingly expressive eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You think that\u2019s weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think it\u2019s actually poetic, Chase. And it\u2019s a good rule to live by.\u201d</p><p>Relieved she didn\u2019t find him a dork, he kissed her forehead.</p><p>That rarely seen shy, sweet smile lit her beautiful face a second before she burrowed back into him.</p><p>Man. He liked her. A lot. He could really fall for her. Hard. Even before they had sex.</p><p>Not that they were going to have sex.</p><p>Keep telling yourself that, buddy.</p><p>Chase began to drift off. A cool breeze and a warm woman\u2014sometimes the best things in life were simple.</p><p>\u201cI should probably go back to the girls\u2019 cabin, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019d hate for you to get kicked outta camp for fraternizing in the boys\u2019 cabin on your first night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But it\u2019d be worth it not to be scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva, if you\u2019re still scared, you can stay here. But this is an awful small bunk. It\u2019d be better for both of us if you were on top of me.\u201d Not what he meant. \u201cOn the top bunk.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his sternum and disentangled from him. \u201cThanks for the offer. But what kind of adventurer would I be if I let my fear of a mountain lion attack derail me?\u201d</p><p>Chase smiled. \u201cYou really are funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Ava had just finished her workout the next morning when she heard three raps on the bunkhouse door. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Gemma poked her head in. Her gaze dropped to the yoga mat and the big balance ball. \u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just finished. Come in. Maybe downwind from me since I reek.\u201d Ava wiped the sweat from her forehead. \u201cThanks for letting me stay here. I hope it\u2019s not an imposition.\u201d</p><p>Gemma sat on the straight-backed chair. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to have you. Although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not what you\u2019re used to.\u201d</p><p>Ava mopped her chest and debated her answer. Gemma knew who she was. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to camp, which I never had the opportunity to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you mind if a snoopy old ranch woman asks a question about your life as a Hollywood actress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t mind if a clueless Hollywood actress asks questions about life on the range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d Gemma grinned. \u201cIs it hard livin\u2019 your life the way you want when you have to worry that people are watching your every move?\u201d</p><p>Ava pulled out the other chair and the table and sat across from Gemma. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an issue until I landed the role on Miller\u2019s Ridge. Then I was this \u2018hot, new actress\u2019, even though I\u2019d been doing bit parts on TV for a few years. The first time the paparazzi yelled \u2018Look this way, Miss Cooper\u2019 and snapped my photo? I thought I was freakin\u2019 cool. I could not understand why other actors complained about photographers following them everywhere. It seemed I\u2019d hit the big time when trade rags sent a photographer to trail me as I was out running errands.</p><p>\u201cI made a few missteps. Doing the walk of shame, which naturally, the paparazzi captured on film. Getting pulled over for a broken taillight, which the tabloids twisted into me being under suspicion for DUI. I started dating an assistant director for the company that produces the show. He insisted we keep our relationship on the down-low since he was a really private guy. So we got...amorous on the patio at my place, not thinking anything of it because it\u2019s secluded, right? I was in my own home, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t gonna end well, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Some douchebag photographer ignored the Private property warning and snapped pics of us getting naked and wild. The pictures were plastered all over the tabloids the next day. Granted, you couldn\u2019t see his face, but you could see mine. He broke up with me immediately. Said being with me was too much work.\u201d</p><p>Gemma winced.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t get me started on the Jake debacle. I had to leave California to get away from it.\u201d When Gemma didn\u2019t ask specifics, Ava knew the bad press had even made it to rural Wyoming.</p><p>\u201cDo you love acting so much you\u2019ll put up with that ugly part of the business to get to do what makes you happy?\u201d</p><p>Ava sighed. \u201cI thought I loved acting, but I\u2019m not even sure of that anymore.\u201d Why was it so easy to blurt this stuff out to a stranger? She smiled at Gemma. \u201cEnough about that. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love my life. I\u2019m truly blessed. I\u2019m married to the greatest man in the world, we have the rugrats we both always wanted,\u201d she smiled softly, \u201cand we get to raise them around family on the land we love.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps pounded across the wooden planks and a dark-haired girl and a younger dark-haired boy burst into the bunkhouse. \u201cMama, come on. Daddy\u2019s got the training bull out. Says he might need your help.\u201d</p><p>Gemma stood. \u201cAll right. Tell him I\u2019ll be right there. You comin\u2019 to watch Chase practice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in ten.\u201d Ava ditched her sweaty yoga clothes and slipped on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. With her messenger-style camera bag, notebook, sunglasses and ball cap, she was good to go.</p><p>The wind blew like crazy, which lessened the sun\u2019s blistering rays. Chalky dust covered her shoes and clothing. She\u2019d arrived in time to see Chase get whipped off a piece of equipment that resembled a gymnastics vault\u2014except a gymnastics vault didn\u2019t spin and tilt.</p><p>Chase picked himself up off the thick gym mats.</p><p>\u201cFive point nine,\u201d Cash called out. \u201cBetter. Go again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Ava moved next to Gemma and draped her arms over the top of the metal fence. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash is workin\u2019 Chase on the mechanical bull today. When a rider hasn\u2019t been on a bull for a few weeks, it helps to regain the movement and sense of balance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it like being on the real thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guys talk about it bein\u2019 similar. Guess the machine is smoother, even set on random intervals.\u201d</p><p>She watched as Chase used the rope wrapped around the center of the machine to hoist himself up. \u201cWhy is Chase wearing a vest, chaps and spurs just for practice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the weight and constriction of clothing needs to be constant. If he gets used to practicing without, it\u2019ll change his balance and movement when he wears it during competition. They try to keep every practice session in line with the real thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Cash yelled, \u201cReady?\u201d Ava reached into her camera bag for her video camera.</p><p>But Gemma put her hand on Ava\u2019s arm. \u201cNo need to tape this. Just watch.\u201d</p><p>The mechanical beast jerked, spinning one way and abruptly switching course. The back end popped up. The front end lifted and slammed down. Chase\u2019s feet were flying; his left hand was straight up above his head. His body countered every movement. The next switch set Chase sailing onto the puffy mats.</p> <p>Ava cringed. That had to hurt.</p><p>But Chase didn\u2019t lie there, moaning in pain. He was back on his feet, yelling at Cash for another go.</p><p>This went on for an hour until Cash insisted Chase take a break. They huddled in the corner, Cash gesturing wildly and Chase nodding his head.</p><p>\u201cHow did Cash get started training bull riders?\u201d Ava asked Gemma.</p><p>\u201cCash rode bulls in the PRCA for twenty years. He never won a national championship, which is ironic because if he would\u2019ve competed in the Indian Rodeo circuit, he probably could\u2019ve had multiple championships.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t tempted to switch circuits?\u201d</p><p>Gemma shook her head. \u201cHe wanted to be judged on his bull ridin\u2019 ability alongside all other riders, not just those with the same skin color. Then Cash fell on some tough times and couldn\u2019t compete. After we got married, I encouraged him to share his expertise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is he looking to turn your boys into champion bull riders?\u201d</p><p>Gemma peeked at Ava over the tops of her sunglasses. \u201cOver my dead body.\u201d</p><p>Ava laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing sandwiches down for the guys in a bit. You want one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll take mine on whole grain bread, with low-fat mayo, goat cheese and organic sliced turkey. And I\u2019d like avocado, sprouts and cilantro on it too.\u201d</p><p>Gemma froze.</p><p>Ava burst into laughter. \u201cHah! Gotcha. Bet you thought I was showing my true Hollywood diva side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for that, I\u2019m making you peanut butter and jelly. And don\u2019t even ask me to cut off the crusts.\u201d</p><p>Chase had been scarce yesterday after tangling with the mechanical bull and helping Cash in the afternoon. Ava suspected he\u2019d gone to bed early because his body hurt, but he claimed fatigue, not soreness, and she let it go.</p><p>Midmorning, Ava headed for the corral to start her duties as videographer and noticed more kids hanging on the rails. \u201cSo, Gemma, did you lock up your other kids in the woodshed yesterday?\u201d</p><p>Gemma snickered. \u201cThese are Cash\u2019s grandkids. Thane\u2014\u201d she pointed to the older boy who looked about six, wearing a Colorado Rockies ball cap, \u201c\u2014and Parker.\u201d Parker wore a coonskin cap. Gemma whispered, \u201cParker is in his pioneer phase and refuses to take the hat off. It\u2019s about to drive his mother crazy. Which is probably why Macie sent the older kids along with their dad today.\u201d Gemma gestured to the chute across the way. \u201cTheir dad, Carter, is helpin\u2019 Cash load bulls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter,\u201d Ava repeated. \u201cI think I met him at Kane and Ginger\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably. He\u2019s married to Cash\u2019s daughter. He\u2019s also Chase\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never keep this all straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook me a while too. Don\u2019t know what the hell those women were thinkin\u2019 with all the C and K names in the McKay family.\u201d Ryder raced off and Gemma yelled, \u201cHuh-uh, buddy boy. Get back here. Daddy doesn\u2019t want you by those bulls today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Mom, that\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. Stay by me or go in the house.\u201d</p><p>Ryder sighed. Kicked a clump of dirt and scaled the metal rails like a monkey.</p><p>\u201cLooks like Chase\u2019s about to leave the chute. You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll set.\u201d Ava\u2019s hat shaded the worst of the sun\u2019s glare.</p><p>A man inside the arena opened the gate. The bull erupted from the chute, all four hooves airborne. Chase\u2019s entire body jerked forward as the bull\u2019s front legs landed. Then the beast twisted its back end, trying to throw Chase off. Somehow he stayed on. But the bull\u2019s next spin sent Chase sailing into the air and he collided with the ground.</p><p>The neck strap caught the camera as Ava lurched forward, shocked at seeing Chase lying on the ground. Motionless. The gate opener was leading the bull out another gate, ignoring Chase completely. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t someone helping him?\u201d She began to scale the metal corral.</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d Gemma tugged her back down, forcing Ava to meet her gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ve never actually seen bull ridin\u2019, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I thought it\u2019d be like yesterday, with the mechanical thingy. Not like this. Not with him really getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva. Honey. Bull ridin\u2019 is an extremely dangerous sport. Bulls are highly unpredictable. There is no control factor. And these bulls that Chase is trying to ride? Real wild cards because most of them haven\u2019t been ridden. We have no idea how the bull is gonna react until it\u2019s tested out.\u201d Her worried eyes searched Ava\u2019s. \u201cChase knew that goin\u2019 into these stock trials. Didn\u2019t he tell you the dangers? What you might see?\u201d</p><p>Ava shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you watch any bull ridin\u2019 on TV before you agreed to tape him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a video on YouTube. But it\u2019s nothing like watching this live, with the horns and the hooves, and the sickening sound of his body smashing into the ground.\u201d Ava pressed her hand against her lower abdomen. \u201cI...I don\u2019t have the stomach for this, Gemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he gets hurt? Like really badly hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a risk. That\u2019s also part of the appeal for men who do this for a livin\u2019. You must understand that about Chase, Ava. This is who he is. Ridin\u2019 bulls is not only his job, but also his passion. He\u2019s reached the highest level of the sport and you don\u2019t get to that position without bein\u2019 a damn good athlete.\u201d She rubbed Ava\u2019s arm. \u201cSee? He\u2019s already up and goin\u2019 back for more.\u201d</p><p>As much as Ava didn\u2019t want to look, she couldn\u2019t help it. Sure enough, the fringe on Chase\u2019s chaps flapped as he hustled back to the chute.</p><p>The guy at the gate yelled, \u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 that one\u2019s a keeper, Cash, if it threw boy wonder on his ass.\u201d</p><p>Male laughter echoed back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Colby,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cCarter\u2019s older brother and Chase\u2019s cousin. He got here early this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby knows rodeo stock?\u201d</p><p>Gemma nodded. \u201cCash and Colby competed on the same PRCA circuit for years. They quit around the same time, but the love of rodeo never really left them. They\u2019ve been buying and breeding bucking bulls for a couple years. We\u2019re doing things pretty unconventionally regarding stock trials. Seemed a sign Chase needed help with his ridin\u2019 the same time Cash and Colby needed an experienced rider to test new bulls.\u201d</p><p>Male shouts competed with the loud clanks.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s a chute fighter,\u201d Gemma offered. \u201cWhich is problematic. They\u2019ll let him fight until he settles down. But he could be too tired to buck and they won\u2019t have an accurate idea of his bucking ability. After Chase rides him today, they\u2019ll probably need a re-ride tomorrow to see how he performs. A bull that\u2019s a chute fighter is an extra danger to the rider. A lot of injuries happen before the gate opens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that thing he\u2019s wearing, a modified catcher\u2019s mask, prevent that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all riders wear those protective helmets, but Cash makes them mandatory here.\u201d</p><p>More loud sounds of flesh hitting steel and male warning shouts.</p><p>\u201cIs Chase on the bull right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no. They\u2019re waitin\u2019 to see if the bull calms down.\u201d She pointed to the camera. \u201cYou oughta be getting this on tape.\u201d</p><p>Eventually the huge bull, an ugly two-toned yellowish white with splotches of brown, calmed down. Chase secured his hand, nodded to Colby. Once again, Chase didn\u2019t reach the eight-second mark before his ass met the dirt. A less forceful buck off than the last one, but the power when his body impacted into the ground had to rattle his bones and jostle his brain.</p><p>The idea of Chase constantly being subjected to skull fractures from a horn or a hoof to the head made bile rise in her throat. She bent down and retrieved the water bottle from her messenger bag. Sipping the lukewarm liquid slowly, half-afraid she\u2019d toss her cookies, half-tempted to force herself to hurl so she had a valid excuse to leave.</p><p>Suck it up. You willingly signed on for this and you can\u2019t quit the first day.</p><p>Ella tugged on her pant leg. \u201cMiss Ava? Will you play with the kitties with me?\u201d</p><p>Sure, kid. Let\u2019s go right now.</p><p>Gemma squeezed Ella\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMaybe later, sweets. Ava is taping Chase\u2019s rides so he can watch \u2019em tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d Ella raced to the old barn.</p><p>\u201cHow come she gets to go somewhere but I can\u2019t?\u201d Ryder complained.</p><p>\u201cBecause she could care less about the bulls. You, my curious son, would be back there pullin\u2019 Chase\u2019s bull rope if you had the chance. Here we go.\u201d</p><p>Ava resituated the camera.</p><p>Come on, Chase. Ride this one.</p><p>The gate opened, the bull shot out like a rocket, zigging and zagging. Halfway across the arena, Chase bailed off, slipping sideways and landing on his hands and knees. Even from this distance she could see the hard set to his jaw, the stiff angle to his shoulders. He yelled, \u201cSet \u2019em up again. A big one this time.\u201d</p><p>Gemma said, \u201cYou know, it\u2019d help if we recorded the buck-off times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. There\u2019s a notebook in my bag.\u201d</p><p>Bull number five leapt out of the chute like a two thousand pound ballet dancer and Chase went flying like a trapeze artist from Cirque du Soleil. He rolled to his feet after he landed on his shoulder. Dust followed behind him, \u00e0 la Pigpen from Peanuts as he moseyed to the fence. Ava snickered, until she zoomed in on Chase\u2019s pained face. He was hurt. But that wouldn\u2019t stop him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How many more bulls would he get on today?</p><p>All of them, until he rode at least one.</p><p>Another hour passed. Then two. Chase stayed on bull number sixteen the full eight seconds. She didn\u2019t get caught up in the clapping and whistles from Gemma, the kids and the guys because she was too busy taping the triumphant look on Chase\u2019s face.</p> <p>Did he quit after that?</p><p>No.</p><p>He climbed on three more bulls. Rode two of them. Bull number twenty was another chute fighter. By the time the bull settled down, she could hear Cash and Carter yelling at Chase to take a break. He shook his head, bounced around on the bull\u2019s back and nodded at Colby.</p><p>It was apparent how not ready Chase was when the bull turned sharply, kicking out his rear end so powerfully that the rope jerked from Chase\u2019s hand. Chase did a flip midair before he crashed into the corral.</p><p>But did the Man of Steel stay down, wallowing in pain? Nope. He staggered to his feet. Holding the metal fence rails for support, he limped across the dirt, waving off Colby\u2019s help as they disappeared into the barn.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do it for today,\u201d Gemma said. \u201cYou comin\u2019 up to the house to eat with us, Ava?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thanks for asking, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be great, but it takes awhile to edit this. I imagine Chase will want to look at the footage later, so I\u2019d better get started on it.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Ava was inside the bunkhouse, she locked the door, shut the window, pulled the curtains and flopped on her bed. Blessedly cool. Blessedly dark.</p><p>The tears came before she could stop them.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t exactly sure why she was crying. Wasn\u2019t like she\u2019d gotten thrown around like a rag doll twenty times. Her occupation didn\u2019t lend itself to danger. Maybe she\u2019d get a paper cut from script pages. Or possibly she\u2019d burn her mouth on a cup of coffee. Or she might have an allergic reaction to makeup. But nothing remotely life-threatening.</p><p>Talk about being out of her element on so, so many levels.</p> <p>She\u2019d never dated professional athletes, so she hadn\u2019t ever witnessed that mindset and mix of physical perfection and determination needed to push to the highest level. She witnessed that drive in Chase today. It scared her to death.</p><p>So did this desolate feeling stem from fear for Chase?</p><p>No. Hers was fear of the unknown.</p><p>Out here in the real world? People dealt with serious hazards every day. Hazards she never even considered in her tidy universe, where out of sight, out of mind wasn\u2019t just a saying but a way of life.</p><p>Ava let her gaze wander around the bunkhouse. She\u2019d seen the wary way Gemma, Cash and even Chase had looked at her, expecting to see disgust on her face about the primitive accommodations. Right now, where she rested her head at night was the least of her concerns. For all her bold talk about experiencing real life, she didn\u2019t know if she could handle it.</p><p>And didn\u2019t that make her spoiled? She had the luxury of packing up her stuff and escaping if she so chose. These people didn\u2019t.</p><p>So what was the appeal to sustain this way of life? When it was comprised of backbreaking work, extreme temperatures, isolation and daily physical danger? There didn\u2019t appear to be monetary gain. Was it the satisfaction of besting the elements and the animals year after year?</p><p>The only way she\u2019d glean the tiniest bit of understanding would be to stick it out. Figure it out. Maybe by doing that, she\u2019d find her way. Because one thing she had figured out? She was more than a little lost in her own life, regardless of her physical location.</p> <p>Her thoughts drifted back to her sleeplessness last night and her flash of understanding of how important it was for Chase to prove he could keep the \u201cno sex\u201d promise he\u2019d made to himself. Who was she to try and change his mind? Just because she wanted to prove that she had the mad skills to keep a man sexually satisfied? Chase ought to fall into bed with her?</p><p>Talk about diva-ish expectations.</p><p>Needing to sort out her emotions, she snagged her notebook and flipped on the desk lamp. She scrawled random thoughts, suggestions, ideas. Gibberish mostly, but she finally felt a measure of control. She was being honest on the page, not writing snarkily, or trying to be hip, or funny, but being real.</p><p>Ava also realized she\u2019d never really know Chase except on a superficial level unless she studied his obsession and profession from a different angle. Not from fear, but from curiosity. She turned on her computer and searched for Chase McKay\u2019s previous year\u2019s rides, creating a separate disk with those, so he could compare then and now.</p><p>Time got away from her as she edited, copied folders and burned a DVD, so the knock on the bunkhouse door startled her. Sweet Ella stood on the porch, bouncing with impatience. \u201cYou still wanna go see the kitties?\u201d</p><p>She could use a mental break. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>They messed with the balls of fluff until Gemma called Ella for supper. When Ava returned to the bunkhouse, she noticed Chase was in the bathroom. Now was her chance to get the disks up to the house without running into him. She needed time to figure out how to deal with these conflicting feelings, whether the emotional price of ditching her normal life was worth it for the short term. She couldn\u2019t avoid him for long, but she intended to try.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>As Chase dished up a helping of sausage and fried potatoes, Gemma said, \u201cAva dropped off the disks she made of your rides today. One of the disks has all your previous good rides in the PBR and your worst rides to compare against your rides today.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s fork stopped halfway to his mouth. \u201cShe did? That\u2019s above and beyond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe slo-mo can give an idea of what you\u2019re doin\u2019 differently,\u201d Colby said. \u201cSomething is off in your ridin\u2019, but I\u2019ll be damned if I could pinpoint exactly what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because there were too many things wrong to focus on just one,\u201d Cash said with a smile.</p><p>If Cash\u2019s kids hadn\u2019t been at the table, Chase would\u2019ve flipped him off. Oh right. His arm hurt too fucking bad to even lift up. \u201cI\u2019m gonna blame some of my altered performance on the safety helmet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wanna train here, you have to wear it. The sooner you get used to it, the sooner we can get you back on track. Besides, you were havin\u2019 troubles long before the headgear switch.\u201d</p><p>Colby pointed at Chase with his butter knife. \u201cI\u2019m with Cash on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d wear the helmet without complaint to every performance if you were still on the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Chase snorted. His big, macho cousin wouldn\u2019t have worn one. Period.</p><p>\u201cMy boys all wear helmets when they\u2019re competing at junior rodeo events. They don\u2019t know different since they\u2019ve always worn safety equipment.\u201d Before Colby took a breath and continued his diatribe, his cell rang and he excused himself.</p><p>Chase pushed his food around on his plate. He was sore as hell, worse than he\u2019d been in months. He didn\u2019t feel like eating. But that wouldn\u2019t sit well with Gemma, especially since Ava had bailed on supper.</p><p>Ryder chattered. Ella threw out random facts about cats. The youngest boy, Jansen, looked ready to fall asleep in his chair.</p><p>Gemma asked, \u201cEverything all right?\u201d after Colby returned to the table.</p><p>\u201cFine. Channing says it\u2019s so quiet in the house with all her boys gone she actually spooked herself.\u201d</p><p>That made Chase think of the first night they\u2019d arrived and Ava\u2019s fear of unfamiliar noises. Seemed odd she\u2019d be off by herself somewhere.</p><p>\u201cI wish Gib and Braxton coulda come,\u201d Ryder complained.</p><p>Cash ruffled Ryder\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re full of complaints tonight, son. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was boring standin\u2019 around today. I wanna help with the bulls tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo can do. But I\u2019ll tell ya what. I\u2019ll let you watch Chase\u2019s rides in a bit. After you get cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Dad. Do I hafta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Cash said. \u201cAnd you two,\u201d he pointed to Ella and Jans, \u201cstart makin\u2019 your way upstairs to the shower.\u201d</p><p>After the kids left, Colby sighed. \u201cWhat is it about boys\u2019 bone-deep fear of soap and water? Drives my wife insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet Princess Talia is sweet-smelling,\u201d Gemma teased. \u201cI\u2019ll bet she\u2019s getting big too.\u201d</p><p>Colby\u2019s face lit up. He shifted to dig his wallet out of his back pocket and passed around a picture of his baby girl.</p><p>Since Chase hadn\u2019t seen the newest addition to Colby and Channing\u2019s family\u2014hard to keep up with his prolific cousins\u2019 offspring\u2014he dutifully checked out the dark-haired, blue-eyed child. Definitely a McKay.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the most beautiful thing in the world. Takes after her mama,\u201d Colby said. \u201cEven at six months the girl\u2019s already got her brothers wrapped around her pinkie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like she\u2019s taking after Keely,\u201d Chase said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of the latest McKay newlywed...\u201d Gemma asked Colby, \u201cHow is the wild child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy. Her business is good, and that\u2019s sayin\u2019 something in this economy. Her West cousins, Chet and Remy, started building her and Jack\u2019s house as soon as the ground thawed. Not that Jack or my cousins need my dad\u2019s input, but apparently he\u2019s over at the building site every day to make sure Keely is happy. Damn man still dotes on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to do with daughters,\u201d Cash said. \u201cNo matter how old they get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe my folks took all four boys fishing. But it ain\u2019t like they\u2019re roughing it in Grandpa and Grandma\u2019s new RV, with air conditioning and satellite TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least if they\u2019re around a lake Carolyn can toss them in the water so she won\u2019t hafta put up with their stinky selves in a small space.\u201d Gemma stood. \u201cYou guys head on into the family room. I\u2019ll dish up cake after you\u2019re done watchin\u2019 the rides.\u201d</p><p>Chase tried not to wince as he rose to his feet. He plopped on the closest easy chair, but didn\u2019t relax, fearing his muscles would seize and he\u2019d have to ask for help getting up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cash popped in the DVD. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look-see.\u201d</p><p>The rides were painful to watch. Not because of the reminder of physical pain, but because it looked as if Chase McKay had never ridden a bull.</p><p>After they watched all the short test rides, Cash inserted the disk with Chase\u2019s winning rides, or at least the rides he\u2019d managed to hang on for the full eight seconds.</p> <p>He listened as Colby and Cash discussed everything, from the angle of his chin, to the height and position of his arm in the air, to his spurring technique, to his initial seat on the bull. Chase didn\u2019t comment, or defend, as he might\u2019ve done in the past, but listened.</p><p>Then they started the disk from the beginning again.</p><p>Ryder raced in and dropped at Chase\u2019s feet. The kid didn\u2019t utter a peep; his focus was entirely on the successful rides. Cash switched out the disks to Chase\u2019s attempts today.</p><p>About bull fifteen, Ryder piped up. \u201cDad? Can I ask something? How come Chase\u2019s left shoulder is back? Not straight in line like the right one? It kinda hangs over his leg.\u201d</p><p>Chase looked at the kid and then at the TV. \u201cRewind that.\u201d Sure enough, Chase noticed the discrepancy immediately. \u201cCan we go back and watch the disk where I actually rode some bulls?\u201d</p> <p>Cash swapped out the disks. Low and behold, Chase\u2019s shoulders were straight.</p><p>Colby said, \u201cI\u2019ll be damned. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s all of the problem, but it\u2019s a good place to start.\u201d He grinned at Ryder. \u201cGib\u2019ll be fit to be tied when I tell him your eagle eye caught that. He\u2019ll probably want us to start taping him so he can watch for mistakes in his ridin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat mistakes?\u201d Ryder scoffed. \u201cGib is gonna be world champion one day.\u201d He looked up at Chase with pure hero worship. \u201cAfter you win the world title a coupla times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure hope so.\u201d</p><p>Colby pushed up from the floor. \u201cHow you feelin\u2019, cuz?\u201d</p><p>Like dogshit. \u201cOkay. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get you on that mechanical bull while this is fresh in my mind.\u201d</p><p>When Chase didn\u2019t respond, Cash said, \u201cUnless you\u2019re too sore. We can do it in the mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s gaze moved between the two men. They were sacrificing family time to help him out. He\u2019d cowboy up no matter how goddamn bad he hurt. He withheld a wince as he eased out of the chair. \u201cI\u2019m game. Might need a shot or two of whiskey afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure we all will.\u201d</p><p>Gemma leaned in the doorway. \u201cSo I should wait on the cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 Ryder deserves the biggest piece for his help,\u201d Chase said.</p><p>She smiled at her beaming son. \u201cI\u2019ll have a cowboy-sized slice ready when you get back.\u201d</p><p>Cash didn\u2019t ease Chase into the ride. He cranked it full blast. Colby wandered the perimeter of the mats. After Chase\u2019s fourth attempt, Colby walked closer to pat Chase\u2019s left thigh. \u201cTurn your leg in and you\u2019ll stop leanin\u2019 back on this hip. If the hip is aligned, so will the shoulder.\u201d</p> <p>He shifted to find the proper seat. \u201cThat feels weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now make sure when you throw your left arm up that you don\u2019t change this alignment.\u201d</p><p>Chase raised his left arm. The mechanical bull kicked hard to the right and then spun to the left. Chase focused on keeping his upper body aligned. It worked. He bailed off after he heard the buzzer.</p><p>Both Cash and Colby grinned at him. But Cash whistled when Chase started to walk off the mats. \u201cHuh-uh, McKay. One ride could be a fluke. I\u2019ll need at least two more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadistic bastard,\u201d Chase mumbled under his breath as he climbed back on.</p><p>Think. Align. Focus.</p><p>He ended up riding the next two. As sore as he was, as tired as he was, he couldn\u2019t wait to get on bulls tomorrow.</p><p>Back at the house, he shoveled in a piece of strawberry shortcake and knocked back a shot of whiskey with Cash and Colby before returning to the bunkhouse. He took another shower, needing the hot water to dull the day\u2019s aches and pains.</p><p>Ava\u2019s door was closed and no light spilled from the window as he walked past her side of the bunkhouse.</p><p>He wanted to tell her about the breakthrough he\u2019d had tonight. What did it say that she was the first person he\u2019d thought of telling?</p><p>That you\u2019re still not focused on the main reason you\u2019re here.</p><p>When Chase lumbered into the bunkhouse, he saw Colby sitting on the bunk across from his.</p><p>Colby glanced up from poking buttons on his cell phone. \u201cHang on a sec, I gotta tell Cord I fucked up and forgot to check the drainage ditch on the east side of our folks place before I left.\u201d</p><p>Chase popped three aspirin and collapsed on his bed.</p><p>\u201cHow you holdin\u2019 up?\u201d Colby asked and flipped off the light.</p><p>\u201cBeen better.\u201d He rearranged his pillow. \u201cDid you ever hit a low spot when you were on tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of times. I can\u2019t believe I stuck with it for as long as I did. That lifestyle takes a toll on a man. But I loved it. The competing. The traveling. Hanging with the guys. The easy women.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me, I\u2019da sworn the abundance of willing women was my number one reason for stayin\u2019 on the road.\u201d</p><p>Only a guy who\u2019d been there could understand that appeal.</p><p>\u201cBut now? I suspect the reason I stuck it out was because I was waitin\u2019 for a woman who didn\u2019t want a rodeo cowboy, but me. Luckily I found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you miss that life on the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first. Then not at all.\u201d</p><p>Chase couldn\u2019t fathom that. \u201cReally? So if you\u2019d met Channing two years before you did, you\u2019da gladly given up your wild rodeo ways to set up housekeeping with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see your opinion on marriage ain\u2019t changed. I can\u2019t answer that, because as much as I\u2019d planned to quit rodeoin\u2019 fulltime at summers end? My injury gave me no choice.\u201d His pause weighed heavily in the room. \u201cJust curious about what your plans are if you aren\u2019t allowed back on tour. Or if you can\u2019t keep up the ridin\u2019 percentage to stay on tour. You considering the PRCA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems I\u2019ve had two choices in my life. Rodeo or ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour payout from your percentage of the ranch sure gives you more than two choices now, Chase. What about that buddy of yours? The one who offered you a stake in a bull? Any interest in breeding stock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll leave that to you and Cash.\u201d Chase sighed and stared at the bunk above him. \u201cAlls I ever wanted to do was ride bulls. I\u2019ve never looked beyond that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an easy mindset to fall into when you\u2019re young, on top, and believe you\u2019ll stay there forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Chase prompted.</p><p>\u201cBut bull ridin\u2019 isn\u2019t a forever occupation.\u201d Colby sighed. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve got enough on your mind right now. We\u2019re all damn proud of you.\u201d</p><p>If they were all so proud of him, why did he feel like such a disappointment? Or were they proud of him for the wrong reason? \u201cThanks, Colby, I appreciate the advice.\u201d</p><p>Chase was tired of Ava avoiding him. Especially when he had no idea if he\u2019d done something to piss her off.</p><p>For the last two days she\u2019d dutifully recorded his rides, made DVD copies and handed them to Gemma every afternoon. But as far as a one-on-one conversation between them? Not once.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s changed her mind about continuing this western adventure with you.</p><p>After supper, Chase tracked her down to the training paddock, her silhouette reflected as a shadow in the moonlit dirt below the mechanical bull.</p><p>Despite the ache from wrist to shoulder, Chase balanced on one arm and hopped the fence. When he stood in front of her, he said, \u201cYou gonna get in a little practice?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAva? You all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze finally snapped to his. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, right? Acting like it\u2019s no big deal you got thrown on your ass half a dozen times. Or that you got stomped on by a bull at least four of those times. Oh, and that\u2019s just today. That\u2019s not counting the first two days I watched. And taped. And wanted to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanted to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHide,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I didn\u2019t have to watch you getting hurt over and over. Record you getting hurt over and over.\u201d</p><p>Chase wasn\u2019t expecting that. He climbed on the mechanical bull, so they faced each other, knee-to-knee with their legs draped over the sides. \u201cAll this fuss is about me? Really?\u201d</p><p>Ava nodded, but still wouldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cIn my head I knew climbing on a bull was dangerous, but seeing it firsthand scared the living piss out of me, Chase McKay.\u201d</p><p>Such sweet honesty bowled him over.</p><p>\u201cThe last bull today that threw you into the gate? I was really glad you were wearing a helmet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I\u2019m getting used to the damn thing. But I still got my bell rung pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t brush my concerns aside, Chase. You almost\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost don\u2019t count in bull ridin\u2019, Hollywood. Staying on eight seconds is the only thing that does count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatching you sometimes...? God. A couple rides seemed like eight hours.\u201d</p><p>Chase murmured, \u201cSeems that way to me too sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s eyes were filled with frustration. \u201cWhy do you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you walk onto a fake set and pretend to be somebody you\u2019re not?\u201d he volleyed back.</p><p>\u201cNot the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. We both take risks in our jobs, they\u2019re just different types of risks. We\u2019re both professionals.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva. Stop.\u201d Even as Chase\u2019s conscience warned No no no, his body urged him closer with Yes yes yes. He slipped his hand around the back of her neck and angled his head until their lips were barely an inch apart. Kissing her jaw, her chin. Soft, teasing smooches. Dragging out the innocent kisses until the heat kicked in.</p><p>When Ava opened her mouth, and the warm flesh of her lips skimmed across his, he lost his mind. His intention to gift her with the most sensual kiss in the history of the world vanished.</p><p>Chase inhaled her, keeping her in place as he feasted on her mouth. When her hands inched up his arms, he made a low-pitched warning sound and her fingers curled into his biceps.</p><p>He drank in the taste of her. Feeding her hot kisses. Wet kisses. Sliding his tongue deeper to explore her mouth, then retreating to gently smooch her kiss-plumped lips.</p><p>During one of those tender, fleeting kisses, she murmured, \u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>He recognized the question in her voice, it was the same one running through his mind: What the hell are you doing? Twining silky strands of her hair around his fingers, he rested his forehead to hers, breathing raggedly. \u201cDammit, Hollywood. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>They stayed like that for several blissful minutes, even when Chase knew he should pull away.</p><p>\u201cAre you having second thoughts about hitting the rodeo trail with me? Especially since I just gave you the mother of all mixed signals by layin\u2019 a big, wet kiss on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy second thoughts had nothing to do with that.\u201d Ava pressed her lips to his. \u201cBesides, one little kiss isn\u2019t gonna scare me off. You and me? We\u2019re friends. Pals. Buddies. Road warriors. Road dogs. We\u2019ll probably be prancing around each other naked by the time our adventure is up. Prancing around totally nude and we won\u2019t even bat an eyelash.\u201d</p><p>Not a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of that happening if Ava was nekkid. Chase tipped her face up to gaze into her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right watching me compete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. It\u2019s gotten better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because my ass didn\u2019t hit the dirt as often,\u201d he said dryly. Chase slid off the bull and held out his hand to help her down. \u201cYou comin\u2019 back to the bunkhouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a bit. It\u2019s so beautiful here. Almost like I\u2019m on a movie set and it isn\u2019t real. I want to drink it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot worried a mountain lion will sneak up behind you and carry you off?\u201d</p><p>Was the wind playing tricks on him? Or did he hear her mutter, \u201cI wish you\u2019d sneak up behind me and carry me off.\u201d</p><p>Chase said, \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019ll be fine. Good night, Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>Ava stretched out on the mechanical bull and stargazed. So peaceful. The profusion of stars reinforced that feeling of insignificance.</p> <p>Seemed to be a theme in her life.</p><p>She\u2019d almost told Chase she was leaving for LA as soon as possible. Ever since his breakthrough on the bulls, she\u2019d been waiting for him to tell her, in that charming cowboy way, that he wouldn\u2019t need her help videotaping his rides. Maybe it was high schoolish that she\u2019d intended to give him the brush off first.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t rescinded his offer. Instead, he\u2019d kissed her.</p><p>Had he ever kissed her.</p><p>Ava remembered how his hot breath drifted across her cheek. A non-kiss, a tease, but one that raised goose bumps down the entire left side of her body. She\u2019d withheld a shiver, suspecting he\u2019d take her reaction the wrong way.</p><p>And she might\u2019ve succeeded in pretending his peck was just a friendly gesture if he hadn\u2019t kept inching those clever lips down her jawline. If he hadn\u2019t made that nearly imperceptible growling noise in the back of his throat. If he hadn\u2019t tenderly smooched the tip of her chin on his way to tenderly smooching her mouth. Once. Twice. The third kiss lingered. No hint of tongue, just a gentle press of lips on lips. Somehow his left hand had curled around her neck. Somehow, her hands ended up clamped onto his biceps.</p><p>Ava expected he\u2019d keep the kiss slow and easy. So when Chase kissed the living shit out of her, she understood she didn\u2019t know this Chase at all. The Chase who trapped her face in his big hands. The Chase who ably slipped his tongue past her teeth and fried her circuits with a kiss that stirred something inside her she\u2019d never felt with any man.</p><p>Lust with an edge of danger. Lust that had no boundaries.</p><p>Just as Ava was about to lose herself in the sensation of surrender, Chase broke the kiss.</p><p>And then he\u2019d apologized.</p><p>So yeah, she\u2019d had that girlish sense of glee when he admitted he wasn\u2019t sorry. She could work with that.</p><p>A clement breeze wafted over her. The warmth of the leather soaked into her back and she was lulled into total relaxation. She sighed and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he whispered, \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She scrambled up and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cScoot over.\u201d Using the stirrup, Chase vaulted onto the back of the mechanical bull.</p><p>Ava watched him get situated; it wasn\u2019t much different than when he readied himself to ride a real bull. He offered his hand and hauled her closer, laughing at her shriek of surprise as he draped her thighs over the top of his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been dying to do this,\u201d Chase murmured, and that sinful mouth lowered to her neck, bestowing hot, sucking kisses that set her blood on fire. His tongue traced her collarbone from her shoulder to her throat. \u201cPut your hands on me, Ava.\u201d</p><p>Chase nearly purred when she thrust her hands through is hair. He nuzzled her cleavage while he unbuttoned her blouse and flicked open her bra so her breasts tumbled free. A low groan of male pleasure vibrated through her body as he sucked her nipples with single-minded devotion.</p><p>\u201cSo sexy.\u201d Chase scattered kisses up to her ear. \u201cYou ready to take a real risk?\u201d</p><p>Head muzzy from his kisses, she mumbled, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Hold on to me. I\u2019m gonna turn the machine on slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d The back end of mechanical bull lifted, sending Ava sliding forward. Her whole body tensed as her weight rested on Chase fully.</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s why I\u2019m on the bottom.\u201d</p><p>The bull spun to the left and she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Ava blinked at him. Then Chase\u2019s mouth was on hers. His hands were on her. His body moved with the rhythm of the bull, and he urged hers to do the same.</p><p>She fell into him, giving herself over to his gracefulness, his athleticism and his sensuality.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he muttered against her lips. \u201cRelax, baby, trust me.\u201d</p><p>The constant swoop of her stomach faded, mostly because Chase distracted her. And what sweet, hot distraction it was. His rough fingertips stroking the inside of her thighs. His blistering kisses. His sexy growl against her skin. The pressure of her clit pressing into the hard muscle of his abdomen with the bull\u2019s every downward drop.</p><p>His hot breath flowed over her ear, sending a shiver of anticipation through her when he whispered, \u201cAre you wet for me, Ava Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kiss me once and I\u2019m ready for you.\u201d</p><p>The bucking stopped. \u201cScoot back for a sec.\u201d Keeping his fiery blue eyes on hers, Chase unbuttoned his jeans, unzipped and pulled his cock out. He reached around to bring her back onto his lap. \u201cYou ride me. I\u2019ll ride the bull.\u201d He lifted her and all that male hardness filled her in one deep plunge.</p><p>After Chase turned the bull back on, he reconnected to the rhythm of sex. Feeling his muscles flow in accord with the machine brought another level of appreciation for his riding abilities.</p><p>The spinning apparatus added another dimension. When the bull slanted forward, she shifted her hips side to side, trying to create friction on her clit. Even as she impaled herself on Chase\u2019s cock fully, it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>\u201cChase. I\u2019m close. I need...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know baby. Me too.\u201d He stopped the bull at a steep angle. Kissing the upper swells of her breasts, he said, \u201cLie back.\u201d</p><p>When her spine met the hard surface, Chase hooked his feet in the stirrups and stood. His hands slid beneath her butt, raising her so he could thrust into her hard. His gaze winged between her face and the way her breasts bounced with his every thrust.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself,\u201d he panted. \u201cI wanna watch you get yourself off.\u201d</p><p>Ava covered her mound with her hand, scissoring her index and middle finger over her clit, before sliding down to where Chase\u2019s cock plunged in and out, performing the same motion.</p><p>His molten eyes snared hers. \u201cTeasin\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe second I touch my clit I\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>She dragged her middle finger up the wet seam of her sex. Once she reached her clit, she rubbed up and down and quickly unraveled. Blood pulsed beneath the pad of her stroking finger, tightening her pussy muscles around Chase\u2019s cock.</p><p>He whispered her name, and thrust powerfully, staying buried inside her on the last stroke as he came.</p><p>Then Chase angled forward, remaining imbedded in her body, trapping her hand between them, placing his forearms by her head as he kissed her. A kiss unlike any other.</p><p>Ava felt weightless. Boneless. Dizzy. Buzzed.</p><p>Buzz, buzz, buzz.</p><p>She batted away the annoying insect but it kept buzzing around her head. Go away. I\u2019m basking in afterglow. She swatted one more time and her hand connected with a solid object.</p><p>Her eyes flew open.</p><p>Stars twinkled above her. She was still stretched out on the mechanical bull. But she was alone. No heat and stickiness between her thighs. No weight of Chase\u2019s body on hers as he kissed her sweetly in the aftermath of zealous lovemaking.</p><p>It\u2019d just been a damn dream.</p><p>The truth was, she knew that for at least the next two weeks, the only place she\u2019d get down and dirty with him was in her dreams.</p><p>Chapter Ten </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ava checked the guard on the electric clippers. Better to leave it a little long than trim it too short. She bent down, letting the ends of his dark hair tickle her cheek as her lips grazed his ear. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>Chase released a shudder and she smiled. He wasn\u2019t the only one who could send mixed signals.</p><p>Standing above him, she wedged his knees between her thighs as she wrapped the fingers of her left hand around his jaw. Keeping his head at the proper angle, Ava warned, \u201cHold still,\u201d and clicked on the clippers.</p><p>The first strip of hair to go was dead center, front to back. Then she moved to tackle the right side and finished with the left side. She brushed the hair from his shoulders, wishing some had landed on his arms, giving her an excuse to feel those bulging biceps. \u201cHave a look.\u201d</p> <p>He stood and meandered to the mirror. Ava watched him smooth his hand over his scalp. \u201cWow. That looks different, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver worn your hair that short?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Chase slanted this way and that.</p><p>\u201cIs it good? Or bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I guess.\u201d Chase\u2019s vivid blue eyes met hers in the mirror. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p> <p>I think cutting off your gorgeous black locks just increased your hotness by a factor of ten million.</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>He mugged in the mirror. \u201cI like it, but I think I wanna go just a hair shorter\u2014ha-ha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Stop admiring your handsome self and sit so we can get this done.\u201d</p><p>He plopped back on the chair.</p><p>Ava straddled his legs and held his head in place. The second trim didn\u2019t take as long as the first. She shaved the hair on the back of his neck. Her hands took one last lingering sweep over his shorn hair, down his beautiful face, to his broad shoulders. She scooted back. \u201cYou look good with short hair, Chase.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. Do I look recognizable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe goatee helps.\u201d</p><p>He snagged the broom from her. \u201cI\u2019ll finish up. We need to get on the road so I can make my check-in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour hours.\u201d</p><p>Once they were cruising down the blacktop, Ava cranked her window open for fresh air. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA one-night rodeo in Broken Bow, Nebraska. Then we\u2019ll hit smaller rodeos within driving distance during the week. Next Thursday, Friday and Saturday we\u2019ll be in Scottsbluff, Nebraska. At some point I\u2019m thinking we\u2019ll head to Cody, Wyoming. Their rodeo is set up differently. During tourist season, they have a new slate every night, and hand out a new purse every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of purse? Because I\u2019d like to win a purse.\u201d</p> <p>Chase laughed. Hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. In rodeo, purse means the amount of money paid out to the winners.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cAin\u2019t like a purse you can buy on Ro-day-o Drive in LA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are getting a huge kick out of me being such a neophyte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck you out, using fancy words to confuse a simple cowboy. What\u2019s a neophyte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who\u2019s inexperienced in a certain area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a greenhorn. Or a tenderfoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019d prefer old Western terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re on the subject, we need to get a few things straight about this road trip. Traveling partners split the expenses fifty-fifty. The goal is to get to the next event as cheaply and quickly as possible. Sometimes that means no time to check into a motel and clean up, especially if the events are geographically spread out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it my imagination, or did you emphasize cheaply?\u201d</p><p>Chase grinned. \u201cGlad to hear you picked up on that. We ain\u2019t gonna be staying anyplace as fancy as the Cooper hotel chain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sorta figured,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>\u201cIs that gonna be a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Hollywood, you\u2019re rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Ava said a little abruptly.</p><p>\u201cSo your idea of roughin\u2019 it and mine are likely polar opposites.\u201d Chase took his eyes off the road and peered at her over the top of his sunglasses. \u201cI ain\u2019t askin\u2019 this to be a nosy dick, but have you ever tried to live on a budget?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had no reason to. \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything? I can pay my half of the traveling expenses, no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn cash? We ain\u2019t using credit cards at all on this trip. We\u2019re both supposed to be under the radar. Heck, we\u2019re even using fake names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me some credit, Chase. I actually know how not to leave a credit card trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that still doesn\u2019t tell me if you\u2019ve ever made a budget and stuck to it? Do you know what it\u2019s like to be completely out of money?\u201d</p><p>Ava fought a shudder at the very idea of being out of money permanently. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so. How much cash do you have on you right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss money with you,\u201d she snipped.</p><p>\u201cTough shit. How much?\u201d</p><p>She debated on telling the truth, or lying and stealthily lining her pockets with cash from an ATM during their next stop.</p><p>Chase eased onto the shoulder. \u201cDump your purse and count out the money in your wallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do we have to do this right now?\u201d</p><p>He offered her a wolflike smile. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll play fair.\u201d</p><p>Ava gasped with total sarcasm. \u201cYou callin\u2019 me a liar or a cheat, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, I reckon.\u201d He patted the bench seat. \u201cLay it on me, baby.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d like to lay something on you\u2014my lips, my hands, my whole body.</p><p>Friends, Ava, remember? Friends, buddies, pals. Focus.</p><p>Hiding her superior look because she had planned for using only cash, Ava unsnapped the billfold portion of her wallet. She counted out seventeen hundred dollars and dug in her purse, finding another two hundred dollars worth of crumpled and folded bills.</p><p>Chase took out his wallet and counted out twenty-one hundred dollars, then reached in the glove compartment, coming up with five hundred more.</p><p>Holy crap. He had more money than she did. Not fair. \u201cCan we stop at a cash machine so we\u2019re even?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be even. Remember I hafta pay contestant entry fees outta that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you win...you\u2019ll have more money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not keeping anything I earn. Don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do with it yet.\u201d He shoved his money back in his wallet. \u201cSo I gotta know, Hollywood. You up to the challenge of living like those of us who don\u2019t have an easily replenished pile of cash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll know you ain\u2019t serious about wanting to experience something real, \u2019cause living on a budget is as real as it gets for most people.\u201d</p><p>Ava understood why Chase was pushing her. Didn\u2019t mean she appreciated it, but if she said no, everything would end before it began. What was she out? Wasn\u2019t like the temptation for gourmet dining would be an issue. Or boutique shopping for designer originals. Or forking over big bucks for a mani-pedi at an exclusive spa. Or buying pricey cocktails at trendy nightclubs.</p><p>\u201cAva?\u201d</p><p>She met his challenging gaze head-on. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow the real adventure begins.\u201d After gifting her with his dazzling smile, he returned to the highway.</p><p>She dozed off at some point. After she woke, to the sound of crunching sunflower seeds, she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay to ride with as sore as you\u2019ve been the last couple days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t as bad as it was. I\u2019ll be stiff no matter what I do, so I might as well try making the buzzer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the entry fee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixty-five bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to drop you off so I can find a hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But it needs to be under a hundred bucks a night.\u201d</p><p>Ava started humming the music from Mission Impossible and Chase laughed.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re dropping me off, you\u2019ll have to park in public parking since I won\u2019t have a contestant tag yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have a separate area for contestants?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cTimed-event competitors take their horses and horse trailers take up a shitload of parking space. The competitors who travel with their family have campers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like the contestant area is one traveling party town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be right. When I first started competing and I didn\u2019t have a nickel to my name, I\u2019d drag an old tent along. Some of the stuff I saw people doin\u2019...gave me quite the sexual education at the tender age of sixteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the juicy details so I\u2019m not shocked by what I see.\u201d</p><p>Chase smirked. \u201cShocked. Right. I bet you\u2019ve seen wild stuff in wacky Cal-y-forn-i-ay, so the countrified version will probably seem tame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not an answer, Sundance.\u201d</p><p>He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel. \u201cI went to the first overnight event by myself \u2019cause my buddy Jet couldn\u2019t get time off from work. I set up my pup tent. Had a couple of pilfered beers in my cooler, feeling like I was hot shit, right? So I\u2019m sitting in my lawn chair, watching the goin\u2019s on around the campground after the event ended. I hear a noise and creep around my tent to see two guys and a girl at the picnic shelter. They\u2019re having a good time. One guy and a girl are clearly a couple \u2019cause they can\u2019t keep their hands off each other. I start to back away when the other guy grabs the girl and kisses her. I\u2019m thinking his buddy is gonna punch his lights out for touchin\u2019 his girl, but he yanks the girl\u2019s top down.</p><p>\u201cThe chick starts rubbing herself all over both of them. The guy behind her lifts up her skirt and shoves his hand between her thighs. I see his arm moving and I wondered what he was doing to make her squirm like that. She starts moaning real loud and the guy behind her turns her head to the side and kisses her to keep her quiet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chase\u2019s retelling of the story was making Ava squirmy.</p><p>\u201cI figure they\u2019re all done. Except this chick dropped to her knees. At sixteen, I knew what that meant even when I hadn\u2019t found a girl willing to...ah, perform that particular act on me yet. I thought she\u2019d blow one guy at a time while the other one watched. But no, she worked them both at the same time. Switching back and forth. And I was shocked that they were moving, fucking her mouth, not standing there letting her do the work. Then the guys take a half a step back and jack off on her tits. I\u2019d never seen anything like it live and in person.\u201d</p><p>Ava rested her shoulders against the door, surprised by his honesty. \u201cDid it turn you on, Chase?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMad me hard as a fuckin\u2019 brick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>His cheeks bloomed a charming shade of pink and he smiled guiltily. \u201cI jacked off right there. \u2019Course, afterward I sorta felt like a pervert. But it didn\u2019t stop me from checking out the picnic shelter the next night to see if they\u2019d come back.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSo how did seeing that affect you, other than making you horny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted that type of experience for myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI assume you got to experience that, or something like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when he clammed up. Ava waited a couple of minutes before she said, \u201cCome on, Chase. We\u2019re friends. Friends share stuff like this all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even with your brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. So can we drop it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Ava put her hands in the middle of the bench seat. \u201cTo show you this friends sharing thing isn\u2019t one-sided, you tell me the rest of the story and I\u2019ll tell you a story about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d He lifted his ball cap off his head and yanked it back down. \u201cIs this the way the trip is gonna be? You nagging me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNagging? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad word choice. What I meant is, are you gonna keep pestering me to blab personal shit that no one else on the planet knows about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Chase, it\u2019s really too fucking bad that I want to get to know you on more than a superficial level, because God knows I don\u2019t have enough of those fake friendships and relationships in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s harder for you to be my friend\u2014to trust me, to talk to me honestly\u2014than it would be if you just jumped my bones and fucked my brains out. But you\u2019re the one who set the friendship parameters, not me. And friends talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we please just fucking drop it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cWho isn\u2019t being real now? You\u2019re expecting me to change and yet you don\u2019t have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidja ever think I don\u2019t wanna put myself in a bad light in front of you?\u201d</p><p>Such a self-protective macho man. Chase was so different from the sensitive West Coast guys who constantly shared every emotion, every thought, every bad and good deed. He was more of a loner than she\u2019d first suspected. He held himself at arm\u2019s length\u2014a trait she recognized because she was the same. To get to the real Chase, she\u2019d have to lay herself bare for him. The very thought caused her pulse to skip, but she\u2019d do it.</p><p>\u201cGreat. First you wouldn\u2019t shut up and now you\u2019re giving me the silent treatment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m trying to find a way to convince you to trust me. That whatever bad light you shine on yourself, I plan to do the same.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Ava watched the mile markers go by. After they\u2019d passed the fourth one, Chase spoke.</p><p>\u201cI wanted that type of experience, hell, any type of sexual experience, but I knew...\u201d He puffed out a breath. \u201cLook, truth is I was a short, scrawny, sixteen-year-old kid. I hadn\u2019t added any height to my boy frame in over a year. Trust me. I measured every week. And every week I came up lacking. You\u2019ve met my brothers. And my cousins.\u201d He reached for his water bottle in the cup holder and took a long drink. \u201cMore than one person asked me if I\u2019d been adopted by the McKays because I sure didn\u2019t \u2018measure up\u2019 to them. Probably thought they were bein\u2019 funny, and I didn\u2019t have the life experience to give \u2019em what for.</p><p>\u201cThe first summer I started sneaking off to rodeos, I figured out I needed weight training. Not only to build my strength as a bull rider, but to change my physical appearance. I convinced myself if I was muscle bound, then maybe girls wouldn\u2019t care so much that I\u2019m short.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s stomach muscles knotted at his admission, but she didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cIn addition to ranch work, I lifted weights and added daily cardio. The change to my body came pretty fast. No steroids, in case you\u2019re wondering. By the following summer, I\u2019d bulked up and was no longer a skinny teenage boy. After the physical transformation...well, I finally had my pick of the ladies. So I\u2019ve kept up a weight training regimen for the past twelve years, half afraid if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll revert to that ninety-pound weakling sitting in the shadows with my cock in my hand, just watching.\u201d</p><p>Knowing he needed a moment before she responded, she dug out a protein bar and offered him half, surprised when he took it. Maybe he thought it was a peace offering.</p><p>\u201cNo comments?\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou took charge of your body because you wanted to. And it changed your life. That\u2019s admirable. I can\u2019t say the same. I let other people\u2019s perceptions and expectations change mine.\u201d She leaned across the seat. But this time she cupped her breasts. \u201cThese? Not real.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s eyes wandered over her cleavage and up her face. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. I had a boob job two months after I turned nineteen. Wanna feel them?\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open. \u201cWhat? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d Ava snatched his hand and curled it around her left breast, holding it in place. \u201cBecause I know you\u2019re a tit guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Ava, what the fuck are you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m providing a visual aid with my show and tell.\u201d When he attempted to move his hand back, she circled his wrist with her other hand. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to turn this into something sexual. I\u2019m showing you what I gave up in order to have the perfect Hollywood body and a rack that makes men weep with want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you give up?\u201d he asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cI have very little sensation in my breasts. I went from flat-chested to busty in three hours and as soon as the incisions healed, I went out on casting calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the ah...enhancement work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I got the first role I auditioned for. And the second. But by the third cattle call, I realized I looked like everybody else. We were clones. Interchangeable. Blonde hair, big boobs, tanned, toned bodies, collagen lips. The only differences were our eye colors, but that could be changed too.\u201d Ava gently removed his hand.</p><p>\u201cYour parents...?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cMy parents were appalled I\u2019d \u2018maimed\u2019 myself. It was awful. Not having their support hurt me so I lashed out, reminding them it was my body, my choice, my life, all that crap. We had limited contact for almost a year. That\u2019s not the worst part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. Ava darlin\u2019, look at me. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Ava looked at him. \u201cThe first time I ended up in bed with a guy after receiving my new gigantic breasts? I felt nothing when he touched me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould it\u2019ve been operator error?\u201d</p><p>She actually laughed and saw his quick smile. \u201cI\u2019d hoped...until the same thing happened with the next guy to come along. And the next guy. Stimulation by my own hand or a lover\u2019s hand rarely does anything for me. So I just...\u201d An honest to God blush heated her cheeks because she\u2019d never admitted that to anyone.</p><p>\u201cCome on, friend. Don\u2019t hold out on me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am an actress. I learned to fake my response when guys went crazy over my tits.\u201d She scowled. \u201cWasn\u2019t something I had to worry about with Jake. The fact he wasn\u2019t enamored with my chest should\u2019ve been a tip-off.\u201d</p><p>Chase grinned. \u201cYep. Them shoes and him not bein\u2019 all over you twenty-four/seven were clues you missed.\u201d He reached over and traced the outline of her jaw. \u201cSad to say, most of the women I\u2019ve been with over the years are interchangeable and unmemorable, so I know clones. And you, Ava Rose Cooper Dumond, are not a clone. Not even fuckin\u2019 close.\u201d</p><p>That was one of the sweetest, most heartfelt compliments she\u2019d ever received. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He refocused on his driving. \u201cWe\u2019re about ten miles outside town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I go to the contestant area and they\u2019ll let me back there to find you?\u201d</p><p>Chase shook his head. \u201cThe contestant area is for contestants only. They\u2019re strict about it and have security guards to keep non-authorized people out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how am I supposed to get close ups of your rides?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t your video camera have a zoom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but the footage will be better if I\u2019m closer.\u201d She really couldn\u2019t believe there wasn\u2019t some way around the security rule. \u201cNo one gets back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuthorized people. Stock contractors. Event coordinators. The media.\u201d</p><p>That gave Ava an idea. Might take a few days to execute, so she said nothing.</p><p>Chase seemed distracted and didn\u2019t speak until they parked at the main entrance to the fairgrounds. \u201cHang out at the grounds and I\u2019ll find you when the rodeo ends.\u201d He grabbed his equipment bag from behind the seat. \u201cWill you be all right driving around here?\u201d</p><p>Ava snatched the keys from him. \u201cI\u2019m from LA, remember?\u201d She squeezed his biceps. \u201cBe careful tonight, Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. See you later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Chase repositioned his equipment bag, trying not to smack into bystanders as he made his way to the registration table. The long line indicated he\u2019d found the right place.</p><p>He automatically lifted his hand to adjust his cowboy hat, a nervous habit he\u2019d had his entire life, but his fingertip connected with the curved bill of his ball cap, not his Stetson.</p> <p>Everything about being here felt damn weird. He glanced around. Looked like the chutes were well maintained. The spectator stands were covered to keep out the worst of the midday heat and the occasional cloudburst. A brand new electronic scoreboard anchored one end. All in all, a nice county rodeo.</p><p>The line moved ahead a few feet. When Chase reached for his duffel bag, something struck him in the left shoulder. He glanced up sharply to see the young kid in front of him, backing away, a look of alarm on his face.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I lost my grip and it slid down... I didn\u2019t m-mean to...\u201d</p><p>Christ. The kid was barely eighteen and looked scared Chase was going to beat the crap out of him. Chase shrugged. \u201cNo big deal. I\u2019m still standing.\u201d He thrust out his hand. \u201cBill Chase.\u201d</p><p>The kid dropped his equipment bag so quickly it missed Chase\u2019s foot by barely an inch. \u201cI\u2019m Ryan, Ryan Ackerman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, Ryan, Ryan Ackerman, what event are you competing in?\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s face lit up like a firecracker. \u201cBull ridin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m official and everything.\u201d Ryan fumbled for his wallet in his back pocket and whipped out a PRCA card.</p><p>Chase took it, checking the date. The card still smelled of new plastic, as it was only a week old. \u201cCongrats are in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019m really excited to be here.\u201d</p> <p>No lie. The kid fairly bounced from boot to boot. Chase grinned. \u201cYou have been on a bull before, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI was on the high school rodeo team. Ended up fourth in the county semifinals, but third place is the cutoff for finals so I didn\u2019t get to go to state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here now, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>The line moved and Ryan kept a firmer grip on his bag even as he turned around to talk to Chase. \u201cHow long you been ridin\u2019 bulls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOfficially? About eleven years. Off and on. Off, mostly lately. I decided to hit rodeos this summer to try and get back on track.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s gaze briefly dropped to Chase\u2019s belt buckle, which was the fastest way to figure out if you were in the presence of a champion. But it wasn\u2019t like Chase could wear his Man of Steel belt buckle at these events, so he\u2019d opted for just a plain belt and buckle.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do too. In between when I\u2019m working construction for my mom\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man\u2019s gotta make a livin\u2019. So is your mom here, watching your debut?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s workin\u2019 this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Ryan was at the head of the line. He showed his PRCA pro card, and when the lady said, \u201cThat\u2019ll be sixty-five dollars,\u201d Ryan opened his wallet and froze.</p><p>Chase stealthily peered around the kid\u2019s arm. He held two twenties, a five and four singles.</p><p>Ryan stammered. The woman manning the registration was sympathetic, but Chase knew she wouldn\u2019t let the kid compete without paying the entry fee. Chase took a twenty out of his pocket and let it fall on the ground. Then he tapped Ryan on the shoulder. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>When Ryan turned, Chase noticed the kid\u2019s face was fire-engine red. \u201cAh, sorry, we\u2019re just tryin\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think something fell outta your pocket when you took out your wallet.\u201d</p><p>Relief swept over Ryan\u2019s face when he saw the twenty dollars behind his equipment bag. \u201cGosh. Thanks. I thought I had enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Tickled Chase to no end to see Ryan\u2019s excitement when the lady handed him his contestant number.</p><p>Ryan grinned at Chase. \u201cNice meetin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you behind the chutes.\u201d Chase handed over his PRCA card and entry cash to the secretary.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am. Is there a section reserved for family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Section F, first six rows. Seating is first come, first serve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll let her know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his cell phone. Two hours before the performance started. He texted Ava the family section info and cut around the contestant entrance. Normally he loved being behind the chutes trash talking with the other riders. But he feared he\u2019d give too much of himself away, so he opted to stretch out, warm up and get his head in the game by finding a remote corner by the pens.</p><p>As team roping started, Chase paced along the back fence until he heard a noise that sounded like...retching. He turned the corner and found the rookie, bent over, hands on his knees.</p><p>And Chase thought he was nervous? Poor kid. He\u2019d been there. He leaned against the rail and waited until Ryan pushed himself upright. With his pasty-white complexion, the kid resembled a zombie. Chase didn\u2019t say anything, merely handed him a bottle of water.</p><p>Ryan slumped next to him. Took a drink, swished it around in his mouth and spat it out. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarf before I rode? Yep. \u2019Course, I always told myself it was from something bad I ate or drank and definitely not from bein\u2019 scared shitless.\u201d</p><p>That earned Chase a wan smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal. In fact, I\u2019d think you were abnormal if you weren\u2019t shaking in your boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. But the trick is to use that fear and control it, not let it control you. Make sense?\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat number you ridin\u2019 tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ridin\u2019 sixteen. If you want, I can help pull your rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d Ryan asked with total surprise.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t like we\u2019re competing against each other. We\u2019re tryin\u2019 to best a bull, and in my mind, that puts us on the same side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Chase nudged him with his shoulder, or tried to, but the kid was a solid six inches taller than him. \u201cI\u2019m always right. Now come on, let\u2019s get ready to ride us some bulls.\u201d</p><p>Barrel racing ended. Most competitors were behind the scene, willing to lend a hand to whoever needed it. Chase watched as three of the first eight riders covered their bull. Then three more.</p><p>The kid was quick getting his hand in position and a wrap. An older guy stayed to help and released his hold on Ryan\u2019s vest when the kid nodded his hatted head.</p><p>The gate opened and they were off. First thing Chase noticed: Ryan wasn\u2019t spurring much, but he remained on the bull, matching his upper body movements to every jerk and twist. When the buzzer sounded, Chase whooped and hollered with the rest of the riders.</p><p>The score boomed over the loudspeaker. \u201cHow about a ride of seventy-eight for the PRCA debut of this Nebraska cowboy?\u201d</p><p>Not a bad score for a rookie. Not bad at all.</p><p>Chase wandered down to his chute and performed a couple of stretches before he secured his headgear. Funny thing was, for as much as he\u2019d initially bitched about wearing the helmet during the training with Cash, he\u2019d gotten used to it.</p><p>\u201cHere. Lemme hold it for you,\u201d Ryan said. Once he was set, Chase slipped in the mouth guard and ran through his final mental checklist.</p><p>Good seat. Check.</p><p>Hips parallel. Check.</p><p>Chin up, arm up. Check and check.</p><p>Ready to rock and roll.</p><p>Chase nodded at the gate man.</p><p>They exploded from the chute, dirt flying. Chase didn\u2019t hear the crowd. He kept his focus on adjusting to each minute maneuver the bull made, and somehow, everything clicked into place.</p><p>The bull wasn\u2019t a jumper, but a spinner. Or so Chase thought until the animal nearly went vertical. But he gritted his teeth and held on until the buzzer sounded. As soon as he jerked his hand free, he sailed off and whipped off his helmet, squinting at the scoreboard. Nothing yet. The bullfighter jogged over with his bull rope and high-fived him.</p><p>Finally, as he reached the side gate, he heard, \u201cFolks, we have a new leader. Let\u2019s hear it for an eighty-one point ride from Wyoming\u2019s Bill Chase, on the rank bull, Gnarly Dude, brought to you by Jackson Stock Contracting.\u201d</p><p>Chase waved to the crowd and disappeared into the contestant\u2019s area, switching out his helmet for his battered ball cap. He leaned against the railing to catch his breath. To replay the ride while it was fresh in his mind.</p><p>Isn\u2019t that Ava\u2019s job as a videographer? To provide you with instant replay?</p><p>Ava. He hadn\u2019t thought about her in hours. So when someone poked him in the chest hard, three times, he half-expected he\u2019d look up into those stunning aquamarine eyes of hers.</p><p>No such luck. Ryan jammed his finger in Chase\u2019s sternum twice more. The kid looked furious. Before Chase could speak, Ryan bit off, \u201cI need to talk to you. In private. Right now.\u201d He stomped over to the corner by the empty pens.</p><p>Chase followed. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Ryan loomed over him. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to be a bull rider since I was nine years old. So like any kid who discovered a dream, I became obsessed. I watched every bull-riding event on TV. Including spending the last five years studying the riders.\u201d His voice dropped to a fierce whisper. \u201cDid you really think no one would recognize your ridin\u2019 style, Chase McKay?\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve studied your form more than any other rider, including the reigning champs. You\u2019re like my hero...and instead of bein\u2019 happy I finally get to meet you, I\u2019m pissed off that you\u2019re running around here lying to folks. Are you doing this for kicks? You don\u2019t get enough adoration ridin\u2019 in the big league and bein\u2019 on TV every week?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chase tamped down the immediate flare of temper. \u201cI understand why you\u2019re upset. But if you truly know my percentages and how I ride, then you also know how bad I\u2019ve been sucking it up. Not just in the last few months, but in the last year. I\u2019ve had a boatload of distractions. Made some piss-poor choices that affected my ability to concentrate.\u201d He sent Ryan a questioning glance. \u201cWhen was my last good ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides winning the championship at Man of Steel last year?\u201d Ryan scratched the tip of his chin. \u201cI\u2019d have to say Tacoma. On Bad Reputation. You covered all your bulls, and if not for that single low score of eighty, you woulda won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t win. It\u2019s been a struggle. Almost like I forgot how to ride a goddamn bull. You have no idea how frustrating it\u2019s been for me.\u201d Chase blew out a slow breath. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not my intention to trick anyone. I just wanna get on as many bulls as I can. So I\u2019m asking you, Ryan. Please don\u2019t turn me in. My entire career depends on no one knowin\u2019 it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheesh. I ain\u2019t gonna snitch on ya.\u201d He sighed. Dug the toe of his boot in the dirt. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019d be like, bein\u2019 you but having to pretend you\u2019re someone else. Someone average. Someone less successful. Don\u2019t it feel weird?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little. But mostly it feels good to ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked better than you have in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Think anyone else recognized my ridin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Most folks will chalk up the similarities to coincidence, kinda like I did at first. \u2019Cause no one would ever believe Chase McKay would be competing in a PRCA rodeo in Broken Bow, Nebraska.\u201d</p><p>Chase chuckled. \u201cTrue. That\u2019s why I\u2019m keeping a low profile around other riders and with the public.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be hard to do since you won,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>The officials herded them back into the arena for the winners\u2019 presentation.</p><p>The older guy who helped Ryan in the chute said, \u201cGreat ride, kid.\u201d He offered his hand to Chase. \u201cTaz Lashlee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you, Taz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t seen you around the circuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen off doin\u2019 other stuff. Thought I\u2019d give it a go again.\u201d Chase folded his arms over his chest. \u201cSorry I missed your ride.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was last out. So I covered my bull. Not pretty, like you done, but I\u2019m good with finishing third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long you been rodeoin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Taz\u2019s smile was missing a few teeth, which wasn\u2019t unusual in the world of rough stock riders. \u201cLonger than is smart, that\u2019s for damn sure. I got a whole lotta try in me for bein\u2019 so long in the tooth.\u201d He grinned again.</p><p>\u201cTaz also rides bareback,\u201d Ryan inserted. \u201cAnd he\u2019s being modest. He\u2019s made it to the world finals three times. Twice in bareback and once in bull riding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awesome, Taz. Congrats,\u201d Chase said. \u201cWhere\u2019s home for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere and there. I spend most my time on the road. Seen a lot of this great country. Met a lot of fine folks.\u201d</p><p>Then Chase understood. Taz was part of a dying breed, men so obsessed with rodeo they\u2019d given up anything resembling a normal life. The lure of a championship buckle proved too strong, and like an addict, Taz couldn\u2019t separate himself from his fix of possible rodeo glory. Being a rodeo cowboy was all he knew. All he wanted to know. Chase remembered being at an event with Colby, and the late night conversation at the campground about old timers competing on the circuit. Both Colby and his traveling partner, Trevor Glanzer, swore they\u2019d quit before they gave their entire lives up to the sport.</p><p>Being a new competitor at the time, Chase hadn\u2019t understood ever giving up the thrill of riding. But the longer Chase stayed in the business, the clearer his future became. He never wanted to be that guy\u2014the grizzled fifty- or sixty-something rodeo dog\u2014living out of his truck, with nothing to show for his life except aches and pains and stories about life on the road.</p> <p>So how many more good years did he have left? What would he do with his life? His future?</p><p>\u201cGot awful quiet there,\u201d Taz said. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Chase offered him a smile. \u201cYeah. I just realized I\u2019ve gotta meet someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA female someone?\u201d Taz asked, elbowing Ryan and winking lewdly.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes. Nice meeting you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be ridin\u2019 around here again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be outta Nebraska until the two day event in Scottsbluff next weekend.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s face lit up. \u201cAwesome! We\u2019ll be there too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya then.\u201d Chase snagged his equipment bag and exited the contestant area. He\u2019d no more than cleared the gate when three women surrounded him. The old Chase would\u2019ve smiled charmingly, flirted outrageously, made plans with one or all of the buxom buckle bunnies. The new Chase kept his head down after the \u201cNice ride, cowboy\u201d comments, and sidestepped them.</p><p>But the determined ladies followed him, chattering like crows, apparently not caring that he had someplace else to be. He looked up to see how far he was from the stands and saw her.</p><p>Ava.</p><p>Christ, she took his breath away.</p><p>Chase had about three seconds before the lovely Ava launched herself at him. He wrapped her in his arms and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cWhat a great ride! You were amazing. You looked totally in control.\u201d</p><p>He released her, but snuck in a quick peck on the mouth before he met her gaze. \u201cYou liked seeing me in control, huh?\u201d</p><p>A soft blush stole across her cheeks. \u201cI taped it, but the angle wasn\u2019t that great, so I don\u2019t know how it turned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be great.\u201d That\u2019s when Chase noticed the hostility flowing from the buckle bunnies. He tugged Ava to his side before addressing the trio behind him. \u201cLadies. Have a great evening.\u201d Then he led Ava away, stopping beneath the stands.</p><p>Ava pushed him against the concrete wall and got right in his face. \u201cIt\u2019s always like that for you? Doesn\u2019t matter if I shaved you bald, you grew an ugly-ass ZZ Top beard and dressed like Charlie Brown, women of all ages would still line up for a shot at you, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Unsure how to answer, he squirmed.</p><p>Her eyes searched his.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you kissed me again. Out of the blue.\u201d</p><p>Closing his eyes, Chase let his head fall back against the wall. \u201cYou caught that, huh.\u201d Great response, McKay, especially when you have no excuse.</p><p>Then Ava\u2019s warm, soft lips pressed against his. He bit back a groan. Fought the urge to spin her around, pin her to the wall and kiss her until they couldn\u2019t see straight.</p><p>She eased back and Chase opened his eyes.</p><p>Ava smirked. \u201cBe warned. If you steal a kiss, so will I. Anything you do to me? I\u2019ll do right back to you.\u201d</p><p>Goddamn, she was hell on his good intentions. \u201cThen no more kissing.\u201d</p><p>Something like resignation flitted through her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re back on the road early tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. We\u2019ve got one-nighters for the next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re back in familiar territory.\u201d</p><p>Chase stopped and stared at her. \u201cWas that a shot at me?\u201d</p><p>She lightly punched him in the arm. \u201cFriends give each other shit all the time. Suck it up, cowboy. Let\u2019s get you fed so you\u2019re not so cranky.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>An afternoon rodeo allowed the rare night off. He\u2019d just slipped on his last clean pair of Cinch jeans, when two knocks preceded Ava opening the door and waltzing into the bathroom. Damn good thing he hadn\u2019t been standing around in his skin.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chase, oh, sorry...\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look particularly sorry as she stared at his chest. Before he backed off to grab his shirt, Ava traced a fresh bruise on the bottom curve of his rib cage. His skin beaded beneath her tender touch.</p><p>\u201cIs this the only bruise you got today?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI guess. I didn\u2019t really look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it doesn\u2019t hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Her beautiful, skeptical eyes connected with his.</p><p>Chase covered her hand with his on his stomach. \u201cI\u2019m not bein\u2019 a tough guy to impress you, Ava. I get the shit beat outta me by bulls on a weekly basis, so I\u2019ve usually got pain one place or another.\u201d He stepped back. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and please tell me you\u2019ve got a real restaurant in mind and not just a stop at the Qwickie Mart for more sunflower seeds and licorice.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThere\u2019s a glimpse of that snooty California girl, but as a matter of fact, I\u2019ve heard about this supper club called Steak\u2019n a Claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, pray tell, is a supper club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou eat on one side and there\u2019s entertainment and a bar on the other side. Something you\u2019d be interested in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid we\u2019ll be recognized?\u201d</p><p>He probably deserved that, since he\u2019d purposely made them keep a low profile this first week on the road. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna go, Hollywood, just say so.\u201d</p><p>Ava rose to her three-inch height advantage and crowded him. \u201cI just asked a question, McKay, so don\u2019t get snippy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen don\u2019t get snippy. Men get pissy.\u201d</p><p>She poked him in the chest. \u201cFine. Don\u2019t get pissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. So is that a yes or a no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. What am I supposed to wear?\u201d</p><p>Her long legs were encased in tight jeans. She wore a fluttery top with silver and blue swirls that reminded him of the ocean. \u201cYou look great right now.\u201d</p><p>Ava rolled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t have a bit of makeup on, my hair is in a clip and I\u2019m wearing flip-flops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tryin\u2019 not to call attention to yourself, remember? You get all fancied up, looking like the Hollywood star you are, and we\u2019ll draw more notice.\u201d He pushed up on his toes and kissed her forehead. \u201cBesides, you don\u2019t need none of that junk anyway. You always look beautiful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSuch sweet bullshit,\u201d she mimicked. \u201cHow soon before you\u2019re ready to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I get my boots on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll change shoes too.\u201d</p> <p>Chase shoved his wallet in his back pocket, and maybe for the first time he\u2019d gone out with a woman, he hadn\u2019t double-checked his condom supply.</p><p>The place was jam-packed and they scored the last table. Pretty basic menu. Several different cuts and sizes of steak. Fried chicken. Pasta. Seafood. The house specialty was the chicken-fried buffalo steak, served with mashed potatoes, gravy and a cold broccoli salad.</p><p>\u201cIt all looks good. I\u2019m too starved to pick one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me to order for you?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>Ava folded her menu and set her elbows on the table. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>The waitress dropped off two glasses of peach iced tea and Chase dumped in three packets of sugar.</p><p>\u201cThis is a cool place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty standard for a small Midwestern town. I try to find joints like this rather than eating at another chain restaurant when I\u2019m on the road.\u201d</p><p>She mumbled something as her focus followed someone\u2019s movements across the room.</p><p>\u201cSee someone you know?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cI see someone I\u2019d like to know,\u201d Ava purred. \u201cSome fine, fine specimens of cowboy in here.\u201d</p> <p>Jealousy had Chase cranking his head to check out which man had caught her eye. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. He\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get lucky and run into him next door at the bar.\u201d Jesus. What the hell had possessed him to say that? He glanced up to see Ava looking at him skeptically. He said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize we\u2019re just friends, Sundance, but you have no problem with me slow dancing with another guy? Right in front of you?\u201d</p><p>Chase hoped his shrug came across nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cWhat if the sexual chemistry was off the charts and I wanted to go home with him?\u201d</p><p>The thought of some random guy touching her in all the ways Chase imagined touching her made his teeth clench and his eyeballs pulse. He ripped open two more packets of sugar and angrily dumped them in his tea, violently stirring the liquid.</p><p>\u201cThat much sugar isn\u2019t good for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither is an STD you might pick up from some loser bar rat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Chase\u2019n Tail McKay is going there with me?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up. \u201cNo. Sorry. Obviously I can\u2019t tell you what to do, besides warning not to bring some strange dude back to the hotel room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with you, but I\u2019m not gonna lie either. While this road trip is fulfilling some of my needs, it\u2019s not fulfilling them all.\u201d</p><p>I can fulfill your every need and then some.</p><p>When Ava leaned across the table, Chase could see so far down her shirt he swore he caught a glimpse of nipple.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had sex in four months, Chase. I didn\u2019t realize how much I missed something until I haven\u2019t had it. It\u2019s like my brain is on a continual loop\u2014imagining rough hands stroking my skin, craving sweet and lazy kisses, or hot and hard kisses, needing an intense body-to-body connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you tryin\u2019 to do to me here?\u201d he half-growled, hating\u2014and loving\u2014that she\u2019d put such graphic images in his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat? We\u2019re friends. I\u2019m sharing my frustrations with you.\u201d Ava blinked innocently. \u201cOh wow. Sorry. For a second I forgot that you are captain of the USS Abstinence... Well, anyway, your lack-of-sex situation is self-imposed, mine is not. And I don\u2019t think I should have to suffer for your choice.\u201d</p><p>The food arrived. Chase watched Ava devour every bite, and tried to ignore the happy little humming moans that reminded him of sex.</p><p>Hell, everything about her made him think of sex.</p><p>Ava shoved aside her empty plate. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019ll be fun to hang out at the bar for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Yippee. He was such an idiot. Now he\u2019d spend the rest of the night watching her entice the local yokels.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>They both glanced at the young woman at the end of the table. \u201cThis might sound strange, but me\u2019n my friends we were wondering if you are...\u201d</p><p>Chase braced himself. Here it was. He should\u2019ve known better than to show up in public place, even a rural dive, with the radiant Ava Cooper.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019d be happy to take your picture,\u201d Ava said pulling Chase from his worrisome thoughts. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great that her friends took her out to celebrate her birthday?\u201d Ava prompted Chase.</p><p>Hugely relieved, he offered the birthday girl a genuine smile. \u201cWhile you\u2019re taking pics, I\u2019ll pay the bill.\u201d Grabbing the check, he stood and tossed a ten on the table for a tip.</p><p>Ava rose from the table. Even with the two inches his dress boots added to his height, Ava towered over him by five inches. She bent forward slightly and put her mouth by his ear. \u201cFess up, cowboy. You were worried one of us had been recognized.\u201d</p><p>Her hot breath sent a tingle straight to his dick. Resisting temptation of turning his head and pressing a kiss at the base of her neck, he sidestepped her. \u201cSee ya over there.\u201d</p><p>Chase secured a high-topped table in the middle of the room with both the bar and the dance floor in view. One thing he\u2019d noticed over the years; patrons in small town bars were a diverse mix of people. Old-timers mingled with the younger set. No one was trying to act hip, cool or aloof. Or wear trendy clothes, although single ladies had done themselves up in tight clothes and rhinestones for a night on the town.</p><p>He purposely sought out places like this, as a reminder real cowboy country existed. Where small town values, hard work and integrity were as prized as a college degree. Where boots, jeans and hats were worn for both everyday and formal attire. Where no one looked at you funny for ordering cheap beer because most folks were on a budget. Where your neighbor would make sure you got home safely if you imbibed a little too much.</p><p>Would Ava see that? Understand it? Find it quaint? Or rural?</p><p>Ava slid next to him with a husky, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. What would you like to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll wander up to the bar and see what they\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re goin\u2019 to the bar to look for a...drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But it wouldn\u2019t hurt to check out my other options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t a lot of options. It\u2019s a slow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been screening me for me?\u201d she asked doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cA guy checking out other guys in a joint like this will get your ass thrown outta here faster than you can say \u2018Brokeback\u2019, trust me.\u201d</p><p>Ava laughed.</p><p>He loved to hear her laugh. So sweetly melodic and yet completely unaffected.</p><p>The cocktail waitress stopped and Ava conferred with her in low tones before she ordered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you decide on?\u201d</p><p>A secretive smile bloomed and then she focused her attention elsewhere. \u201cSee that guy in the red plaid shirt? To your left? What do you think of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim? Seriously? He\u2019s too old for you.\u201d Chase let his gaze wander, acting like he was playing along with the find-Ava-a-fuck-buddy game, when in all likelihood, he\u2019d fuck up any man who laid a hand on her. \u201cWhat about the dude in the bright blue shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww. He\u2019s got a ZZ Top beard. And I think there\u2019s food in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like beards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly on Abraham Lincoln, Van Gogh and the aforementioned little \u2019ol band from Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou coulda told me you hate the goatee I\u2019m growin\u2019,\u201d he said a little shortly.</p><p>She reached over and tenderly stroked the bristly hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I like it. Your lips are perfectly framed and look so kissable. I wondered if it\u2019d be soft or scratchy.\u201d</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t move. Hell, he didn\u2019t breathe as her fingers repeatedly smoothed over his face, his whole face, not just the part with excess hair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much it\u2019s filled in. God. How many times a day do you have to shave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m on tour? Usually twice. Can\u2019t stand how razor stubble feels on my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to feel your razor stubble on my face,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t meant to say that out loud.</p><p>Or maybe she had.</p><p>The cocktail waitress floated a napkin on the table and placed a lowball glass in the center. \u201cTook the bartender a minute to figure out how to make this.\u201d She grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t get a lot of requests for that drink in here.\u201d</p><p>When Ava opened her purse to pay, Chase put his hand over hers. He pulled money from his front shirt pocket and dropped it on the tray.</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t speak until the waitress left. \u201cI can buy my own drinks, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can. You can also open your own door and pay for your supper, but that ain\u2019t happening tonight, so deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, she didn\u2019t argue. She took a healthy sip of her drink and said, \u201cWow. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTie me to the bed and fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Chase choked on his beer. Choked hard enough Ava had to pat him on the back. \u201cWhat the hell did you just ask me to do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to do anything to me, because I knew you\u2019d say no. The name of my drink is called Tie me to the bed and fuck me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand in Scout\u2019s honor pose. \u201cIt was the drink du jour at my friend Bella\u2019s bachelorette party. And if you don\u2019t believe me, ask the waitress.\u201d</p><p>Right. Ava just wanted to hear him say that drink name out loud. In a honky-tonk bar. Not a chance.</p><p>They watched the dancers for three songs. Ava leaned closer. \u201cSee that older couple with matching blue shirts?\u201d He nodded. \u201cHow long you think they\u2019ve been together?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProbably their whole adult lives. Why?\u201d</p><p>She released a wistful sigh. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful. So in tune with each other. I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019d be like to have that solid connection every day. I wish I had my video camera so I could capture their happiness.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Ava did understand more than he credited her.</p> <p>\u201cBy the way, when are you planning to teach me to two-step?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want to dance with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrop it, Ava.\u201d</p><p>Of course she didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ll only put up with so much high-handed behavior, and you\u2019re pissing me off. Answer the question. Why don\u2019t you want to dance with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m short,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>About twenty seconds passed before she was in his face. \u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s your reason for not dancing with me? Here\u2019s where I tell you that is not a valid reason. That\u2019s a sucky reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a valid reason to me. Christ, Ava, you\u2019re a good three inches taller than me when you\u2019re not wearing them three-inch fuck-me heels. I will not make a goddamn spectacle of myself with you towering over me like I\u2019m some kinda midget, getting my jollies burying my face in your chest, no matter how much the latter appeals to me.\u201d Dammit. Not a good time to spout that confession. \u201cYou wanna talk about drawing attention to us? Trust me, that\u2019d do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous and perfect and a California goddess, okay? You never have to deal with the \u2018less than\u2019 issues the rest of us mere mortals do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>He drank, refusing to get sucked into this with her.</p><p>\u201cSo if I wore flats and you wore the heeled boots you\u2019ve got on now? Then would you dance with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you all fired up to dance with me, Hollywood?\u201d</p><p>Ava opened her mouth. Closed it. \u201cI like to dance. Dancing with my girlfriends at the clubs in LA isn\u2019t like close dancing with a man. I just thought it might be fun. Guess I was wrong.\u201d And she was gone.</p><p>Way to be a dickhead.</p><p>As Chase was formulating charming apologies, a female voice said, \u201cHey, I know you.\u201d</p> <p>The woman was probably mid-thirties. Teased and sprayed blonde hair. Heavy glittery makeup. A low-cut tight T-shirt that outlined hard nipples. His first thought? She was a clone. Interchangeable with ninety percent of the women he\u2019d been with in the last decade. Heck, he might\u2019ve actually been with her. And didn\u2019t that make him the worst kind of man-whore? Chase shook his head. \u201cSorry. You\u2019ve confused me with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth, thickly coated with frosty pink lipstick, curved into a smile and she rested her tits on the table. \u201cI know my rodeo cowboys. Bull riders are my specialty. Even a hottie like you can\u2019t hide out in Pine Bluff, Wyoming without expecting fans to recognize you. You\u2019re Chase McKay.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. Chase took a drink to wet his suddenly dry mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, lover, your secret is safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat secret?\u201d Ava cooed, possessively sliding her hand across his shoulders. \u201cSorry I was gone so long, baby. What\u2019d I miss?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at hearing Ava\u2019s precisely mimicked honey-smooth Southern drawl. \u201cNothin\u2019. A case of mistaken identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not mistaken,\u201d the woman retorted. \u201cYou are Chase McKay, the PBR bull rider, right?\u201d</p><p>Ava tittered, \u201cOh, honey, I wish he was. This is just my boring old Bill. Who is such a Mr. Grumpy Pants tonight.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Grumpy Pants? What the fuck?</p><p>Tipping his hat back slightly, Ava kissed him four times, each kiss a little longer. \u201cWe\u2019ve only got the sitter for another hour, Billy boy. What do you say we head out to the truck? I know what\u2019ll put a smile on my baby daddy\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>The woman said, \u201cSorry, my mistake,\u201d and hustled away.</p><p>Ava\u2019s eyes lit with triumph. \u201cIf you want to pull this off, we\u2019d better go right now. And for Godsake, act like you can\u2019t wait to get me naked and fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Chastised and yet turned on, Chase stood, keeping Ava\u2019s arm draped over his shoulder. Gritting his teeth against the stares about their height differences, he curled his arm around her waist and directed her outside.</p><p>After he\u2019d climbed inside the truck cab, Ava said, \u201cAre you still a Mr. Grumpy Pants?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cChrist. Seriously? Did you have to call me Mr. Grumpy Pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to set the scene. Besides, it worked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, one good thing came from her flashing her tits at you and me running interference to protect your virtue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt kept me from asking you if the big chip on your shoulder about being a short man weighs you down when you\u2019re riding a bull as much as it does the rest of the time.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Direct hit.</p><p>\u201cThen again, I might\u2019ve just said \u2018thank you for a great dinner\u2019 and left you to brood while I trolled the excellent selection of Wrangler butts. Not that I got to do that either, since I was too busy saving you from yet another one of your adoring female fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it.\u201d Ava yawned and turned away, giving him the cold shoulder he deserved.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Ava had a great time with Chase last night at the supper club despite his refusal to dance with her. It hadn\u2019t occurred to her the outwardly confident bull rider would be self-conscious of his height, or lack thereof. She loomed over many of the men she worked with. And Chase was so damn good-looking, so muscular, so charming, he seemed larger than life.</p><p>Probably a smart call on his part, keeping them from being plastered body to body as they swayed on the dance floor. Ava had behaved herself, following his friendly lead, even playing along when he\u2019d started picking out potential conquests for her. But it quickly became apparent that no man in the joint held a candle to Chase McKay. It also became apparent that women who wanted the eye-catching cowboy were not cowed by the fact Chase was out with her. No wonder he could bed a different woman every night if the ladies constantly subjected him to come-ons. What red-blooded man wouldn\u2019t take every kinky thing that was freely offered?</p><p>Except he\u2019s not taking anything from you after you\u2019ve offered. Several times. In several ways.</p><p>Like she needed that reminder. She was no different from any other woman; she regularly suffered from self-confidence issues, body issues, dating issues. People assumed that since she had a high profile career and a supposedly glamorous life she\u2019d have hordes of men vying for her company. But the opposite held true; she rarely got asked out on a date. Maybe invites to dinner weren\u2019t issued because men were afraid she\u2019d turn them down flatly and cruelly. Maybe men assumed she\u2019d already have exciting plans with other celebrities. Maybe men were scared off by her bank account. Maybe men thought she was stupid because she hadn\u2019t finished college. Maybe men associated her with the man-eating character she played on TV. Maybe her real personality was too weird. Maybe her real personality was too abrasive. Or worse, maybe she didn\u2019t have a personality at all.</p><p>Wow. Insecure much?</p><p>Problem was... once those self-doubts surfaced, they multiplied. Maybe men were leery of becoming tabloid fodder if they publicly dated her. Maybe men were sick of big-boobed blondes. Maybe she should lose ten pounds, buy a whole new slutty wardrobe and then she\u2019d have men falling at her feet.</p><p>Maybe you can wave your magic wand from the prop department and generate world peace. This negativity and second-guessing is not helping. You\u2019ve never needed a man\u2019s approval to feel secure or to define you on any level\u2014personally or professionally.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t true. She\u2019d managed to fake that self-assured air so many of her peers owned\u2014at least when it came to her career. But she failed miserably when it came to presenting the I\u2019m-so-hot-don\u2019t-you-want-me-baby? attitude around men. Give her a script and she could act brash and sexy. Not so easy in the real world.</p><p>Sad thing was? Even the small scrap of relationship confidence she\u2019d gained after being Jake\u2019s girlfriend had vanished after the tabloid story broke. For those months she\u2019d been half a couple, she\u2019d felt good about herself, knowing a beautiful, desirable man like Jake was attracted to her. Didn\u2019t that make her beautiful and desirable too? Which afterward, sort of made her feel pathetic, that she\u2019d needed validation badly enough she overlooked the warning signs in their relationship. Before Jake had entered the picture, she\u2019d sworn to herself she\u2019d step out of Hollywood and find a man who wasn\u2019t in the entertainment industry. Like most single women she was mortified at the idea of asking her parents for a fix-up. So she\u2019d been this close to signing up for a private dating service. She\u2019d spent way too many weekend nights alone in her pajamas watching TV, eating ice cream straight out of the carton. Wouldn\u2019t that make a great tabloid headline? Actress Ava Cooper\u2014why are Ben &amp; Jerry the only men in her life?</p><p>Dammit. For the first time in years Ava felt totally comfortable being herself around a man she was wildly attracted to. Yes, she\u2019d been fun and flirty, sexy even, but it didn\u2019t feel like acting. She\u2019d taken a chance and shown Chase the real Ava. He hadn\u2019t run away calling her a freak, yet he\u2019d still relegated her to the \u201cfriend zone\u201d probably permanently. She could tell herself over and over that his refusal to become her lover was nothing personal, but that broken, feminine part inside of her took it very personally. Problem was, she didn\u2019t know what to do about it. Did she move on to another man in hopes he\u2019d burn up the sheets with her? That idea held little appeal for her now, even when many of the cowboys she\u2019d crossed paths with had made it very clear they\u2019d love to take her for a ride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wanting what you can\u2019t have will only make this trip miserable. And this trip isn\u2019t only about getting down and dirty with Chase McKay.</p><p>Also true. Disgusted with herself for wallowing, she focused on the task at hand for today\u2014finding a motel within their budget.</p><p>Chase wandered to check out the contractor\u2019s rough stock.</p><p>Ava wasn\u2019t content texting him; she called. \u201cHey, I found us a room. I actually comparison shopped. This place isn\u2019t as nice as the first one I checked out, but it does have free Wi-Fi.\u201d</p><p>It amused the hell out of him that she sounded so damn proud of herself. \u201cIt\u2019s less than a hundred bucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Be nice if you had a little faith in me, Sundance. Anyway. I\u2019m starved. I\u2019ll probably try to find something healthy before I head to the rodeo grounds. Did you want me to pick you something up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s healthy? Hell no. I noticed a couple of tempting treats as I wandered past the vendor stands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are talking about food treats, right?\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>\u201cBe nice if you had a little faith in me, Hollywood,\u201d he shot back.</p><p>\u201cTrusting lot, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoes with the territory for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis goes with the territory as well. Please, please be careful tonight, Chase. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>Touched by her genuine concern, he said gruffly, \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And I expect you to share your idea of a tempting treat with me after the rodeo ends.\u201d</p><p>No way could he confess she was the most tempting thing in his life right now. Imagining her beautiful form stretched out nekkid on his bed as he worshipped every millimeter of her body. With his hands. His mouth. His tongue. At least twice.</p><p>\u201cChase? You still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about the treat I\u2019m gonna offer you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give me a hint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s long and hard and filled with sweet white cream.\u201d</p><p>Ava sighed dreamily. \u201cAm I perverted for admitting I can\u2019t wait to wrap my lips around it and taste it?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, even as he inwardly groaned at the sexy mental image she provided. \u201cAre you in for a big surprise. See you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize you\u2019re supposed to stay on the bull a full eight seconds and not hop off at six point nine,\u201d Ava said after he\u2019d cleared the contestant\u2019s area.</p> <p>\u201cFunny.\u201d Chase tried not to limp, but he\u2019d taken a real ass buster.</p><p>\u201cIt sucks I can\u2019t go behind the chutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said. After every performance,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cYou\u2019re shit outta luck unless you can miraculously prove you\u2019re a stock contractor, a promoter or a member of the media.\u201d</p><p>Ava stopped and looked at him. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cHave you been snooping on my computer?\u201d</p><p>Why the hell would she ask that? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you even looked at any of the rides I emailed to you?\u201d</p><p>Probably not wise to admit he\u2019d fallen behind watching the rides she\u2019d so painstakingly taped. But he was riding a hundred times better than just two weeks ago. He carried enough rodeo superstition that he feared watching it might jinx his run of good luck. So he deflected. \u201cCome on, sweet thang. It\u2019s time for that treat I promised you.\u201d He towed her to a food booth by the carnival grounds. \u201cWe\u2019ll take two fried Twinkies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not what I was expecting from your description, Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered that, Hollywood.\u201d Chase paid and handed Ava the stick, warning, \u201cCareful. It\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just blow on it a little.\u201d She held the phallic-shaped object close to her pursed lips.</p><p>This was a bad idea.</p><p>\u201cOr, maybe it\u2019d be better if I sucked on just the very tip. That\u2019s always the best part.\u201d She opened her mouth and those lush pink lips enclosed the end. Her cheeks hollowed as she sucked and emitted throaty groans of satisfaction.</p><p>Then she licked all the way around the head. The tip. No, the top of the Twinkie.</p><p>Dammit. Chase could not tear his eyes away from her avid mouth, nipping teeth and flashing tongue.</p><p>\u201cOops. I\u2019d better be careful not to let that sweet, hot cream explode and coat my lips before I have a chance to swallow it all.\u201d</p><p>This was fucking torture and she knew it.</p><p>Keeping her eyes on his, Ava opened her mouth and the entire Twinkie disappeared inside.</p><p>Holy fuck. She was deep throating it.</p><p>Then she slowly, sensually, slid it back out, a little at a time. She licked her lips. \u201cMmm. You were right. This is delicious.\u201d</p><p>Chase had to turn away when she noisily started sucking again. He was hard as a fucking post just from watching her. He counted to one hundred before he chanced a look at her.</p><p>Mistake. She\u2019d eaten down to the middle of the Twinkie and she\u2019d dip her tongue inside before licking the outside rim. Her eyes danced with pure mischief. \u201cSomething wrong with your Twinkie, Chase?\u201d</p><p>Time for a little payback. \u201cNot at all. Just waiting for it to cool down. See, my favorite part is the warm, juicy center. I like to taste it slow, licking from bottom to top a few times before I bury my tongue deep.\u201d</p><p>She froze.</p><p>Chase held up his Twinkie and traced it from top to bottom with the tip of his index finger, creating a small crack in the batter. Then he spread the two sections apart, bent his head and licked straight up the slit and back down. Three times. Stopping at the center to suck with gusto. He lifted his mouth and growled, \u201cGod I love this. Love having my face covered with stickiness. Love to feel that sweetness sliding down my throat.\u201d</p><p>Ava drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cSo warm. So soft. So tasty.\u201d He locked his gaze to hers as he lapped up every bit of the filling.</p><p>Oh yeah. With the way her body shifted from side to side, look who was all hot and bothered now. \u201cYou all right? You stopped eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. I\u2019m full.\u201d She walked to the garbage and tossed away the last half of her Twinkie.</p><p>Chase ate the rest of his quickly because he really did love the damn things.</p><p>When Ava sauntered back to him, his eyes zeroed in on a white dot by her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me. Do I have something on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You missed a spot.\u201d</p><p>Ava rubbed her fingers across her lips.</p><p>\u201cCome here. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d Chase should\u2019ve used his thumb to wipe it clean. But some primal instinct urged him to use his mouth. He curled his hand around the side of her face, letting his tongue follow the bottom arc of her lip. He nibbled at the corner of her smile, tasting the sweet cream filling and the sweetness of her mouth.</p><p>This woman turned him inside out. Everything about her tempted him in ways he\u2019d never been tempted.</p><p>They stayed like that for several long moments, neither willing to break the tenuous connection.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Ava said softly. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been embarrassing to walk around with a white spot on my face.\u201d</p><p>He murmured, \u201cEspecially when we both know what it looked like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink people would\u2019ve checked to see if I had dirty knees too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably discreetly. Then they\u2019d be checking me out to see if I was wearing a big ol\u2019 grin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you probably wouldn\u2019t have been so eager to lick that spot away if it was...?\u201d</p><p>Seen-it-all, done-it-all, kinky California chick couldn\u2019t even say the words? Interesting. Chase whispered, \u201cWould I lick my come from your mouth after you finished blowing me? In a fuckin\u2019 heartbeat. I\u2019d love to taste myself on your tongue, Ava. It\u2019d be hot as hell.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me and tell me you didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d she sniped, \u201cwhen I know damn well you did.\u201d</p><p>Enough. This had gotten way out of hand. He stepped back. \u201cLook. We\u2019re both tired. A little punchy. Let\u2019s just forget it and head to the motel.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Ava parked in front of the orange door of room 116 at the Westward Ho Motor Inn. Schlepping her duffel bag, Chase\u2019s bag and her assorted electronic bags made her long for a bellhop.</p><p>Inside the clean, small room, she picked the bed by the wall just to be ornery, because she knew Chase didn\u2019t like sleeping by the window. Which served him right. He\u2019d been standoffish the last day, insisting she leave him at the Scottsbluff rodeo grounds, even when no official bull riding events were scheduled.</p><p>She flopped on the bed, turned on her computer and messed with the mockup websites for an hour before she called Hannah.</p><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t Wyoming\u2019s newest cowgirl,\u201d Hannah said drolly.</p><p>\u201cHah! The joke is on you. I\u2019m not in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNebraska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually worse because I\u2019m from Nebraska. Anyway, you calling to rub it in you\u2019ve gotten laid by a smokin\u2019-hot cowboy or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish. The sex part of my summer vacation hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d Yet. \u201cI\u2019m calling because I need you to do something for me. Something that might be...well, not illegal per se, but a little on the shady side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to make me a couple of press passes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll bite. What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can get access to the rodeo contestant area to videotape bull rides. It\u2019s manned by security, but media is allowed. So I thought, Hannah deals with media passes all the time, she\u2019d know exactly how to fake a couple of good ones.\u201d</p><p>Hannah sighed. \u201cAva. I love you, but I\u2019m not going to jail for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJail schmail. Seriously, this will be a piece of cake. Alls I need is the name of the magazine, my picture and my name laminated on an official badge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one will check to make sure you\u2019re legit?\u201d she asked skeptically. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course they will.

What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new magazine I created,\u201d she said with pride.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Ava, this is your brainchild?\u201d Computer keys clicked in the background. \u201cThe Check back for more details on the main page is vague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is perfect for my purposes. Anyone who checks it\u2014and me\u2014will believe this is a brand-spanking-new magazine, still working on a web presence.

Now that is a great magazine tagline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Filled with nervous energy, Ava hopped off the bed. \u201cSo what do you say? Can you get these made up this afternoon and Fed Ex them to me by tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should say no, but I haven\u2019t heard you this excited about anything in a long time. What name are you using for these? Ava Dumond?\u201d</p><p>Ava paced to the window and peeked out the curtain. \u201cNo. How about just initials? A.R. Dumond. I\u2019ll take a picture and email it to you. You can use it for both IDs.\u201d She picked up the guest services guide and rattled off the address. \u201cI know this is last minute, but I really need to have these in hand by tomorrow, because we won\u2019t be staying anyplace this long for at least another week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018we\u2019?\u201d</p><p>As much as Ava trusted Hannah, she hedged on divulging Chase\u2019s identity. \u201cA bull rider. He\u2019s showing me the sights in exchange for me taping his rides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva.\u201d Hannah heaved an exasperated sigh. \u201cDid you hit your head or something? You\u2019re never this trusting. How can you be sure this dude isn\u2019t taking you for a ride as a smooth-talking con artist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s related to Ginger\u2019s husband. I\u2019m being careful. And I\u2019m having fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but I\u2019d appreciate you keeping in contact with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Oh, and one other thing? Can you grab three pairs of jeans out of my closet and send those too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just buy new ones?\u201d When Ava didn\u2019t answer right away, Hannah demanded, \u201cWhat the hell is going on, Ava?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe put me on a budget, okay? I only brought two pairs of jeans and I\u2019m conserving cash because I have to kick in for food and gas and other traveling expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. This...bull rider put you, the heiress who lives the high life, the shopaholic who doesn\u2019t bother checking price tags...on a strict budget?\u201d</p> <p>Damn embarrassing to admit. She bit off, \u201cYes.\u201d Hannah laughed so hard that Ava was tempted to hang up on her.</p><p>Hannah regained control, managing to only let a few giggles escape. \u201cOh man, Ava, I like this guy already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because he won\u2019t let me spend any money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because it sounds like he\u2019s a taskmaster, and God knows, you need someone to teach you restraint.\u201d</p><p>Ava would like it entirely too much if Chase would restrain her. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d keep this to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m insulted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I know I can trust you. You\u2019re about the only one I do trust. And not just because you work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d stay on the line just to hear you groveling, but I have press credentials to fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll owe you one.\u201d</p><p>The following morning Ava decided the next time she saw Chase she\u2019d cluck at him, because he was being a chickenshit. He\u2019d gotten up early again because he was obviously avoiding her.</p><p>She took advantage of the time alone and rolled out her yoga mat, sliding into her morning workout routine\u2014a mix of yoga, Pilates and kickboxing. Maintaining a daily workout was the one thing she did for herself no matter what.</p><p>Ava showered and dressed. She scrutinized her face in the mirror, cursing the fluorescent lights. Bridget, her facial consultant would throw a hissy fit when Ava returned to LA, because she hadn\u2019t followed through with her normal skincare routine. But there was something freeing in applying the minimum amount of makeup and being oblivious to the size of her pores.</p><p>She sat cross-legged on the bed and checked her personal email. Not much. Ava waited for a feeling of homesickness to wash over her, but it never came.</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>Two knocks sounded on the door.</p><p>She peered out the peephole. A FedEx guy. She opened the door and signed off on the packages. She ripped into the box first, unrolling three pairs of jeans and shoving them in her duffel. Two laminated press passes, complete with different colored lanyards, tumbled out from the cardboard envelope. Ava grinned. \u201cHannah. You\u2019re a genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cID,\u201d the man blocking access to the contestant entrance demanded.</p><p>Ava gave the beefy cowboy a once-over after handing him the Faces of Rodeo media badge.</p><p>The guy squinted at her. \u201cNever heard of this magazine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s new. First issue won\u2019t hit the stands until November,\u201d she lied cheerfully. \u201cWe\u2019re still working on the website. Check us out if you have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d He jerked his chin toward the gate in a \u201cgo on\u201d motion.</p><p>Ava kept her cool rather than doing a fist pump. Once she was among the mix of contestants, she wished she\u2019d asked Chase specifics about where to go. She noticed an older gent with a steno pad jotting notes as his interview subject yammered. A cameraman from a TV news crew had set up in the closest corner, taking the best spot. She marched over anyway. There was room for two.</p><p>\u201cHey. Great night for a rodeo, huh?\u201d</p><p>The guy rolled his eyes and returned to fiddling with his camera.</p><p>So much for Midwestern friendliness.</p><p>Ava draped the strap of her video camera over a fence rail and held the Nikon. She\u2019d intended to only snap a few pictures to keep up her cover, but her lens kept coming across fascinating subjects on the periphery and in the arena.</p><p>Time sped by so quickly she was surprised to hear the announcement for bull riding. She switched out cameras and zoomed to the action in the chutes. Chase and a young kid were helping an older guy get set to ride. She hadn\u2019t thought of Chase as a team player, so seeing him in that role was a little shocking.</p><p>Rather than focusing on the bull and rider when the chute opened, she kept her lens on Chase and his young buddy. Both guys were rapt, hands circled around the top metal bar, lips moving with silent encouragement. They whooped when the ride ended successfully and high-fived each other.</p><p>Ava grinned right along with them.</p><p>The kid was up. Chase and the older guy helped situate him, holding the bull rope, dropping a booted foot into the pen, forcing the bull to stand up. For the hundredth time Ava was grateful for the days she spent at the Bar 9 with Gemma sharing her knowledge of the sport.</p><p>And once again she left the camera on Chase. He seemed tenser watching his young friend ride. More relieved than happy when the kid reached the eight-second buzzer and scored eighty-three points.</p><p>Then Chase was all business. With the zoom function when she zeroed in on his face. His fierceness, concentration and ruggedness were absolutely mesmerizing.</p><p>She shifted her position after Chase slipped on his helmet. Her heart raced when he climbed into the chute. Would she ever lose her fear for him in those seconds he tried to master a fifteen-hundred-pound beast?</p><p>Her lens panned the surrounding cowboys as Chase readied his bull rope. Few paid attention. How different would their attitudes be if they realized Chase McKay was set to ride?</p><p>The gate banged open. She literally held her breath as Chase and the bull exited the chute in an explosion of dirt. Chase countered the animal\u2019s every twisting maneuver. Staying strong. Keeping his seat. Maintaining his fluidity. His control. His mastery. He made it look so effortless. He was sheer physical perfection. Grace and flow.</p><p>No wonder Chase had buckle bunnies dogging him after a performance. Seeing him move like that on a bull, they imagined how he moved while riding them.</p><p>Don\u2019t pretend you haven\u2019t imagined it.</p><p>Ava watched him tug off his helmet and squint at the scoreboard. The announcer drawled, \u201cYou just watched the ride to beat, folks. Let\u2019s give Bill Chase a hand for his ninety point ride!\u201d</p><p>That was his best ride and score yet.</p><p>That caused contestants to look at him differently. Her lens tracked his progress as he accepted handshakes and pats on the back. But his young buddy showed his excitement by picking Chase up and spinning him around. For being self-conscious about his height, Chase took it with humor. Then he knocked the kid\u2019s cowboy hat off his head and strode away.</p><p>You could be in big trouble, falling for this man, Ava.</p><p>No. She was in lust with him. His \u201cjust friends\u201d edict made him more appealing because she hadn\u2019t been just friends with a guy since high school.</p><p>Something caused Chase to look her direction. He aimed a smoldering stare at her. A stare that seared her body right through the lens. A stare packed with so much raw sexual power Ava bobbled the camera. Her pulse pounded as Chase took his own sweet time sauntering toward her, but his posture wasn\u2019t the least bit casual. \u201cThat was some ride, Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Felt good.\u201d Those stunning blue eyes searched hers carefully from beneath the brim of his ratty-ass ball cap. He blurted, \u201cWill you leave the contestant area with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed me to bat away all those bunnies for you?\u201d she teased.</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cYeah. Seems to be a lot of them at this event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re done avoiding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you haven\u2019t been around since we arrived in Scottsbluff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten up early to work out. I met this rookie kid last week. After I rode, he cornered me, calling me out as Chase McKay.\u201d He smiled sheepishly. \u201cThe little shit promised to keep my secret if I gave him bull ridin\u2019 pointers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that he listened to me. Kid is such a greenhorn. And stubborn? He won\u2019t turn his foot out, refuses to wear a helmet, won\u2019t consider a trying a different wrap. So I gave up talking to him about bull ridin\u2019 and we watched the slack competition. What did you do\u2014\u201d his knuckles grazed her breasts as he reached for the lanyard around her neck \u201c\u2014besides craft fake press passes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had my assistant whip them up. Realistic, don\u2019t you think? I needed access behind the chutes so I can video you from a closer angle. It\u2019s made a huge difference. You won\u2019t believe the footage I got today.\u201d</p><p>His rough-skinned hand enclosed hers. \u201cAva. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>The lanky, shaggy-haired young rider inserted himself between Chase and Ava. \u201cMan, that ride was epic. Textbook. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan Ackerman, I\u2019d like you to meet Ava,\u201d Chase inserted.</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry. I didn\u2019t realize...\u201d Ryan wiped his hand on his leg before he offered it to Ava. \u201cGood to meet you.\u201d His gaze dropped to the press credentials. \u201cWow. You\u2019re a reporter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf sorts. Were you happy with your ride tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...I...ah...I...\u201d</p><p>Ava touched his arm. \u201cThis isn\u2019t an interview, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Ryan blew out a breath. \u201cI pretty much suck at that kinda stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe longer you do it, the easier it gets,\u201d Chase said. \u201cYou goin\u2019 to get your bag? \u2019Cause I was headed that way myself.\u201d</p><p>Chase and Ryan returned as she finished stowing her video camera. Chase placed his hand in the small of her back, guiding her around groups of people. He paused before they exited the gate. \u201cSo, Ryan. Got a girlfriend at home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust making sure you\u2019re free and clear since we\u2019re about to stroll through the buckle bunny beltway. Got a preference? Blonde or brunette?\u201d</p><p>Ryan blushed to the roots of his sandy-brown hair. \u201cDon\u2019t matter. Them kinda girls never look twice at me anyway.\u201d</p><p>Chase flashed a devious smile. \u201cThat, my friend, is about to change.\u201d He let his gaze fall to Ryan\u2019s duffel bag. \u201cYou carrying condoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the...? Why would you...?\u201d Ryan glanced nervously over his shoulder to see who was within earshot.</p><p>\u201cSimple question. Yes. Or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he hissed. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as happy as you\u2019re gonna be.\u201d Chase put his lips on Ava\u2019s ear. \u201cFeel like snapping a few pictures of the PRCA\u2019s newest up-and-coming bull rider?\u201d</p> <p>The warm rasp of his deep voice in her ear sent an electric tingle down the right side of her body. She automatically leaned into him. God he smelled good. Like leather and man.</p><p>\u201cAva?\u201d he murmured. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d</p><p>No. Whisper it again. At least ten more times. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they cleared the gate, a half-dozen women descended on them\u2014mostly on Chase. Although Ryan topped Chase by six inches, Chase clapped the kid on the shoulder, pushing him front and center. \u201cDamn good ridin\u2019. You keep that up and I\u2019ll be watching my back the rest of the season.\u201d Chase discreetly nodded to Ava.</p><p>\u201cRyan, could I get a couple of pictures of you? Maybe leaning against the railing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Ryan dropped his duffel bag and struck a pose. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTilt your chin up, sugar,\u201d Ava drawled. \u201cWe want a clear shot of that handsome face of yours, not your ratty old hat.\u201d</p><p>Ryan grinned goofily and Ava was completely charmed by this sweet man-boy.</p><p>She tested the flash twice after Chase moved to stand next to her.</p><p>A bold buckle bunny inserted herself between them\u2014breasts first. \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan Ackerman. A bull rider.\u201d Chase confided, \u201cWasn\u2019t that eighty-three point ride tonight something? Now he\u2019s sittin\u2019 in second place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The busty brunette offered Ryan a jaunty little finger wave and a come-hither smile.</p><p>The poor kid didn\u2019t know what to do besides blush.</p><p>Ava cajoled, \u201cCome on, Ryan. A couple more shots. Then you can charm all these lovely ladies who are waiting on you.\u201d</p><p>Ryan swallowed hard as his eyes darted to the women who\u2019d formed a semi-circle behind her and Chase.</p><p>Click, click. \u201cSee? All finished. I\u2019ll be in touch about release forms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Good. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Chase crowded her, setting his hand on her lower back, above her ass, showing everyone she was with him. \u201cGreat ride. See you on dirt tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>None of the bunnies bothered him\u2014just as Chase predicted.</p><p>And that bothered Ava. Big time. She felt used.</p><p>Frankly she was tired of Chase running hot and cold, gazing at her with lust and then acting like an offended monk when she responded to his blatant sexuality. What happened to her intent to reclaim her own sexuality?</p><p>You set it aside because that\u2019s what Chase wants.</p><p>But what about what I want?</p><p>What about it? You want a change, you\u2019ll have to make it or take it, not wait for it.</p><p>Ava huffed out a frustrated breath. It was annoying to realize that once again she\u2019d shelved her intimate needs and followed a man\u2019s lead.</p><p>Enough. It was past time she took control.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful quiet,\u201d Chase said when they reached his truck.</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about how thoughtful it was of you to look out for Ryan. Especially helping him get laid.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s hand froze on the door handle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta admit jealousy, though. We\u2019ve been friends longer and you haven\u2019t gone out of your way to help me get laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ava.\u201d</p><p>She hip-checked him\u2014not playfully\u2014and opened her own door, then slammed it in his stunned face.</p><p>Music filled the truck cab as they exited the fairgrounds. They didn\u2019t speak. Ava rolled down her window, breathing in the humid night air. It smelled different here. Warm. Earthy.</p><p>Once they were inside the room, Chase stripped off his chaps. \u201cI\u2019m hitting the shower.\u201d</p><p>Ava waited until she heard the water turn on before she poked her head into the bathroom. \u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist Almighty. What do I hafta do to get some damn privacy around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLearn to lock the door?\u201d she intoned with fake cheer.</p><p>A growling noise bounced off the tile walls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out. Don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back, so don\u2019t wait up.\u201d</p><p>The shower curtain snapped open and he blinked the water from his eyes. \u201cWhere you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t know until I get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust lemme finish my shower and I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m flying solo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I really need to spell it out for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Hollywood, and use small words so the dumb cowboy don\u2019t get confused,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a diva,\u201d he shot back.</p><p>Ava stomped closer to the shower and purposely didn\u2019t allow her gaze to drop below his eyes. \u201cWhile I appreciate your friendship, you can\u2019t fault me for looking for something more, even for one night. Especially since I\u2019ve told you I won\u2019t live like a nun just because you\u2019ve decided to act like a monk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo because I won\u2019t nail you right goddamn now, you\u2019re goin\u2019 out to find some random dude to fuck just to prove you\u2019re as hot as sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that any different than you using me as a shield to prove you can abstain?\u201d</p><p>That shocked him.</p><p>Good. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva. Wait.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t.</p><p>After grabbing her purse, she sailed out of the room and made tracks to the pub she\u2019d passed earlier in the day. Although the place seemed crowded, Ava found a seat at the bar and ordered a draft beer.</p><p>The jukebox spewed country tunes. A few couples were dancing. Maybe she\u2019d find a smooth-moving country guy to teach her to two-step, since Chase had refused.</p><p>Fucking Chase McKay. Damn man was intruding on all her thoughts.</p><p>An older guy took the barstool next to hers. She recognized him\u2014he\u2019d helped Ryan and Chase behind the chutes tonight. She smiled. \u201cGreat ride tonight.\u201d</p><p>He smiled back. \u201cThanks.\u201d He offered his hand. \u201cTaz Lashlee. I saw you with Bill Chase and Ryan earlier. Ryan tells me you\u2019re a reporter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Ava Dumond.\u201d</p><p>Taz looked around. \u201cAm I in Bill\u2019s chair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Taz ordered a beer.</p><p>\u201cSo can I ask you a few questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou planning to put me in the hot seat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want a chance to shitcan PC chit-chat and blow me away with your nitty-gritty, down-and-dirty stories about life on the road as a rodeo cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful what you wish for.\u201d Taz held nothing back.</p><p>Ava wished she\u2019d brought her video camera\u2014Taz\u2019s life was the stuff of legends. She made a mental note to get footage of him riding. The variances between a grizzled old veteran, a competitor at the top of his career and a rookie in the beginning stage of learning the ropes made a fascinating dichotomy. After an hour passed, she felt as if she\u2019d known him for years.</p><p>Taz said, \u201cYou expecting Bill to show up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. He was tired. He\u2019s probably crashed in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re traveling together?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ava nodded. \u201cI\u2019m new to the world of rodeo. He agreed to show me the inside scoop. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDollface, that surely ain\u2019t all. Not even close. The man has it bad for you.\u201d</p><p>Not bad enough to act on it.</p> <p>\u201cI seen how he\u2019s been lookin\u2019 at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re a hot, sweet fried Twinkie and he\u2019d like to lick you up one side and down the other before devouring you completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept the man seems to be on a sugar-free diet,\u201d she said wryly.</p><p>Taz chuckled. \u201cMaybe. But I reckon he\u2019s just trying to keep from gorging himself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuch an overactive imagination, Taz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try. Better to be one of them colorful characters folks talk about than an average Joe.\u201d</p><p>The conversation drifted to Ryan. Upcoming rodeos they\u2019d all be attending. Other events. Then Taz took off, leaving Ava alone. It was enough to give a girl a complex about men.</p><p>Right. She already had enough complexes, although she doubted anyone would look at her and believe that.</p><p>A guy paused behind the barstool on Ava\u2019s right side. He smiled. \u201cIs this seat taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was just\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m Brad.\u201d</p><p>Brad was decent-looking. Tall. Mid-forties, with brownish-red hair, his smile nearly hidden by a mustache. \u201cNice to meet you, Brad. I\u2019m Ava.\u201d</p><p>When she offered Brad her hand, he lifted it to his lips. \u201cEnchanted, Ava.\u201d</p><p>His calculated charm set off her warning sensors.</p><p>He ordered a slow screw up against the wall, Mexican style. Another warning bell pealed. Ava decided to skip politeness and bail on this low-rent lothario.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me the \u2018I need to get the hell outta here\u2019 vibe, Ava. What is it about me that\u2019s sending you running? The polyester shirt? The porn star \u2019stache?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cBusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFYI: I\u2019m not trolling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I am.\u201d</p><p>His thick eyebrows lifted. \u201cThat old dude your type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was offering me advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my career,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cHuh. That\u2019s interesting. You compete as a barrel racer or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a circuit cowboy. I\u2019ve known guys like him my entire life. Salt of the earth type. But his career is rodeo. He lets his life be measured eight seconds at a time.\u201d</p><p>Ava chewed that over, wondering if Chase would end up the same way. Living event to event, trying to recapture former glory. Chasing the buzz and the buzzer.</p><p>\u201cSo, he wasn\u2019t really giving you career advice, was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I was going with the old adage about divulging things to a stranger that you wouldn\u2019t discuss with your closest friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a stranger. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>She scrutinized him. \u201cAll joking aside, why should I trust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gamble. But life is a gamble, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He sighed. \u201cConfession time. The instant I saw you tonight? Even with the darker hair? I knew exactly who you are, Ava Cooper. I\u2019m a huge fan.\u201d</p><p>She froze.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not a stalker.\u201d Brad sipped his drink. \u201cIn fact, a mutual friend sent me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Brad frowned. \u201cNo, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell do you know Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my niece.\u201d</p><p>Ava gave him a cool once-over. \u201cAnd you just happened to conveniently be in Scottsbluff, Nebraska? Tonight? Bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing convenient about it since I live over three hours from here,\u201d he muttered. \u201cLook. Hannah was more than a little worried about you and this bull rider you\u2019ve hooked up with. She knows I still enjoy a good rodeo, and I\u2019m a lot closer than she is in California. So she called me after you had her make those press passes and asked me to double-check that this cowboy didn\u2019t have you shackled to his pickup or something.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes welled up. Damn Hannah. The woman was such a good friend.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to contact you, but after that last text you sent her? She feared you might do something rash, so here I am.\u201d Brad leaned closer. \u201cI\u2019m trustworthy, Ava, I promise. Talk to me. Imagine I\u2019m Hannah, if that helps.\u201d</p><p>She considered it and threw caution to the wind for a change. \u201cAll right, Uncle Brad. You\u2019ve convinced me to give it a whirl.\u201d She swigged her beer and shared the basic run down of the situation with Chase. His \u201cjust friends\u201d spiel. His mixed physical signals.</p><p>After she finished, Brad said, \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re confused. But I believe there\u2019s an easy solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring another guy to your hotel room. Or better yet, be half-naked with another guy when Chase walks in. He\u2019ll either rip the guy limb from limb or he\u2019ll leave until you\u2019ve had your fun. Either way, you\u2019ll know how he feels.\u201d</p><p>Simple. Effective. But for all her bold talk...could she really do it? Push Chase to take action with her by making him jealous? Her every insecurity hit her full force. What if Chase was playing the friendship card because he really wasn\u2019t interested in anything more? What if he didn\u2019t like fake breasts? What if he\u2019d never want her because she was taller? What if her less-than-glamorous appearance turned him off?</p><p>But what if he just needs a nudge? What are you out?</p><p>Not a damn thing. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. No more waiting in the wings. Time to let her sexual needs take center stage for a change.</p><p>\u201cIs this idea gaining ground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. The problem is\u2014\u201d I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s attracted to me, \u201c\u2014I haven\u2019t found a guy I could even pretend I\u2019d want to bang, let alone finding the real deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Chase know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She huffed out a frustrated breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know. See why this is driving me crazy?\u201d</p><p>He spun toward her on the barstool. \u201cHow far you willing to take this?\u201d</p><p>All the way. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me be the guy you drag back to the room.\u201d When she frowned, he leaned closer. \u201cThen it\u2019s a controlled situation. You don\u2019t have to worry about some strange guy taking things too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do this, Brad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sucker for this type of romance stuff. And I get to help out my favorite niece\u2019s friend. Plus, it\u2019ll be a hoot, acting with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow well can you act?\u201d</p><p>Brad bestowed a smoldering look of pure hot need. Invading her space, he stared directly at her lips. \u201cYou have a mouth made for sex. As much as I\u2019d like to kiss those pretty pink lips for hours, and watch them wrapped around my cock, I\u2019d really like to see them soft and open as I\u2019m making you come for the fourth time.\u201d</p><p>Holy. Shit. Then Brad\u2019s eyes met hers and there was no sexual heat whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Wow. Damn. That was a really great way to set the scene.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cGood to know I can still pass for straight.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou\u2019re gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the day I was born,\u201d he said breezily.</p><p>Her gaydar wasn\u2019t just rusty; it was completely fucking broken.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d</p><p>Brad didn\u2019t cajole her as she weighed the pros and cons. But the bottom line? She was desperate to do this. \u201cDeal. But part of the deal is you can\u2019t tell anyone. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word.\u201d He rested his forearms on the bar. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>Ava smiled. \u201cWhy wait for tomorrow? Let\u2019s get started tonight.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Maybe faking sleep when Ava returned to the room last night at 1:04 a.m. made Chase a total pussy. He\u2019d decided pretend slumber was preferable to beating the tar out of whoever Ava flirted and giggled with outside the motel room door.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t attempted to be quiet when she finally deigned to enter the room. That chapped his ass. It was almost as if she\u2019d been...taunting him.</p><p>Sending the still-sleeping Ava a cursory glance, Chase slipped out. Three hours later, after running five miles and completing a full weight training session at the gym, Chase opened the door only to be greeted by Ava\u2019s crotch.</p><p>Her feet were spread wide and her legs were splayed open. The remainder of her body was bent back over the big blue ball. Ava\u2019s body was twisted so he couldn\u2019t even see her face\u2014only the area between her thighs and the flat arc of her belly.</p><p>Goddamn if his mouth didn\u2019t water when he fantasized about dropping to his knees and burying his face against her tempting mound. Or testing the bounce factor of that exercise ball as he slammed his cock into her.</p><p>Ava sat up and rested her hands on her knees. She smirked as if she knew every lewd thought that\u2019d crossed his mind. Her eyes flicked over him, head to toe. \u201cMorning, roomie. Seems we\u2019re on the same wave length.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I highly doubt our thoughts are even close to parallel, Hollywood.\u201d Chase drained his water bottle. Then he yanked his tank top over his head, mopped the sweat from his face with it and tossed it on his bed. His gaze returned to Ava. He wasn\u2019t imagining things this time; Ava actually licked her lips as she eyeballed his chest. He didn\u2019t hide his smirk as he gestured to her. \u201cYou about done doin\u2019...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy yoga practice? Yes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wondering who gets the shower first?\u201d</p><p>Ava hopped off the ball. \u201cGo ahead. I planned on staying around the room the rest of the day, trying to get some...ah...work done. I figured you\u2019d be going to the fairgrounds with Ryan and hanging out until the rodeo started.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That vague comment got his back up. Was she trying to get rid of him? Just to be ornery, he said, \u201cI hadn\u2019t planned on goin\u2019 anywhere today. Thought I\u2019d stick around the room and rest up. Hang out with you, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Panic darted through her eyes. \u201cOh. Obviously since you\u2019re paying for half the room that\u2019s your prerogative. But I was hoping...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoping for what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo have a few hours of quiet time so I can get your rides separated from the other footage.\u201d</p><p>Quiet time his ass. She wanted nookie time. And he\u2019d be goddamned if he\u2019d just fucking walk away and make it easy on her to bang a total stranger in his hotel room. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly loud, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Chase, but I need quiet. Complete silence. No TV. No talking. No cell phone conversations. No fighting.\u201d</p><p>The sneaky-ass woman knew that lying on his bed, counting the flaws in the ceiling tile for hours would drive him bonkers. But the idea of any man, in here\u2014the private space Chase shared with Ava\u2014touching her, kissing her, fucking her on that lumpy damn mattress\u2014made Chase crazier yet. So he offered Little Miss Liar-Liar-Yoga-Pants-On-Fire a somber nod. \u201cUnderstood. There\u2019s online work I\u2019ve been putting off. I promise to be as quiet as a church mouse.\u201d By Ava\u2019s expression, she expected him to tuck his tail between his legs, exit the room and leave her alone.</p><p>Like hell.</p> <p>Chase smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m glad we can sort this stuff out so quickly.\u201d</p><p>After he was scrubbed and freshly shaven he wandered out of the bathroom with a towel loosely secured low around his hips. As he dug in his duffel bag for clean clothes, he felt her checking out his package, and then his butt, although she didn\u2019t utter a peep.</p><p>It was a long, quiet afternoon.</p><p>An hour before the finals performance at the fairgrounds, Chase checked out his bull, stretched his quads and hamstrings and tried to mentally prep himself. He was leaning against the corral, watching the last rays of sunshine through the clouds of humidity, when he heard, \u201cBill Chase. You\u2019re lookin\u2019 good to win this tonight.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward Taz. \u201cI hope so. Be nice if we all came in the money, huh?\u201d</p><p>Taz spit a stream of tobacco juice through the fence rails. \u201cYep. Be a boost to the boy if he could place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s doin\u2019 better than I did. Took three events before I even rode one for eight seconds. I damn near gave up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen there myself more times than I care to admit. Started the junior events at fifteen. Got my pro card at eighteen. I\u2019ll be fifty-one next month. So a long damn time.\u201d Another brown stream landed in the dirt.</p><p>\u201cYou get tired of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are days. But it ain\u2019t like I got other skills. Ridin\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>Sobering for Chase to admit that he might be Taz in a few years.</p><p>That\u2019s when Ava sauntered into view. Smiling at assorted cowboys as she shooed them aside and set up her video camera. Fuckin\u2019 hell, the woman was something else.</p><p>\u201cShe sure is,\u201d Taz said.</p><p>Shit. He hadn\u2019t meant to say that out loud.</p> <p>\u201cI saw her last night at the bar on Main Street.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been too pissed off and filled with pride to track her down after she\u2019d left. \u201cAny guy in particular catch her notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I believe one did.\u201d Taz snorted. \u201cIf I were twenty years younger, I\u2019da given that guy a run for his money. Man. He was all over her.\u201d</p><p>Chase wanted to demand what the guy looked like. If he was tall. If Ava and the putz had danced together. Or whether they\u2019d snuck off early. They could\u2019ve gone back to his place right after they\u2019d met. She could\u2019ve ended her sexual drought and he wouldn\u2019t know it. That thought turned his vision a dangerous red and he wanted to rip something to pieces with his bare hands.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t see Ryan last night until late neither. Kid still had a grin on his face this mornin\u2019. You got time to have a beer at the campsite tonight after the event?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll swing by. It\u2019ll be an early night since I\u2019m hitting the road tomorrow mornin\u2019.\u201d He clapped Taz on the shoulder. \u201cGotta get my head on straight about this ride. See you in the chutes.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gone about fifty feet when Ryan tracked him down and blurted, \u201cI need your help, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe. I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019re in the home stretch. Just treat it like any other ride. Concentrate on staying on, ridin\u2019 hard, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shot him a baffled look. \u201cHuh-uh. I\u2019ve heard guys talking and I know there\u2019s more to it than that. I\u2019ve got the basics down, but I need...ummm...advice with the fancier stuff I ain\u2019t tried before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFancier stuff?\u201d Chase frowned. \u201cExplain that.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks turned cherry red. \u201cYou know. Like usin\u2019 my mouth on her and different positions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Chase stepped back. \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa. You ain\u2019t talking about ridin\u2019 in the final go-round, are you? You\u2019re talking about ridin\u2019...a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh.\u201d Ryan glanced around, owl-eyed. \u201cSheesh. Of course I\u2019m talking about a girl. I know how to ride a bull. I need to up my game with Allison tonight. You know, do some different sex stuff to impress her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of Christ, Ryan. Seriously? You want my advice on sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, everyone knows your reputation with the ladies. It\u2019s been all over the rodeo magazines and the fan sites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see you denying it. Chicks still line up to get with you, even after that video, maybe especially after that video, so it\u2019s gotta be true.\u201d Ryan crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cBesides. You owe me.\u201d</p><p>Of all the... Chase counted to ten. \u201cHow do you figure I owe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou threw me to Allison last night. And she... Well, she was all over me. Tonight I wanna show her that I can do more than just lie there with a stupid grin on my face wondering how I got so lucky to get naked with her.\u201d</p><p>That comment hit home on many levels. Chase sighed. \u201cYou ever gone down on a girl before?\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head.</p><p>Fucking awesome. \u201cOkay. Take your time getting down there. Don\u2019t just dive in. Especially not the first time. Use your mouth and your hands.\u201d His eyes searched Ryan\u2019s. \u201cYou do know where a woman\u2019s clit is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d he said sullenly.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019d be surprised how many men are. Take your cues from her. If she\u2019s moving and getting wetter, then you\u2019re doin\u2019 it right. If she acts bored, she probably is bored, and you need to try something different. When she says \u2018Don\u2019t stop\u2019, for Godsake, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I know when she\u2019s about to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome? You\u2019ll be able to feel it. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome guys say they don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019re fuckin\u2019 idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut women like it, right?\u201d</p><p>Chase grinned. \u201cWomen love it.\u201d</p><p>Again, Ryan briefly looked over his shoulder. \u201cWhat about different positions? We did it the regular way once, and then she blew me, and then she rode me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more important she\u2019s hot to be nekkid with you than it is to try every position you see in porn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. That makes sense.\u201d Ryan grinned and punched Chase in the shoulder. \u201cThanks, man. I wish I could tell my buddies I got sex advice from Chase McKay.\u201d He bounded off.</p><p>Yeah. Sex advice from the guy who currently wasn\u2019t getting any. That was something to brag about.</p><p>Somehow, Chase put sex out of his mind. At some events, the leader rode last, but this one he was scheduled to ride fourth. Helmet on, mouth guard in, a good wrap, a good seat and he was ready to hit it.</p><p>The bull went crazy, three jumps and then into the wildest spin Chase had ever experienced. Gritting his teeth, he held on by sheer strength. Soon as he heard that buzzer, he released his hand and hit the ground flat on his back. Luckily the bad dismount didn\u2019t knock the wind out of him, but he was so damn dizzy he could barely stand. The bullfighters helped him stagger to the fence as he awaited his score.</p><p>Eighty-eight. He\u2019d won. No other rider could catch him. Chase allowed a smile as he waved to the crowd.</p><p>Ryan finished third, Taz not in the money. Ava taped the prize handout, but then she disappeared.</p><p>He had a single beer with Taz and lumbered across the grounds and highway to his motel room. He hadn\u2019t taken off his chaps, vest or even his spurs. Pausing in front of the room, he dug his keycard from his duffel bag and opened the door. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him that Ava might have made plans\u2014nekkid plans\u2014until he saw her stretched out on the bed in her birthday suit.</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d Her feet kept slipping on the cheap nylon comforter as she scrambled up the bed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He dropped his bag to the carpet absentmindedly. Holy hell, did she have a rockin\u2019 body. Golden skin that boasted curves, curves and more curves. As he took a step toward her, he noticed panic in her eyes\u2014not heat or even that tempting sexual challenge he\u2019d never be immune to. His gaze tracked her mesmerizing body, from the flare of her hip, to the contour of her belly, across those glorious tits and the graceful line of her neck.</p><p>Seconds after Chase noticed a full box of condoms, bottle of lube and two bandanas on the nightstand, a dude wearing chaps and a cowboy hat sauntered out of the bathroom with a hearty, \u201cYou ready for the ride of your life, toots?\u201d</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>After his shock wore off, Chase snarled, \u201cJesus, Ava, this is the type of douchebag you came up with? A wannabe cowboy with a fake drawl who calls you toots?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Douchebag demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe guy tellin\u2019 you to get the hell outta my room.\u201d</p><p>The douchebag looked at Ava. \u201cI thought you said this was your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, fuckface, eyes on me, not her.\u201d When douchebag turned, Chase stabbed his finger at the clothes by the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re done. Grab your shit and get gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh.\u201d Douchebag gestured to Ava. \u201cI get gone when she tells me to, not you, little man.\u201d</p><p>Ava said not one word.</p><p>Chase\u2019s anger hit the boiling point. Instead of yelling, his voice dropped lethally low. \u201cGet. The. Fuck. Out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what? You gonna throw me out?\u201d Douchebag sneered. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to eat your spinach and grow some first.\u201d</p><p>Faking calmness he didn\u2019t feel, Chase scooped up the man\u2019s belongings, opened the door and dumped the pile onto the walkway.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d Douchebag loomed over Chase.</p><p>\u201cYou have fifteen seconds to get out of my room and out of my face or I will beat you bloody. You\u2019re not the first asshole who\u2019s tried to take me on, believing a short man is a weak man. But by all means, I\u2019m more than willing to offer you proof that\u2019s a mistake.\u201d Chase locked his cold gaze to the man who had six inches and a good fifty pounds on him. \u201cGet out. Right. Fucking. Now.\u201d</p><p>Douchebag glared, but ultimately retreated. He sent Ava a dark look before he muttered, \u201cNo piece of ass is worth this bullshit,\u201d and stormed out.</p><p>Chase slammed the door, locked it and engaged the safety chain before he faced Ava.</p><p>Immediately she started babbling. \u201cChase. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know what you were thinking, sugar tits.\u201d He shucked off his vest as he ambled toward the bed. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I call you sugar tits, do you? Because, I gotta say, it\u2019s a whole lot better than toots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were thinking you wanted to get laid.\u201d Chase popped the buttons on his shirt. \u201cBut that douchebag was the best you could do? In an arena filled with real cowboys, you picked...him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wore a hat. And boots. And chaps.\u201d</p><p>Chase laughed. \u201cHe wore a Toby Keith party hat. His boots were brand spankin\u2019 new. And the chaps? Hell. Them I can\u2019t even explain.\u201d He toed off his boots. Unhooked his chaps and let them fall to the floor in a dusty whoosh. The fact Ava\u2019s eyes never wavered from watching him strip prompted him to bare it all. He unbuckled his belt. Once the zipper loosened his jeans, he slipped them off along with his briefs. He grabbed the back strap of his chaps. Felt goddamn stupid putting them back on nekkid, but he did it anyway.</p><p>He thought about what his brother Ben said about being a man. Being in control. Reading what his lover wanted and acting on it. He felt almost as clueless as Ryan tonight.</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>Man up. \u201cIf you still want to get laid by a cowboy, just say the word. Say the word and I\u2019ll give you a night you\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what about your self-promise to abstain? I don\u2019t want you blaming me afterward that I enticed you into fucking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been enticing me since the moment I laid eyes on you. I consider it a personal victory that I held out as long as I did with you, Ava, because you are something else. Beautiful. Smart. Funny. Sexy. And in case you haven\u2019t looked at a calendar recently, the month is up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the only reason you\u2019re doing this, Chase? Because I\u2019m convenient and the calendar is giving you the all clear to revert to your love-\u2019em-and-leave-\u2019em ways?\u201d</p><p>Chase climbed on the bed, straddling her hips. \u201cNot even fucking close.\u201d He bent his head, studying the turbulent emotions in her beautiful eyes before he pressed his mouth to hers. Lightly teasing her sweet, warm lips. Sucking in her rapidly expelled breaths deep into his lungs. Fueling the need, building the sexual buzz.</p><p>When Ava playfully sank her teeth into his bottom lip and tugged, Chase shuddered. He thrust his tongue inside her mouth and intensified the kiss until she thrashed beneath him, attempting to force full-body contact.</p><p>He ripped his mouth free, panting as if he\u2019d just climbed off a bull. Resting his forehead to hers, he said, \u201cDamn. A man could lose his head just kissin\u2019 you.\u201d Chase smooched her plump lips twice more before following the curve of her jaw up to the sweet spot in front of her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re mine tonight, Hollywood. All night. Any way I want you. As many times as I want you. Make no mistake: I want you. And it doesn\u2019t have a goddamned thing to do with you being convenient, or any fucking calendar, understand?\u201d</p><p>Her rapid-fire, \u201cYes,\u201d caused him to growl against the pulse beating wildly in her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou always smell so damn good.\u201d He nuzzled below her earlobe. \u201cGirly. Like summer flowers.\u201d His tongue traced the shell of her ear. \u201cAnd sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my lotion. Orange blossoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Good enough to eat.\u201d Chase let his lips drift down the center of her body between the deep swell of her cleavage. But he didn\u2019t stop to tongue those tempting nipples, or rub his mouth all over her succulent curves, he kept moving south. He felt her thighs clench between his when the very tip of his tongue circled her belly button. He swept openmouthed kisses from hipbone to hipbone. Then he brushed his goatee across the damp path his mouth had made, using his warm breath and the rough texture of his facial hair to make that delicate flesh quiver.</p><p>But he stopped mere inches from the rise of her mound. Her completely bare mound. \u201cI like you so silky-smooth.\u201d He placed a tender kiss on the section of skin right above where her sex parted like a flower.</p><p>\u201cChase. Please. It\u2019s been so long...\u201d</p><p>His gaze snapped back to hers. \u201cSo long since a guy went down on you?\u201d</p><p>Ava nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cSince right after Jake and I started dating. He did it once and...\u201d Her laugh resembled a groan. \u201cDidn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Chase scooted back until he was between her thighs. \u201cThat shoulda been your first sign the man was gay.\u201d His tongue trailed down the seam of her sex and he licked back up to her clit.</p><p>Ava whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>That response did him in. No teasing her endlessly this time. A primitive growl rumbled free and he roughly pushed her legs apart, baring every glistening pink inch of her sex. He lowered his head and inhaled the aroma of pure Ava before he plunged his tongue inside her pussy. Hot and wet. Spicy sweet.</p><p>She bucked, but his grip on her legs held her steady, keeping her in place as he tasted her thoroughly. He flattened his tongue, lapping the honey from every hidden fold. As he sucked her pussy lips into his mouth, the tip of his tongue sought her clit. Flicking that little nub over and over until it plumped.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes. Like that.\u201d</p><p>Chase narrowed his oral worship to just her clit, suckling softly but firmly until she arched against his mouth. Ava\u2019s fingernails dug into his scalp as her orgasm overtook her. Her sexy, low-throated groan escalated into gasps. Her entire body trembled and Chase didn\u2019t relent.</p><p>As soon as she finished coming, she attempted to scramble back, attempted to close her legs, attempted to regain control.</p><p>But Chase wanted her wild. Writhing beneath him as he made her come again. He grabbed her hips and jerked her back down where he wanted her. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done with you. Come on, baby, one more,\u201d he murmured against the rise of her mound as he nuzzled her satiny skin.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I never have...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will with me.\u201d</p><p>After a tiny beat of hesitation, Ava rolled back onto the mattress, giving herself\u2014her pleasure\u2014over to him completely.</p><p>With that small act of surrender, Chase finally understood what Ben had meant. In that single defining moment, he shed his habitual sexual selfishness and became the lover Ava needed.</p><p>Mindful of the sensitivity of her clit, Chase used teasing breaths, fleeting kisses and soothing caresses. On her belly. On her hipbones. On the tops of her thighs. Everywhere but on her pussy. When Ava began to shift restlessly, he slipped two fingers into her, wiggling the digits, but not sliding them in and out. He continued the randomness of his kisses, memorizing her body\u2019s response to every lick, nibble and gentle bite.</p><p>Before Ava could beg, Chase let his mouth wander to where she wanted it most. Lapping at her clit instead of concentrated sucking, while his fingers fucked in and out of her wet heat. He couldn\u2019t wait to plunge his cock in and feel that hot velvet clamping around his shaft, but he didn\u2019t want to hurry this.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she panted. \u201cI need your mouth...\u201d</p><p>Chase firmed his lips, pulling at the throbbing flesh and pushed another finger deep into her clenching channel, trying not to grind his aching cock against the sheet. That\u2019d be damn embarrassing, spilling his seed before he even got inside her.</p><p>Ava released a wail as she came again.</p><p>Her sweet juices coated his mouth and he licked his lips before pressing openmouthed kisses on the inside of each thigh. While she caught her breath, he ripped open the box of condoms.</p><p>She lifted up to rest on her elbows and watched as he slipped one on.</p><p>God. She looked even more beautiful flushed with color, her eyes heavy with pleasure, her lips fuller from his kisses. He couldn\u2019t wait another second to have her. He said gruffly, \u201cRoll over.\u201d</p><p>Something resembling wariness flashed in her eyes, but she didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>Chase hiked her hips and moved in behind her. He placed a single, tender kiss between the dimples above her ass. Then he took a taut cheek in each hand, aligned his cock and surged inside her.</p><p>Oh fuck yeah. Every goddamned bit as good as he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>He was too far gone with need to take this first time slow. That\u2019d come later. Much later. After he\u2019d dulled this sharp edge of lust. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pushed her hips back, meeting his every hard thrust with a soft grunt. The fringe on his chaps swung forward, the leather connecting with her skin.</p><p>Even as his cock plunged into her fully, even as his balls drew up, aching for release, even as his legs shook and sweat coated his skin, he planned for the next time he fucked her. The next hundred times.</p><p>Chase closed his eyes; his hands yanking her body back to meet his escalating thrusts. Faster, harder, deeper, the only words echoed in his head as primal need roared. Impossible to hold off his orgasm, no matter how much he wanted to prolong the sensation of sinking into her soft, wet, flesh.</p><p>He threw back his head, groaning as his cock emptied in hot pulses. Groaning louder when he felt Ava\u2019s pussy contracting around his dick as she came again.</p><p>Heart thumping, mouth dry, lungs lacking air, Chase fell forward onto Ava\u2019s back, bracing himself on his hands. Although this rendezvous was supposed to\u2019ve been a dare, a fun, wild slap and tickle to ease the sexual tension between them, he felt he\u2019d shared something of himself with her that he\u2019d never shared before.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Three times.</p><p>The man made her come three times.</p><p>In an hour.</p><p>Just thinking about it and Ava\u2019s pussy clenched.</p><p>\u201cChrist. Do that again and I\u2019m never moving off you.\u201d</p><p>She did it again.</p><p>Chase lightly sank his teeth into her shoulder. Then his voice rumbled in her ear. \u201cJust for that, I oughta stay inside you until I\u2019m hard again and fuck you until you scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy vocal cords could always use a good workout.\u201d</p><p>He lifted up, eased out and pinned her flat on her back with his mouth on hers. Kissing her with wild abandon. Making a mockery of any kisses she\u2019d ever shared with another man.</p><p>This is what she wanted. His hunger. His mouth. All the muscular, sweaty weight of his body plastered against hers. His decision to take her from behind their first time half-shocked her. She\u2019d never enjoyed that position.</p><p>Chase gradually slowed the avid stroking of his tongue, switching it up to tease her mouth with firm-lipped nibbles, turning passion into tenderness. He pressed his lips to her ear. \u201cI ain\u2019t surprised it\u2019s like this between us, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He mumbled something, kissed her and murmured, \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>Ava stretched contentedly, wondering what was next. Would he want another round or was he done for the night? Made zero sense she felt disappointment at that prospect, especially after three outstanding orgasms.</p><p>But Chase swaggered in, stopping at the foot of the bed, shucking his chaps, bestowing the devilish grin that turned her nipples hard. \u201cThat took the edge off. Now, after the appetizer I\u2019m ready for the main meal.\u201d</p><p>She shrieked when he jumped on the bed.</p> <p>He put a knee on either side of her hips. \u201cRelax. I just wanna touch you. Seems I skipped a few crucial places in my rush to get nekkid with you.\u201d</p><p>Ava smoothed her palms up his muscular quads, inching toward his groin. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. You focused on one very crucial spot pretty good. Twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiked that, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. I\u2019d also like equal time.\u201d She licked her lips and stared at his cock. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you scoot that bad boy closer to my mouth so I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh, Hollywood. You don\u2019t get to set the scene on the mattress. I do.\u201d</p><p>The intensity in his tone sent a shiver through her as his thumbs continually, idly stroked the lower curve of her breasts. His blue eyes teemed with sexual heat. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see your lips wrapped around my dick. But it\u2019ll be on my timeframe, not yours. Understand?\u201d</p><p>So he was a little bossy in bed. Normally that\u2019d be her cue to leave. She preferred to...top from the bottom as it were. But Chase wasn\u2019t having any of it. And that turned her on more than she\u2019d thought possible. Her pulse skipped. Her breathing grew erratic as he held her gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou like me takin\u2019 charge,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you do and I\u2019m more than happy to oblige you.\u201d He slid down her body, sucking her right nipple into his mouth while his fingers plucked the other.</p><p>Ava panicked a bit and squirmed. Not because it felt good, but for the first time she feared he hadn\u2019t been listening when she\u2019d confessed about her desensitized breasts. How long would he play and tease, awaiting her response? Would he get pissed off when his attentions elicited no reaction? Or if she told him to stop?</p><p>A sharp pinch on each tip simultaneously had her crying out in total shock.</p><p>\u201cYou sure felt that,\u201d he drawled and returned his eager mouth to her nipples, delicately licking. Sucking forcefully. Nipping with his teeth. His rough-skinned hands continually caressing and squeezing the fleshy part of her breasts as his mouth worked the softened tips into rigid peaks.</p><p>This was okay. She relaxed slightly. She could handle him taking his own sweet time.</p><p>But as soon as she loosened up he moved. He stopped nuzzling and laving her chest and scooted down her torso. Kissing her stomach. Tracing each of her ribs with his hot mouth. Tonguing her belly button. Rubbing his warm, soft lips over her hipbones. Letting his goatee skim the sides of her torso. Turning every inch of her skin into his personal playground. Never focusing too long on one area. Keeping her on edge until her body vibrated inside and out, wanting more than just his erotic caresses.</p><p>\u201cTell me why you got that panicked look when I told you to roll over when I had you the first time,\u201d he asked as if his mouth wasn\u2019t hovering over her mound.</p><p>Ava\u2019s face heated and the flush spread down her entire body. She looked away.</p><p>His tongue made a slow pass up her slit and he commanded, \u201cAva. Look at me and answer the question.\u201d</p><p>She blurted, \u201cBecause Jake always fucked me doggie style. Didn\u2019t register why until after.\u201d When guilt shone in Chase\u2019s eyes, Ava reassured him, \u201cSo I figured I shouldn\u2019t be greedy and ask if we could do it face to face since I\u2019d already gotten off twice and you hadn\u2019t gotten off at all.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s eyes iced over. \u201cTaking one for the team, were you? Just goin\u2019 along with it because that\u2019s the way I wanted it?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo. Maybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is it? And don\u2019t tell me what you think I wanna hear. Tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>Why was he pushing her on this now? And why, rather than putting on an easygoing front, distracting him with a kittenish purr, did she find herself snapping at him? \u201cHere\u2019s the truth. I wasn\u2019t thrilled, okay? I never get off when a guy fucks me from behind. So go ahead and give me that cocky cowboy smirk because you know exactly how hard you made me come that way.\u201d</p><p>Chase pushed to his knees between her legs, tugging her into a sitting position so he loomed over her. \u201cI\u2019m not keeping a goddamned oral sex or orgasm scorecard, Ava. Christ.\u201d The tender way his big hands slipped up her neck to cup her head belied the fierceness on his face. \u201cAfter all the nights I spent fantasizing about you, forcing myself to keep away from you, even when I know it hurt you, the last thing I wanna do is fight when we\u2019re finally nekkid together.\u201d</p><p>Made her go all gooey inside, how he balanced his gruff side with his sweet side\u2014and he wasn\u2019t even aware he did it. She curled her fingers around those impressive biceps and whispered, \u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>His posture relaxed. He let his thumbs draw a slow arc over her cheekbones. \u201cI still see questions in your eyes and that stubborn tilt to your chin, darlin\u2019. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize you like to be in control, but I want to touch you too. And it\u2019s sort of selfish, to be honest, that I can\u2019t run my hands and my mouth all over this incredible body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelfish?\u201d He laughed softly and kissed her nose. \u201cThat\u2019s a new one. I\u2019ll play along. Or I\u2019ll let you play. But I\u2019ve got two rules. First, no touching my feet because they\u2019re so damn ticklish.\u201d</p><p>Ava smiled, surprised he\u2019d admitted that weakness.</p><p>\u201cSecond. No touching my cock.\u201d</p><p>Her smile vanished. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>Chase cocked his head, studying her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I gave you full access to my cock, you wouldn\u2019t touch me anywhere else, would you?\u201d He let his hands fall to her breasts. \u201cKinda like them other guys you\u2019ve been with only wantin\u2019 to get their hands on these. I don\u2019t want that for us. Ever. Maybe that is selfish. But it\u2019s been the same story for me. Women I\u2019ve been with have gone straight for my dick. I want you to feel your hands on me, on my body, not just between my legs. I want that more than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s heart flipped over at his raw honesty. When she struggled to find a response that wasn\u2019t trivializing the situation, he sighed.</p><p>Then he retreated, stretching out on his back on the bed, folding his arms behind his head, spreading his legs.</p><p>She wanted to touch him in a way no other woman ever had. Physically. Emotionally. She straddled his hips, watching his face as she angled across him and freed his right arm. Starting with his hand, she outlined each thick finger from the ragged tips to the webbing, loving the rough texture of his knuckles and the hard calluses, built up from years of riding bulls. She placed a soft kiss in the center of his palm and curled his fingers into a fist. Next she followed the corded muscles in his forearm, marveling at the strength. When she reached his massive bicep, she sighed. Her fingertips traced every bulge and deeply cut section of muscle. She kissed the bend in his elbow and lowered it to the mattress before reaching for his left arm.</p><p>Instead of using her fingers to acquaint herself with this side of his rippling, muscular flesh, she used her tongue. The \u201cdamn, woman\u201d uttered under his breath made her smile against his tricep as she mapped his muscles with her mouth. After she released his arm, her mouth wandered from the cup of his shoulder, up the column of his neck.</p><p>Chase groaned and turned his head, granting her full access. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She loved his reaction to the scrape of her teeth, the sucking kisses, the feather light placement of her lips in random spots on his neck. Goose bumps spread across his arms and up his nape. He shifted on the bed, not thrashing, but wiggling enough she knew he liked what she was doing to him. She reveled in this immense power of worshipping rather than being worshipped.</p><p>Ava immersed herself in him. The scent of his skin. The tangy taste of his sweat. The way his muscles strained beneath her tongue. She kissed, licked and nibbled her way down the center of his throat, from his square jaw to his breastbone. And could she get a halleluiah that he had chest hair? Talk about manly, masculine goodness. She rubbed her face over the dark patch of hair, breathing him in, listening to the pounding of his heart, warmed by the heat from his skin, and knowing his body\u2019s response to her was echoed in her body.</p><p>Bracing herself on all fours above him, she watched his face as she tongued his nipple.</p><p>The man actually arched up.</p><p>She sucked the flat disk until it became a stiff point and then she used her teeth on the hard nub. Alternating nipples, forcing herself to focus only on this part of his torso, even when her hands wanted to wander.</p><p>His breaths came in short bursts. When she blew a stream of air across his wet nipple, he moaned, \u201cI...damn. I like that.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d been a long time since she\u2019d indulged in foreplay. She also wanted to get to the good part, the hard thrusting, interlocking body parts of sex. But seeing Chase\u2019s reaction to the way she touched him made her burn hotter, made her want to drag out this exploration so she could know every dip and hollow of this magnificent body. She outlined his pectorals with her lips, looking up at him when she reached his sternum. \u201cYour body is a work of art, Chase. Beautifully sculpted. Strong. Supple. You work it with pride and it shows.\u201d</p><p>His face filled with satisfaction. And pure male heat.</p><p>She planted kisses down the center of his torso, following the sexy dark trail of hair. When her chin bumped against the wet tip of his cock, she glanced up at him again. \u201cHold your cock off to the side, since I\u2019m not supposed to touch it.\u201d</p><p>Chase quirked a brow, managing to look both menacing and obliging. He fisted his hand around the root and stroked upward a few times, never breaking their eye fuck. Finally he pulled his shaft aside and held it by is hip. \u201cHappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. Because I\u2019ve been wanting to get my mouth on your eight pack abs since I saw you naked in Ginger\u2019s bathroom.\u201d And yes, indeedy, she gloried in exploring his ridged, yet flat abdomen, dipping her tongue into the defining grooves. He tasted different down here. Muskier. More like sex. And again, she rubbed her face against his taut skin like a contented feline.</p><p>Well, not completely contented. She wanted more. She peered at him and saw he\u2019d closed his eyes.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Ava reached between his legs and cupped his balls, squeezing gently as her nails scraped up the inside of his right leg, brushing the coarse pubic hair, then traveled back down to his knee.</p><p>Chase jerked back. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019, Hollywood? No touchin\u2019 my cock, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. But I\u2019m not touching your cock; I\u2019m touching your balls.\u201d Smiling\u2014smirking really\u2014she rolled the taut globes between her fingers, letting her thumb stroke the shiver-inducing skin right behind the sac. Holding his gaze, seeing him torn between wanting her to continue touching him, and denying her because she\u2019d... sort of broken his rule.</p><p>He grabbed her wrist and flipped her on her back amidst her surprised shriek. He growled, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to punish me?\u201d She stretched her arms above her head, loving the way his eyes devoured her body. \u201cFifty lashes with your wet tongue, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I have some very specific punishments in mind and I can\u2019t wait to try every fuckin\u2019 one of them. But it\u2019ll keep.\u201d He grabbed another condom and covered himself. Then he braced his forearms by her head, and lowered his body over hers.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but touch him. This man unlike any she\u2019d ever met, who made her feel things that scared her and thrilled her.</p><p>His eyes regained their earlier intensity. \u201cKnow why I took you from behind? Besides me wanting to put my hands all over your fantastic ass?\u201d</p><p>Say something flip and totally male. Don\u2019t be more sweet and loving than you\u2019ve already been or I might fall for you.</p> <p>\u201cI knew I wouldn\u2019t last because I\u2019ve wanted you for too damn long.\u201d Chase kissed the corners of her mouth. The apples of her cheeks. Her temples. \u201cBut this time? I\u2019ll be looking in your eyes, feeling your body wrapped around me, your nails scratching my back, your mouth on mine everywhere. I intend to make it last a good, long time.\u201d</p><p>And...Ava felt herself cartwheeling her arms, trying desperately not to tumble straight into the daunting place she\u2019d never been. \u201cChase...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Chase kissed her. Rocking against her. \u201cYou know what I like best about this position?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat lying down we\u2019re the same height.\u201d Chase pushed into her fully.</p><p>Ava almost knocked him off balance she arched so sharply from his hard thrust. \u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kiddin\u2019. You\u2014this\u2014feels amazing.\u201d He pulled out slowly until just the head of his cock rested in her opening.</p><p>She waited, expecting he\u2019d plunge back in. But he gave her a long, slow glide of his flesh into hers and stopped when he\u2019d filled her completely. He did that exact same move twice more and stopped again.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurtin\u2019 you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re holding your breath.\u201d</p><p>Damn. She exhaled. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Chase placed a soft smooch on her mouth. Then another. Until the kisses became longer. More intense. With hardly a breath between them. But still he didn\u2019t rush the joining of their bodies. Keeping the rhythm slow and steady.</p><p>Ava\u2019s hands were all over his slippery skin. She couldn\u2019t touch him enough\u2014from his straining arms to his strong shoulders and back, down to his muscular ass. She arched and wiggled and squirmed against his rock solid body, urging him to get a move on.</p><p>He broke the kiss and murmured, \u201cThe more frantic you get, the slower I\u2019m gonna go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can.\u201d He softly blew in her ear, educing a whole body shudder. \u201cBecause I really love the sexy way you\u2019re grinding your whole body on mine and if I move faster you\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>She trapped his face in her palms and looked into his laughing eyes. \u201cYou always going to be this controlling in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Sometimes I\u2019m gonna be worse.\u201d Then Chase raised his body up enough so his chest hair abraded her nipples with his every upward stroke. \u201cWrap your legs around my hips and grab the headboard.\u201d</p><p>Ava told herself it was his sexy growl that did it for her, not his command. But as soon as she reached up, he picked up the pace and she understood the appeal of surrender. This was heady stuff, ceding her pleasure to him. Becoming mindless in the friction of damp skin rubbing on damp skin. Anticipating the heat and hardness of his shaft plowing into her tender pussy. Destroying her wits as his mouth eked out every shiver and moan with hot, wet sucking kisses on her neck.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he whispered fiercely. \u201cLet me take you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed, her back bowing as his cock hit her G-spot. Over and over. He\u2019d changed the angle of his hips so he wasn\u2019t bumping against her clit, but this felt so damn good she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Chase took her mouth again as he drove into her, so in tune with what she needed that Ava swore they\u2019d made love a thousand times before instead of just once.</p><p>Then he adjusted his position again, hitting both spots with each hard, deep stroke.</p><p>Ava seemed to splinter into a million pieces when she climaxed. She knew Chase wasn\u2019t far behind as his thrusts intensified. When he groaned and started to bury his face in her neck, she released her grip on the headboard and cradled his face in her palms. \u201cLook at me. Show me what I do to you.\u201d</p><p>Chase whispered, \u201cGod, Ava,\u201d and shuddered as his orgasm rolled over him in a long wave that left him groaning and her stunned by the intensity.</p><p>Panting, they just held onto each other, trying to unscramble their brains. Finally Chase mumbled, kissed her, pushed up, pulled out, and got up to ditch the condom.</p><p>Ava rolled over, deliciously sore, but unsure what would happen next.</p><p>When he crawled back in bed, she pushed up on her elbow, intending to give him space. He said, \u201cWhere you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. To my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d He dropped his top leg over hers, holding her in place. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to fuck me and run. I suspect that\u2019s been both our habits in the past. We both know this ain\u2019t a one-night thing.\u201d He scooted behind her and planted a kiss on her shoulder. \u201cSo get used to sharing a bed with me.\u201d</p><p>Touched by his unexpected affection, Ava turned and rubbed her cheek over his. \u201cSounds good. I prefer a king-sized bed anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the room\u2019s still gotta cost under a hundred bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a taskmaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s gotta keep you in line.\u201d</p><p>Chase was a hard sleeper. So Ava found it easy to slip free from his arms in the early morning hours.</p><p>She wished for light but didn\u2019t dare risk waking him by turning on the one in the bathroom. But it was handy that they\u2019d slept naked. She paused at the foot of the bed, her eye on the prize. Although they\u2019d had sex three times last night, Chase hadn\u2019t allowed her direct access to his cock, even one time, which was why Ava was helping herself to it now. It was a new day. Last night\u2019s rules no longer applied.</p><p>She knew she\u2019d only have limited time before Chase woke up. Bending her head, she inhaled this warm, intimate scent before she sucked the soft cock into her mouth. She loved how the skin grew taut and the flesh expanded with every suctioning pull. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stirred, moaning as his cock hardened. Lengthened.</p><p>When Ava started sliding his shaft over her tongue, his hand landed on her head.</p><p>Immediately it snapped back and Chase scrambled upright. \u201cAva? What the devil are you doin\u2019?\u201d He inhaled a sharp breath through his teeth when she tongued the tip. \u201cHell. I thought it was a dream.\u201d</p><p>She pulled off his shaft long enough to say, \u201cNope. I want to make this buff body to squirm.\u201d She licked him like a lollipop.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve no doubt you can make me squirm. You probably could get me to beg.\u201d He brushed her hair back from where it\u2019d fallen in her face. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Again, Ava eased off and met his gaze in the near darkness. \u201cBut nothing. You don\u2019t get to direct this.\u201d</p><p>If she thought he\u2019d lovingly pet her, agree, and murmur encouragement, she was mistaken. Chase\u2019s big hands were on her face, gripping her jaw. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>His answer turned her panties damp. As did his explicit command, \u201cOn the floor. On your knees.\u201d</p><p>As Ava moved, so did Chase. He perched on the edge of the mattress, making space for her between his legs. Then he stroked her cheek. \u201cBetter. Now I can watch you workin\u2019 me and you ain\u2019t gonna choke when you swallow.\u201d</p><p>No mincing words there.</p><p>\u201cTake me in your mouth again, Ava.\u201d</p><p>God that low gravely morning voice loosened something primitive inside her. She bent her head, letting her hair fall against his thighs, feeling his muscular quads quiver in response to the soft strands teasing the muscles. She suckled the tip, tracing the shape of the plump head with the inside of her lips, taking time to flick her tongue over the sweet spot below the cockhead with every wet swipe.</p><p>Tease. Retreat. Acquainting herself with his reactions, licking away the little pearls of pre-come. Then Ava moved in for the kill, needing to taste him fully. She made a fist around the base, sliding her hand up and down the length, bobbing her head to meet her fingers.</p><p>He stayed rigid, hands propped on the edge of the mattress, watching her. But Chase wasn\u2019t completely motionless. His body trembled. His chest rose and fell rapidly. His toes curled.</p><p>Something about seeing that odd vulnerability made Ava ache. Made her want to assure him she\u2019d never exploit this part of him that he was bold enough to share with her.</p><p>Her hand slid down to fondle his balls as she worked that long shaft, rubbing the plump cockhead against the roof of her mouth before opening her throat. Breathing through the gag reflex, she swallowed him fully.</p><p>\u201cHoly. Christ.\u201d Chase\u2019s palms covered her ears and he pushed her upper body back. Then he thrust past her lips, lodging his cock into her throat, staying there until she swallowed. He pulled out and did it again.</p><p>Ava had no control. Chase held her head, keeping her in place. \u201cAva. Look at me. See what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze connected with his. Such lust. Such hunger in his eyes. Such need. She felt it all flowing between them, felt her body responding to the call of his. She hollowed her cheeks around the thickness filling her mouth and he groaned.</p><p>\u201cWatch those teeth, darlin\u2019,\u201d he warned, \u201cbut don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>She switched from deep throating him to shallow bobs of her head. Her senses were fine-tuned to the wet sucking sounds of his cock shuttling in and out of her mouth. The gentler grip he maintained in her hair. The shag carpet digging into her knees. His low murmurs of approval. The wholly male scent of his sex. And his entire body twitching with anticipation.</p><p>More more more. Give it all to me.</p> <p>He swore and went motionless.</p><p>Ava moaned around his cock as he came and his taste exploded on her tongue. She swallowed each hot spurt and his pleasure rolled over her in a warm, satisfying wave. When the tremors ceased, she released his softened cock little by little, dragging out the moment for herself.</p><p>After his eyes opened and he seemed to remember where he was, he stroked her hair. Ran his thumb across her swollen lips. Then he granted Ava that cat-who\u2019d-gotten-cream smirk. \u201cMuch better than an alarm clock.\u201d</p><p>As much as she\u2019d loved blowing him, now in the aftermath, she felt shy. Exposed. She ducked her head, letting her mouth connect with his thigh, loving the way that coarse hair felt on her sensitized lips.</p><p>He continued to pet her, soothe her, trailing his fingers across her shoulder and down her spine. He only allowed her to hide from him for so long before he forced her to meet his gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go back to LA now that we\u2019ve scratched the itch. And before you go getting that mean glint in your eye, this has been way more than just sex for me. Way more.\u201d</p><p>For me too. But she couldn\u2019t say it. Instead she said, \u201cBut how does this\u2014\u201d she gestured to their naked bodies, \u201c\u2014change things between us?\u201d She braced herself for a noncommittal answer, but Chase\u2019s next words blew her away.</p><p>\u201cAva. It changes nothing and it changes everything. We\u2019re friends. I can\u2019t imagine losing that part of you. But now I see us getting nekkid together as often as humanly possible, until we\u2019re both exhausted and grinning from ear to ear. So what does it mean we\u2019ve gone from friends to lovers?\u201d He bestowed that sweet, hot, naughty grin. \u201cI believe that means we\u2019re havin\u2019 us a bonafide summer romance.\u201d</p><p>Ava watched from the shadows of the bleachers as Chase strode out of the medical tent. He stopped and talked to a couple of riders.</p><p>The man was magnificent. Not just his physique. Not just his face. Not just his cowboy charm. Not just his way with people that put them at ease. All those things by themselves were pretty impressive. But were powder-keg potent wrapped up in one package\u2014a hunky cowboy who defined resilient.</p><p>She felt the other men\u2019s eyes on her, but she only had eyes for him. \u201cCan I talk to you for a second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Excuse us.\u201d</p><p>Wanting privacy, Ava wandered to the far corner, away from the contestants and rodeo officials.</p><p>When she turned around, Chase rested against a section of the metal corral.</p><p>\u201cYou still pissy with me for insisting we book a room tonight instead of heading to the next rodeo?\u201d</p><p>His bad dismount last night affected his right side, his knee, his hip and his shoulder. She\u2019d cringed this morning, seeing his bruised and battered body. He\u2019d turned pissy and told her to quit staring at him like a circus freak. Then he\u2019d grabbed his clothes and headed to the bathroom on stiff legs.</p><p>His blue eyes trapped hers. \u201cMaybe.\u201d His big hands curled around her hips, but he kept their bodies apart. \u201cBut I\u2019ll let you make it up to me.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s stance gave Ava additional height advantage. He didn\u2019t seem to mind, which was another big change in his attitude since they\u2019d started sleeping together. \u201cAnd what do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>He pressed a hot kiss on the center of her chest. Then those oh so talented lips traveled up the arc of her throat to her ear. \u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blowjob.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s chuckle against her neck caused goose flesh to break out. \u201cTempting, but no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna bend me over a hay bale and spank my ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong again. But you are givin\u2019 me some great ideas.\u201d His wet tongue flicked her earlobe like he was working her clit, which sent a spike of heat straight to her core. \u201cI want a kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Right now.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her lips to his in a slow slide of mouth on mouth. Gradually shifting the kiss from sweet to fiery. Kissing him with passion, tempering it with tenderness. A languorous meeting of tongues, a communion of need.</p><p>He placed soft smooches on her mouth. \u201cThanks for caring about me, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound surprised I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am. I\u2019m not used to it because I\u2019ve kept relationships casual. I wasn\u2019t joking about my threshold being two weeks.\u201d He twirled a piece of her hair around his finger. \u201cI haven\u2019t answered to anyone for years. I find I like answering to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t like to see you hurting. You don\u2019t have to be tough in front of me, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hard habit to break.\u201d He quickly changed the subject. \u201cAre you taping me tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Unless you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to. I just hope it\u2019s not the same as last night.\u201d</p><p>His injury was causing him more pain than he\u2019d let on. She\u2019d be surprised if he rode any bulls tonight. \u201cGood luck. I\u2019ll see you after.\u201d</p><p>Chase stuck it out on both bulls. But he wasn\u2019t in top form and finished in fourth place, out of the money.</p><p>First thing he did at the motel was shower. For thirty minutes. When they\u2019d first started traveling on the road, she hadn\u2019t understood why it took him so long to shower. But now she knew he needed that long to get rid of the aches and pains from riding.</p><p>He dropped his towel and crawled in bed, twining himself around her like her own personal anaconda. \u201cI\u2019m not up for sex games tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much for my nefarious plan to play nekkid Parcheesi with you.\u201d</p><p>Chase laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. Can I give you a massage or rub some ointment on the sore spots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. But this is good. Your warm body is like a magic heating pad. Makes all my aches and pains go away. Makes me all tingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. You\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. You know it, but I\u2019m at my best when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>Ava melted just a little.</p><p>\u201cNow, we done talking so we can see who gets tossed off America\u2019s Next Top Model, or what?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Chase wasn\u2019t claustrophobic. But if he had to spend another fucking minute in the truck cab with Ava, surrounded by the scent of her lotion, the sight of her pink-tipped toes tapping on his dashboard and the porn queen way she sucked on licorice, he\u2019d go insane.</p><p>In fact, he figured he deserved a medal for his ability to withstand the temptation of pulling off on the closest dirt road so he could fuck her inside the truck cab, or against the truck door, or in the truck bed. He\u2019d been so lost in fantasies of the many, many ways he intended to take her, he\u2019d missed the damn turn off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d known the second he touched her he was done for. Ava needed him in a way no other woman ever had. He was a different man when he was with her, regardless if they were naked. So maybe that\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t freakin\u2019 wait to get naked with her again, day after day after day.</p><p>Seemed to take forever to check-in. He ditched the bags in the corner of the room. In the mirror above the sink, he saw Ava flop on the bed and heave a huge sigh.</p><p>\u201cBefore you get too comfy, maybe you oughta see if you got the door shut.\u201d</p> <p>She popped to her feet and resituated her skirt as she crossed the room, those fucking sexy little pleats teasing the back of her legs.</p><p>When he\u2019d gotten a look at her outfit this morning\u2014short plaid skirt, plain white blouse, black ballet shoes\u2014his cock had been hard all day as his head conjured up bad-schoolgirl-needing-a-spanking scenarios.</p><p>Ava tested the door by pushing on it. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you were worried it wasn\u2019t shut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLock it.\u201d He put his mouth below her ear and pressed their bodies together.</p><p>The lock clicked.</p> <p>\u201cHands on the door.\u201d He nuzzled her neck, whispering, \u201cWant you.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to catch his temple with a kiss and a soft, \u201cYou have me. What are you going to do with me?\u201d</p><p>Chase let his breath tease her damp nape. Making her wait for a response.</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>He licked the shell of her ear. \u201cWhat do you want me to do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d</p> <p>Made him hot as hell when crude words tumbled from that pretty mouth. But Chase knew it made her equally hot when he talked dirty right back to her. He curled his fingers around her hips and tugged her butt into his groin. \u201cGrind this sweet ass against me. Make me want it. Make me want to touch it. Make me want to run my mouth over it. Make me want to fuck it.\u201d</p><p>He wondered if she\u2019d balk, but she shimmied her hips and swung those perfect mounds of flesh into his groin like a pro.</p><p>Chase had a condom on two seconds after his jeans hit the floor. Dragging his cock up and down her sweet slit, he wasn\u2019t surprised how easily his cock slipped inside her welcoming heat. Ava was always ready for him. As much as he wanted to pound into her, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Not at first. But her breathy whimpers and the tight clasp of her pussy when he drove in hard and deep shattered his strategy.</p><p>\u201cYes. I like that. God, I love that.\u201d</p><p>Hips pistoning, he set a plunge-and-retreat rhythm that felt so good he never wanted to stop. Each thrust pushed him to that elusive point, but Ava reached it first. Her cunt clamping down around his cock had him grunting, sweating, swearing as he fucked himself into an orgasmic stupor.</p><p>When he returned to earth, he muttered, \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I made claw marks in the door with my fingernails.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a compliment.\u201d</p><p>Ava leaned back and wrapped her arm around his neck. \u201cIf I don\u2019t say it enough, you are an amazing lover, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame goes, sugar tits.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t consider that a term of endearment, but I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. Talented. Sexy. Smart. Sophisticated. Funny. Sweet.\u201d He kissed the back of her neck. \u201cAre those better terms of endearment?\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his throat. \u201cActually, I prefer sugar tits.\u201d</p><p>As they straightened their clothes, she said, \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got that out of the way, I expect you\u2019ll be looking for food next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of the way?\u201d Wearing a wicked, determined grin, Chase stalked her until the back of her knees hit the bed. \u201cJust for that smartass crack, sugar tits, I\u2019m gonna eat my fill of you. And darlin\u2019, you know how much I can eat.\u201d</p><p>Chase looked far too comfortable, far too sexy lounging against the passenger door, camera in hand. \u201cSmile.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cWhy are you taping me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re driving and I\u2019m bored out of my fuckin\u2019 mind.\u201d</p><p>At least if his hands were occupied he wasn\u2019t crunching on sunflower seeds. Or touching her. If the man put his hands on her while she was driving, she\u2019d wreck his precious truck.</p><p>\u201cBesides, what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from California. I don\u2019t even know what the hell that barnyard saying means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I answered your questions over the last few weeks, it\u2019s time for you to answer mine. Pains me to admit it, but your Gestapo tactic worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know stuff about me I\u2019ve never told anyone.\u201d</p><p>But I want to know everything about you. I\u2019m as obsessed with you as you are obsessed with riding bulls.</p><p>Chase fiddled with the camera. \u201cWhoa. You can get really close with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you getting shots of my nose hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019ve zoomed in on your nipples. Think cold thoughts, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of what I did to you last night. That was pretty hot.\u201d</p><p>Her grip increased on the steering wheel even as her toes unconsciously curled. Chase\u2019s hungry mouth sucking on her clit. His fingers tweaking her nipples. Proving his mastery over her body, restraining her arms, denying her release, and building her to a frenzy with each lick. Each touch. Each whispered promise of ecstasy until she shattered with an epic orgasm that made her scream. Then he\u2019d made love to her with such exquisite tenderness she\u2019d melted.</p><p>\u201cSee? It worked. You\u2019ve got that dreamy look you get right after I fuck you.\u201d</p><p>And so much for the basking. \u201cAsk your damn question.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cLeast favorite food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEggplant. Slimy, nasty stuff. No matter how it\u2019s cooked it tastes like dog shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hafta agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame for zucchini. Our cook used to try and hide it in other dishes, but I always could taste it. Blech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a full-time cook, growing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaria wasn\u2019t live-in help, but she came every day. Sometimes she cooked lunch, but most the time it was dinner. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people I know don\u2019t hire out for them kinda domestic jobs. To be honest, you don\u2019t act nearly as spoiled as I thought you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there was a compliment in that somewhere. Anyway, my mom worked a lot, expanding the hotel business. Cooking dinner and cleaning up the kitchen was the last thing she wanted to do after spending fourteen hours at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta ask this, Hollywood. Did you have a nanny?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMy dad stayed home with me and my brother when we were little. He jokes he can change a tire and a diaper in ten seconds flat. I told you he\u2019s a mechanic, right?\u201d</p><p>Chase lowered the camera and squinted at her. \u201cWait a second. Dumond. Is your dad the Dumond in DRT\u2014Dumond Racing Team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He started the team in our garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, Ava. DRT is my favorite NASCAR team. Darby Janeville had an amazing season last year with that second place showing in Darlington\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ava held up her hand. \u201cNo offense, but you might as well be speaking Chinese. I don\u2019t follow NASCAR. Haven\u2019t much cared for racing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t say anything, but obviously he wanted to.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it you know all about your mother\u2019s position as CEO of Cooper Hotels, but you don\u2019t have any interest in your father\u2019s business? Especially since he built it from the ground up and he was around more during your growing-up years than your mom.\u201d</p><p>That jarred her. She\u2019d never thought of it that way. Her dad used to ask her to come to races. She always refused. When had he stopped asking?</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t you noticed?</p><p>Chase\u2019s deep voice startled her out of guilty thoughts. \u201cSo your brother chose the hotel business over the racing business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAxel is involved with DRT, mostly from the Cooper Tires side. He attends all the events with Dad.\u201d Again, it struck Ava, how much she\u2019d cut herself off from her family in recent years since she\u2019d \u201cmade it\u201d as an actress. Was that why Axel acted so curt with her? Because she blew him off, he was mirroring her behavior?</p><p>When had she gotten so selfish? So stingy? Unwilling to share any of her free time with her family?</p><p>She knew Chase had taken a rash of crap about his emotional and physical distance from his family. She\u2019d felt sorry for him, but come to find out, she\u2019d been acting the same way.</p><p>\u201cAva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Spaced there for a second. I\u2019m a lot like my mom in that I don\u2019t do domestic things. My housekeeping service keeps my house tidy. They take my dirty things to the laundry once a week. Then clean clothes are miraculously returned to their proper places. I don\u2019t have to do anything. So that makes me as useless as teats on a bull, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Chase smiled. \u201cNice barnyard reference, Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the horseshoe fits... Anyway. It\u2019s embarrassing to admit I\u2019m so helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t be. You lead a different life than most folks. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. You have what most people work so hard for. You shouldn\u2019t apologize for it.\u201d</p><p>How was it this man knew exactly what to say? Not in a suck-up way, but with total sincerity?</p><p>Such a sucker for this man, Ava. Write it on your forehead\u2014s-u-c-k-e-r.</p><p>\u201cOkay, back to the hard-hitting questions. What\u2019s the most personal thing anyone gave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go first this time, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bronze my cousin Carter sculpted of me ridin\u2019 the bull Chicken on a Chain that scored me a ninety-two point ride.\u201d</p><p>That was a very personal gift, which caused Ava another pang of sadness when she thought about the loss of hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Your face changed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe camera showed you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva.

Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather commissioned a necklace for my sixteenth birthday. A tiny beautiful Swarovski crystal rose with a gold stem artfully twisted into an \u2018A\u2019.

I don\u2019t know if the chain broke or what, but I was devastated because it happened about a month after he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, sugar, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Evidently Chase had enough taping. He returned the camera to the case and faced forward, wiggling to get comfortable.</p><p>\u201cBefore you nod off, tell me why we\u2019re backtracking. You planned a route through Montana and now we\u2019re back in Cornhusker territory.\u201d</p> <p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cSouth Dakota is not Cornhusker territory. The reason I\u2019m not goin\u2019 to the event in Billings is because Ryan told me a former PBR bull rider who switched to the PRCA circuit will be competing. I don\u2019t wanna run into him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen? Because I\u2019d remember something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were pecking away on your computer, and I told you about it as soon as I got off the phone with Ryan. You said, and I quote, \u2018Sounds like a good plan\u2019 so don\u2019t blame me that you tuned me out again.\u201d</p><p>Before she could apologize, Chase said, \u201cI\u2019m whupped,\u201d and wedged himself between the passenger door and the seat, pulling his hat down over his eyes.</p> <p>Ava had just walked out of a truck-stop bathroom, when her phone rang. Her belly tightened at the caller ID: Marnie Driscoll. Her agent. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva, dear, it\u2019s Marnie. I\u2019m so happy to hear your voice. That secretive assistant of yours wouldn\u2019t tell me where you\u2019ve been hiding yourself.\u201d</p><p>Thanks, Hannah. \u201cI\u2019m taking a vacation at an undisclosed location. Why? What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Marnie sighed. \u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid I have bad news. The movie shoot in Mexico has been postponed indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething with illegal permits and the production company\u2019s insurance carrier refusing to cover people and equipment in that part of Mexico due to previous issues. It\u2019s all very complicated, and evidently Lynch is incensed enough to completely rewrite the screenplay with an entirely new location. With as slow as that writing process is for him, you could be in limbo on this project for at least a year.\u201d</p><p>She slumped against the concrete wall. \u201cDamn. I really looked forward to that role and working with Lynch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. But to be perfectly blunt, dear, I\u2019m not terribly unhappy about it. I know everyone is vying to work with Lynch because he\u2019s on his way up, but the pay was total crap. You\u2019d signed on for slave wages, with less-than-decent living conditions in a dangerous part of Mexico for several months. And we both know the backend profit deal I negotiated for you wouldn\u2019t amount to much without major distribution, which Lynch still lacks with his small production company.\u201d</p> <p>Marnie had lobbied hard for Ava not to take the part. But Marnie\u2019s bottom line wasn\u2019t Ava\u2019s\u2014Marnie looked solely at dollar signs. That trait made her a great agent, but caused friction on occasion. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is actually very happy news for us. Since you were committed to that movie, I couldn\u2019t suggest you to casting agents for any new mid-season TV productions. Now that stumbling block is out of the way and I can let everyone know you\u2019re available.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it made her a diva, but Ava couldn\u2019t muster much enthusiasm for signing on for another series. Yes, it\u2019d been upsetting when Miller\u2019s Ridge had been cancelled, but without being tied to a weekly TV show, she\u2019d finally had the chance to branch out. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay yes. Say you\u2019re excited.\u201d Marnie sighed again. \u201cLook, Ava, I know you\u2019ve mentioned that five years of working on television was enough. But sweetie, that was before this thing happened with Jake. You\u2019ll be lucky if anyone shows an interest in hiring you, even for TV.\u201d</p><p>That stung.</p><p>\u201cWe need to rebuild your name. It might take a couple of years, but you\u2019ve given your all to your career, we both know it\u2019d be suicide to stop now. I\u2019ll make the rounds. Throw out a few hooks to see who bites. Does that sound reasonable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thanks, Marnie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job. But just so we\u2019re clear, if we do get lucky and land you an audition, I can count on you to be there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning, drop everything and fly to LA on a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I can\u2019t imagine your little vacation is more important than your career. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d Marnie hung up.</p><p>And Ava feared this was the beginning of the end of her Wild West adventure.</p><p>Hours later Ava\u2019s head was screaming. A thick haze settled behind her eyes, making it hard to see.</p><p>She hated to wake him, but she had no choice. \u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He stirred. \u201cI\u2019m awake. We already there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re about thirty miles out. But I can\u2019t drive anymore.\u201d</p><p>Chase was immediately upright. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a metal spike sticking out of the top of my head? Because it sure feels like it.\u201d</p><p>Now silvery fishlike lines were swimming in her peripheral vision, adding a layer of nausea to the pain and dizziness.</p><p>\u201cPull over,\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know you\u2019re hurting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva. Ease off the gas and pull over before you cause an accident. You\u2019re driving down the middle of the damn road.\u201d</p><p>She slowed. By the time she stopped, her stomach was in full revolt. Ava let her head fall back into the headrest and muttered, \u201cGive me a minute and we\u2019ll switch places.\u201d</p><p>Chase hopped out his side and opened the driver\u2019s side door. \u201cHold tight.\u201d His hands slipped beneath her legs and he picked her up slowly, taking extra care not to jostle her.</p><p>What a sweet, attentive man. But still it caused a spark of paranoia, imagining how many times he\u2019d done the soothe-and-calm routine with other women. Ava managed to last fifteen seconds in the passenger side before she bailed out, falling to her knees on the rocky ground and dry heaving. Her belly roiled and she felt clammy sweat plastering her hair to her head.</p><p>Chase\u2019s hand rubbed circles on her back. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d She pushed back on her heels.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of the heat.\u201d He helped her back into the truck. Once they were moving, he threaded his fingers through hers. \u201cIf you feel barfy, lemme know and I\u2019ll pull over.\u201d</p><p>Every bump in the road sent a shaft of pain into her skull. Finally, the truck stopped.</p><p>Chase said, \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>The truck cab heated, her whole body dripped sweat. Then blessedly cool air wafted over her. She opened her eyes and noticed they were in a motel parking lot. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA place where you can take it easy today. How often do you get migraines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get migraines,\u201d she said irritability.</p><p>\u201cAva. Sweetheart. I know what a migraine looks like and you need some damn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hot, sweaty and my brain feels like it\u2019s in a pressure cooker, so please don\u2019t yell at me, Chase, and give me an on-the-fly diagnosis.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed his hands up her neck to cup her face in his palms, wiping away her tears. Those blue eyes showed concern, not anger. \u201cGot a great opinion of me, Hollywood, if you think I\u2019d yell at a sick woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sick.\u201d More tears leaked out before she could stop them. \u201cI\u2019m upset because I lost my job.\u201d The last word caught on a pain-filled gasp.</p><p>Chase went perfectly still. \u201cRun that by me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy agent called when I stopped for gas. The movie shoot in Mexico has been called off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby. I\u2019m so sorry. I know how much you wanted that. No wonder you\u2019ve made yourself sick. C\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t hold back the sobs. Her thoughts were so muddled, she couldn\u2019t tell him the rest. She\u2019d probably have to leave any day and that made her sick to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cHey, now, come on, let\u2019s get you fixed up.\u201d</p><p>Ava gripped his hand as he started across the parking lot. But the shimmering mirage images were back in her peripheral vision and she stumbled. Chase caught her and gently lifted her into his arms. She whispered, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Inside the room, Chase settled her on the bed. \u201cLie back and close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>The dizziness didn\u2019t go away, but it didn\u2019t get worse.</p><p>The bed dipped. \u201cThis might be cold.\u201d</p><p>A cool cloth covered her forehead and eyes. She sighed. \u201cYou must think I\u2019m a baby for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh. Relax. Breathe nice and slow, yoga girl.\u201d</p><p>She focused on forcing air in and out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d His rough-skinned fingers trailed up and down her arm, soothing her, his touch more effective than any over-the-counter headache medicine.</p><p>\u201cChase\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh.\u201d The last thing Ava remembered were his warm lips pressing against hers, and his whispered, \u201cRest.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach rumbled so loudly it woke her up. Disoriented, she opened her eyes and saw Chase lying next to her. Her stomach did a little flip, not from sickness, but from seeing those beautiful blue eyes first thing.</p><p>\u201cHey. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHungry. Thirsty. Confused. Like I was in a time warp. What time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven a.m.\u201d Chase handed her a bottle of water. \u201cThis\u2019ll help.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Ava sat up and drank all the water. \u201cSo I crashed for over twelve hours. Guess I missed the rodeo last night. How\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>Chase wore a stoic expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Did you have like a ninety-nine point ride or something?\u201d</p> <p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. What happened?\u201d Her gaze swept over him. \u201cDid you get hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 happened, Ava. I didn\u2019t compete last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019d just leave you here alone when you were so goddamn sick?\u201d</p> <p>She froze.</p><p>Chase grabbed her hand and rubbed her knuckles against the razor stubble on his cheeks. \u201cI was freaked out about you. I wasn\u2019t exactly sure what to do. I\u2019m not...well, I don\u2019t have much experience taking care of sick people. My first response has always been to get the hell away, so I sort of winged it.\u201d A sheepish smile curled the corners of his mouth. \u201cYou don\u2019t look too worse for the wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t compete last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are more important things in life than bull ridin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>This tough man had given up a chance to ride some of the best rough stock around to play nursemaid. Just when she thought she had the one-track mind bull rider down cold, he bowled her over with something completely unexpected.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou take such good care of me, Ava, I was more than happy to return the favor.\u201d</p><p>She smiled until he got right in her face. \u201cAnd I\u2019m also happy to return the favor of nagging you into telling me exactly what your agent said that got you wound so tight.\u201d He flashed his teeth. \u201cNo dodging me either, because friends share stuff like this, remember?\u201d</p><p>Somehow she\u2019d known that comment would come back to bite her. But she wasn\u2019t an actress for nothing. She\u2019d lie her ass off so Chase didn\u2019t put an end to their adventure right now.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The bad thing about driving all night? Trying to find a motel at six in the morning with available rooms. When they finally located one, they agreed paying seventy dollars over their budget was worth it.</p><p>As soon as they dropped their bags, they stripped, crawled between the cool sheets of the king-sized bed and conked out, twined together. Even in sleep Chase kept Ava close. He\u2019d never imagined he\u2019d like waking up with the same woman wrapped around his body every morning.</p><p>He woke around noon and showered. He didn\u2019t bother dressing because his priority was getting Ava nekkid. Immediately. But first he grabbed his supplies from his duffel bag and piled them on the nightstand.</p><p>Chase started at her pretty toes peeping out from beneath the comforter. She\u2019d insisted on foregoing lunch for a pedicure. He hadn\u2019t understood why sporting pink toenails vastly improved her mood; it just had. And after how worried he\u2019d been while she\u2019d had that vicious migraine, he would\u2019ve done anything to see her back to normal.</p> <p>He nibbled on the top of her foot and pressed a kiss on her instep. His mouth wandered past her ankle, and he slowly zigzagged just the very tip of his tongue up her shin. God. She had such satiny smooth skin everywhere.</p><p>Ava stirred and murmured, \u201cI\u2019m liking this morning wake-up call, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>He threw back the covers and continued his northward progression, using his right hand to lightly stroke her right leg. \u201cAnd just think, I\u2019m only half-done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re getting tired you could stop at the midpoint and...rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest...by putting my face in your crotch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And you could leave it there as long as you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. I\u2019m an accommodating woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for me.\u201d He lightly sank his teeth into her hipbone and snapped the stretchy string of her cherry-red thong. He peppered kisses down the sexy sweep of her belly to the rise of her pubic bone, but rather than continuing south, he dragged openmouthed kisses straight up her torso. Paused to tongue the rhinestone charm dangling from her belly button piercing. He lifted his mouth from feasting on her skin long enough to say, \u201cUnhook your bra.\u201d</p><p>Ava twisted the front snap until it released. She tugged it down her arms and tossed it aside. Then her hands were on his head, sensuously rubbing her palms across his bristly hair. \u201cI love how this feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love when you put your hands on me, but right now, I want them above your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really love it when you get all bossy,\u201d she said with a husky purr.</p><p>He kissed her sternum. \u201cI know you do.\u201d Humbling, how readily Ava accepted it his aggressive side. She turned herself over to him without hesitation. Without restriction. With absolute trust that he could give her what she needed.</p><p>Which was why he was going to push her a little farther today than he usually did.</p><p>While letting his facial hair tease the underside of her breasts, Chase said, \u201cAva, do you trust me?\u201d</p><p>A beat passed before she answered, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe very sure of that answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanna try something with you. But I hafta know you\u2019re on board. That you believe I\u2019d never step far over the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does scare me a little.\u201d She squirmed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll admit my interest outweighs my anxiety. So, yes. Whatever you want from me, Chase, is yours.\u201d</p><p>Humbled, Chase slipped his hands up her chest to lovingly curl his hands around her face, studying her eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d His kisses started out sweet, but quickly heated. Deepened. Intensified to the point they both breathed hard when he finally released her mouth.</p><p>He reached for the neckerchief on the dresser. \u201cBlindfold first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike in the movie 9 1\u20442 Weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever seen it.\u201d Chase covered her eyes and secured the knot on the back of her head. He let his lips drift across her forehead, then across her cheeks. Placing his mouth on her ear to whisper, \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone else\u2019s ideas on how to turn you on, Ava Rose. And sweet darlin\u2019, make no mistake. I\u2019m gonna turn you inside out.\u201d</p><p>She moaned and angled her head, trying to force him to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Hold still or I won\u2019t touch you until you prove you can behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard-ass.\u201d She bestowed that dazzling movie star smile. \u201cI meant that with the utmost respect, sir.\u201d</p><p>Chase smooched her mouth. \u201cI like it when you suck up to me. Wrists together.\u201d He bound her hands with a bandana, looped his belt through the binding and attached it to the headboard.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you tying me up? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve ever tried to get away from you when we\u2019re naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I appreciate that.\u201d He straddled her thighs and ran his hands from her bound wrists, down those yoga-toned arms, stopping at those beautiful, plentiful tits. He cupped and squeezed them, loving that his hands couldn\u2019t contain all the abundant flesh. \u201cHave you ever noticed your nipples are the same deep pink color as your lips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Look, Chase, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth with his, stopping her protest. Maybe he was wasting his time fondling her breasts because she couldn\u2019t feel anything, but he hadn\u2019t done a thorough test yet. If he\u2019d attempted a sensual yet intensive assessment without restricting her hands, well, her clever hands would distract him and he\u2019d lose his focus. And this was all focused on her. As soon as he broke the seal of their mouths, he returned to worshipping her chest.</p><p>Letting the tips of his fingers caress the outside swells of her breasts, he feathered his thumbs over her nipples, watching the tips draw into rigid nubs. Tempting, to enclose the peak between his lips, getting it wetter with each suctioning pull of his hot mouth. Making it harder. But he didn\u2019t. He just stroked and teased.</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t need verbal confirmation his focused attention was having a positive affect; her body told him everything he needed to know. He took possession of her mouth. Whispering kisses across her passion-dampened skin. Using his tongue to trace the upper and lower bow of her lips while maintaining the slow, steady torment on her nipples.</p><p>Only when she relaxed did he mix it up. Following the cords in her neck to the base of her throat, he opened his mouth and sucked the sweet spot by her collarbone the same time he pinched both her nipples. Hard.</p><p>Ava gasped and arched.</p><p>He was insistent in his attention. Licking, softly kissing, gently biting her neck, then randomly tweaking those taut peaks. Relentlessly and very, very thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cChase\u2014\u201d</p><p>He fell headlong into the rush of serving up harsh kisses whenever she opened her delectable mouth. And he knew the exact moment she realized he was one hundred percent in charge and she surrendered to him completely.</p><p>Chase murmured, \u201cGood girl,\u201d and started on her nipples. The teasing laps and random licks on the tips didn\u2019t get much reaction. But when he sucked strongly and used his teeth, she thrashed beneath him. Normally by the time he\u2019d taken his lover to that point, he\u2019d back down and move to the next step in the seduction process. Not this time. He kept up his assault, immersing himself in the taste of her, the feel of her, taking her someplace new, no matter how long it took.</p><p>When he blew a cooling stream of air across the erect peaks and Ava trembled, he pushed her breasts together so closely her nipples almost touched. Tucking his knees beneath her armpits, he slid his shaft into the valley of her cleavage.</p><p>Her body bucked beneath his.</p><p>Chase groaned at the slickness of her skin and how hot it looked with the head of his cock fitted into the hollow of her throat. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to fuck your tits like this since the moment I saw them.\u201d He pulled out, then slowly slid back into the tight tunnel he\u2019d created, savoring the clasp of her flesh around his. He added another layer of sensation and pinched her nipples. \u201cCan you feel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSqueeze them together more. Like that. Touch my nipples harder,\u201d she panted. \u201cEven harder than that. You\u2019re not hurting me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He growled at the visual feast before him. Ava bound, at his mercy.</p><p>Chase rocked his hips faster, driving his cock against that pliant skin, pinching her nipples in time to his thrusts. When his balls lifted, his hands fell away and almost told her to open up and swallow him to the root. But he stopped.</p><p>Too soon. Not about you. About her. She needs this.</p> <p>Ava whimpered at the loss of contact.</p><p>He caressed her cheek as he leaned forward to grab his supplies off the nightstand. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. Incredible. Christ, Ava, you undo me.\u201d</p><p>She twisted in her bonds. \u201cI want\u2014\u201d</p><p>He placed his fingers over her lips. \u201cIn time. Now hold still.\u201d He scooted back until he straddled her pelvis. Holding open the old-fashioned, spring-loaded wooden clothespins, he simultaneously attached them to her nipples.</p><p>When she arched and emitted a surprised cry, he murmured, \u201cSeems you have some feeling there after all.\u201d He hopped off the end of the bed. Tapped her ankles. \u201cSpread your legs for me. Wider. Nope wider than that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChase\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, yoga girl, I know how flexible you are. Do it.\u201d</p><p>Her heels slid out until one hung off the bed.</p><p>He positioned himself in the space she\u2019d made. He placed an openmouthed kiss on her belly. On each hip. Then he released the clothespins for about ten seconds before he reattached them sideways, so the holes surrounded the tips.</p><p>Ava\u2019s cries became louder as he settled his mouth on her cunt. She was already drenched. He lapped her honey, pushing his tongue deep inside her, then retreating to trace the folds of her sex. Teasing the skin around her clit, but never coming into direct contact.</p><p>She bumped her pelvis, thrashing, her body begging.</p> <p>Pressing open the fleshy skin protecting that pleasure pearl, he licked. Delicately. Insistently. When her entire body stilled, he zeroed in on her clit and sucked continuously until her pussy contracted against his mouth.</p><p>As she came down, Chase scattered kisses up her torso and slid two fingers inside her hot channel, stroking the pillow of flesh on her inner vaginal wall. Then he quickly removed the clothespin from her left nipple, knowing the instant blood returned to the tip.</p><p>Ava jerked, whimpering, \u201cIt hurts, God, it\u2019s throbbing,\u201d and flat out shrieked when Chase sucked the distended nipple into the wet heat of his mouth.</p><p>She climaxed again suddenly. Violently.</p><p>He felt her orgasm pulsating on his tongue as he suckled her nipple. He felt it beneath his thumb as he strummed her clit. He felt it squeezing his fingers as he stroked the inside wall of her sheath. Every part of her body radiated the pleasure he\u2019d wrought from her, brought to her.</p><p>It was fucking hot as hell.</p><p>His impatient cock, hard as a fencepost for the last thirty minutes, poked into his abdomen, leaving a slick trail.</p><p>She twitched with aftershocks and Chase continued to pet her, stroke her. He kissed her temple. \u201cAva. I\u2019m gonna unhook you from the headboard.\u201d</p> <p>She rubbed her cheek against his and mumbled.</p><p>Once he had the belt undone and the bandana off, he put on a condom and patted her hip. \u201cSit up.\u201d</p><p>As soon as languorous Ava moved, he snagged a pillow and covered it with a towel. \u201cUp on your knees.\u201d Chase repositioned her, pressing a hand to the middle of her back. \u201cOn your elbows, so your chest is over the pillow.\u201d</p><p>Ava groaned. \u201cThe towel rubs on my nipple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I take off the other clothespin now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He kneed her legs apart to create a wider base. Taking himself in hand, he prodded the entrance to her pussy twice before sliding in halfway.</p><p>She automatically arched, trying to force him inside her fully, but Chase covered her body with his. Molding his belly to the soft curve of her ass, pressing the weight of his damp chest against her back, bracketing her arms with his. Boxing her in. Making her wait. She only had movement he allowed.</p><p>He pulled out and snapped his hips, plunging in to the root. Every thrust sent her tits swinging and rubbing over that cheap, nubby towel. Every thrust had her crying out. Every thrust brought Chase closer to detonation. He couldn\u2019t hold off. He didn\u2019t want to hold off. When his balls drew up, he hammered into her without pause. Burying his face between her shoulder blades, sucking in her scent with every ragged breath, he came in a hot, fast rush.</p><p>Just when Chase thought that burst of pleasure was over, he felt Ava\u2019s contractions start again. Despite his shaky stance, he reached between them and released the clothespin.</p><p>Ava bucked as he massaged the tender tip. Her whimper escalated when the blood rushed back to those tissues. He forced her to ride the line between pleasure and pain as her pussy pulsed around his cock.</p><p>Her elbows gave out and she fell forward.</p><p>Chase peppered her shoulder with kisses, giving her a second to find her equilibrium. A muffled sob escaped, snapping him from smug satisfaction. Panicked, he flipped her on her back, looming above her to see Ava...crying.</p><p>His gut clenched. \u201cAva? Baby? Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and more tears spilled free.</p><p>He tenderly swiped them away. \u201cThen what? Sweet thang, you\u2019re killin\u2019 me here.\u201d</p><p>She bit her trembling lip, turning her head toward the wall.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d When she didn\u2019t respond, he repeated, \u201cLook at me,\u201d more sharply.</p><p>Those breathtaking eyes connected with his, even as she blinked back tears.</p><p>\u201cGod. Don\u2019t cry. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one...\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cNo man has ever seen to me like that. Taken time and demanded patience from me. How did you know that\u2019s what I needed and wanted?\u201d</p><p>Relieved he hadn\u2019t somehow fucked this up by acting too domineering, Chase gave her a lingering smooch. \u201cHow did I know you needed more nipple stimulation?\u201d His intent to be flip vanished when he realized sharing the truth mattered more than touting his years of sexpertise. \u201cA combination of instinct and curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>Ava ran the back of her knuckles across his cheek. \u201cYou can tell me anything, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all my supposed sexual experience, I\u2019ve always been a taker in bed. No need to work for it when women were vying for a piece of me, vying to please me.\u201d</p><p>Although she didn\u2019t say a word, her eyes and her face echoed total understanding.</p><p>\u201cBut with you...from the start, even us just bein\u2019 friends, I demanded more because I wanted more. Not more to take, but more to give. You bring out something in me, Ava, a side of myself I never knew existed. It\u2019s scary shit. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And no.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d ever be passive in bed. You\u2019re so...inventive. And maybe this sexual aggressiveness feels new, but it\u2019s not new. It\u2019s part of your makeup that\u2019s been dormant.\u201d Her fingertips brushed his whiskers. \u201cI like it. I can\u2019t imagine you being any other way.\u201d</p><p>Humbled, Chase kissed her. Kept it light. Breezy. Not the passionate show of possession his head urged him to demonstrate.</p><p>Ava broke the kiss with a heartfelt sigh. \u201cSo what\u2019s on the agenda today before the rodeo starts?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m definitely thinking I need another ride.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cDone. You really needed a trim.\u201d Ava set the clippers on the table.</p><p>After she brushed the remnants of his hair off his shirt, Chase\u2019s hands circled her hipbones. Then he tugged her onto his lap. \u201cPut your hands back on my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no. It feels so damn good when you\u2019re touching me there.\u201d</p><p>The deep, raspy timbre of his voice rolled over her. Through her. She placed her palms on his cheeks and slowly slid them up the planes of his chiseled face. Once she reached his hairline, she let her nails scrape over his scalp. Slowly. Thoroughly. Losing herself in touching him at his invitation, without restriction. Loving how the stubbly hair felt beneath her palms and fingertips. Remembering how it felt gently scraping the inside of her thighs. Her belly. Her breasts.</p><p>Chase expelled a groaning sigh and pressed his soft, warm lips to the base of her throat. His mouth wandered south to the upper swell of her cleavage. He dragged his goatee across that tender flesh, adding in a lingering kiss here and there.</p><p>Ava\u2019s thighs tightened around his hips. She allowed her head to fall back, stroking his head as she pleased, wishing her hands could wander. But since Chase\u2019s touches never veered out of control, she followed his lead. One of these days she\u2019d step over the line and push him to unleash the wild man he attempted to control. For now, she\u2019d lose herself in his sweet need.</p><p>\u201cAva,\u201d he whispered thickly against her neck, below her ear.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re going to warn me we don\u2019t have time for this. But I don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna tell you to stop. I was gonna ask you pretty please to go get a condom.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and kissed his smirk. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>Sweaty and sore, Chase paced in front of the motel room. The pains and twinges in odd places served as a reminder he\u2019d gotten spoiled in the PBR. There was a world of difference in getting on one, two or three bulls over a three-day period, as opposed to PRCA riders, who climbed on one or two bulls each night. Sometimes for several nights running. This time of year shouldn\u2019t be called Cowboy Christmas, but Cowboy Hell.</p><p>He mopped his face with the bottom of his tank top and used his key card to open the door. The sight that greeted him? Ava, half-nekkid, her flexible body bent backward over her exercise ball, that mouth-watering pussy tempting him from between her toned thighs.</p><p>His aches and pains were forgotten. A new ache arose\u2014his cock instantly went hard.</p><p>Ava\u2019s strong, sexy abdominal muscles rippled as she elevated her torso. \u201cHey. Great timing. I just finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect timing.\u201d Chase dropped to his knees on the yoga mat between her feet. \u201cTake off your bottoms.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Recognition lit her eyes and a secretive smile appeared. \u201cReally, Chase? Right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m all sweaty. Can\u2019t I take a shower first?\u201d</p><p>He growled, \u201cNo. Seeing your hot, bendy body stretched out over that ball does it for me in a bad way.\u201d Using a single rough-edged fingertip, he leisurely traced the waistband of her yoga pants, low on her hips. But not nearly low enough. \u201cTake. Them. Off.\u201d</p><p>She stood and peeled the stretchy black fabric down her legs. She began to remove her bra, but he said, \u201cLeave it. Same position you were just in. Arched over the ball, hands on the floor behind you, feet on the floor, legs spread.\u201d</p><p>With effortless grace, Ava returned her body to its previous pose.</p><p>Goddamn she was beautiful like this. Not just her bared body, but also her willingness to cede control to him. His hands skated up the outside of her thighs, still trembling from her workout. Or were they trembling in anticipation? He palmed her hips and squeezed, stopping to stroke the sensitive sweep of flesh between her hipbones until goose flesh dotted her torso.</p><p>\u201cThis is weird. I can feel you but I can\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>Flattening his hands, Chase mapped her quads, his thumbs dragging along the inside of her thighs. He gripped her knees and lowered his head, placing his mouth on her.</p><p>Ava sighed.</p><p>Chase licked her slowly, savoring the salty tang of her sweat mixed with the musky sweetness of her pussy. That was the extent of his attention at first, his tongue created a repetitive path over the pink slit, from the wet entrance to her sex to the top of her mound. Each pass made her wetter, made that intimate flesh plumper, made her breathing more labored. Made him hotter. Harder.</p><p>He fucking loved this. He could spend hours, right here, testing her stamina, his control, and seeing how many times he could make her come with just his mouth.</p><p>His hands caressed her outer thighs up to where her leg became the curve of her ass. He loved this hidden, highly sensitive crease, loved that stroking it while lapping her pussy caused Ava to clench her ass cheeks and moan.</p><p>And still he feasted on her sex. Nipping, suckling, easing back to blow on her wet skin. With the stiffened tip of his tongue, he rimmed her pussy, from her entrance to her clit and back down the other side.</p><p>\u201cChase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood is rushing to my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I love to hear when I\u2019m eating my fill of this sweet, hot cunt.\u201d He shoved his tongue inside her until his teeth pressed into her flesh.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>Chase slid his thumb into her pussy the same time he jammed his tongue in deep. Fucking her with both. Trying to keep her still after she\u2019d begun bumping up her hips, which set the ball bouncing. But then she started thrashing too.</p><p>\u201cAva, darlin\u2019, hold still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Please. I\u2019m close.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping his thumb pressed in her clenching channel, he used his index finger and other thumb to separate the skin concealing her clit. Once he\u2019d exposed that swollen pearl, he flicked it with his tongue. No respite. No mercy. As soon as her abdomen and thighs went taut, he sucked directly on it.</p><p>Ava detonated. A hoarse cry split the air. Her body vibrated as her orgasm rocked through her and the blood-engorged tissues pulsed against his mouth.</p><p>Primal satisfaction roared inside him.</p><p>When she shuddered, her wail reverberated through the plastic ball. He wanted to do it again. And again. Bathe in her juices as he swallowed climax after climax. He kept nuzzling her, caressing her, gorging his senses on everything\u2014her taste, her scent, the feel of her body, the sound of her passion.</p><p>Her hands stroking his scalp brought him back to earth.</p><p>Whoa. He\u2019d never lost himself like that before. He\u2019d hit hazy white space of after orgasm bliss many times, but he\u2019d never reached it by giving pleasure rather than receiving.</p><p>Chase lifted his head, meeting her passion-glazed gaze, knowing his own eyes were closer to animal than man.</p><p>Ava\u2019s shaking fingers lovingly followed the shape of his face. From his scalp, over his forehead to the ridge of his eyebrows. Then down the slope of his nose and the jut of his cheekbones to the broad angle of his jaw.</p><p>He stood, bringing her to her feet, teasing her succulent mouth with flirty kisses. After toeing off his running shoes, he shucked his athletic shorts. \u201cKnow another yoga pose that drives me out of my mind with lust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDownward dog.\u201d He scraped his teeth along the cord in her neck, right by her racing pulse. \u201cMaybe I oughta call it downward doggie style. Assume the position.\u201d He released her and snatched a condom and the lube from the nightstand.</p><p>When he turned around, condom on and slicked up, and saw Ava\u2019s perfect ass in the air, he wanted to smack it. Bite it. Bury his cock in it.</p><p>Moving in behind her, his greedy gaze pursued the long, strong line of her spine. Resting her body weight on her hands caused the muscles in her triceps and biceps to stand out. His finger forged the same path as his eyes, but slipped past the sexy dimples above her ass, past her tailbone. Down the cleft of her ass. The tip of his finger swirled over the tight rosebud. \u201cAnother time, I\u2019m taking your ass like this. Clutching these sweet cheeks as I\u2019m pounding into you. Think you could hold the position, Ava Rose? While I\u2019m fucking your ass hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She arched, lifting her head.</p><p>Chase reached his ultimate destination, the entrance to her pussy. Oh yeah, Ava was still wet. He widened his stance, rubbing his stiff shaft up the slit of her sex, once, twice, three times, before plunging his cock in to the hilt.</p><p>He hissed at the immediate hot clasp of her vaginal walls and the suctioning pull as he retreated. Her innermost flesh stayed pliant as he rammed back in.</p><p>Chase closed his eyes for a moment, enjoying every single sensation. Sweat dripping down his back. Ava\u2019s taste still lingering on his tongue. His racing heart that sent blood sizzling through his veins. The feel of her firm butt cheeks beneath his fingertips. The cushiony mat beneath his feet. The sheer ecstasy at having this woman naked and willing any time he wanted. Any place. Any way.</p><p>\u201cChase? You okay? You sorta stopped moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust taking a breather before this.\u201d He surged into her. Slam. Withdraw. Slam. Withdraw. Slam.</p><p>She emitted a sexy groan.</p><p>He noticed Ava hadn\u2019t lifted her head. \u201cTell me what it looks like from that angle,\u201d he asked, not missing a single stroke.</p><p>\u201cHot as hell. No wonder you love to take me from behind, if this is what it looks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Chase picked up the pace, his hands slippery on her damp skin. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking turn on to bury my dick so far inside you it looks like we\u2019re one person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty poetic, McKay. God! Do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d He swiveled his hips when his cock was fully seated.</p><p>\u201cYes! Dammit, I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>She came again. Her body shaking, but she held position.</p><p>Which sent him soaring into the abyss. Pulse after pulse of his cock emptying set his limbs to quaking. His eyes rolled back in his head and pleasure swamped him.</p><p>When she groaned and said, \u201cI\u2019m getting a cramp,\u201d he roused himself from that happy place and pulled out.</p><p>She rolled up and gave him a contented look.</p><p>He grinned back at her. \u201cYou know, Hollywood. This yoga stuff ain\u2019t half bad.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>If the first two weeks they were together had been about friendship, the last two weeks had been about sex.</p><p>They still couldn\u2019t get enough of each other. They\u2019d spend all day traveling. Then they\u2019d fall on each other the second they were alone. Usually in their motel room, since Chase wasn\u2019t much on public displays of affection. But when that bedroom door closed? It was almost as if her body became an extension of his\u2014their bodies were never apart for very long, whether in rest, in sleep or in passion.</p><p>The passion between them...one for the record books. Ava had never been in such an explosive sexual relationship. She\u2019d known Chase\u2019s sexuality was an innate part of him, but she\u2019d never understood it was such an innate part of her too.</p><p>Yet, for as addictive as their lovemaking had become, the friendship part of their relationship hadn\u2019t changed. They never ran out of things to talk about. Silly things. Serious things. She never had to guess Chase\u2019s feelings on anything. He threw them out boldly and without apology. The silences between them weren\u2019t awkward, demanding conversation.</p><p>What she wouldn\u2019t give for some silence right now. Total silence. She sighed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s about the fifteenth time you\u2019ve sighed in the last five minutes. What\u2019s wrong now?\u201d</p><p>Rather than let it go again, she snapped, \u201cDo you have to eat those stupid sunflower seeds every damn time we get in the truck?\u201d</p><p>Chase said, \u201cYup,\u201d then spit the spent seeds into his discard cup.</p><p>Rattle the bag. Fill his mouth with seeds. Crack the seeds. Spit out the empty shells. Repeat. Sometimes for six hundred miles.</p><p>It drove Ava fucking insane.</p><p>Sure, it was Chase\u2019s truck. But if she had to listen to Mr. Chipmunk Cheeks enjoying his nuts for the next three hours, she might do something rash, and rude, and violent to his nuts.</p><p>Needing a distraction, she flipped on the radio, scrolling through static until she found a station that played decent music. Her bare toes tapped in time to Lady GaGa\u2019s \u201cPoker Face\u201d as she resituated herself and her laptop.</p><p>Click. Off went the radio.</p><p>Ava didn\u2019t demand he turn it back on. She just reached over and did it herself.</p><p>\u201cShut that shit off,\u201d Mr. Chipmunk Cheeks said around a mouthful of seeds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna hear music, listen to your damn iPod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you my ear buds broke, but you couldn\u2019t be bothered to stop so I could pick up a new pair. So deal with it.\u201d</p><p>He sighed with utter exasperation. \u201cYou can have the radio on if you find a country music station.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she sneered. \u201cI hate that whining, puntastic drivel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd \u2018Poker Face\u2019 is what? Pure musical artistry?\u201d Chase sneered right back.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Ava cranked the music a notch higher.</p> <p>He turned it back down. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to piss me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling is mutual.\u201d</p><p>How had they survived these last two weeks?</p><p>Wait a second. Hadn\u2019t Chase told her he\u2019d rarely made it past the two-week mark with any lover? Maybe this was how he intended to end it. By picking fights.</p><p>But you started it. Be the bigger person and let it go.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I had your damn camera pointed at you right now so you could see your diva side, a side which you claim ain\u2019t there, because darlin\u2019, it sure as hell is.\u201d Spit. Spit.</p><p>That smart comment totally screwed him for her being the bigger person. \u201cI wish I had my damn camera pointed at you right now so you could see how ridiculous you look with your mouth crammed full of sunflower seeds,\u201d she mimicked. \u201cOoh, and the bonus? You\u2019d get to hear how fucking irritating it is when you spit them out.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her with sunflower seeds all over his teeth.</p><p>\u201cEww. Gross, Chase, shut your mouth. That\u2019s nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just bein\u2019 mean.\u201d He rolled down the window and emptied his overflowing seed cup.</p><p>Great. Now when he spit out his spent seeds she\u2019d hear a ping against the paper cup after the pa-tooey spitting sound.</p> <p>Next pee break Ava was buying barbecue-flavored CornNuts. The crunch and the smell would be the ultimate payback. \u201cWhen are we stopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I need to fill up. Why? You gotta use the bathroom again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bladder is different than yours. Plus. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d When he offered her his bag of seeds, she almost grabbed it and chucked it out the window. Which he knew, if the smirk on his face was any indication. \u201cI want real food.\u201d</p><p>Chase snorted. \u201cDefine real food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething that is not battered and deep fat fried. A fresh garden salad with spinach and arugula and butter lettuce, bursting with crunchy vegetables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a salad yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had chopped iceberg lettuce with a few carrot shavings and one cherry tomato\u2014that is not a salad. And since when is a cup of fruit cocktail topped with sliced bananas considered a side of fruit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince always. I can pull over and you can forage for fresh crunchy greens in the ditch if you like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh shut up. Now who\u2019s being mean?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cLook, it sucks that it annoys you, but do you want to know why I need sunflower seeds when I\u2019m on the road?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d really piss him off if she didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>Even when you are dying to know?</p><p>Dammit. \u201cFine. Why do you need sunflower seeds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I used to chew tobacco. Goin\u2019 from event to event, I was chewing a can of Copenhagen a day. When my usage inched up to nearly a can and a half a day? I knew I had a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sunflower seeds helped you quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst I got a prescription for Chantrix. Then I started on the seeds. It\u2019s been three years since I quit and I still fucking crave chew. Especially when I\u2019m on a long drive. And I\u2019m usually by myself, so I don\u2019t give a shit about how obnoxious it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you quit chewing, because it\u2019s a disgusting habit.\u201d She shuddered, thinking of all the cowboys she\u2019d watched spitting all the damn time. \u201cBut you\u2019re telling me to suck it up as far as your need for seed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>Ava cooed, \u201cWell, darlin\u2019, I say the same to you as far as the music. Suck it up.\u201d She turned the music a hair louder and refocused on the task on her computer, separating pictures and video snippets into appropriate folders.</p><p>Talk about a long, silent, uncomfortable drive.</p><p>Because they were hitting another rodeo in Montana that started at noon the next day, they wouldn\u2019t need a motel room since they\u2019d\u2014she\u2019d\u2014be driving straight through the night.</p><p>Chase parked in the far corner of the lot. He faced her. \u201cYou\u2019re not coming to tape my rides?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better rest up for the drive.\u201d She might actually be able to sleep without Mr. Chipmunk Cheeks\u2019 constant chomping.</p><p>He cleaned up the mess on his side and pulled out a sun shield that fit the entire windshield. \u201cKeep the windows cracked for air. Be glad it ain\u2019t a hundred degrees today. Need anything else before I take off?\u201d</p><p>A kiss so I know there\u2019s no real hard feelings between us.</p><p>But for some stupid reason, pride probably, she couldn\u2019t ask for it. She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cLock the doors,\u201d he warned and he was gone.</p><p>Don\u2019t obsess. You\u2019re together all day, every day. This was bound to happen sooner or later.</p><p>Sighing, Ava snagged her pillow, donned her eye mask and drifted to sleep in blessed non-nut-cracking silence.</p><p>And she must\u2019ve slept hard because the next thing she knew, Chase gently jostled her awake. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>She sat up and blinked at him, standing just inside the passenger door in the glow of the interior light. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost ten. Ran late because of some annual local awards that took damn near forty-five minutes before the bull ridin\u2019 started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRode the first one. Bucked off the second. Didn\u2019t place.\u201d He unzipped his vest.</p><p>She automatically touched his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens.\u201d When Chase unhooked his chaps, Ava noticed he winced. He seemed to be taking a long time getting upright.</p><p>\u201cHow hard did you hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t the buck off that hurt. It was the damn hoof to the ribs and the hoof to my right thigh.\u201d</p><p>Ava scooted to the end of the bench seat and started on his buttons. \u201cLemme see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Chase eased his shirt aside.</p><p>A huge bruise was already forming along the inside curve of his rib cage. \u201cOh, baby. Look at you.\u201d Her fingers traced the welt in the center of the bruise. \u201cIs the rib cracked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Sore as hell. Gonna hurt like a bitch to ride tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say Don\u2019t ride because he would anyway. She leaned forward to kiss him. To stroke him. To give him the TLC he needed. \u201cPretend I\u2019m kissing your owie.\u201d</p><p>He smiled against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat else can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis... You...\u201d He struggled and finally sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re all I need right now, Ava.\u201d Chase returned her kiss with such sweetness she felt tears prickle behind her lids. Mr. Tough Guy wasn\u2019t always so tough. She really loved that he had no problem showing her his softer, needier side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dead on my feet,\u201d Chase said. \u201cCan we hit the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in. I\u2019ll load up your gear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me, Chase, you\u2019re beat to shit. Just get in the damn truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d programmed the GPS and they were on track to the Big Sky Rodeo, she glanced over at Chase.</p><p>His normally bright eyes were dulled by pain. \u201cWill you wake me if you get sleepy?\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr help yourself to my sunflower seeds. God knows when I eat them they keep you awake. And usually pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d Ava brought his rough knuckles to her lips. \u201cGo to sleep, cowboy. I\u2019ve got your back.\u201d</p><p>And the next time she looked over at him, he was sound asleep.</p><p>About five hours into the drive, when Ava had a hard time keeping her eyes open, she reluctantly reached for the bag of sunflower seeds.</p><p>He\u2019d never let her live it down.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>\u201cYou know, for claiming you wanted to see the countryside, you\u2019re spending a lot of time looking at your computer.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s fingers stopped clicking on the keyboard. \u201cIf you wanted a conversation, Sundance, all you had to do was ask,\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>Clickety-clackety. Musical tones sounded, indicating she\u2019d shut down her computer. She stowed it and turned sideways in the seat to stare at him. Glare at him most likely. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond words,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But I didn\u2019t mention your computer work again because I needed conversation. I just hate to see you missing out on this scenery.\u201d</p><p>Finally she looked out the window. \u201cOh. Wow.\u201d</p><p>The Big Horn Mountains stretched along the left side, long rolling prairie on the right. The scale of the area was deceiving. They\u2019d drive toward those mountains for another forty-five minutes before they even reach the base.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m surprised to see snow on mountaintops in July.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are about thirteen thousand feet so you\u2019d have to climb up awful damn far to get a handful of the stuff. But it\u2019s pretty here. One of my favorite places in Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, why don\u2019t you still live in Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did for a while. In a junky old trailer between my folks\u2019 place and Quinn\u2019s house. PBR events are spread out across the country, and I started flying more. Air travel ain\u2019t cheap\u2014\u201d he smirked, \u201c\u2014unless you\u2019ve got a private jet at your disposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never let me live that down, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Anyway, since Denver is a hub, me\u2019n a couple of guys rent a three-bedroom apartment close to the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre the other guys bull riders?\u201d</p><p>Chase shook his head. \u201cDylan is a pilot. He\u2019s all over the place. Lance is a troubleshooter for a computer software company. None of us are ever there at the same time. It works well because we\u2019re all at the same point in our careers. We basically needed a place to crash, store our stuff and park our cars when we\u2019re on the road.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d you meet? Since you all have diverse occupations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI graduated from high school with Lance and he met Dylan through a friend.\u201d When Ava remained quiet, he said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She reached for his hand and threaded her fingers through his. \u201cIs that where you were before you decided to hide out at Ginger and Kane\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>Yeah. And I felt like a fucking loser the entire time. Sitting alone in a place as impersonal as another damn hotel room. Wishing I could go home, but feeling like I didn\u2019t have one. Didn\u2019t have anyone I could really talk to either. Not like I\u2019ve learned to talk to you.</p><p>Rather that share that embarrassing memory, he brought her hand to his mouth and kissed her knuckles. \u201cSmart and beautiful. How did I get so lucky?\u201d</p><p>Ava laughed. \u201cAnd wily, because you\u2019re avoiding the question, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I ain\u2019t the only one who avoids questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeaning...why won\u2019t you tell me what you\u2019re working on so diligently? Since you spend hours on it.\u201d</p><p>She gazed out the window. \u201cI\u2019m keeping a lid on it because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never attempted. Being the paranoid type, I\u2019m not sure it doesn\u2019t suck. So, it is an ego thing, with a little superstition\u2014talking about a project while it\u2019s in incubation stage\u2014thrown in to make it really mysterious.\u201d She sent him a coquettish glance. \u201cPlus it wouldn\u2019t do to expose all my secrets to you, McKay. You might get bored with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHighly unlikely that\u2019ll ever happen.\u201d Chase slowed and took the exit ramp for the Ranchester turnoff, pulling to the shoulder past the stop sign. Then he scooted from behind the steering wheel and said, \u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d hauling Ava onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cChase! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting me some sugar.\u201d He curled his hands around her neck and brought her mouth to his for a kiss. Nibbling on her lips, he let his thumbs stroke the strong, sexy line of her jaw. When she expelled that sweet sigh of surrender, he swept his tongue into her mouth. The kiss was a hot mix of teasing licks, shared breath and the wet glide of firm lips on soft. This unhurried kiss wasn\u2019t a prelude to anything else. Too often when the sexual heat exploded between them, they couldn\u2019t wait to get to the naked part, ending this deep connection. Which was a shame, because while the sex rocked his world, this stirred his soul.</p><p>He slipped his lips down to smooch her chin, then placed a very soft kiss on the side of her throat.</p> <p>Ava\u2019s head fell back and she whispered, \u201cGod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He set her back in her seat and slid back behind the wheel. About a minute later, Ava reached for his hand and squeezed.</p><p>The road up the Big Horns was long and flat\u2014to a point. Then it became a twisty maze of switchbacks as the road ascended. When they finally reached Sand Turn, he found a spot in the parking lot, which was crowded, most vehicles with out-of-state license plates.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re there already?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. Greybull is on the other side, but this is a cool spot. The view is great, so grab your cameras.\u201d</p><p>Heat beat down, but being so high up, a constant breeze stirred the air, bringing the scent of sun warmed pine and chalky dust. Amazing didn\u2019t begin to describe the view; you could see for two hundred miles. The sky was a watered-down blue, causing the thin clouds floating by to disappear into the endless horizon like ghostly vapors.</p><p>Once they stood by the rock ledge, Ava grabbed his arm. \u201cThis is magnificent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned against the wall and alternated between watching people and watching Ava. They\u2019d stopped frequently over the last few weeks so she could film scenery that struck her fancy. Ava behind a camera lens was a different Ava. Focused. Patient. Intent. Her voice even had a more authoritative tone, not the usual soft lilt reminiscent of a Southern belle.</p><p>She shot a lot of footage, but she never showed him the results of her hours of labor or asked his opinion on her next subject. She could spend hours marveling at tiny pink flowers blooming alongside a mud puddle. Or an animal track. One afternoon she even taped a beetle climbing a yucca spike for an hour before he forced her away.</p><p>Her reaction boggled him. He\u2019d expected a privileged woman like Ava to become bored quickly. When in fact, he\u2019d gotten bored a helluva lot sooner than she had.</p><p>She\u2019d become so intent on zooming in on the variance in colors of the canyon walls she nearly missed the big launch. \u201cAva, there\u2019s a hang glider about to take off on your far right side.\u201d</p><p>Immediately she spun and refocused. Holding on to the bars of the metal cage, the guy raced to the edge of the cliff until he ran out of ground. A collective gasp echoed as he successfully cleared the first group of pine trees. It was bizarre, seeing a hang glider from the top, not from beneath. The glider caught a thermal and began to climb.</p><p>Ava\u2019s tendency to film reaction to events, rather than just the event itself, amused him. While she had the camera pointed at the sky, he also knew the spectators on the ledge were within her view.</p><p>He braced himself for when she aimed her lens at him.</p><p>\u201cSo, ever had a desire to hang glide? Skydive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kiddin\u2019 me? That kinda dangerous stuff can kill ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the man who makes his living climbing on the back of two thousand pounds of pissed-off bull.\u201d</p><p>Chase grinned. \u201cDanger is all in the perspective, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Ava shut off her camera and they walked to the truck. \u201cI suppose so. But you\u2019d never catch me doing either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you\u2019d be the daredevil type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. I\u2019m more the Chicken Little type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. It is daring to leave the comforts of your cushy lifestyle. Hit the road with a guy you barely knew. Immerse yourself in way of life you didn\u2019t know existed. Few women would start this journey, let alone embrace it fully, let alone enjoy it without restriction. I find that amazing. I find you amazing.\u201d</p><p>And for once, he\u2019d stunned her into total silence.</p><p>Following slow-moving campers down the narrow, twisting road into the valley put them behind schedule, so Chase\u2019s anxiety was high when they finally reached the Greybull rodeo grounds. \u201cI called yesterday and made reservations at Sleepy Time cabins.\u201d He pointed. \u201cRight over there.\u201d</p><p>Ava pecked him on the mouth. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>The contestant line wasn\u2019t long. He paid his entry fee and headed to the designated area. At some smaller Wyoming rodeos, sponsors fed the competitors behind the chutes in the sponsor tents and Chase was starving. No sign of food.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Ryan or Taz yet. The thought of waiting around, striking up a conversation with someone he\u2019d have to lie to about who he was didn\u2019t sit well with him.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s a sign you should be done with this.</p><p>Chase had his phone out to text Ava, when he heard, \u201cChase?\u201d He spun around and was face to face with his cousin Tell.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Tell wore the black-and-white-striped vest designating him a PRCA judge. His cousin tried to grab Chase in one of those awkward man hugs, but Chase didn\u2019t want to draw more attention to them, so he smiled and thrust out his hand. \u201cFancy meeting you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could say the same. Thought my eyes were playin\u2019 tricks on me. Man, you look different. Good, but...wow. I almost didn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d</p><p>Chase gave Tell a once-over and whistled. \u201cLookit you. All official and judge-like. \u2019Bout damn time. Uncle Casper can\u2019t throw a shit fit that you\u2019re off to the rodeo, bein\u2019s he ain\u2019t in charge no more.\u201d</p><p>Tell smirked. \u201cAnd life is good because of it. Brandt is so over the moon happy these days, he don\u2019t mind if I take off because he has Jessie has to help out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Brandt and Jessie are doin\u2019 good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Me\u2019n Dalton tease them endlessly about acting all newlywed starry-eyed and shit, but after what they\u2019ve been through, hell, after what we\u2019ve all been through with Luke and now Mom and Dad, no one deserves happiness more than them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s gaze landed on the piece of paper sticking out of Chase\u2019s duffel bag that served as his contestant number. He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re competing in this rodeo? I didn\u2019t see your name listed anywhere.\u201d</p><p>As a supposed star of the PBR, the rodeo promoters would\u2019ve made a huge deal out of Chase McKay\u2019s appearance at the tiny rodeo, hoping to increase attendance.</p><p>\u201cI thought the PBR discouraged their top fifty riders from competing in PRCA events,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>\u201cManagement hasn\u2019t ever come right out and said Don\u2019t do it, but that don\u2019t mean it ain\u2019t heavily implied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re rebelling?\u201d Tell shook his head. \u201cWhy am I not surprised? Good thing I\u2019m not judging bull ridin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Chase shuffled his feet. \u201cAbout that. There\u2019s something you oughta know. It\u2019s kind of a funny story.\u201d He relayed his double life as Bill Chase.</p><p>Laid-back Tell vanished. His eyes narrowed and he looked so much like his dead brother Luke that Chase had a serious case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. \u201cLemme get this straight. You\u2019ve been a fraudulent member of the PRCA...for twelve years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You got a pro card under false pretenses. Competed under false pretenses. Took money under false pretenses. Is that about right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long you been double-dipping in PRCA events? All along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just the last few weeks after my suspension from the PBR tour. I didn\u2019t see the harm. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m in it for the money. In fact, I haven\u2019t spent a dime of the payouts I won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the fuckin\u2019 point,\u201d Tell retorted hotly. \u201cThis is just another example of the almighty Chase McKay thinking he don\u2019t have to play by the rules. How cheating is somehow all right if it benefits you in the end. Well, fuck that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d never seen Tell so mad. And what sucked is Chase didn\u2019t blame him for his fury because Tell hadn\u2019t said a thing that Chase hadn\u2019t considered.</p><p>But you discarded the guilt and did what you wanted anyway, didn\u2019t you?</p><p>\u201cLook. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGoddamn right you should be. Does your family know you\u2019ve done this?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Tell let the pause linger. \u201cBecause you know it\u2019s wrong. They\u2019d tell you it\u2019s wrong, and they\u2019d kick your ass until you made it right. I look at you and I feel like I don\u2019t know you at all.\u201d Tell stormed off, stopping when he reached the metal fence by the livestock gate. His fingers curled around the rail and he stared across the arena, his posture vibrated with anger.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t Chase considered he might run into his cousin while skipping from event to event in Tell\u2019s jurisdiction?</p><p>Because once again you only thought about yourself.</p> <p>Seemed to be a theme.</p><p>Chase slumped against the corral and waited for the impending ass-chewing from his upstanding, do-the-right-thing younger cousin. He glanced at the clock. The longest his diatribe could last would be forty-five minutes until the rodeo kicked off.</p><p>Tell walked back to him, a grim set to his mouth. \u201cFirst off, I wish I wasn\u2019t wearin\u2019 this damn vest because I\u2019d love nothin\u2019 better than to knock your dumb ass right in the dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut since that ain\u2019t the smartest option, we\u2019ll go with the other one.\u201d Tell paused. \u201cWithdraw from the competition.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped. \u201cWhat? No. I drove a long damn way. I need to get on some bulls tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTough shit. This is how it\u2019s gonna be. Either you voluntarily withdraw or I will report you to the head judge and you\u2019ll be disqualified anyway.\u201d</p><p>Without thinking, Chase snapped, \u201cJesus, Tell, judging power gone to your head or what? Why would you do that to me?\u201d</p><p>Tell loomed over him because he knew it drove Chase bat-shit crazy. \u201cTo you? This ain\u2019t only about you. I won\u2019t turn a blind eye to this and get myself banned as a judge. I\u2019ve worked too damn hard. Now that I know that you\u2019ve been lying and cheating puts me at more risk than you, do you understand that?\u201d</p><p>The truth tumbled down on him like a load of bricks. Was he really so single-minded he\u2019d risk destroying his cousin\u2019s future in the PRCA just so he could get on another bull?</p><p>No. Fuck no. And it made his cheeks burn with shame and his gut churn that he\u2019d even considered it. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. Christ, Tell, I\u2019m a sorry son of a bitch sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll withdraw from the competition right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that. And while it was good to see you, since you can\u2019t be bothered to come home very often, part of me wishes I hadn\u2019t laid eyes on you.\u201d Tell walked away without looking back.</p> <p>Chase dragged ass as he trudged back to the check-in table. The secretary agreed to remove his name from the roster, but the fee was nonrefundable.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>Find Ava and get the hell outta Dodge.</p><p>As he\u2019d started typing another text message, he heard his name shouted and Ryan fell into step with him.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re going the wrong way. The contestant area is back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not competing tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ryan frowned. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Lie. \u201cI\u2019m burned-out and my shoulder is acting up. I thought it\u2019d be okay to ride, but it\u2019s not, so I changed my mind and withdrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s head snapped up to see a slow grin spreading across the kid\u2019s face. \u201cI might actually have a shot at winning tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you keep your chin down, which wouldn\u2019t be an issue if you\u2019d wear a freakin\u2019 helmet.\u201d</p><p>Another scowl. \u201cNo way. It\u2019d throw my balance off. Just because it works for you don\u2019t mean it\u2019ll work for me, so quit nagging me about it. Sheesh. You ain\u2019t my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta rethink that smartass comment, since my ridin\u2019 percentage is over eighty after I made the switch and yours ain\u2019t close to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRub it in, why doncha,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cAre you at least staying to watch? In case I do win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last fuckin\u2019 thing I wanna do tonight is sit up in the goddamn stands,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>Ryan froze. His cheeks flamed and he ducked his head, hiding his face beneath his cowboy hat. \u201cOh. Okay. Ah, I\u2019ll catch ya later I guess.\u201d The he spun on his heel and was gone.</p><p>Nice going. Maybe you can knock a toddler\u2019s ice cream cone in the dirt too.</p><p>In his foul mood, it didn\u2019t take long to reach the cabins.</p><p>Three soft knocks broke her concentration. She glanced up from the computer screen as Chase said, \u201cAva. Let me in.\u201d</p><p>She leapt up to disengage the locks. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Chase sauntered in and set his hat on the dresser before he plopped into the lone chair in the room. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran into my cousin Tell. He\u2019s a judge for saddle bronc and bareback. He wondered why I was here, I told him the truth. Then he spewed every shitty thing about me sneaking around the PRCA circuit, which ain\u2019t anything I haven\u2019t already been wrestling with since I started this trip.\u201d</p><p>First time he\u2019d mentioned feeling any guilt.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cLong story short, Tell demanded I quit the event or he\u2019d report me. I understand where he\u2019s coming from. It\u2019ll be his ass if anyone finds out he knew I\u2019d been lying to the PRCA about bein\u2019 Bill Chase. So I dropped out of the competition. Then I ran into Ryan, and he\u2019s confident he has a shot at winning tonight since I\u2019m not competing. He begged me to watch him ride and I was a dick, which is just fuckin\u2019 awesome, because for the millionth time in my life I used my shitty mood as an excuse to be a douchebag to someone who didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Hard, to watch him struggle, but Ava knew from past experience Chase wasn\u2019t in the frame of mind to be petted and soothed.</p><p>That\u2019s when she knew for sure it was more than just sex between road buddies as they killed a couple of weeks during a lost summer. That\u2019s when she realized she was completely in love with him. His opening up to her, letting her see the man who struggled, who cared what people who he cared about thought of him, not just the charming bull rider with carefully crafted PC answers, not just the determined lover, but the real Chase McKay.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have any beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He sighed again. \u201cJust as well. Makes me think it\u2019s time to pack it in and cut the rest of this adventure short.\u201d</p><p>Outwardly Ava managed a bland expression, but inside she panicked. She wasn\u2019t ready to end this. Not now that she\u2019d cemented how she felt about him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been ridin\u2019 better than I have in years. I\u2019m ready to go back to the PBR.\u201d He expelled a bitter laugh. \u201cBut that ain\u2019t up to me, is it?\u201d</p><p>Ava sauntered over and straddled his thighs.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting me some sugar,\u201d she mimicked his husky drawl and swooped in for a kiss. The same type of soul kiss he\u2019d bestowed in the truck that literally left her breathless. After she\u2019d thoroughly scrambled his brain, she whispered kisses beneath his jaw. \u201cThe way I see it, we have two choices for tonight. We can lock the door and engage in wild, kinky, loud sex all night. Or we can go to the rodeo. Cheer Ryan on. Drink beer. Get rowdy. Do all the fun stuff as spectators that you don\u2019t get to do behind the chutes. I\u2019ve been to several rodeos with you, Chase, but we\u2019ve never gone to a rodeo together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, we\u2019ve already paid for the room, so we might as well stay. And if you\u2019re serious about no more PRCA events, you should hang out with Ryan one last time. He\u2019d appreciate it. Especially after your dickish behavior.\u201d</p><p>Chase rested his forehead against her chest. \u201cOkay. You\u2019ve convinced me.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping her arms around his neck, she rubbed her chin across the stubbly hair on his head, loving their wordless connection.</p><p>\u201cHow soon do you need to be back in California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we leave here tomorrow, you wanna head to Yellowstone for a few days? No rodeo, just you\u2019n me playing tourist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He slapped her butt. \u201cI\u2019m gonna grab a soda out of the vending machine. Want one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>The phone call from Marnie deflated her good mood. She debated on answering, but she\u2019d rather get it over with because she\u2019d been expecting\u2014dreading\u2014this call for days. \u201cHey, Marnie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva, dear, I have news. The Richfield casting agency has gotten you a reading for a new sitcom.\u201d</p><p>At least Marnie never made small talk. \u201cIs this for a pilot?\u201d There was no guarantee a pilot would be picked up by any TV network and she considered auditioning a waste of time.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a pilot. It\u2019s already been approved and will air on the CW as a mid-season show. Granted, it has a limited episode run, but that works in our favor.\u201d</p><p>Say no.</p><p>Say yes, you idiot. Haven\u2019t you had enough time tooling around the countryside with Chase? You need to get back to your real life.</p><p>\u201cAva, sweetie, are you still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Sorry. Thanks, but I\u2019ll pass on this one.\u201d God. Was she making a mistake? How much would Marnie have to cajole her to get her to cave in?</p><p>A lot. She wasn\u2019t ready to walk away from Chase yet.</p><p>\u201cWell. I wasn\u2019t expecting that. However, it\u2019s your decision. I\u2019ll figure out a way to decline the audition, although, you should know I really put myself out there for you, Ava.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, that is your job. Take care.\u201d And she hung up as Chase entered the room.</p><p>\u201cWho was on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah.\u201d Fibbing didn\u2019t feel right, but Chase would insist she go back to LA. Even when he wasn\u2019t the only reason she\u2019d said no. Her gaze flicked to her laptop. She\u2019d made progress on her project and hoped to have something tangible to show Chase in the next week, especially since he\u2019d mentioned her secretiveness about it today.</p> <p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But save the soda for later. Right now I need a beer.\u201d</p><p>At the rodeo grounds they scarfed down Indian tacos and drank beer. They chose seats at the top of the bleachers, away from the main crowd.</p><p>Chase watched her digging in her bag. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you brought your cameras.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cinematography efforts haven\u2019t been solely focused on you, you know.\u201d She wanted to video Ryan\u2019s ride. The long angle from the stands would be a nice contrast to the rest of the footage she\u2019d shot.</p> <p>She fiddled with the zoom function. Looky there. Two well-endowed buckle bunnies, with puffy blonde hair, and skin-tight jeans waiting for cowboys. \u201cAre these painted chickies your type?\u201d She held the camera close so he could check them out.</p><p>\u201cThey were my type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve taken them both on at once?\u201d</p><p>Chase looked at her evenly. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about my past, Ava. Why the questions now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just curious if your preference for girl-on-girl action is out of your system or if...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf some night I\u2019ll bring another woman into our bed and expect you to be all right with getting down and dirty with her just to please me?\u201d</p> <p>His emphasis on our bed sounded permanent. She didn\u2019t focus on that, just offered him a shrug. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Then Chase was right in her face. \u201cI\u2019d never demand something from you that makes you uncomfortable. And no one, man or woman, gets to put their hands on you, because in case you haven\u2019t noticed? When it comes to you? I. Don\u2019t. Fucking. Share.\u201d</p><p>A tingle heated her blood at his blatant possessiveness.</p><p>\u201cAny other questions?\u201d he asked in that rough rasp.</p><p>\u201cAh, no. I\u2019m good.\u201d Ava\u2019s attempts at taping the rodeo events were half-assed because she kept sneaking looks at Chase. The man she loved. And where her eye went, her camera lens followed.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWill you please get that goddamn thing outta my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut yours is such a gorgeous face, beyond compare really. Broody. Masculine. Sexy with that perpetual five o\u2019clock shadow. I love how your hat shades your eyes. And when you\u2019re a little pissy, that muscle along your jawbone jumps and I just wanna sink my teeth into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can compliment you if I want, McKay, so suck it up.\u201d</p><p>Chase laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou know, as I\u2019ve been taping your handsome self, I realized I have the perfect job for you if you don\u2019t get a call back from the PBR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMovie and TV stunt man.\u201d</p><p>Chase turned and looked at her as if she\u2019d lost her mind.</p><p>\u201cI know some people in the business, if you\u2019re interested. I can hook you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it escaped your notice that I\u2019m a little on the short side of, oh, not bein\u2019 tall, dark and handsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, I\u2019m usually too busy staring and drooling over all those eye-popping muscles of yours to worry if you measure up, because you\u2019re beyond any standard scale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many beers have you had to get so much honey to drip outta your sweet mouth?\u201d</p><p>She knocked into him with her shoulder. \u201cYou are forgetting a couple of key points, Mr. Negative.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Pollyanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost guys in Hollywood are short. These days few guys are as big as the old action stars like Dolph Lundgren and Arnold Schwartzeneger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What about Vin Diesel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t distract me by making me name specific actors who don\u2019t hit the six foot mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a solid five inches below the six foot benchmark, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlls I\u2019m saying is you could find work if you wanted to switch your occupation.\u201d Then she looked away.</p><p>Chase curled his hand around her jaw, forcing her to meet his blue gaze. \u201cAnd where would I live if I relocated to LA?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cWith me.\u201d</p><p>A couple of seconds passed before he kissed her hard. Twice. \u201cI\u2019ll take it under consideration.\u201d He slipped his hand into hers and tugged her closer. \u201cNow can we watch the damn rodeo?\u201d</p><p>When bull riding started, he gave her space to tape.</p><p>Taz stayed on and ended up with a score of eighty. Two other riders reached the eight-second mark but scored below seventy-nine. Three riders hit the dirt and Ryan was up next.</p><p>Chase got a little fidgety when the gate opened and Ryan and the bull burst into the arena. \u201cCome on,\u201d Chase said under his breath. \u201cFollow his switch. That\u2019s it. Just a little longer... Yes!\u201d He whistled loudly and faced Ava. \u201cThat\u2019s about an eighty-two point ride.\u201d</p><p>Ryan won. He looked ready to cry, vomit and pass out\u2014all at the same time. But he managed to keep his cool at the ceremony when the sponsors awarded the belt buckle, the check and the piece of artwork painted on deerskin that detailed how Greybull had gotten its name.</p><p>When the crowd of well-wishers thinned out, Chase and Ava approached him. Ryan was so pumped he picked Ava up and spun her in a circle, oblivious to Chase\u2019s warning growls.</p><p>\u201cThanks for comin\u2019! I wish my mom coulda been here to see me win, but she promised to come to the event next week in North Platte.\u201d</p><p>Chase offered his hand, forcing Ryan to release Ava. \u201cCongrats. That was an excellent ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst time I ever felt I coulda ridden a bull all night. Man. It was awesome.\u201d He squinted at Ava\u2019s bag. \u201cDid you tape it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I wasn\u2019t close, so I don\u2019t know how good it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you email it to me so I can show my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, what\u2019s your email address?\u201d</p><p>He scrawled it on a napkin and handed it to her. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou in the mood to celebrate?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah. I met a couple of girls earlier and they\u2019re taking me to a party.\u201d</p><p>Only Ava noticed the brief flash of disappointment on Chase\u2019s face that Ryan already had plans.</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun.\u201d He clapped Ryan on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s been great getting to know you, Ryan, and good luck the rest of the season.\u201d</p><p>Ryan looked confused. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re saying goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He reached for Ava\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving tomorrow morning for R&amp;R in Yellowstone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are competing in North Platte next weekend, right?\u201d</p><p>Chase shook his head. \u201cBill Chase has retired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...it\u2019s the rodeo closest to my hometown. I thought we could hang out. You could meet my mom.\u201d</p><p>Ava couldn\u2019t stand to see Ryan\u2019s distress. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the week plays out and he\u2019ll call you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He was about to say something else, when two girls raced to his side. The brunette said, \u201cThere you are! We\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d The trio got caught up in conversation, leaving Chase and Ava staring after him.</p><p>\u201cSo now that Ryan has blown us off, is your offer for wild, kinky, loud sex still on the table?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Chase\u2019s phone buzzed on the seat.</p><p>Ava picked it up and read the text. Where are you? She sighed. \u201cHow many times has Ryan texted you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a dozen. Kid\u2019s just a little anxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019s afraid you won\u2019t show up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what he\u2019s told me, that\u2019s been a common occurrence and I don\u2019t wanna be another guy who disappoints him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan does realize how far out of our way this event is?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cSome other place you need to be today, Hollywood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But ten hours in the car is a long haul. Even for old road dogs like us.\u201d</p><p>Chase laughed. \u201cAdmit it. You\u2019d had your fill of nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe forever.\u201d</p><p>On their Yellowstone trip, they\u2019d spent one night in Cody, checking out the museums, strolling through the town, but they skipped the rodeo. Then they\u2019d driven around Yellowstone for the next three days. He\u2019d even talked Ava into camping one night.</p><p>Not a good idea.</p><p>While she appreciated the scenery, including the star-filled night sky and the clean mountain air, every noise freaked her out. She\u2019d convinced herself bears would attack them during the night and she didn\u2019t sleep, which meant he hadn\u2019t slept. She bitched about the cold, rocky ground. She gagged when forced to use an outhouse. Smoke from the campfire made her cough and her eyes water. She burned her hot dog and her marshmallows in the coals. Bugs dive-bombed her head. Glowing eyes stared at her from the tree line. She\u2019d complained from the moment they\u2019d pitched the tiny two-man tent until the next morning when they\u2019d packed up. They\u2019d even skipped spending time in the Tetons because Ava\u2019s priorities were a finding a shower, putting on clean clothes and getting a manicure. In that order.</p><p>The odd part of the fiasco? Chase hadn\u2019t been mad. If any other woman had acted that way? He might\u2019ve pitched her over a steep cliff. But Ava amused the hell out of him because her comments weren\u2019t mean-spirited or snotty, just honest.</p><p>While he and Ava spent time isolated, out in nature, he realized that he wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the great outdoors himself. Being outside on the McKay Ranch was one thing; he\u2019d always loved that, even when he hadn\u2019t been thrilled with the backbreaking work. His brothers never suggested camping outside after chores were done. The same held true for most of his McKay cousins simply because when the workday ended, they wanted to be inside. Where it was cool, or warm, depending on the season. Where snow wasn\u2019t blowing or sun wasn\u2019t beating down. Where a meal and a conversation waited. That break from the elements was a necessary part of surviving as a rancher. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once they\u2019d reached Jackson Hole, Chase found a luxury resort and surprised Ava by booking a suite. She\u2019d actually teared up when he arranged for two hours of in-room spa treatments and left her alone to be pampered.</p><p>While she was getting massaged, he took his truck for an oil change and called his family to catch up. Maybe it stung a bit, their shock he\u2019d contacted them without prompting. But Chase was determined to prove he could make changes in all areas of his life and stick to them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Ava asked.</p> <p>Chase grabbed her hand and kissed her palm. \u201cHow fantastic these last six days have been. Just me\u2019n you seeing the sights. Hanging out with my friend. Then you rockin\u2019 my world in bed and out of it.\u201d</p><p>She permitted a smug smile. \u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>After driving through Riverton, Ava suggested they drive up to Thermopolis to see the famous hot springs. Then she surprised him and booked a room at a bed and breakfast joint that boasted a small private hot spring. She\u2019d dragged him outside after the other guests were in bed for the night. Talk about a thrill, seeing Ava take control. Rubbing her firm, curvy body slick against his. Her mouth tasting. Her hands roving. Her voice a sexy rasp in his ear as she\u2019d taken him to heaven.</p><p>\u201cIt went beyond...well, anything for me too, Chase,\u201d she said softly, when he realized he\u2019d gone completely quiet again.</p><p>What Ava didn\u2019t realize was he\u2019d lain awake last night, wondering if that was the beginning of the end for them, because they\u2019d made no future plans after Ryan\u2019s event. He still hadn\u2019t heard from the PBR. Eight weeks had passed. He might be in limbo, but Ava had a life in California that was more than just a career.</p> <p>And how fucking sad was that for him?</p><p>Chase pulled into a service station. \u201cNeed anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re buying sunflower seeds, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed licorice and a Diet Dew comin\u2019 up.\u201d</p> <p>Ava had her headphones on when he returned. And she\u2019d fired up her computer, something she hadn\u2019t done often the last six days. Nor had she snapped many photos, which didn\u2019t make sense, given they\u2019d been in a scenery-rich national park. He\u2019d learned not to question her because it always got her back up.</p><p>He\u2019d become accustomed to hours driving in the truck, so he wasn\u2019t tired when they reached the fairgrounds. His cell rang. \u201cYes, Ryan, we\u2019re finally here. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the beer garden with my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right there.\u201d He faced Ava to find her staring at him. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Chase stopped just inside the gate to gather his thoughts.</p><p>Ava rubbed his arm. \u201cChase? You all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous.\u201d</p> <p>That surprised her. But she offered him that sweet, pure Ava smile and tenderly brushed her lips across his. \u201cI imagine he is too.\u201d</p><p>Ryan leapt up the instant he saw Chase, nearly tackling him. \u201cHow slow did you drive? Man. I thought you\u2019d never get here.\u201d He wrapped his arms around Ava and lifted her off the ground.</p><p>Chase couldn\u2019t help but grin. Ryan was like a big goofy pup. No boundaries. Honest affection and boundless enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cCome on. We\u2019re sitting over here.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s mother was a bottle-dyed redhead, somewhere between thirty and fifty, with the rough edged look he\u2019d seen on plenty of single blue-collar mothers. But she had Ryan\u2019s big smile and obvious pride in her son, by the way she kept fussing over him.</p><p>\u201cMom. This is Chase. And Ava.\u201d</p><p>He offered his hand. \u201cNice to meet you after Ryan has told me all about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackie Ackerman. Ryan is such a huge fan of yours. It\u2019s been a dream come true for him, getting to hang out and bullshit about bull riding.\u201d She turned her gaze to Ava. \u201cThanks for sending the video of Ryan\u2019s winning ride. I really wish I coulda taken time off work to see it live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Do you mind if I tape your rides tonight?\u201d</p><p>Ryan smiled widely. \u201c\u2019Course not.\u201d</p><p>It was difficult to get a word in edgewise with Ryan yammering a million miles an hour. The kid defined nervous energy. Finally Chase put his hand on Ryan\u2019s restless fingers and said softly, \u201cRelax. Take it down a notch.\u201d</p><p>Struck Chase strange that Ava remained behind the camera for the entire conversation. She\u2019d toss out remarks occasionally, but stuck to the observer role. She had changed too, seeming content to stay out of the spotlight.</p><p>The five-minute warning for the start of the rodeo echoed across the grounds. Ryan said, \u201cYou coming back to help me pull my rope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If you promise you ain\u2019t gonna talk the whole damn time we\u2019re waiting for you to ride,\u201d he teased.</p><p>Jackie laughed and playfully smacked her son\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s got you pegged, Ry-Ry.\u201d</p><p>Ryan stood, lifted his mom to her feet and squeezed her in a bear hug. \u201cSee ya after. Cheer loud for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it. Be safe, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Ava slipped on her press pass and entered the restricted area with Chase and Ryan.</p><p>Chase loved the buzz around the chutes, but he also felt the odd man out because he wasn\u2019t competing. Ryan knew quite a few of the guys. He flitted between chatting up bronc riders to leaning over the fence and talking to timed event competitors. The barrel racers weren\u2019t on their horses yet, or Ryan would\u2019ve been on that side of the chutes, charming the ladies.</p><p>He and Taz watched the action in the arena without speaking beyond the occasional remark on the performance. When the Dodge truck drove onto the dirt to drop off the barrels, they headed behind the chutes.</p><p>The roster had twenty bull riding competitors. Taz had drawn fourth, Ryan twelfth. He and Ryan helped Taz and watched as the bull landed hard on its front hooves and Taz sailed ass over teakettle until his body smacked into the ground and bounced before stopping.</p><p>Taz wasn\u2019t moving. The bullfighters watched over him until medical professionals arrived.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes were huge as he faced Chase. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be fine, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tough. They\u2019re getting him fixed up. See? He\u2019s on his feet.\u201d</p><p>The kid jumped down a level before Chase caught him by the shirtsleeve. \u201cNo need for you to head over there. They\u2019ll shoo you out. And Taz will bitch about you wanting to hold his hand anyway.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded. Blew out a distressed breath. Squinted at the scoreboard to see who was up next. Then Ryan went into that quiet time before a ride. Some guys called it psyching themselves up. Others called it getting in the zone. Chase found those minutes leading up to climbing on a bull the hardest. One he was on and getting a good wrap on his hand, he went through a mental checklist. Once the gate opened, he focused on keeping his seat, staying on, spurring and making that buzzer.</p><p>So he paced right along with Ryan. Until they stopped, stared at each other foolishly and smiled.</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid, you\u2019re up next. Show me whatcha got.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s bull was a mean bastard. First it wouldn\u2019t get up. Then it decided to fight. Chase held the bull rope as Ryan got a fast wrap. Taz held on to the back of Ryan\u2019s vest until Ryan shouted, \u201cGo!\u201d and the gate opened.</p><p>The bull had a showy style, leaping and twisting like a marlin on a hook. Ryan\u2019s hat went flying, but the kid held on.</p><p>Chase curled his hands around the wooden rail and muttered, \u201cAlmost, come on,\u201d and the buzzer went off.</p><p>As Ryan reached to release his rope, the acrobatic bull jerked its head, catching Ryan in the face with a horn. Ryan fell back far enough that when the bull\u2019s rear legs left the ground, the momentum ejected the kid sideways. He slammed into the solid metal gate head first, and then his body crumpled to the ground.</p><p>Confusion reigned in the arena when the bull charged a bullfighter. Then the barrel man. The pickup men cornered the angry animal and dragged it out with ropes.</p><p>He looked back, expecting to see Ryan on his feet, but he hadn\u2019t moved. What the hell?</p><p>Distorted noise echoed through the loudspeaker system, the words garbled and grating.</p><p>Get up.</p><p>Chase wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d said the words aloud. His vision became a pinpoint focus on a too-still Ryan lying in the dirt.</p><p>Then the bullfighters and medical team erected a human tent around Ryan and he couldn\u2019t see a damn thing.</p><p>Get up kid. Come on. Shake if off. Don\u2019t scare your mama like this. Jesus. Don\u2019t scare me like this.</p><p>More medical personnel raced over. A stretcher appeared. Then an ambulance. It never looked right, a ghostly quiet emergency vehicle slowly rolling across the arena dirt. No flashing lights, no wailing sirens, no rush.</p><p>The sound of spectators clapping as they paid respect to the person leaving via ambulance partially roused Chase from his stupor. Seemed as if he\u2019d blinked and the next rider was up, and the rodeo was back in business.</p><p>He turned and literally ran into Ava. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the hospital. Ryan is probably freaking out. I imagine Jackie is already on her way.\u201d He took Ava\u2019s hand and they weaved through the melee of contestants leaving the event. She didn\u2019t speak until they were in his truck.</p><p>\u201cWill Ryan be okay?\u201d</p><p>Chase shifted in the seat. \u201cIn small events like these, there are no med techs, so they automatically take injured riders to the closest hospital as a precaution. And Ryan is young. Old timers like Taz refuse to ride in an ambulance and find their own medical treatment. But I doubt a youngster like Ryan put up much of a fuss when they told him he needed to go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay. That\u2019s explains a lot.\u201d</p><p>They made the drive to the hospital in silence. He parked in the emergency lot, and it seemed to take an hour to walk through those emergency room doors.</p><p>Inside the hospital waiting room, Jackie paced in front of the windows. Ava hustled over and hugged her. \u201cAny news?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. They haven\u2019t told me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call someone to wait with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend is on his way. I won\u2019t call the rest of my family until I know what\u2019s going on. I appreciate you coming. I know Ryan will appreciate it too. It can be a group effort to chew his ass for worrying us once they let us see him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything I can get you?\u201d Ava asked. \u201cA drink? Something to eat? A blanket?\u201d</p><p>Jackie shook her head and continued pacing.</p><p>Chase wanted to bust through the swinging doors and get some answers. Shoving his hands in his pockets, he braced his shoulders against the cement wall, his stomach too queasy to pace.</p><p>Time dragged. The click of Jackie\u2019s heels competed with the beeping machines that echoed from the nurse\u2019s station.</p><p>Ava left him alone. She left Jackie alone too. The three of them were the only ones in the waiting room, but they might as well have been miles apart.</p> <p>The doors opened.</p><p>\u201cJackie Ackerman?\u201d a woman wearing blue scrubs asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m Jackie.\u201d</p><p>The woman wandered over. Fatigue lined the skin around her eyes, but her face remained blank. \u201cI\u2019m Doctor Silsbee. I headed the team that worked on your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but he didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t make it as in...he died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry. He coded twice and our attempts to revive him were unsuccessful.\u201d</p><p>Every bit of blood drained from Chase\u2019s face. He watched the doctor\u2019s mouth move, but her words were muffled by the accelerated beating of his heart in his ears.</p><p>Silence. Then a switch turned on and sound blasted his eardrums.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jackie yelled at the doctor. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not possible. Ryan is just a kid. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019ll pull through. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Miz Ackerman. The trauma to your son\u2019s brain was too severe. I can request a counselor or a clergyperson for you to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a fuckin\u2019 counselor, I need to see my son.\u201d</p><p>Doctor Silsbee appeared to brace herself.</p> <p>Chase felt himself splinter into two halves. One part stood there stoically, reasonably, wanting to help. The other part let lose a low-pitched wail that escalated into an unending scream.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not lying to me?\u201d Jackie shrieked. \u201cHow do I know this isn\u2019t some big goddamn mistake and you\u2019ve got Ryan confused with someone else\u2019s kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, we have verification from the ambulance crew who brought him in from the fairgrounds. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. This isn\u2019t funny! Take me to him. Now.\u201d</p><p>Heartsick, and barely hanging on by a thread, Chase stepped between her and the doctor. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to see him, Jackie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove out of my way.\u201d</p><p>He curled his hands around her upper arms and said softly, \u201cLook at me and listen.\u201d</p><p>Something shifted in her. Jackie blinked pain-filled eyes and whispered, \u201cBut I have to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. There\u2019s no reason for you to do this to yourself. Don\u2019t have your last memory of Ryan be what you see lying on a gurney. Because that image will overtake everything, even all the good ones. He\u2019s not there anymore. That\u2019s not him. He deserves better and so do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be dead.\u201d She shook her head so hard her tears splattered his cheeks. \u201cHow can he be dead?\u201d</p><p>Because he refused to wear a helmet. The stubborn kid might be alive right now if he\u2019d listened to me.</p><p>Shame and guilt warred inside him at the ugly and callous words his brain tossed out. God. How could he even think that at a time like this? Ashamed, and fearing Jackie might see those thoughts in his eyes, Chase ducked his head and walked away.</p><p>A burly biker strode in and Jackie launched herself at him. Her raw sounds of anguish nearly knocked Chase to his knees.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t breathe. Couldn\u2019t do anything but stand there helplessly and witness Jackie spiraling into debilitating grief.</p><p>Goddammit to fucking hell. He wanted to punch someone. Kick something. Hurt himself so the pain on the outside matched the pain on the inside.</p><p>Ryan. Dead. Eighteen years old. His life just starting. So full of happiness and joy. Now gone. That light forever extinguished.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stay in this hospital another second. He very calmly walked out the door, even as his legs urged him to run. The night air was so thick with humidity it was impossible to suck enough air into his lungs. He felt as if he were drowning. Chase closed his eyes, hating being mired in that special slice of hell called limbo.</p><p>Ava\u2019s voice brought him out of his dark thoughts. \u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>He flinched when she touched him.</p><p>\u201cBaby, come on, let go of the railing.\u201d</p><p>Railing? He looked down at his white-knuckled grip on the metal handrail, then at Ava standing next to him. Tears dripped down her cheeks. His mouth couldn\u2019t form any words.</p><p>She attempted to pry his fingers free. \u201cChase. Please. You\u2019re scaring me. I\u2019ve been trying to get your attention for five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Something about her tone spurred him to act. His fingers uncurled, but he\u2019d been clutching the metal so hard he\u2019d lost feeling in his hands. No. He was numb all the way to the bone.</p><p>How long had he been standing there in shock? Absolutely lost in grief and disbelief?</p><p>She took his keys and half-shoved him in the truck and slipped into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cWe need to find a place to stay tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Just find a liquor store first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind a goddammed liquor store.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Chase had crawled inside a bottle for the past two days. How he hadn\u2019t passed out wasn\u2019t a testament to his ability to handle his liquor, but a testament to his stubbornness.</p><p>Ava had never felt so helpless. She wouldn\u2019t mother him. She wouldn\u2019t press him to talk. So she curled up beside him on the bed, offering her physical presence while he steadily polished off another bottle of rotgut whiskey.</p><p>He absentmindedly stroked her hair while he clicked through TV channels. Occasionally he\u2019d switch out the remote for the bottle. His body temperature was warm despite that he only wore a pair of athletic shorts. He didn\u2019t speak. At all.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t moved either. Not even when her phone rang yesterday and she\u2019d left him to take the call outside.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to talk to Marnie\u2014it didn\u2019t matter what offer the woman dangled. No way was she leaving Chase alone at a time like this. No way. But Marnie hadn\u2019t understood Ava\u2019s absolute refusal to listen to the pitch for another audition. Not even after she explained she was dealing with a friend\u2019s death. Her agent went on a tirade about sticking her neck out for her client, complaining bitterly about Ava\u2019s lack of consideration for Marnie\u2019s reputation. Ava half-listened, her mind elsewhere, mainly on the devastated man hiding in the motel room, just out of her reach.</p><p>Chase\u2019s cell phone buzzed on the nightstand, startling her. He didn\u2019t bother to grab it. The buzzing rings stopped for a couple minutes, then the phone began to vibrate again. Ava looked at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna get that?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>The phone quit ringing.</p><p>Five minutes later it started again.</p><p>Chase took a swig from the bottle when it stopped.</p><p>By the third attempt, she rolled off the bed and picked up his phone. Caller ID read: Ryan Ackerman. She shivered and answered it anyway. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Jackie Ackerman. I\u2019m looking for Chase. He didn\u2019t leave me a way to contact him. I found his name on my son\u2019s phone, so I\u2019m hoping this is the right number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is, Jackie. This is Ava.\u201d She felt Chase\u2019s gaze snap to her. \u201cDid you want to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Hang on. Let me get him.\u201d Ava covered the mouthpiece. \u201cYou need to take this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d His voice was rough from too much whiskey and too little use.</p><p>\u201cYou have to.\u201d She spoke into the phone. \u201cJackie? He\u2019s right here.\u201d</p><p>Chase muttered and set aside the bottle to snatch the phone Ava held out to him. \u201cHey, Jackie. No. It\u2019s all right, you\u2019re not a bother.\u201d</p><p>A bunch of \u201cUh-huhs\u201d followed. Then, \u201cOf course I\u2019ll be there. No. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll find it. See you. Thanks for letting me know. Take care.\u201d He punched the off button and tossed the phone aside.</p><p>Perched across from him on the other bed, Ava waited a minute before she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He held up the bottle, studying the two inches of remaining liquid. \u201cShe gave me the time and place for Ryan\u2019s memorial service. Memorial service. The kid had barely begun to live. Is there anything worse on this whole fucking planet than memorializing a promising life cut short?\u201d</p><p>The lump in her throat prevented response.</p><p>\u201cWe all have to fucking sit there, looking at the goddamn picture of him, or the fucking casket, and pretend he\u2019s in a better place? That this is some kind of master fucking plan? Wrong. Goddammit everything about this is so wrong I...can\u2019t...even...\u201d Chase tipped the bottle up and sucked it dry in three greedy gulps.</p><p>Ava wanted Chase to lash out. To act out. To lose control and throw the bottle at the wall as hard as he could, screaming his rage and frustration as it shattered. But he\u2019d closed himself off.</p><p>Or so she thought.</p><p>Chase lurched to his feet and staggered to the bathroom. Slamming the door behind him. Attempting to keep her out.</p><p>Not a fucking chance, McKay.</p><p>She leapt up after him, but paused, unsure what to do. Pressing her back against the wall outside the bathroom, listening to him retch. Her belly roiled. Her heart seized with his every distressed whimper. Her tears fell freely as she heard him trying to hold back his sobs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Time passed in a vacuum of misery.</p><p>After she heard the toilet flush for the third time, she curled her palm around the handle, praying he hadn\u2019t started locking the door. The door swung open with a loud squeak.</p><p>Chase sat on the floor, his face hidden in his hands. He said, \u201cGet out,\u201d in that dangerously low tone.</p> <p>She parked herself next to him, hip to hip. When he didn\u2019t bark at her to leave, she placed her hand on his knee, wondering if he\u2019d accept her need to soothe him.</p><p>Try.</p><p>\u201cYou want some water?\u201d she asked.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>She counted to one hundred. \u201cChase? Do you need\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything. Just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I don\u2019t need you.\u201d</p><p>Ava ignored the sharp pang his words caused. \u201cBut I need you.\u201d</p><p>Chase slowly lifted his head and looked at her with red-rimmed eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The stark misery had her reaching for him without conscious thought. \u201cDon\u2019t turn me away. It\u2019s ripping me up to see you like this. I need to help you. Tell me how. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me. So just go the fuck away.\u201d</p><p>She slowly rolled to her feet. He probably thought he\u2019d scared her off. No way, buddy, I\u2019m sticking. She filled a cup and held it out, waiting for him to take it. She\u2019d stand there all night if she had to.</p><p>Finally, he said, \u201cFuck, all right, give me the goddamn thing,\u201d and snatched it from her fingers.</p><p>He could scream obscenities at her if it\u2019d bring him out of his sorrow-filled drunken stupor.</p><p>An eternity later, when he figured out she wasn\u2019t going anywhere, he started to talk.</p><p>\u201cWatching Ryan these last few weeks, before he...\u201d Chase squeezed the plastic cup so hard water shot out the top. \u201cIt drove home the point I\u2019ve had it so fuckin\u2019 easy my whole life.\u201d He gulped the water, swished it around in his mouth and leaned forward to spit it in the toilet. \u201cI cheated to get where I am today by bein\u2019 Bill Chase.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever name you used didn\u2019t get you to the top. Your drive to be the best did.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t argue with that. But she\u2019d be surprised if he didn\u2019t try.</p><p>\u201cThe guilt is eating at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilt that you\u2019re alive and Ryan\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Guilt I didn\u2019t push him harder to wear a helmet. He\u2019d be alive if he\u2019d listened to me. Banged up, but alive. How can I live with that?\u201d</p><p>Pointing out the obvious\u2014there were no guarantees anything would\u2019ve saved Ryan\u2014would mean nothing to him right now.</p><p>\u201cAnd here I am, wrecked because an eighteen-year-old kid I barely knew died. But I sure as fuck didn\u2019t act this way after my cousin Luke got killed.\u201d His head fell back against the concrete wall. \u201cChrist. I grew up with Luke. His death ripped our family to pieces. But I could only spare two days out of my life, out of my precious schedule to go to his funeral? And once I was back on tour, I didn\u2019t think of him at all. Even when I knew his brothers were beyond hurting. Did I reach out to them? No. Did I make an extra effort to keep in better contact with my own brothers because I understood how lucky I was I still had them? No.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I called them less than before. Same with my folks. Even now, when Jackie lost her only child and she\u2019s devastated, I\u2019m sitting here thinking about myself. How I feel. How it\u2019s affected me. How fucked up is that?\u201d Chase squeezed his eyes shut against the tears trickling down his miserable face. \u201cDon\u2019t answer that. I\u2019m a cold, self-centered son of a bitch. A shitty son, a shitty brother and a shitty friend.\u201d</p><p>Ava silently cried along with him, her heart breaking for this man who only saw the worst in himself.</p><p>\u201cNone of this matters,\u201d he said, his tone defeated.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe PBR, the PRCA, bull ridin\u2019. It\u2019s all bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase. You don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I mean. In all my years, I\u2019ve never seen anyone killed on the back of a bull. Seen them hurt? Yes. Seen them seriously hurt and even paralyzed? Yes. But someone I know, someone killed right in front of me and hundreds of other people? That\u2019s a first. That\u2019s so wrong. So fucking wrong. Ryan\u2019s death, and the tragedy of it, will make papers across the country. But it won\u2019t change anything. It won\u2019t give his mother comfort. Christ. He was her only kid and now she\u2019s alone.\u201d</p><p>Chase broke down. His massive shoulders shook as he cried.</p><p>When the worst of it passed, and he\u2019d taken the quiet comfort she\u2019d offered, she stood. \u201cCome on. You\u2019re exhausted and need to sleep.\u201d She held out her hands to help him up.</p><p>\u201cAva, I\u2019m not three years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are three sheets to the wind.\u201d</p><p>Chase turned his head away. \u201cSorry I\u2019m such a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason for you to let me help you.\u201d</p><p>An eternity passed before something shifted in him. He struggled to his feet by himself, but allowed Ava to guide him back to the bed he\u2019d barely left for two days.</p><p>Once she\u2019d settled beside him, he twined his arms around her, tangled his legs with hers. \u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he whispered thickly against her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. There\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be than with you, Chase. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>His whole body relaxed as he expelled a deep sigh and passed out.</p><p>She trailed her fingers up and down his spine.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s death had changed them both. Where did they go from here?</p><p>They kept a low profile during Ryan\u2019s funeral. But so many people attended it was easy to blend. All in all, the service was nice. Sad.</p><p>Ava ran into Taz as cars loaded up for the trip to the cemetery. She almost hadn\u2019t recognized him without his cowboy hat. His hair was shorter. He wore a sports coat.</p><p>He hugged her with a gruff, \u201cAva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaz. How you holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so good.\u201d He glanced at the hearse. \u201cStill can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Chase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the same as you.\u201d Miserable, blaming himself. Avoiding people.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cYou been on the road?\u201d Stupid question, Ava.</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quit. No more rodeos. No more foolin\u2019 myself. I ain\u2019t been ridin\u2019 good consistently for a couple of years anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA buddy of mine bought some land outside Scottsbluff. He\u2019s been trying to get me to take over, making improvements on it, for the last year. I wasn\u2019t interested until...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI realized I ain\u2019t too old to learn something new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could all learn something from this.\u201d</p><p>Taz glanced around and pulled her off to the side, out of earshot. \u201cListen, I know you got a lot of footage of Ryan while you were taping Chase. I\u2019d like to see you do something positive with it. Even if it\u2019s just for his mom. The kid deserves that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Is it all right if I use footage of you too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what for, but sure.\u201d</p><p>Ava kissed his cheek. \u201cTake care of yourself, Taz.\u201d</p><p>They were sitting in a diner outside Alliance, picking at a meal neither wanted.</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He glanced up from smashing a pile of peas with his fork. \u201cWhy? Did you have something on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And hear me out before you automatically say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to New York City with me. Just for a couple of days. We both could use a break. A little bit of pampering. I\u2019ve spent time in your world, Chase, I\u2019d like for you to spend time in mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy New York? Why not LA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy assistant mentioned there\u2019s still paparazzi lurking around my place. We\u2019d be trapped. In New York...we\u2019d probably be anonymous.\u201d She reached for his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s park your truck in Omaha, get on a plane and we\u2019ll be at LaGuardia in three hours. My family has a standing suite at the Cooper Square Hotel. We can stay there as long as we want.\u201d</p><p>His eyes searched hers. \u201cWhy is this so important to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to say goodbye. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no.\u201d</p><p>His vehemence surprised her.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll make the arrangements. We could use a distraction. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>Chase smiled for the first time in days. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, welcome to New York City. The local time is three p.m.\u201d Ava glanced out the airplane window as the flight attendant rattled off the usual spiel. She was anxious to get out of the plane and into the city.</p><p>Chase leaned across the armrest. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>Ava faced him and frowned. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. I expect you\u2019ll be different now that the city mouse is back in her element.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she countered. \u201cWill you become the country mouse? Afraid of taxis, sirens and the crush of people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t skeered of nothin\u2019.\u201d Chase pressed his lips to hers. She\u2019d expected a quick peck, but he cranked the kiss to hot and teasing as his thumb discreetly rubbed the stiff point of her nipple.</p><p>She pulled back. \u201cChase\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed touching you the last few days,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI missed it too.\u201d Ava rested her forehead to his. \u201cHold that thought, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He gave her a lingering smooch. \u201cBear in mind that just because we\u2019re on your turf don\u2019t mean you get to call the shots.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That forceful statement delivered in his masculine growl sent a curl of heat through her. Yes, she\u2019d missed this sexual part of Chase because it was such an important part of who he was. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of horning in on your territory.\u201d</p><p>They exited the plane and wended through the crowd at baggage claim. After Chase hefted their luggage, Ava led him to the area where private transportation companies waited. A man in a black sports coat stepped in front of another guy wearing a gray pinstriped suit. \u201cMiss Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Gino. I hope your flight was enjoyable.\u201d</p><p>The young man attempted to take the duffel bags from Chase, earning a dark scowl as Chase increased his grip on the luggage. \u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, sir. The car is this way, please.\u201d</p><p>The heat and stench assaulted her as they left the cool comfort of the terminal. God. The noise didn\u2019t bother her, but somehow she\u2019d forgotten how rank the city smelled in the summer months\u2014garbage, urine, grease and exhaust fumes.</p><p>Gino popped the trunk on a black limo at the curb.</p> <p>Chase stopped by the rear passenger door and looked at her as Gino snuck in and grabbed the bags. \u201cA limo, Ava? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a compact size, not a stretch limo, and it was the same price as a car service. I thought you\u2019d be happy I comparison shopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. But I\u2019m surprised you used that name to book it. What happened to us laying low?\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cThat name happens to be my name, and it\u2019s on the credit card I used. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d He stepped aside to open the car door for her, only to scowl again when Gino beat him to the punch.</p><p>Ava crawled in first and slid across the bench seat. Naturally, Chase didn\u2019t allow the distance and scooped her up, settling her on his lap. \u201cChase.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? I changed my mind. I\u2019m scared in the big city.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, but she didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Gino took the wheel and said, \u201cCooper Square Hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And Gino, buddy, I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d engage the privacy screen and take the long way,\u201d Chase drawled.</p><p>He nodded and the black glass separated them.</p><p>\u201cNot your first time in a limo, is it, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But it\u2019ll be my first time fucking in one.\u201d Chase placed a kiss on the center of her throat. \u201cI\u2019m dyin\u2019 for you, my Ava Rose.\u201d</p><p>The man could be so sweet.</p> <p>\u201cUndo your bra. I want them sugar tits in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>And...not so sweet. Not that she was complaining. Chase had already untied the bow at the neckline of her sundress and slipped the loosened material down her biceps. She twisted the front closure of her bra and his rough-skinned hands were there, knocking hers away.</p><p>\u201cArch back.\u201d As soon as she complied, Chase\u2019s hot mouth surrounded her left nipple. He suckled strongly. Purposefully.</p><p>That familiar, delicious heat spread. Ava gave herself over to it. Over to him. Reveling in the act of surrender.</p><p>Chase knew exactly how to eek out each sigh and moan. He expertly toyed with her mouth, his kisses so maddeningly arousing, so ripe and sensual, so unbearably erotic, she wanted to beg him to stop. Or to never stop.</p><p>He whispered gruffly, \u201cHang tight,\u201d below her ear and rolled her, dropping to his knees on the floor of the limo.</p><p>Breathing hard, dizzy, wet and achy, Ava rested her back against the plush center cushion. She watched as Chase shimmied her sundress up around her waist. Then he tugged her so far forward her butt cheeks were barely on the edge of the seat. \u201cI\u2019m falling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got ya.\u201d He stretched her left arm to the safety strap on the left side of the car roof, curling her fingers around the leather as he dragged kisses from the cup of her shoulder, across the sensitive bend in her elbow, to her fingertips. And back, to repeat the process on the right side.</p><p>Circling his thick fingers around each ankle, he pushed her legs wide, almost in straddle splits and hooked the edges of her low heels into the plastic lip that housed the door handle.</p><p>Keeping his eyes locked on hers, he took a condom out of his wallet and held the package in his teeth as he yanked his briefs and jeans to his knees.</p><p>\u201cWant me to put that on?\u201d she asked, her focus on his fully erect cock.</p><p>He lifted a brow and smiled briefly before his teeth tore open the square package. \u201cYou\u2019re stretched a little thin.\u201d Once he had the condom on, he worked himself inside her, his mouth busy on her throat.</p><p>Ava\u2019s head fell back and she groaned. So full. So hot. So good, every time.</p><p>Then Chase started to move. Endlessly long, deliciously slow, completely thorough strokes of his hot, hard flesh into hers. His cock buried so deeply inside her she felt his balls resting against her ass.</p><p>For being in the back of a limo, in New York City, during rush hour, there was no rushing Chase. He made love to her with his usual passion, but this tryst also served as a reminder that he\u2019d have her, his way, no matter where, no matter when.</p><p>The rhythm of Chase\u2019s strokes increased and he slipped his hand between their bodies to manipulate her clit.</p><p>\u201cYes. Like that. You know just how... God...don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love watching you come,\u201d he growled, his eyes on her face as he pumped into her. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Ava. No man has ever known you like this. No man but me will ever know this side of you.\u201d</p><p>No declaration of love, just possession, which maybe was the closest Chase came to admitting love. She smashed her mouth to his, matching the kiss to the brutal intensity of the way he fucked her.</p><p>He bottomed out with every thrust. One hand gripping her ass, the other rubbing her clit as he mastered her body with his. As Chase came undone.</p><p>Those teasing tingles tightened, coalesced into full power. The orgasm swamped her. She felt the pulses in her clit, in her pussy muscles spasming around Chase\u2019s cock, in her nipples. Even her lips throbbed as Chase turned the kiss into a sensual tease.</p><p>His body might\u2019ve stopped moving, but his hands didn\u2019t. His mouth didn\u2019t. He nuzzled and caressed every section of her exposed skin. This was another thing she loved about him\u2014his reluctance to release her after such an explosive interlude. He uncurled her fingers from the straps, sweetly kissing each knuckle. He unhooked her shoes, massaging her calves, her quads and her inner thighs. He ditched the condom and straightened her clothes before he bothered with his own. Then he gathered her in his arms and held her, like she was precious. Fragile. Like she was his.</p><p>And Ava let him.</p><p>The intercom buzzed twice, then Gino\u2019s voice came on. \u201cWe\u2019re about four blocks from the Cooper Square Hotel.\u201d</p><p>They remained wrapped together until the limo stopped. The rear door opened and Ava watched Chase\u2019s face as he caught his first glimpse of her family\u2019s hotel.</p><p>Yeah, he wore the holy-crap expression.</p><p>The hotel, situated in the Bowery section of Manhattan was quite impressive, with its seemingly twisted tower, a modern architectural work of art, twenty-one stories tall, comprised of glass on all sides.</p><p>The bags were whisked from the car trunk directly inside. Ava waited while Chase shook Gino\u2019s hand and slipped him a folded bill.</p><p>Chase placed his hand in the small of Ava\u2019s back. \u201cAh yeah, Hollywood, you were definitely slumming with the places we\u2019ve been staying.\u201d</p><p>The front door, at least fifteen feet tall and nine feet wide, swung open and she had her personal welcoming committee ushering her inside the postmodern, oriental-themed lobby.</p><p>\u201cMiss Cooper! We\u2019re so happy to have you back in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jason.\u201d She gestured to Chase. \u201cJason, this is my companion.\u201d Ava purposely allowed Chase to introduce himself, not knowing if he intended to keep up his Bill Chase persona or not. Either way, it was his decision.</p><p>He thrust out his hand. \u201cGood to meet you, Jason. Chase McKay.\u201d</p><p>Ava relaxed slightly. \u201cJason is the evening manager. The man who can make anything happen.\u201d</p><p>Jason, a slight man in his early thirties, smiled at Ava after shaking Chase\u2019s hand. \u201cThe pleasure is mine. We have you set up in the family suite on the fourteenth floor. Chef Delacorte has asked if you have any specifics requests for in-room dining?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a sampler of his latest appetizers, since I\u2019m not sure what our dinner plans are for later this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done. Delivery time?\u201d</p><p>Ava glanced at Chase. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI could eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it. Also, the bar is stocked with your usual requests.\u201d Jason handed Ava a slip of paper. \u201cHere\u2019s your access code. The staff is here to fulfill any of your needs, so don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Thank you.\u201d She slipped her hand through Chase\u2019s and led him around the corner to the elevators. Although Chase seemed to study everything, the funky patterns, the light fixtures, the restaurant behind the artfully placed glass partition, he didn\u2019t say a word until after they\u2019d entered the corner suite.</p><p>The entire space was floor-to-ceiling windows. The enormous bedroom and bathroom were enclosed off to the left. A sitting area faced the city side.</p><p>And still Chase said nothing as he stared out the window at the bustling city below.</p><p>Ava kicked off her shoes and moved in behind him, circling her arms around his waist, setting her chin on his shoulder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no. This place is... I\u2019ve never stayed anywhere this upscale, Ava.\u201d</p><p>Better not tell him this wasn\u2019t the crown jewel in the Cooper Hotel chain. \u201cLike you told me when we first started traveling together. It\u2019s just a room with a bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I\u2019m a fuckin\u2019 idiot.\u201d He wiggled away from her, pressing his forearm against the curved glass. \u201cThe staff fawned over you. Like you\u2019re royalty or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow is it any different than sponsors fawning over you?\u201d</p><p>He scowled over his shoulder. \u201cBig difference. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>At a loss of how to deal with his reaction to their economic disparity, she retreated to the opposite sitting area. Less than fifteen minutes ago they were as physically close as possible. Chase had looked her in the eye and assured her he knew her. Were those just babbled words uttered in a moment of lust?</p> <p>She\u2019d shared every facet of herself with him. Ava never lied about her family background. Could he only deal with her when she was in his world? A transplanted city girl who had to rely on him for everything?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t want her to be this Ava. Truth was, this was the real her.</p><p>Chase had known her family had money.</p><p>To think he\u2019d been afraid a Hollywood actress was out of his league? That was a drop in the bucket compared to seeing her as the billion-dollar baby.</p><p>He needed a drink. He correctly guessed which cabinet held the minibar and opened it, snagging the first beer he found. Fucking Heineken. He drank it anyway. Damn thing probably cost twenty bucks.</p> <p>Two knocks sounded and Ava went to the door. \u201cCome in. That looks amazing. Chef Delacorte truly outdid himself.\u201d</p><p>Chase wandered over to see what type of feast management laid out for a member of the royal Cooper family.</p><p>A small Asian man draped a pristine white tablecloth over the table and arranged the first rectangular platter. \u201cPink sweet potato souffl\u00e9 topped with tapenade.\u201d</p><p>Chase waited for the man to serve up more than two spoonfuls.</p><p>But he revealed the next plate with a flourish. \u201cArugula salad with roasted beets, feta and toasted pumpkin seeds.\u201d</p><p>Beets? The greens looked like wilted dandelion leaves. That whole dish resembled something his mom served when she was cleaning out the fridge.</p> <p>The Asian man said, \u201cPolenta with shallot dill sauce.\u201d</p><p>A rubbery yellow disk with what looked like a splotch of ranch dressing and a skinny piece of ditch weed sticking from the center.</p><p>What the hell kind of appetizers had Ava ordered? Where were the nachos? Chicken wings? Fried pickles, okra and cauliflower?</p><p>\u201cPulled pork sandwich with ginger mango slaw.\u201d</p><p>Now, he could eat pork. But calling that one bite wonder a sandwich was stretching it. Chase counted five more covered dishes. Which probably equaled another five ounces of food.</p><p>\u201cBruschetta with heirloom tomatoes and anise-flavored basil.\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly. Chopped tomatoes on toast.</p><p>Ava glanced at him sharply and he gave her an innocent look.</p> <p>\u201cSpicy yellow fin tuna rolls with lime-pickled onions. And salmon on a bed of black diamond coconut rice.\u201d</p><p>Two sushi dishes. Fucking awesome.</p><p>The waiter lifted the last two lids. \u201cCrimini mushroom ravioli with kale pesto. Baked brie with caramelized fresh fig.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d find a bag of peanuts in the minibar.</p><p>Ava gushed, \u201cThis looks and smells absolutely amazing. Give my sincerest thanks to Chef Delacorte and tell him I\u2019ll pop into the kitchen while I\u2019m here to thank him personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. But he sent you one more token, Miss Cooper.\u201d From beneath the cart he presented a small plate and lifted the silver dome. \u201cYour favorite dessert. Lavender-infused cr\u00e8me brulee\u2019 with sugared pansy petals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I can\u2019t believe he remembered.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t see this for what it is: a total suck up.</p><p>Chase felt somewhat guilty for that thought. How could he fault people for liking Ava so much when he felt the same?</p><p>After she let the server out of the room, she picked up a vivid red rectangular plate and scrutinized the food. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to choose from.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be serious.</p><p>He hoped the beer would drown out how loud his stomach growled.</p><p>\u201cGrab a plate and dig in,\u201d Ava said.</p><p>\u201cNah. You go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Ava faced him. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d He sipped his beer. \u201cThat kinda stuff is not really my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we have all this delicious food and none of it sounds good to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, dime-sized helpings don\u2019t qualify as all this food. Second, if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in something, I don\u2019t eat it. Period.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin with a look of determination. \u201cIf I fix you a plate, will you at least try some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you feed me,\u201d he said silkily. \u201cWhile you\u2019re sitting on my lap. Nekkid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a brat sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Chase stiffened and turned away.</p><p>A minute or so of silence hung in the air.</p><p>Then Ava\u2019s hand lovingly followed the contour of his spine. \u201cSorry. Me pushing food on you is bratty. Will you try some of these dishes if I hand-feed you? Could be sexy and fun. Very upscale 9 1\u20442 Weeks.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d finally convinced him to watch that flick on her computer\u2014not that they\u2019d made it to the end. \u201cFine. But no sushi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause where I\u2019m from? We call raw fish bait, not food.\u201d</p><p>Ava rolled her eyes and bit into a tuna roll. \u201cMmm. More for me. Sit.\u201d She began loading a plate.</p><p>After she straddled his lap, he curled his hands around her ass cheeks, murmuring, \u201cFor balance,\u201d as he kissed her strong, stubborn jawline.</p><p>\u201cHere. This is your speed.\u201d She pinched the tiny pork sandwich between her forefinger and thumb, popping it in his mouth.</p><p>He chewed. Swallowed. \u201cNot bad. Coulda been a whole lot bigger. Something that small just pisses my stomach off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you like cheese.\u201d She loaded her fork with a gooey white substance and then dragged it through some kind of sauce. She held the fork close to his lips. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>He obliged, and as soon as he finished chewing, he swooped in for a kiss. \u201cI liked that one. But my favorite part of this is you feeding me.\u201d</p><p>Her beautiful turquoise eyes glittered with triumph and she waggled the fork at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Christ. Oh hell no. Food is not supposed to be pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet potato souffl\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Chase hoped his gag reflex wouldn\u2019t kick in. He closed his mouth around the fork tines, letting the glob sit on his tongue. Swallowing, he withheld a shiver of disgust. \u201cNext.\u201d</p><p>After he\u2019d appeased her and tried several samples, he carried her to the bedroom. Spreading her out on the thick white comforter, he stripped her to skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still hungry and needing something sweet. So I\u2019m gonna eat my fill of you.\u201d His finger followed the creamy slit between her thighs. \u201cAnd like any fine dining experience, I plan on taking my time. Enjoying the experience.\u201d</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>After he\u2019d brought her to the edge three times, he finally sent her soaring. He kissed his way up her trembling body; humbled he affected this woman so strongly. He tucked them under the covers, spooning behind her and whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for? I should be thanking you, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for sticking by me the last week. I ain\u2019t been the easiest guy to be around.\u201d How did he tell her he\u2019d never opened himself up to anyone like he had with her?</p><p>\u201cEasy is boring.\u201d She turned her head and kissed his arm. \u201cI missed the cocky, bossy bull rider part of you. Although everything that happened with Ryan is beyond tragic and it\u2019s still in the forefront of both our minds, I\u2019m really glad you came to New York with me.\u201d</p><p>Seemed he didn\u2019t have to tell her anything. Seemed Ava already knew. And for the first time in his life, that didn\u2019t scare him to death.</p><p>A nap refreshed them both. Chase would\u2019ve preferred to stay in for the rest of the night, but Ava kept tossing out comments about the city that didn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>He stretched out on the bed, watching her get ready, which was a new experience. The Ava he\u2019d traveled with was low-maintenance. This Ava went all out with hair, makeup, snappy clothes. Chase didn\u2019t want to know where she\u2019d gotten all the extra stuff.</p><p>\u201cThe first day we hung out in Sundance, you bought me the world\u2019s best chili dog.\u201d She rubbed glittery gunk on her cheeks. \u201cSo I wanna take you out for the best burger in New York.\u201d Her eyes met his in the mirror. \u201cI imagine you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving. But you sure the place will be open? It\u2019s almost ten o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Friday night in New York City. The place closes at midnight and we have reservations at eleven.\u201d</p><p>Chase frowned. How had she known he\u2019d agree? Did she assume he\u2019d just go along with everything she planned?</p><p>Ava misread his scowl. \u201cI had Jason make the reservation while you were in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t just a place you can walk in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the good restaurants aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Good restaurant. Hah. Probably wouldn\u2019t be the type of burger joint he preferred. He envisioned their time in New York entirely different than she did. Was she anxious to be in the spotlight again? Because she sure as hell dressed for a photo op.</p><p>Ava Dumond\u2019s comings and goings wouldn\u2019t necessarily attract attention in a city of ten million, but Ava Cooper\u2019s might. Didn\u2019t she see that? Or didn\u2019t she care?</p><p>\u201cChase? You\u2019re quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quiet more often than you realize.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a brow.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, you sure us going out is a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming it\u2019s kosher to wear jeans to this burger place? Because I\u2019m low on Armani suits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine for tonight. But we can look at adding to your wardrobe tomorrow when we\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it, Ava. I am not goin\u2019 shopping with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? We\u2019re in the fashion capital of the world. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo fucking way in hell.\u201d</p><p>Ava walked over to sit on the edge of the rumpled bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Chase crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cYou wanna hit the pricey stores on Fifth Avenue tomorrow? Fine. That\u2019s your thing. Not mine. I\u2019m sure you have girlfriends who\u2019d love to shop with you for a few hours while you\u2019re in town. You\u2019ve probably already lined up a car service. You don\u2019t need me. And you shouldn\u2019t expect me to trail behind you, carrying your bags and standing around like a fucking idiot while you\u2019re pawing though purses.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re too manly for that?\u201d</p><p>He rolled to his feet on the opposite side of the bed. \u201cYes. And you\u2019d be wise to remember I ain\u2019t a lap dog like Jake neither.\u201d He slammed the bedroom door behind him and grabbed another beer\u2014his third of the night.</p><p>Christ. He should\u2019ve known. Ava Dumond was fine being with a dirty rodeo cowboy in his world, but when it came to Ava Cooper\u2019s world, he didn\u2019t measure up. She intended to turn him into a slick-haired, suit-and-tie-wearing, shopping-for-fucking-shoes pussy.</p> <p>Screw that. Just to be ornery, Chase dug out his big Man of Steel championship belt buckle and threaded it through the belt loops of his Wranglers. He\u2019d considered leaving his cowboy hat in the room, but that too, was part of who he was, so on it went.</p><p>He\u2019d finished half his beer when Ava emerged from the bedroom. The woman embodied hot sin in tight white pants, a gauzy shirt draped over a cleavage-enhancing silver-sequined tank top. She hadn\u2019t worn ankle-breaking stilettos to spite him, which was a plus. His eyes roved over her. \u201cGoddamn you look fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompliments won\u2019t negate your shitty attitude.\u201d</p><p>Chase held his beer bottle aloft. \u201cBooze might.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s laugh was laced with exasperation.</p><p>He crossed the room and kissed her soundly. \u201cI don\u2019t like fighting with you, Hollywood. Let\u2019s go have us a burger.\u201d</p> <p>A car service delivered them to db Bistro Moderne. Ava approached the hostess stand. \u201cReservations for Cooper.\u201d</p><p>Of course the reservation was for Cooper.</p><p>The host, a scrawny, pimple-faced Mexican kid, grinned. \u201cWe\u2019re so pleased you\u2019ve chosen to dine with us tonight, Miss Cooper. I was such a huge fan of Miller\u2019s Ridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. That\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I trouble you for an autograph?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to sign one. I\u2019ll swing by on our way out.\u201d</p><p>The kid beamed. \u201cRight this way.\u201d</p><p>From what Chase could see, the restaurant was tiny\u2014ten tables total. The walls were plastered with brightly colored paintings. Music blared but didn\u2019t mask the din. The host led them to a table directly in front of the windows. Talk about being in a fishbowl. Since it was the only seating available, it wouldn\u2019t do any good to complain.</p> <p>\u201cCan I bring you a beverage from our bar, Miss Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Stoli martini, extra dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent choice. And for you, sir?\u201d</p><p>Weird. He didn\u2019t know Ava drank martinis. Seemed there was a lot he didn\u2019t know about her. \u201cDo you have a beer list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sir. We don\u2019t serve beer.\u201d</p><p>Chase managed not to blurt, No beer in a burger joint? He said, \u201cChivas on the rocks. A double.\u201d Before he opened the menu to check whether this place even served burgers made of meat, Ava placed her hand over the top of his.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me to order for you?\u201d</p><p>This was a test. He thought back to the night they\u2019d eaten at the supper club. She\u2019d allowed him to order for her, so she obviously expected the same courtesy. \u201cSure. But no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFish. Got it.\u201d</p><p>She ordered. When their drinks arrived Ava raised her glass for a toast. \u201cTo having fun in the Big Apple.\u201d</p><p>He clinked his glass to hers and drank, but he couldn\u2019t tear his gaze away from her face. The lighting gave her an extra golden glow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>Goddamn he loved it when she blushed. \u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d</p><p>She leaned across the table until they were nose to nose. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Chase angled his head and pressed his mouth to hers, memorizing the shape, softness and taste of her lips beneath his. He let the kiss linger, didn\u2019t use his tongue, only parted his mouth slightly and rubbed his lips over hers twice before he eased back.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak as they took in the ambiance of the restaurant and gazed out the window. Seemed to take forever until their food arrived. His burger had gooey stuff in the middle that tasted like his Aunt Caro\u2019s goose liver spread. The meat was juicy, but the burger would\u2019ve been better with a layer of mustard, onions and pickles\u2014in his opinion.</p><p>Ava only ate half of hers and declined dessert and coffee.</p><p>The server dropped the bill at Chase\u2019s elbow. He automatically opened it and looked at the damages.</p><p>Holy. Fucking. Shit.</p><p>\u201cChase. Gimme that.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her. \u201cA hundred bucks? For one hamburger?\u201d</p><p>Ava snatched the check from him. \u201cI told you I was buying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you were buying me the most expensive burger in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the most expensive. I said it was the best. There\u2019s a restaurant on Wall Street that has one that costs more than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You almost coulda bought a cow for what you paid for two burgers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it go.\u201d</p><p>But Chase couldn\u2019t help but think... Hell, he had no freakin\u2019 idea what Ava was thinking, bringing him here, paying that much for what oughta cost six bucks, max. With fries.</p><p>The server returned with her credit card and the receipt.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d she asked tightly.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The outside air wasn\u2019t as chilly as her attitude.</p><p>Your fault. Fix it.</p><p>Chase wrapped his arm around her waist instead and pulled her against his body. \u201cI\u2019m not an ingrate. Thank you for supper, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut just so you know? Forking out a hundred bucks and change for a burger don\u2019t guarantee that I\u2019m putting out for you tonight.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, called him a redneck, and all was good between them.</p><p>But Chase knew it wouldn\u2019t always be that easy.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Chase left the room early to work out. She was editing the video images of the first time she\u2019d taped Ryan riding, when her cell rang. \u201cHey, Han. You\u2019re up early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me. How\u2019s New York?\u201d</p><p>She stopped resizing images. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I was in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourtesy of the New York City newspaper Talk of the Town, which contacted me at five a.m. for a comment on Ava Cooper\u2019s newest squeeze. Apparently you were spotted out and about last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. See for yourself. The picture of you and cowboy dude is online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe no one will see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s in the print version too. I was already up and headed to Booksoup for all the trade rags.\u201d</p><p>How had that happened so quickly? Ava remembered Chase\u2019s concern last night when she\u2019d mentioned Jason calling for reservations for them. Chase\u2019s distrust of Jason wasn\u2019t surprising; Chase didn\u2019t trust anyone. With good reason. But Ava refused to believe Jason would violate her privacy. Most likely the host or waitstaff from the restaurant had contacted the press. She squinted at the picture of her and Chase, taken through the restaurant window, right when he\u2019d kissed her.</p><p>It\u2019d been a beautiful, sweet moment between them. Not something to be exploited. Something else occurred to her. \u201cDid they give his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But it\u2019ll only be a matter of time. And everyone in the press knows where you stay in New York. Call me later.\u201d</p><p>Ava couldn\u2019t suggest Hannah leak Chase\u2019s identity to end speculation. She wasn\u2019t sure which bothered her more. Admitting Chase was right in reminding her they were supposed to lay low? Or that she thrived on the attention and she\u2019d lived in the spotlight so long she missed it when it wasn\u2019t an almost daily part of her life.</p><p>No. She didn\u2019t want to court trouble. Or speculation. She wanted a normal life where no one cared if she kissed the man she loved, in a restaurant in one of the biggest cities in the world.</p><p>That truth shook her to the core. In showing Chase her world, she understood she didn\u2019t want to live in it all the time anymore. But she\u2019d seen the guarded look in his eye. Would Chase even believe her?</p><p>Her phone buzzed in her hand again and the name on the caller ID shouldn\u2019t have surprised her, but it did. Ava answered, \u201cHello, Petra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I had to find out from a trashy rag like Talk of the Town that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur plan to have a quiet couple of days was blown the first night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been off the grid, darling. People are curious when you resurface. Anyway. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t complain. What\u2019s new with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve volunteered way too much time to my charities, but I simply don\u2019t know how they\u2019d survive without me, so I continue to raise money and Arthur continues to complain about it.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s been in California more than you have in the last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet that makes you crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t miss LA at all. Anyway, I assume you\u2019re not jetting off today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. It just so happens I\u2019m throwing a little cocktail party tonight at the apartment and I\u2019d love for you to come.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ava nearly snorted. Since Petra lived in a fifteen-million-dollar apartment on Park Avenue, her little cocktail party probably meant a guest list of fifty, a black tie affair with a quartet from the New York Philharmonic providing entertainment.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I won\u2019t allow you to say no, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe honest, Petra. How elaborate is this party? And what\u2019s the dress code?\u201d</p><p>Petra sighed. \u201cTwenty guests. Just appetizers. New York casual. Really, it\u2019s practically a barbecue.\u201d</p> <p>Ava laughed at the image of stylish, elegant and immaculately coiffed Petra in jeans and a gingham-checked shirt, serving fried chicken.</p><p>\u201cGlad I amuse you. Show up any time after seven-thirty. And feel free to bring the gentleman in the hat. Ta.\u201d</p><p>The gentleman in the hat might be optional after he got wind of their tabloid appearance.</p><p>Almost on cue, the door opened and Chase walked in.</p><p>She should be used to his jaw-dropping physique by now. The massive biceps, bulging triceps, thick forearms, bulked up chest, the delts, the quads, the glutes, the eight-pack abs. God she loved his abs. She loved to dip her tongue between the hard ridges of muscle, tracing every work-honed line. Especially after he worked out. Losing herself in the musky, salty taste of his skin.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Do I have pigeon shit on my clothes or something?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes snared his. \u201cNo. Just admiring the goods. Seeing you half naked...you are a damn beautiful man, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou been hitting the minibar first thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t tell you enough how unbelievably attracted I am to you. Seeing you like that stops me in my tracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva.\u201d</p><p>She marched over to him, pulling her three-inch height advantage. \u201cYou compliment me all the time. Why can\u2019t I do the same? You think it\u2019s insincere?\u201d</p> <p>That intense blue gaze never wavered. \u201cNo. You ain\u2019t blowing smoke up my chaps just to get into them. I just don\u2019t know what to say. Everything I think of sounds fucking wrong. And I sure as shit don\u2019t want you to think I don\u2019t appreciate it, because I do. So I\u2019m left with saying nothin\u2019 at all.\u201d</p><p>As they stared at each other, uncertainty morphed into heat.</p><p>Ava bent down and brushed her lips over his ear, waiting for his shiver, because he always shivered\u2014and he didn\u2019t disappoint. She nipped his rigid jaw, loving how his stubble felt on her lips. \u201cI want to suck you off. Right now.\u201d She lowered to her knees and hooked her fingers in the waistband of his stretchy shorts, then yanked them down. She looked up at him and said, \u201cShirt. Off.\u201d</p><p>One tug and it was gone.</p><p>She reached between his legs and rolled his balls over her fingers as she suckled the cock head until he was fully erect.</p><p>Chase emitted a sound that Ava understood as more.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t tease and tempt. She wanted to drive him to that point of pleasure so hard and fast he didn\u2019t know what hit him. She used her hand. Her tongue. The deep suctioning power of her mouth. She loved she could render him as powerless to her touch as he rendered her.</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t touch her roughly until he muttered, \u201cFuck,\u201d and his shaft tightened. Then his hands gripped her neck, his thumbs pressing to keep her jaw fully open as his hips pumped into her face. Warm spurts hit the back of her throat and flowed over her tongue as she swallowed.</p> <p>His legs trembled and his harsh breathing sliced the air. He stumbled back and his bare ass landed on the bed. The covers made a whoosh as his upper body fell back and he uttered another, \u201cChrist Almighty.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Ava untied his shoes and slipped them off. The fact Mr. My-Ticklish-Feet-Are-Off-Limits didn\u2019t stir when she removed his socks was an excellent indication of how thoroughly she\u2019d rocked his world.</p><p>The bedroom phone rang and she leapt up to get it. \u201cHello? Oh. Damn. I lost track of time. No, don\u2019t let him leave. Tell him I\u2019ll be down in ten minutes. Or if he prefers, he can park back by the service entrance so he doesn\u2019t have to keep circling the block. Great. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She saved her work and shut down her laptop. She twisted her hair and attached a hairclip. Her clothing choices were dismal, but her shopping excursion would fix that. She threw jeans, a white T-shirt and ballet flats into her bag.</p><p>Chase rested on his elbows when she returned to the bedroom to say goodbye.</p><p>\u201cThis is short notice, but my friend Petra called and she\u2019s having a cocktail party tonight. I told her we\u2019d go. Which works out because I\u2019d already made hair and makeup appointments at my favorite salon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Petra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn actress I worked with when I started out in LA. Petra aimed her goals much higher than acting and snagged a New York financier who dabbled in the movie production biz as her husband. Arthur is thirty years older, and she\u2019s very New York high society now, but for some reason she\u2019s always kept in touch with me.\u201d Ava slung her bag over her shoulder. \u201cThink about coming to the party with me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But where you goin\u2019 now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst to a yoga class near my salon. Then to the salon. Then shopping.\u201d She pointed at him. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that lost puppy look, McKay. I believe you said no fuckin\u2019 way when I mentioned shopping yesterday.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cI meant it. Any idea when you\u2019ll be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you.\u201d She made it to the door when she found her back pressed against the wall and Chase\u2019s mouth insistent on hers.</p><p>After he\u2019d obliterated every thought from her mind, he released her. \u201cHave fun today, Hollywood, because now I know how much you really love all that time-consuming girly shit.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she reached the car that she realized she\u2019d forgotten to tell him about the press situation.</p><p>Chase wasn\u2019t uncomfortable being by himself in New York City. He\u2019d been there a half-dozen times, usually with a group, but any place he needed to get to was a taxi ride away.</p><p>He showered and dressed, walking away from the hotel into the shops in the East Village until he found food that appealed. Two slices of pizza would hold him for a while. The sun beat down, heating the pavement, reminding him the city smelled like ass. The tiny storefronts fascinated him. Everyone was in a hurry, except for the bums. Another thing he noticed? He wasn\u2019t the shortest man around. Here, his height was average. Maybe even above average.</p><p>Much as he hated to admit it, he needed to find something suitable to wear tonight. His clothes were fine for rodeo and travel, but not decent enough for a penthouse cocktail party in New York City.</p><p>Once again he was reminded of the differences between them. He didn\u2019t blame her for wanting to return to the lifestyle she\u2019d been born into.</p><p>None of the shops looked promising for his preferred type of clothing. And he refused to dress in uncomfortable or trendy clothes to impress people he didn\u2019t know. Leaning against a shady section of the brick building, he punched up a Google search and skimmed the results. The closest store was twenty-seven blocks away, according to Google Maps. He hailed a cab.</p><p>The familiar scent of leather and denim greeted Chase as he stepped into Western Spirit. The store itself relied more on kitschy country chic than plain country. Racks of high-end leather coats filled the aisle. Along the wall were vintage boots enclosed in glass cases. Vintage, another word for discarded and out of fashion. He peered at a beat-up pair of Tony Lamas, nothing fancy except the stitching on the snip toe, and the asking price was seven hundred bucks. A new pair didn\u2019t cost that much. Shaking his head, he crossed over to the men\u2019s clothing section.</p><p>He expected to be left to his own devices. His experience with sales staff in New York hadn\u2019t ever been good. So he was surprised when the salesgirl immediately wandered over.</p><p>\u201cYou have an idea of what you\u2019re looking for that I can help you find?\u201d</p><p>Chase glanced up from the rack of long-sleeved western shirts and smiled. The Italian girl, who looked to be late teens, gasped, \u201cOmigod. You\u2019re Chase McKay!\u201d</p><p>Holy crap. He wasn\u2019t expecting that. \u201cGood eye...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngelina. I can\u2019t believe bull rider Chase McKay is in our store. I saw you ride at Madison Square Garden for the last two years. That was the most exciting part of the event when you rode Tick Tock for ninety points. My girlfriend Sarah and I still talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to hear it made such an impact on you, Angelina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo has your injury healed enough to get you back on tour?\u201d</p><p>This was one of his favorite parts of being part of the PBR, connecting with fans. \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to remember she was supposed to be selling him something. \u201cThese shirts are pretty basic. The ones with the custom embroidery are over there. Are those more your style?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m wanting something simple. And without sounding boring, I\u2019m looking for white or black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassic choices.\u201d She eyed the breadth of his shoulders. The length of his arms and torso. Then pulled out four shirts. Two white, two black. \u201cThese are the same brand but the fabric weight is different. Try them on. The dressing rooms are back by the boots.\u201d</p><p>Chase bit back a groan. Why couldn\u2019t he just buy the damn things and be done with it? He hated to try shit on. But he did.</p><p>Angelina scrutinized him after he exited the dressing room. \u201cDefinitely the heavier weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSold. Now I need a coupla pairs of Wranglers.\u201d He rattled off the size, cut, color and style.</p><p>\u201cWe have those. I\u2019ll take them to the counter.\u201d</p><p>As Chase dug out his wallet, he noticed Angelina\u2019s focus kept drifting to the door. And when she caught him watching her, she blushed. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude or nosy, but do you always have photographers following you around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost never. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne followed you here. He\u2019s been waiting in the shadow of that grocery store awning since about five minutes after you walked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d Chase craned his neck and squinted at the man. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty well hidden. How\u2019d you see him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Again she blushed. \u201cMy boyfriend is a journalism major at NYU, so I tend to notice stuff like that because he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what he\u2019s doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably following up on the picture of you and Ava Cooper in this morning\u2019s edition of Talk of the Town.\u201d</p> <p>Chase froze. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen it?\u201d</p><p>How come Ava hadn\u2019t mentioned it? \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t name you, just mention the mysterious man in the cowboy hat. And without sounding all freakish fan girl, when I saw the picture, I thought that might be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a copy of the paper?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cMy boyfriend uses them for class so it\u2019s at our apartment.\u201d</p><p>Pissed him off that someone had tipped the press Ava was in town. They couldn\u2019t even have a dinner out alone like a normal couple without it being news?</p><p>The snoopy bastard had probably been lying in wait today. Had he followed him to the gym? Obviously the asshole had followed him from the hotel. Wait. Chase had taken a cab. Had this guy jumped in a cab too? Why? How had he tracked him down in a city this size?</p><p>Face it, you haven\u2019t seen another man wearing a cowboy hat so you ain\u2019t that hard to find.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. By now probably all the media outlets had figured out who he was. They\u2019d already linked him to Ava, so he\u2019d just add another link and hope like hell this would play well with the PBR. \u201cAngelina, is your apartment close by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin a few blocks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd your boyfriend? Is he home now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of media contacts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know.\u201d</p><p>Chase grinned at her. \u201cGood. How would he like an exclusive with Ava Cooper\u2019s New York City companion, Chase McKay? With pictures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate that these bastards have invaded my privacy. Someone is gonna get the story. For once I\u2019d like to control who that someone is and what information they get.\u201d</p><p>Immediately Angelina had her phone to her ear. \u201cRyan? Get your camera and come to the store. Now. I\u2019ve got your first story. The man with Ava Cooper last night.\u201d She didn\u2019t notice Chase\u2019s frozen smile.</p><p>Ryan.</p><p>Goddamn just the mention of the name made his gut clench with sorrow. He closed his eyes, reminding himself it was a common name. Reminding himself he was here to have fun.</p><p>He had his clothes delivered to the hotel. To be ornery, Chase killed a few hours buying gifts and checking out a museum. While his paparazzi shadow thought he was getting a scoop, Ryan had already sold his story to Talk of the Town\u2019s competitor. He wandered into an Irish pub for a beer and a plate of corned beef before he returned to the room.</p><p>Ava texted she was running late. After being with her practically twenty-four/seven the last month, he missed her. Hopefully she hadn\u2019t filled all her upcoming days in New York with shopping trips and salon appointments. Hopefully she wanted to spend time with him before they returned to the real world.</p><p>Or maybe Ava is sick of your crap attitude as she\u2019s showing you her world.</p><p>Christ, he had been acting like a jerk. And it wasn\u2019t entirely from the lingering sadness of Ryan\u2019s death. He was out of his element and taking it out on Ava. He had to buck up, cowboy up and make sure he didn\u2019t embarrass her tonight.</p><p>His jaw dropped when she blew into the room, an absolute fucking vision\u2014artfully tousled hair, fancy makeup and a lavish skintight turquoise dress that matched her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I thought about having you meet me at Petra\u2019s, but that wouldn\u2019t be fair...\u201d Ava\u2019s eyes narrowed on him, sprawled in the sitting area, in his boxer briefs, drinking a beer and watching classic ESPN. \u201cChase? Aren\u2019t you going to the party with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m goin\u2019 with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you ready?\u201d</p><p>He drained his beer. \u201cI am ready. I showered. Shaved. I was waiting to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>He watched her struggle with her answer. Finally she gifted him with that mega-watt star smile. \u201cAs much as I love to see you undressed like that, cowboy, it is a little informal. So maybe you oughta cover up all those muscles so female party goers aren\u2019t drooling on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch sweet bullshit.\u201d Chase retreated to the bedroom and yanked on new jeans, buttoned the white shirt, added his championship belt buckle, slipped on his boots and hat.</p><p>All in under two minutes.</p><p>\u201cSo? Do I pass?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and returned her focus to two pairs of shoes. One pair, four inches high, were a funky shade of shiny yellow patent leather with turquoise stitching. The other pair, were flats, fancied up with flowers, but were nowhere near as hot as the stilettos.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ava fingered the yellow heels. \u201cI love, love, love these Louboutins. They are so perfect with this dress, but...\u201d She looked up at him and put on a too-bright smile. \u201cBut these will be fine. I\u2019ve gotten used to wearing flats the past few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Damn woman was willing to give up wearing her fancy new shoes so she wouldn\u2019t tower over him in public? That\u2019s when Chase knew that she loved him.</p><p>He pointed at the yellow pair. \u201cWear them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva. It\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>She squealed when she slipped them on. \u201cHave I mentioned how much I love them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA time or two. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. There\u2019s something I forgot to tell you. We made the papers today. Evidently someone told the media I\u2019ve come out of hiding, so there are photographers hanging around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He smiled and opened the door. \u201cBut I handled it.\u201d</p><p>A look of horror crossed her face. \u201cYou didn\u2019t, like, beat them up or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t a total redneck,\u201d he chided.</p><p>Any photographers around the hotel were discreet; he half expected popping bulbs everywhere.</p><p>Ava seemed nervous, which was a switch because he wasn\u2019t a bit nervous.</p><p>He took her hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on, sweet thang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s been a few months since the thing went down with Jake, this is the first social event I\u2019ve attended with industry professionals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought these people were your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out, won\u2019t we?\u201d She sighed. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m sure my poor little rich Hollywood girl whine is getting old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever apologize for how you feel. None of us has to walk in each other\u2019s shoes.\u201d He smirked and pointed to her feet. \u201cAnd no fuckin\u2019 way do I ever wanna walk in them babies.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou always make me feel better. Make me feel normal, no matter what I tell you. I just don\u2019t want to spend the whole night fielding questions about the Jake debacle or tell anyone where I\u2019ve been the last few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Chase stiffened beside her.</p><p>\u201cNot because I\u2019m embarrassed, Sundance. But because our time on the road together was our time. I don\u2019t want to share it with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Her sweetness always caught him off guard. \u201cSo don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Petra\u2019s place was a Park Avenue palace, marble floors, alabaster pillars, gilded wood, velvet and silk curtains, priceless tapestries on the walls and floor. The space screamed filthy rich, but it was cold. Unwelcoming.</p><p>So Chase was surprised Petra\u2019s house wasn\u2019t a reflection of her personality. Petra faked kissed him, cooed over his cuteness and whisked Ava away, leaving Chase alone.</p><p>Tuxedo-wearing waiters circled with trays with food that looked as if it\u2019d been zapped by a shrink ray gun. What was this town\u2019s fascination with miniaturized food?</p><p>He\u2019d knocked back half of a stiff drink when Petra\u2019s husband Arthur introduced himself and several of his friends. The men were fascinated by Chase\u2019s occupation. More respectful about it than he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>As Chase did more listening than talking, he appreciated the PR training he\u2019d had over the years. This nodding and smiling was actually easier than sucking up to sponsors, trying to charm them out of their money.</p><p>Ava was ready to leave before him, but by the time they\u2019d made the rounds, saying goodbye to everyone, he couldn\u2019t wait to take a breath of fresh air.</p><p>Until he actually inhaled stanky-ass New York City air.</p><p>Their driver directed them to the right car, since the all the damn service cars lined along the curb looked exactly the same.</p><p>Ava slipped her shoes off first thing and sighed.</p><p>He\u2019d never in a million years understand women and shoes. \u201cSo that was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t take this wrong, but you didn\u2019t have a problem fitting in with that crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d expected I\u2019d put my boots up on their Louis the Fourteenth furniture and challenge Arthur to a bare-chested wrassling match while swigging from a bottle of hooch?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo. God, no. It just struck me as odd that you were more nervous to meet Ryan\u2019s mom than some of the most powerful men in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose men have no power over me, Ava. But Ryan\u2019s mom? Shit. He\u2019d built me up to be a superhero, to the person who mattered most to him in his life. Meeting her and measuring up? That\u2019s humbling stuff.\u201d</p><p>Ava blinked at him.</p><p>Hell, was she...crying? \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are such a beautiful man. Inside and out. Thank you for going to the party with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He brought her hand to his mouth and kissed it. \u201cYou are gonna feed me real food now, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPoor starving baby. Want to brave the cameras and eat out? Or order room service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if you use some of that Cooper clout and get us a table at the hotel restaurant? You look too goddamn good to waste sitting on a bed in our suite.\u201d He grinned. \u201cBut feel free to leave them shoes on later.\u201d</p><p>After a leisurely meal, which turned out to be romantic and fun, even amidst a crowd, they returned to their room. Chase led Ava to the bedroom and stripped her slowly. Silently. When she was bare before him, he murmured, \u201cI knew I\u2019d find my Ava under here.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes, always so expressive, were oddly wary when she whispered, \u201cAm I really your Ava, Chase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn right you are. The rest of this stuff\u2014country boy, city girl\u2014doesn\u2019t matter. You understand that, right? I\u2019m not here with you because you\u2019re a celebrity, or because you\u2019re rich. I\u2019m with you because whenever we are, whether it\u2019s in Wyoming or Nebraska or New York City, it feels right. When I\u2019m with you, Ava, I feel like I\u2019m where I\u2019m meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not just the wine talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me talkin\u2019.\u201d Chase inhaled slowly, trying to calm the mad beat of his heart. \u201cAva. I love you.\u201d</p><p>A beat passed. She smiled cheekily. \u201cI figured since you ain\u2019t the type to wear your heart on your goddamn sleeve that I\u2019d have to say I love you first.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at her perfect imitation of his way of speaking. This woman rarely reacted as he\u2019d expected, which was just another reason he was so crazy in love with her.</p><p>\u201cMeeting you is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d She started in on his buttons. \u201cI\u2019m not here with you because you\u2019re a famous bad boy bull rider or because of your slamming body...okay that might be part of it.\u201d She kissed each inch of skin she exposed. \u201cI love everything about you. We fit together in so many ways. I never thought...I\u2019d find someone like you.\u201d</p><p>Was she really choked up, telling him how she felt? \u201cAva. You undo me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me to bed. I\u2019m dying for you.\u201d</p><p>Yep. Definitely in love with her.</p><p>\u201cIt says what?\u201d she practically shrieked.</p> <p>\u201cThe City Star has an exclusive with Chase McKay. And a picture of him shopping in a western store. Get this, one of his purchases was a...rope. Apparently he was pretty vague on what he planned on using it for in Manhattan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my fucking God, I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Hannah laughed. \u201cChill out, Ava. This is funny stuff, because you know he did it to make the reporter for the Talk of the Town look like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why didn\u2019t he tell me?\u201d Shit. He had told her he\u2019d handled it. And she shouldn\u2019t be shocked he\u2019d used a subversive tactic. \u201cWhat else does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe City Star says he visited FAO Schwartz and Tiffany\u2019s, creating speculation you\u2019re knocked up. So they\u2019re postulating he\u2019s buying you an engagement ring and baby items.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine it is for him too.\u201d Hannah giggled. \u201cAnd he ended his day with a visit to the Museum of Sex.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s thoughts returned to their sweetly intense lovemaking last night and the new things he\u2019d tried that\u2019d sent her into orgasmic overdrive. Twice.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t hear you complaining about that one,\u201d Hanna said with a rowr.</p><p>\u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Talk of the Town has photos of you guys leaving the hotel last night. Fabulous dress. Vivienne Westwood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore photos of you leaving Petra\u2019s apartment. Lastly a really grainy shot of him feeding you something at the hotel restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteak,\u201d she said distractedly. \u201cThe man is a meat-eating machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you plan to go out and tempt paparazzi today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. He\u2019s at the gym. I talked to Arthur a little last night. He was very helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far are you in the project?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting for her to send me stuff. It\u2019s on hold until that point or until...\u201d Ava scrolled over the images on the screen. Ryan smiling and talking to Chase.</p><p>When the door opened, she said, \u201cHan, I\u2019ve gotta go. I\u2019ll touch base with you later,\u201d and quickly closed the file on her laptop.</p><p>Chase flopped into the chaise. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah. Bringing me up to speed on today\u2019s reporting. Seems someone had a very busy day yesterday.\u201d</p><p>His bottle of water stopped halfway to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cReally, Chase? The Museum of Sex?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cHey, it is a museum. I was tryin\u2019 to get a little culture while I\u2019m in the big city, Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny. And for someone who was such a fit about going shopping with me, you managed to hit three different stores yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, you told me I needed clothes. Then I had time to kill so I picked up a stick horse for my nephew and a stuffed panda for my niece at the toy store. I wandered down the street and saw a fancy crystal vase in the window and knew my mother would get a kick out of a box from Tiffany\u2019s showing up in Wyoming. And while I was in there I found a lamp for Ben\u2019s desk and a picture frame for Quinn and Libby.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d really been shopping for his family? That was so unbelievably sweet. And out of character for the rough cowboy.</p><p>\u201cDid you buy anything for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He cocked his head. \u201cDid you buy anything for me when you went shopping yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But maybe we can pick out something for each other today when we go shopping together, since I now know you were lying through your pearly whites about hating to shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, I have plans today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of plans?\u201d And why didn\u2019t you tell me?</p><p>\u201cOne of Arthur\u2019s friends was talking about corporate sports sponsorships last night and I weighed in. Evidently I didn\u2019t come across sounding like a hick idiot because he called me this morning and invited me to lunch and a Yankees game.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWho invited you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBill Dahl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBill Dahl? Who used to work with Donald Trump? Who has box seats at Yankee Stadium invited you to his inner sanctum? God. Billion dollar deals are made in those seats. You realize that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it\u2019s not a big deal, Ava. Just a couple of guys eating hot dogs and bullshitting while watching a ball game.\u201d He popped to his feet. \u201cI better get in the shower. He\u2019s sending a car to get me in about fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes? That gives you enough time to get ready?\u201d</p><p>Chase rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou have clothes, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I thought I\u2019d stroll in buck-assed nekkid. Christ. I can dress myself. Sometimes I think you forget that I\u2019ve been on TV damn near once a week for the last eight years. So I have an idea how to conduct myself in a professional situation.\u201d</p><p>Now she felt like a snob. \u201cSorry. I do forget that.\u201d</p><p>Without prompting, he said, \u201cI love you,\u201d and smooched her on the mouth. \u201cThat guy who holds the door said the manager wanted to talk to you in his office as soon as it was convenient for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>\u201cCome on. I have something to show you.\u201d Ava draped a lightweight cashmere sweater over her arm and shouldered her purse. She was surprised Chase took her hand without asking questions.</p><p>Jason waited for them at the elevators. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll set.\u201d</p><p>In the elevator, Jason swiped a keycard and inserted a small key into the panel before punching in a code. He faced them as the elevator moved. \u201cEverything is set up as you requested. We have an event scheduled for noon, so the cleaning crew will arrive at six a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He stepped aside as the doors slid open. \u201cEnjoy your evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d Ava gripped Chase\u2019s hand and stopped in the center of the round room.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna tell me what\u2019s goin\u2019 on, Hollywood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t spent as much time together on this trip as I\u2019d hoped. So tonight, it\u2019s just us.\u201d</p><p>His gaze scanned the polished wood floors, the glass walls, and the three doors, which were open, allowing a breeze in. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe penthouse. It\u2019s rented out mostly for parties because...come on. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Ava tossed her purse and sweater on the settee. She lifted a brow. \u201cYou aren\u2019t afraid of heights?\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>Holding his hand, she led him out the door and straight to the edge of the wide walkway.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>That summed it up perfectly. The modified balcony surrounding the penthouse boasted a 360-degree view of the New York City skyline. A waist-high glass partition was the buffer between penthouse and the twenty-one stories to the busy street below.</p><p>Neither said anything for several long minutes as they drank in the spectacular view. Ava had timed it so they arrived just before twilight, which allowed them to watch day turn to night as the lights of the most famous skyline in the world came on.</p><p>They walked the perimeter, stopping every few feet to gaze across the rooftops and the cityscape beyond. Ava pointed out landmarks. This time of day the light reflecting off the Chrysler Building gave it a pinkish-orange hue.</p><p>When they reached the opposite side, Chase said, \u201cHoly shit,\u201d again.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like this.\u201d</p><p>A perpetual breeze blew due to the altitude. Ava\u2019s dress flapped around her knees. Strands of hair drifted across her face and she wished she\u2019d tied it back.</p><p>Chase rested his forearms on the glass ledge and peered over side. \u201cLong drop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ava matched his stance, switching her focus between the activity below and the buzz of helicopters and airplanes in the distance. She glanced at him when he snickered. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He raised his head and grinned at her slyly. \u201cThe little redneck boy inside me wants to spit over the side and see where it lands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can take the man out of Wyoming...but a little tobacco juice always remains.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled.</p> <p>They were shoulder to shoulder, enjoying the view when he turned around and pointed to the main space. \u201cWhat\u2019s around the corner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA living area with a kitchen and a bathroom. Behind that, a bedroom with two bathrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d A cool blast of air eddied around her and she shivered.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere. I\u2019ll keep you warm.\u201d Chase stepped behind her, wrapping his arms around her middle. When he nestled his chin on his shoulder, he sighed, \u201cWell, that ain\u2019t gonna work. You\u2019re blocking my view, bein\u2019s you\u2019re taller than me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you mind that I\u2019m taller?</p><p>\u201cNot so much anymore. Especially not when I see how sexy them sky-high heels makes your legs look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still won\u2019t dance with me.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his lips across the shell of her ear. \u201cI don\u2019t recall you asking me recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I turned on music up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d two-step with you all night.\u201d Chase swept his thumbs over her nipples until they hardened. \u201cWell, maybe not all night. I might have time for a little mattress dancing if you play your cards right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll cheat at cards if have to, to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHow often have you stayed in the penthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to surprise him. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s usually rented with weddings and parties. My visits to New York are spontaneous. As much as I love the penthouse and the view, hanging out up here all by myself is kind of a waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do sneak up if there isn\u2019t an event scheduled. There\u2019s something very humbling staring across all these high-rise buildings. I get that same feeling when I stare out at the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat feeling is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInsignificance. Here, I\u2019m one of millions of people. On my beach, I\u2019m as trivial as a grain of sand. Seeing proof of my irrelevance puts things in perspective for me, especially when I\u2019ve been puffed up by my own self-importance and have lost that insight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t lose that humbleness, Ava. It\u2019s one of my favorite things about you.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled into his arms, wishing she owned the right to be in them every night, fearful of bringing up the \u201cwhat happens next\u201d question.</p><p>Silence lingered as they watched the city lights blaze against the indigo sky.</p><p>Chase\u2019s hot mouth trailed kisses up and down the side of her neck.</p><p>She tilted her head to the side, offering him full access.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful all the time. But especially so tonight in this light. I want you.\u201d</p><p>A shudder of need rolled through her. \u201cI suppose that means I should show you the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened. \u201cNo. I want you like this. Right here. Right now. With the city lights shining like your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the paparazzi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t have a clue what we\u2019re doin\u2019.\u201d He gestured with is chin to the closest building, half a block away. \u201cCan you see in the windows from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen no one will see us, Ava. We\u2019ll look like two lovers lost in each other, admiring the view.\u201d</p><p>The idea of making love in public, but in a private setting, appealed to her. Yet, she couldn\u2019t help but compare it to her last rendezvous at her beach house. The humiliation when an intimacy simply became gossip fodder. She\u2019d never put Chase through that. \u201cChase\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, like you said, who\u2019ll notice us in a city of millions?\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be the same at all. Chase isn\u2019t like that other guy who wouldn\u2019t man up. Even if you are caught, Chase would stand beside you. He wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about anything you do together because he loves you.</p><p>His sweetly seductive warm lips brushed the shell of her ear. \u201cPlease,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Need. Not want. Ava turned and caught his mouth in a deep kiss.</p><p>He pulled back and his lips curved against her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 that as a yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLean forward a little and hold on to the partition.\u201d</p><p>She heard his clothes rustle. Then his rough-tipped fingers were teasing the backs of her thighs as he slowly lifted her dress to her hips. One finger traced the thin strap of her thong down the crack of her ass.</p><p>\u201cMove your feet out, tall girl, so I won\u2019t have to go on tiptoe to fuck you.\u201d</p><p>His rough-toned words were the best kind of foreplay. Heat and hardness pressed into her backside. Beneath the silky fabric of her sundress, Chase\u2019s hand followed the curve of her hip to the rise of her mound. His finger delved under the elastic band of her thong and stroked her slit. He groaned softly as he discovered she was already wet and ready.</p><p>\u201cCant your hips back, baby.\u201d</p><p>Soon as she moved, she felt the condom covered head prodding her entrance.</p><p>Chase fed his cock into her slowly, his hot breath tickling her ear. \u201cEver done it standing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver done it this close to the edge of a twenty-one-story building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But every time you touch me, Chase, you take me to that edge that always makes me dizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love this sweet talkin\u2019 side of you. I love all sides of you, Ava.\u201d That said, he thrust into her fully.</p><p>Ava bowed into the solid wall of his chest.</p><p>Eroticism bombarded her from all angles. The sights and sounds of the city. The temperate breeze washing over them. His firm grip on her left hip. The perfect friction of his shaft tunneling in and out on a slow glide. Then arbitrarily ramming harder. The teasing flick of his fingertip over her clit. The feel of his mouth tasting her skin from her bare shoulder to behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cChase...I\u2019m already...\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. It\u2019s too goddamn good with you. Every. Fucking. Time. Hold on. I don\u2019t wanna push you forward and send us crashing through the glass for the big finish.\u201d</p><p>She twined her left arm back and gripped his neck as he rammed into her more forcefully.</p><p>When he shoved deep and stayed lodged inside her, she shattered.</p><p>Chase breathed raggedly against her nape, his pelvis still bumping into her in tiny increments. \u201cAva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She turned her head, rubbing her damp cheek against his.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me.\u201d</p><p>He sank his teeth into her neck and she squealed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I love you, Chase.\u201d She loved his playful side. She loved his passionate side. She loved they fit together, no matter where they were. No matter who they were with. But she really loved just the two of them together.</p><p>Chase\u2019s voice dropped to a barely discernible growl. \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanna hear.\u201d He scooped her into his arms and carried her to the bedroom.</p><p>With pure male heat and hunger, he undressed her, then himself. This wasn\u2019t a sensual exploration resulting in an achingly sweet union of bodies. No. This was raw mating. He demanded. Took. Teased. And ultimately gave all of himself with such unending passion, he left her knowing no other man would ever reach inside her like he did.</p><p>Sated, spent and sleepy, Ava stretched out on her belly next to Chase as his fingers lazily trailed up and down her spine.</p><p>\u201cWas I too rough?\u201d</p><p>Did he sound worried? She rolled over to look him in the eyes. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a little carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that about you.\u201d Ava pecked him on the lips. \u201cEvery time I think you can\u2019t top the last go-round? You do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd because I know you\u2019re always famished after you ravage me, I took the liberty of ordering food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of food?\u201d</p><p>She traced the scar below his collarbone. \u201cYou seemed to like it when I hand-fed you, so the chef whipped up two trays of appetizers.\u201d</p><p>Chase froze.</p><p>Laughing, she kissed his nipple. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. I didn\u2019t want to be interrupted so we\u2019re having steak salad and other stuff that can be served cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has been great tonight. Just the two of us.\u201d He sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re always thinking of me, so I\u2019ve gotta admit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always thinking of you too, and I lied to you the other day. I did buy you something at Tiffany\u2019s. I\u2019ve been carryin\u2019 it around in my pocket because I ain\u2019t sure you won\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>Ava perked right up. \u201cA present? For me? I love presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s news,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cHand it over.\u201d</p><p>Grumbling, he moved and rummaged though his jeans pockets.</p><p>Her eyes focused on what he\u2019d clutched in his hand when he returned to bed.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d Something cool and hard landed just above her cleavage and his finger fumbled with the necklace clasp below her hairline. \u201cOkay. You can look. But if you don\u2019t like it, won\u2019t hurt my feelings if you wanna return it.\u201d</p><p>Ava glanced down as her fingers lifted the charm. A miniature rose. The twisty stem and tiny leaves were antique silver. The bloom, the size of an eraser, was milky white shot through with pink undertones. Delicate, old-fashioned and absolutely perfect.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find one like your grandpa gave you, and this was the closest I could come. The rose is carved out of rose quartz, which is all over Wyoming.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll think of you whenever I wear it.\u201d Like I\u2019ll ever stop thinking of you. Ava tried really hard not to cry, but a couple of tears slipped free. The last man who\u2019d given her jewelry had been her grandfather.</p><p>\u201cAva?\u201d Chase tipped her face up. \u201cAh, hell. Don\u2019t cry. I told you that you can take it back.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound half-laugh, half-sob. \u201cNo way am I taking it back, McKay. It\u2019s beautiful. Perfect. I love it. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>The guardedness in his eyes vanished. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Chase paced in the hotel room, glaring at his phone. He hadn\u2019t minded that the fucker hadn\u2019t worked at all yesterday, since he and Ava had spent the whole day in their room, most of it in bed after they\u2019d returned early in the morning from the penthouse.</p><p>Dammit. He needed to access his email. Nothing was showing up on his phone. And he\u2019d been in such a hurry to get away from the sorrow in Nebraska he\u2019d accidentally left his laptop in his truck at the Omaha airport.</p><p>His gaze landed on Ava\u2019s computer on the desk. She\u2019d left it on for a change. It\u2019d take him about two seconds to log on to his account. If Ava were here she\u2019d probably tell him to go ahead and borrow it.</p> <p>Two programs were running and he minimized them before clicking on her web browser. He typed in his server site, his password and waited while five days\u2019 worth of messages downloaded. Four jokes from Quinn. Eight forwards from his father, which made him smile.</p><p>When Charlie McKay first got daily computer access, he drove Chase insane with all the crap messages he forwarded. But at some point, Chase figured out those forwards, sometimes funny, sometimes politically incorrect, sometimes sentimental, were his dad\u2019s way of showing love. His way of telling his youngest son that he was thinking about him. Now he didn\u2019t mind them at all.</p><p>He scrolled through the messages. Inquiries from his website from fans wondering when he\u2019d be back in action. A notice from his credit card company about receiving his automatic payment. Same for his cell phone. Same for his rent. The last email, from Elroy, was time stamped roughly two hours ago, a form letter to all riders, regarding changes in the remaining schedule. Nothing new, just standard practice before an event. An event in Wichita he hadn\u2019t heard whether he\u2019d be competing in.</p><p>What would he do if that call never came?</p><p>Go to trade school? Chase didn\u2019t see himself working as a mechanic. Or running heavy equipment on a construction site. Or writing speeding tickets as a law enforcement officer.</p><p>Think harder.</p> <p>Chase pushed the chair back and stared at the bubbles popping up as the screen saver. He could ask if his buddy Darren needed an investor and hands-on help for his bull-breeding program in Oklahoma. Possibly Cash and Colby could get their venture off the ground sooner if they had a full-time partner who wasn\u2019t ranching. No one could deny he had more current contacts at various rodeos than either Colby or Cash.</p><p>Maybe you could try to become a stuntman in Hollywood.</p><p>Right. And if he wasn\u2019t successful at that, he\u2019d be mooching off Ava.</p><p>Ava. The woman turned him inside out. The other night had been nothing short of magical. Standing against the glass partition and looking straight down at the street below thirty stories in the air. Watching day fade to night. Witnessing the lights in the New York City skyline come to life. Dancing with her barefoot across the polished mahogany floor, lights and noise as a backdrop, feeling as if they were the only ones in the world\u2014even amidst a city of ten million. Laughing, carrying her to the gigantic canopied bed, swathed in silk and lace, a bed fit for a queen. Then he\u2019d made love to her, face to face, heart to heart, drunk on the scent of her skin, high on the sound of his name drifting from her sweet lips as a breathy moan, overwhelmed by her. By how much she made him feel.</p><p>The computer dinged, indicating a new email. He touched the mouse pad, tapping on the minimized mail icon. The sender was Jackie Ackerman. What? How had she gotten his personal email address? When he opened it and read, Ava, he realized he\u2019d mistakenly opened Ava\u2019s email program. He should\u2019ve exited out. But he didn\u2019t. He kept reading.</p><p>Ava,</p><p>Ryan\u2019s high school English teacher is pretty computer savvy and she\u2019s more than willing to help. I gave her a stack of Ryan\u2019s pictures to scan. She\u2019s also transferring old home videos into that format you suggested so you can add them to the recent footage you shot. That transfer process might take awhile. Just wanted to give you a heads-up so my portion doesn\u2019t hold up production.</p><p>Production? Of what?</p> <p>I\u2019m glad you\u2019re working on something that might shed some light on this. I never want to see or hear of another mother going through this. I\u2019ll keep in touch. Jackie</p><p>What the hell had Ava promised Ryan\u2019s mother?</p><p>He found her recent history and opened a flash file titled DOC-WIP current. His face filled up the screen. \u201cWhat do I like best about ridin\u2019 bulls?\u201d He watched himself scratch his chin. \u201cFor those eight seconds we\u2019re fighting to see who owns the most determination. Who\u2019s got the most try. Even a small man can best a beast.\u201d</p><p>The frame changed. A squinty-eyed Taz came into view. \u201cWhat do I like best about ridin\u2019 bulls?\u201d He glanced off to the left. \u201cOn a day like today, when I\u2019ve been beat to hell and I can\u2019t hardly wrap my hand in my bull rope because it\u2019s all swelled up?\u201d Taz raised his right hand into camera view and Chase winced. His entire hand was red and purple, puffed up like a bad bee sting. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you nothin\u2019 I like about it. But I sure can tell you a whole heap about what I hate.\u201d</p><p>The frame changed again. A grinning Ryan appeared. Grief sliced through Chase like a scythe through wheat. \u201cWhat do I like best about ridin\u2019 bulls?\u201d Ryan laughed. \u201cWell, mostly that I\u2019m finally old enough to ride \u2019em.\u201d He reached in his pocket and proudly whipped out his PRCA card, holding it close to the camera\u2019s lens. \u201cI guess what I like is how the experienced riders are around to help out. To offer advice. Like one of my friends said, it\u2019s not me versus him in the arena. It\u2019s us versus the bulls.\u201d</p><p>Chase closed his eyes, remembering the day he\u2019d said that to Ryan. Wishing the kid would\u2019ve listened to his other advice.</p><p>Wishing things had turned out differently won\u2019t change anything.</p><p>He opened his eyes as black letters formed on the screen. Chasing Eight: The Heartbreak Road To Rodeo Glory.</p><p>Scenery flew by, speeding to super fast until the time-lapse photography made it seem an entire day had passed. Then again the camera was focused on his profile, front lit by the dashboard lights.</p><p>Ava\u2019s voice, soft and curious, asked, \u201cWhat makes a champion? Besides winning the big belt buckle?\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s stomach clenched as he waited for his onscreen response. \u201cWinning is the only gauge of a champion. Lots of guys want it, they try for it, fight for it, spend years chasing it. If the title was applied to all the great men competing in the sport of bull ridin\u2019, just because they\u2019re great men? Then the title would be meaningless. A champion is called a champion because he\u2019s won. He\u2019s proven to be the best.\u201d</p><p>The next image was Chase receiving his championship buckle and oversized cardboard check at the Man of Steel competition last year. The announcer\u2019s words were lost in the thunderous crowd response. The noise and image faded to the next scene, the low fanfare of the Scottsbluff Rodeo win. Two officials shaking his hand. The camera panned the nearly empty stands and then zoomed to the cowboys who didn\u2019t win, as they packed up their gear behind the chutes.</p><p>A crash sounded onscreen. Although the screen remained blank, he heard his voice. \u201cI\u2019m nekkid here, Hollywood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that. What do you want me to do about it?\u201d she purred.</p><p>The dark screen morphed into a background of a cheap motel room. He watched Ava, fully clothed, crawling across the bed toward him. He tucked a wayward strand of hair behind her ear. His playfulness had vanished. His face was filled with such love, with such wonder, with such longing as he looked at Ava onscreen, that Chase\u2019s stomach clenched watching it.</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m too beat to shit even for a blowjob.\u201d Pain creased his brow. \u201cMy head is killin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want some aspirin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook it already. Didn\u2019t help. Which makes me wonder why am I even doin\u2019 this? Putting my body through hell every fuckin\u2019 night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just had a bad buck-off.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cLike that\u2019s news. The thing that really sucks is none of this matters. The injuries I get on the road trying to prove myself. The PBR will probably flip me the bird and not let me back on tour anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo quit.\u201d</p><p>Horror distorted his face. \u201cAnd do what? Bull ridin\u2019 is the only thing I want to do. It\u2019s the only thing I can do. It\u2019s my life. Who am I without it? Nobody, that\u2019s who.\u201d</p><p>Ava sat back on her haunches. \u201cYou\u2019re so much more than just a bull rider\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d he snapped. Sighing, he let his head fall back against the headboard. \u201cI need them to call me back. And the longer I have to wait, the less likely that phone call becomes.\u201d</p><p>Chase watched himself onscreen. Christ. Was he...crying with his eyes squeezed shut like that? Fucking awesome. He looked like a whiny-ass baby loser who complained about everything and couldn\u2019t even take his girlfriend up on giving him a blowjob.</p><p>She moved out of camera range.</p><p>His eyes snapped open and his gaze tracked Ava\u2019s movements across the room. \u201cWhere are you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need some air.\u201d</p><p>He reached a hand out to her. \u201cDon\u2019t go. I can\u2019t...\u201d His voice broke. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m an asshole tonight. I feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s cheeks burned. She\u2019d fucking taped this? He opened up to her and this was what she did? He thought back to that night. He\u2019d knocked his noggin pretty damn hard when he\u2019d hit the ground. No wonder he hadn\u2019t remembered much of the conversation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evidently he hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d set up a goddamn camera in their room either.</p><p>He hit the pause button, his head spinning, his gut churning, his thoughts focused on one awful thing.</p><p>Betrayal.</p> <p>Yes, he knew she\u2019d been taping all the fucking time, but he had no idea she\u2019d been making a goddamned movie. The whole time they were together. To think he\u2019d invited her to share his experiences on the road. He froze. Wait a second. He hadn\u2019t invited her. She\u2019d invited herself. Offering a convincing argument about wanting to see real life outside her poor, privileged upbringing.</p><p>But Chase sure as hell hadn\u2019t encouraged her to creep around, sticking that camera in everyone\u2019s face. Capturing their private moments. Having no shame in using them for her own gain. For a woman who claimed to hate the intrusion of paparazzi, she\u2019d become damn good at acting like one of them. She\u2019d promised him she wouldn\u2019t show her home movies to anyone.</p><p>A new thought chilled his blood. Did Ava have footage of Ryan\u2019s last ride? Of his lifeless body leaving the rodeo grounds?</p><p>He\u2019d trusted her. After keeping women around for recreational uses only, Chase had opened up to her. Told her things he\u2019d never shared with anyone. He\u2019d fallen in love with her.</p><p>Jesus. He was a fucking idiot. She was an actress. She\u2019d probably been acting the entire time.</p> <p>His bag was packed and on the bed in less than five minutes. Would he leave without explanation? Or stick around to hear hers? As he debated, the hotel door opened. Her voice carried to him.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I cannot believe New Yorkers\u2019 rudeness. All I asked for was plain honey for a bagel, instead of that nasty cinnamon honey spread. You\u2019d think I\u2019d asked the girl at the counter to track down a hive and gather a honeycomb herself.\u201d</p><p>The food bags hit the table. \u201cAnyway. Here\u2019s breakfast. Eat at your own risk. I\u2019m half-afraid she spit in the coffee.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t move from where he leaned against the doorjamb, she prompted, \u201cChase? You all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m trying really goddamned hard not to throw your computer on the floor and stomp it into pieces. But I\u2019m sure a smart cookie like you backed up all the important files, didn\u2019t you? So it\u2019d be pointless and I\u2019d probably hurt myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>Chase whirled around. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about the movie you\u2019ve been making since we met?\u201d</p><p>Her face, usually so animated, went completely blank. \u201cWhat were you doing on my computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChecking my email. Imagine my shock when I accidentally clicked on your account and an email from Jackie Ackerman showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had no right.\u201d</p><p>He was looming above her almost before she could blink. \u201cNo, you had no right. I had no idea what you were filming would be used for a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA documentary,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cWhen you offered to help me, I had no fuckin\u2019 clue you were really helping yourself, weren\u2019t you? Getting some juicy stuff, taping our private moments. Asking those annoying personal questions at every turn. Now I know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were eager for my help, if I recall. And if I\u2019d stayed focused on Chase McKay all the time\u2014that would\u2019ve been acceptable?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone of this is acceptable. Using me. Using Taz. Using Ryan.\u201d Chase stared at her as if he\u2019d never seen her. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell me what you were doin\u2019 when we\u2019ve been together every damn day for almost two months? But you told Ryan\u2019s mom? How did you get Jackie on board for this exploitation? What scene did you set? Did you promise this \u2018documentary\u2019 will bring her money?\u201d</p><p>Her hand cracked into his cheek.</p><p>He slowly straightened and backed away.</p><p>Ava scrambled after him. \u201cOh God, Chase. I\u2019m sorry. Let me see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never hit another person in my life. I don\u2019t know what got into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were acting. Playing the part of the outraged woman. Setting the scene. It\u2019s all second nature to you.\u201d</p><p>Again her face rivaled a statue\u2019s for stillness.</p><p>\u201cWas any of this real?\u201d He laughed harshly. \u201cNo. Of course it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m the typical dumb cowboy, believing a beautiful, filthy rich, famous woman like you could fall for a man like me. I probably deserve this. Maybe especially after my womanizing ways over the years. But knocked flat and humbled on camera before millions of people seems a harsh comeuppance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t acting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when it came to sex. Some things can\u2019t be faked.\u201d</p><p>Ava wrapped her arms around herself and looked away.</p><p>Then Chase knew. She couldn\u2019t fake her body\u2019s reaction to him, but she could set the scene to force his hand. \u201cThat first time... Now that I think about it, the loser bar rat in our room. He was a total plant, wasn\u2019t he? A guy supposed to drive me into a jealous rage. Force me into taking you to bed before another man beat me to it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t deny anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the lapse in judgment. I\u2019ll take my licks for bein\u2019 played for a fool by you. But I will take them in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter bein\u2019 in the PBR for years, I know enough about release forms to remember that I didn\u2019t sign anything that allows you to use any images of me. No pictures, no sound bites, no videos, no quotes, nothin\u2019. You go ahead and make your documentary, Ava, but leave me out of it. There better not be a single word, a single image or a single reference to me anywhere. And if there is? I will file a lawsuit the likes of which you\u2019ve never seen. You may have money, honey, but in the court of law, it\u2019s all about who has the best lawyer. And I guarantee you the one I have on retainer, from the last unauthorized use of my image incident? Lives for shit like this. He\u2019ll make your previous skirmish with the press look like a fuckin\u2019 picnic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot about this I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re wrong about me. And if you\u2019d stop acting like the wounded male and let me explain, instead of jumping to the worst possible conclusion\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cWill you shut up and listen?\u201d Ava drew herself to her full height and looked down on him. But her eyes strayed to the red mark burning on his cheek. Her face held that delicate thread of a woman about to crumble. \u201cI didn\u2019t pull a fast one on you. From the first day I left Denver and stopped periodically to dink around with my cameras, I had no idea what to do with the footage I\u2019d shot. I\u2019d vaguely considered using the scenery as inspiration for a screenplay, which I freely told you the first day we spent together. When I started taping your rides? That changed everything for me. Not because I wanted to exploit you, but everything about your life as a bull rider fascinated me. Scared me. I\u2019d never met anyone like you. That\u2019s not me bullshitting you. That\u2019s not me acting, for Christsake.\u201d She poked him in the chest hard with her perfectly manicured fingernail. \u201cAnd fuck you for thinking what happened between us, either between the sheets or on the road, was acting on my part. It was real. As real as it gets. At least I can admit it. At least I\u2019m not freaking out and backtracking like you are, because you\u2019re scared shitless you admitted I\u2019m more than another fuck-and-run encounter.\u201d</p><p>Damn woman saw too much. \u201cGet to the fuckin\u2019 point, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter seeing the events at that first rodeo, I thought maybe I was on to something. Especially after meeting Ryan and Taz. The three of you were in different places in your riding careers. The new footage became more focused. I asked questions that would support the images I\u2019d gotten. But my ideas were still being processed. I didn\u2019t tell you what I was working on, not because I was creating some big, goddamn, rip-your-life-to-shreds secret video. I couldn\u2019t tell you because I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was doing.\u201d She retreated to gaze out the window. \u201cThat changed when Ryan died. I knew some of what I had could be molded into a documentary. A look at Ryan\u2019s life and the tragedy of his death. But I\u2019d never do something like that without his mother\u2019s consent. Taz approached me at Ryan\u2019s funeral about compiling some of Ryan\u2019s rides for Jackie. He must\u2019ve told her about it, because she contacted me. So that\u2019s where I am. Trying to help a brokenhearted mother put the pieces together.\u201d</p><p>Her voice caught and Chase fought the urge to go to her.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe I don\u2019t know you as well as I thought I did either. I can\u2019t believe after what I\u2019ve been through you\u2019d consider, for even one nanosecond, I would willingly, gleefully put another human being though that bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Now Chase was really confused.</p><p>His cell buzzed and he plucked it out of his pocket. He put a fake note of cheer in his voice. \u201cElroy. I hope you\u2019re calling me with good news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re officially back on the PBR roster and scheduled to compete in Wichita next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kiddin\u2019? That\u2019s great.\u201d He allowed a tight laugh. \u201cI was getting worried. No word from the powers that be. And then, I\u2019ve, ah, been in the press the last few days a little more than you\u2019d like, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, the coverage of you and Miz Cooper weighed in your favor for a change.\u201d</p><p>Talk about a shocker. \u201cIt did? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re finally with a woman who\u2019s newsworthy in her own right, and not by virtue of her association with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid that make sense in your head before you said it? \u2019Cause that didn\u2019t make a lick of sense on my end.\u201d</p><p>Elroy laughed. \u201cYou two are a match made in PR heaven. Even though some tabloid rags are claiming your whole relationship is a publicity stunt.\u201d Elroy paused. \u201cIs it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. And here\u2019s fair warning: that is not a topic of discussion.

You\u2019re in New York now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get you to Wichita directly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBook me into Omaha. I left my truck there.

As soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Ava stared at him with shock.</p><p>\u201cThe event isn\u2019t for another couple days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that. But there are other things I need to take care of first.\u201d</p><p>Elroy sighed. \u201cFine. Contact me when you get to Kansas. And I don\u2019t gotta remind you no press unless you\u2019re escorted by a PBR media liaison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. I\u2019ll keep in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Elroy hung up.</p> <p>Chase returned to the bedroom and picked up his bag.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo discussion. No yelling, no hashing it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is there to hash out? You knew I\u2019d be gone the second the PBR called me back. Getting my bull ridin\u2019 mojo back was the only reason we were even traveling together.\u201d Chase held out his bag. \u201cThis is my life, Ava. Not this.\u201d He gestured to the fancy digs surrounding them.</p><p>\u201cYou told me there were more important things in life than being a bull rider.\u201d</p><p>Chase looked her in the eye and said, \u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>Although it pained him, he shouldered his equipment bag and walked out.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Ava had been mindlessly staring out the window, crying and wallowing in self-recrimination, when her phone buzzed. Hoping it\u2019d be Chase, she answered without checking the caller ID. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Who is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling on behalf of Nina Beal, senior VP of Montieth Associates. Nina is requesting an in-person meeting with you regarding a possible audition for a new sitcom slated to start production next week.\u201d</p><p>Why were they calling her directly? \u201cThis request was approved through my agency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarnie Driscoll was contacted and gave us this number.\u201d</p><p>This was Marnie\u2019s way of giving Ava full responsibility for declining the audition. \u201cWhat is the in-place date for the meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThursday. One o\u2019clock. At the Burbank office.\u201d</p><p>Looked like she\u2019d be home sooner than she\u2019d planned. \u201cThat will work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We look forward to seeing you then, Miss Cooper.\u201d</p><p>A casting call. For a new sitcom. She could throw herself into familiar work for the next year and put this summer behind her. Chase had been right about one thing, they both needed to get back to their real lives. And for her, that mean a major overhaul of the way she\u2019d been living. She intended to make changes across the board and start with a clean slate. In both her professional and personal life.</p><p>She blew her nose and hoped she didn\u2019t sound as if she\u2019d spent the last two hours bawling when she dialed her parent\u2019s home number.</p><p>\u201cAnd to what do I owe the pleasure of a phone call from my beautiful daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeya, Dad. I just wanted to talk. I know it seems like the only time I call you is when I want something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Well, maybe. I want to ask you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it bug you that I don\u2019t take an interest in Dumond Racing? That every time you\u2019ve asked me in the past decade to come to a race or hang out at an event I\u2019ve said no?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, \u201cI know you\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer. Be honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, as long as you asked, yeah, it does bug the crap out of me. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re embarrassed that your dad is a former grease monkey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not embarrassed. God, I\u2019m embarrassed for myself for being so oblivious to anyone\u2019s feelings but my own. You raised me better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d He paused again. \u201cAva, what is this really about?\u201d</p><p>His voice was so soft and gentle, more tears fell. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to think over the past couple months. I\u2019ve watched my...friend come to terms with family issues and I saw a lot of myself in him. I realized I haven\u2019t been a good daughter, or a good sister, or even a halfway decent supporter of Dumond Racing. I\u2019m so mired in my own stupid, petty problems that I\u2019ve let important things slide. Important people.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cYou are important to me Dad, and I love you. And I\u2019m sorry for acting like such a brat. But I can change. I want to change.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cCan you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. And I will let you make it up to me in two weeks when you attend the Dumond Racing Team trials at Breakwater Speedway. I\u2019ll warn ya. Lots of media. Oh, and your brother is in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle it. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Although, in all fairness, I\u2019ve gotta point out that you ignore your mother\u2019s business just as much as you do mine.\u201d</p><p>Ava laughed. \u201cWell, she\u2019s next on the apology chain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, sweetie, so there\u2019s no need to go through this twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I on conference call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m tired of hearing about your life third or fourth hand,\u201d her mother chastised.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so why don\u2019t you tell us firsthand how in the devil you hooked up with a bull rider?\u201d her father prompted.</p><p>She tried to keep things light lest she start bawling again. \u201cI take offense to your term \u2018hook up\u2019 Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I meant. Start talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met Chase McKay in Wyoming through Ginger Paulson. I traveled with him on the rodeo circuit for a few weeks and he came to New York with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull riding is a damn dangerous job.\u201d</p><p>You don\u2019t know the half of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d her mother asked. \u201cBecause I\u2019m sure the pictures in the papers don\u2019t do him justice. He looks buff. Mysterious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of God, Eileen, really? This is the direction you\u2019re taking this conversation?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cIf your father is offended by the graphic details you want to share with your mama about that hot cowboy\u2019s attributes, we\u2019ll kick him off the line.\u201d</p><p>Her dad snorted. \u201cAs glad as I am you called, Daughter, this is where I hang up.\u201d Click.</p><p>Her mother snickered. \u201cToo easy. Now. Spill your guts because this Chase guy. He\u2019s the one, isn\u2019t he? That\u2019s the reason you\u2019re keeping him to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, Ava broke down. She wished she could crawl through the phone line onto her mother\u2019s lap. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d find someone like him. He\u2019s the best friend I\u2019ve ever had and he drives me crazy. He\u2019s bossy and so sweet that I melt whenever he touches me even when I want to scream at him. I\u2019m so in love with him it\u2019s scary. And funny. And pathetic. And what the hell am I gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he feel the same way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he did, until... I don\u2019t know how to explain because it still doesn\u2019t feel wrong to me. I think he\u2019s overreacting, but he\u2019s pissed off. And he just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened.\u201d After she finished, her mother said, \u201cHmm,\u201d not in a good way.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ava blew her nose. \u201cAm I a spoiled brat who doesn\u2019t think of anyone but myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. But as human beings, we\u2019re all like that. I understand why he\u2019s upset. You took something very personal and intend to turn it into something public without consulting him. So he\u2019s questioning your motives, and he probably fears you\u2019ve been acting with him this entire time.\u201d</p><p>Ava felt like she could throw up because Chase had said that very thing. \u201cI wasn\u2019t. I love him. I told him I love him. And he took off anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that callback from the PBR what he\u2019d been waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is his career, Ava. You, of all people, should understand that. If the situation were reversed? If your agent had called during the fight? What would you have done? Taken off, the same thing Chase did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cReally? Well, that\u2019s new. Tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>Ava talked about what she\u2019d seen and experienced over the last few weeks and how it\u2019d changed her, not only personally but career-wise. It felt good to bounce ideas off her mom, because she defined savvy businesswoman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Ava. I\u2019ve always been proud of you even when I didn\u2019t understand your love of show business. But I\u2019m happy to hear you\u2019ve figured out you\u2019re more than an actress and want to try other things within the industry. I\u2019d be happier yet if you asked to come to work for me.\u201d</p><p>Ava laughed and sniffled. \u201cNo way. We\u2019d kill each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. Anyway, I\u2019m also happy that you found your other half.\u201d Her mom got quiet for a second. \u201cMy life would be hollow without your father in it. Having a successful career is great, but being in a loving relationship is even better. So back to the Chase issue...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive him time. Don\u2019t call him, don\u2019t text him, don\u2019t IM him, don\u2019t email him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom. I don\u2019t think playing games will work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this isn\u2019t a game. This is a way to show him what a big hole his life will have without you in it. You\u2019ve been joined at the hip for almost two months. Let him miss you, sweetie. Let yourself know what it\u2019s like to really miss him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if that doesn\u2019t work? Go with plan B.\u201d</p><p>Her mother, businesswoman extraordinaire, always had a backup plan. \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrack him down, tie him up and force him to listen to reason. It helps if you\u2019re naked. And holding beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Mom. I don\u2019t think that will work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure did with your dad. Good luck, sweetie, keep in touch.\u201d</p><p>Ava packed her bag and booked a commercial flight to LA.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I so nervous?\u201d Ava asked Hannah, two days later.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I think after the audition.\u201d Hannah straightened Ava\u2019s miniskirt for the third time.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not helping my nerves.\u201d She tried not to think that Chase would know exactly what to say to her to calm her down. The door to the conference room opened and a long-legged blond strolled out. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for you, Miss Cooper.\u201d</p><p>Ava squeezed Hannah\u2019s hand and followed Corporate Casting Barbie into the conference room. Well, at least this production company didn\u2019t have the clich\u00e9d casting couch. Ava chose the chair directly in the middle, across from the desk of the three executives who were too busy on their phones to acknowledge her.</p><p>Finally another blonde met Ava\u2019s gaze and smiled coolly. \u201cI\u2019m Nina Beal. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Miss Cooper. I was a huge fan of Miller\u2019s Ridge. Pity it got cancelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The man sporting a Groucho Marx mustache peered at her over the top of his glasses. \u201cWe\u2019ve cast the two stars of this show. We\u2019re casting secondary characters. The part you\u2019re being considered for is Mamie\u2019s best friend, Sally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSally is the opposite of our quirky, fun-loving, serial dating, always-finding-man-trouble main character, Mamie,\u201d the other man, who looked like Woody Allen\u2019s younger, nerdier brother, inserted.</p><p>So Sally was the stick-in-the-mud sidekick. How fun. \u201cWhat ages are these characters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust out of college.\u201d The woman studied Ava openly. \u201cShe could pass as twenty-two. If we darkened her hair more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely put a pair of eyeglasses on her.\u201d</p><p>The Groucho guy said, \u201cWhat about brown contacts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019d also suggest taping her chest to downplay the size of it.\u201d</p><p>Ava clenched her teeth, but couldn\u2019t maintain a fake smile.</p><p>They talked among themselves. Argued. Gestured to her as if she was part of the furniture.</p> <p>That attitude didn\u2019t used to bother her. But it did now. As an actress, she\u2019d seen herself as a piece of clay. Ready to adapt to the director\u2019s vision. Put the right words in her mouth and she could be anyone. Any time. Any place.</p><p>But today the clay comparison didn\u2019t work. Today she felt like a mannequin.</p><p>It became very quiet and all eyes zoomed to her. She cleared her throat. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased you agreed to meet with us. Given the issues you\u2019ve faced the last couple months, it\u2019s understandable you\u2019re looking to lose yourself in a new role.\u201d</p><p>That comment sent up her red flags.</p><p>\u201cPity your agent couldn\u2019t be here or we could get the details ironed out right now because shooting starts next week.\u201d</p><p>This was all kinds of wrong. Enough. She was done.</p><p>Ava stood. \u201cThank you for your time and my agent will be in touch.\u201d She didn\u2019t stop walking until she was through the conference door and standing on the sidewalk.</p><p>Hannah snagged her elbow and tugged her around the corner. \u201cWell? Did they offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t want it.\u201d She looked Hannah square in the eyes. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t want to be an actress at all anymore. There are so many other things I\u2019d rather do with my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva, when did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been building for a while. Don\u2019t tell me the see-all, know-all Hannah missed it?\u201d</p><p>Instant skepticism tightened Hannah\u2019s face. \u201cHow much of this change has to do with the cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d Ava folded her arms. \u201cBut only because he showed me parts of myself that I wasn\u2019t aware of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t explain it. I feel more like...me, the real me when I\u2019m around him. Everything was better. Freer. I\u2019ve been waiting my whole life to feel that way. And I know he felt the same.\u201d His words, whispered the last night they were together, when he thought she was asleep, haunted her. I love you, Ava Rose. Goddamn, what am I gonna do about you?</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to tell me what happened in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase borrowed my computer and saw the mock-up film I\u2019d started with the footage I\u2019d shot at the rodeos of him and Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it over between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. There\u2019s too much...there. Know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Hannah shook her head.</p><p>But the too much portion of her comment sent Ava\u2019s thoughts spinning. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I have enough footage to make two documentaries. So I could make one without Chase\u2019s image, or approval, not that I want to do that. But if I had something to show him, I could convince him this is a worthwhile documentary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he still says no?\u201d</p><p>Ava looked Hannah in the eye. \u201cThen I go to plan B.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Meanwhile...outside Sundance...</p><p>Gavin Daniels turned down the air conditioning in the rental car. The outside temperature, according to the Lexus XLV, hovered around one hundred degrees. Hot for anyone, except a Phoenix native used to seeing the mercury hit one hundred fifteen degrees regularly in the summer months. He appreciated the heat in Wyoming owed nothing to humidity. Hot and dry he could handle. Hot and wet made him want to peel his soggy skin from his bones.</p><p>This trip had been a long time coming. If he was the morose type, he might say all his life. His mother\u2014God rest her soul\u2014had encouraged him to take the journey. As much as he loathed the idea of deathbed promises, that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019d done in the days before she\u2019d slipped away forever.</p><p>The aftermath of her death was a blur. Grief claimed his attention for several months. After that, he\u2019d dealt with the consequences of neglecting his business while he grieved. Then he\u2019d been waylaid by his daughter\u2019s rubber ball tendency\u2014bouncing to whichever parent offered respite from the other parent. Add in his ex-wife\u2019s histrionics...that was just another reminder of why Ellen was his ex. Didn\u2019t take more than a simple glance at the calendar to know the last eighteen months had been the shittiest time of his life.</p><p>When the dust settled, he was faced with the one-year anniversary of his mother\u2019s passing. With that shock came the guilt he hadn\u2019t accomplished the one final thing she\u2019d requested.</p><p>Gavin booked a flight into Rapid City. He\u2019d secured a couple nights at a bed and breakfast between Sundance and Moorcroft. Which was quite a feat, according to the information he\u2019d gathered online, because it was the height of tourist season in the Black Hills around Devil\u2019s Tower, a stopping point on the road to Yellowstone. He\u2019d lost track of the number of motor homes and out-of-state license plates he\u2019d passed on I-90.</p><p>The female voice on the GPS announced, \u201cTurn left in point one mile. You have reached your destination.\u201d</p><p>No going back now. Unless once he saw the turnoff he just kept driving right on past it. As the mailbox entered his line of sight, he realized he was unprepared for any outcome in this situation, be it total exuberance, flat-out denial or complete apathy.</p><p>That\u2019s when Gavin admitted to nerves, to trepidation, to betrayal, to an underlying sense of...wrongness. Add in paranoia and he might as well be thinking about the hours leading up to his disastrous marriage. That made him smile briefly, but he sobered when he recognized the sad truth that hope hadn\u2019t surfaced in his emotional turmoil.</p><p>When he pulled up to the well-kept ranch house, a couple sat on a porch swing in the shade. Enjoying a normal afternoon. Blissfully unaware.</p><p>His heart pounded. Sweat broke out on his brow, yet a clammy feeling slithered down his spine.</p><p>The couple stood and started down the steps. Probably wondering what business he had in the middle of nowhere. Probably thinking he was lost.</p><p>Gavin ditched his sunglasses and opened the car door. He jammed his hands in the front pockets of his khaki pants, because he didn\u2019t know what else to do with them.</p><p>The man and woman were equally wary, stopping five feet from him. Waiting.</p><p>For what?</p><p>For him to be the first one to speak? To explain?</p><p>Near as he could tell, they were the ones who had a helluva lot of explaining to do.</p><p>He turned his focus to the man. Probably in his early sixties. He wasn\u2019t tall; he wasn\u2019t short, just average height. Solidly built, not fat, not skinny, not muscular, not wiry, but his carriage and clothing screamed physical laborer. He had a full head of black hair randomly streaked with silver. When Gavin met the man\u2019s eyes, blue eyes identical to the ones staring back at him in the mirror every day, he quickly looked away. Which allowed him to direct his attention to the woman.</p><p>Again, she was average height. A little on the plump side. Her hair was short, curly as if she\u2019d recently had a perm, a rich dark brown as if she\u2019d recently colored it. She wore her age more obviously than the man did, crinkly frown lines by her mouth, on her forehead and beside her eyes, as if she\u2019d spent her life worrying. Despite Gavin\u2019s initial judgment of dowdiness, she wore trendy eyeglasses and dressed in a style he\u2019d call country chic. She appeared the type who\u2019d give out hugs, cookies and advice. She didn\u2019t look like the type of woman who\u2019d give away her child.</p><p>The man put his arm around the woman\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSomething I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Are you Charles McKay and Violet Bennett McKay?\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a look. \u201cYes, we are. Who wants to know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d</p><p>Gavin took a deep breath. \u201cI believe I\u2019m your son.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>The crowd roared behind him, ready to party at the PBR on a Saturday night.</p><p>Chase braced himself. The PBR\u2019s newest female reporter, a fiery redhead named Lissa, stuck the microphone in his face as soon as he cleared the contestant gate. He\u2019d been expecting it since he\u2019d avoided an on camera interview last night. To ensure his cooperation, the cameraman blocked him in. Bastard.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here with Chase McKay after that amazing ninety-one point ride on Devil\u2019s Due. Congratulations, Chase, that\u2019s gotta feel good to be back on top.\u201d</p><p>He focused on the woman and not the camera. \u201cIt does. Especially after an extended break and such a poor showing in Dallas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell us about the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Devil\u2019s Due is an ornery little cuss and highly unpredictable, so I wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d go into spin mode tonight or hopscotch around. Luckily I was able to stay with him no matter what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the past few weeks you\u2019ve been off the tour to deal with a recurrence of your shoulder injury from last year. Are you still having issues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. The time off allowed me to find my focus again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you accomplish that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went back to basics. Tried to fix what wasn\u2019t working with my ridin\u2019. I was fortunate to have two former PRCA bull riders helpin\u2019 me get back on track.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt appears to\u2019ve worked, since you\u2019re seated first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. The thing I learned, or maybe relearned, is to focus on the bull I\u2019m on and not worry about the next bull or the money or the points or where I might land on the leader board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood advice that\u2019s obviously paid off. Two questions. You\u2019ve come back to the PBR tour more confident and more aggressive. And it\u2019s interesting to see you\u2019ve swapped out your usual black cowboy hat for a safety helmet. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a dangerous sport, and any time a rider has a chance to protect himself with additional safety equipment, I\u2019m all for it. I\u2019ve had a couple of close calls in recent years. I\u2019ve witnessed horrible accidents with other riders that would\u2019ve been preventable had the rider worried less about appearances and more about safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoken like a new convert.\u201d Lissa flashed a dazzling smile\u2014a sign she was about to go in for the kill. \u201cLast question, and I\u2019m sure your fans are dying to get the scoop, straight from the source. You\u2019ve recently been spotted with actress Ava Cooper. Is love in the air?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike my brother Ben has been reminding me, a gentleman doesn\u2019t kiss and tell.\u201d</p><p>She laughed provocatively. \u201cCan you at least say whether there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll be seeing Miss Cooper cheering you on in the stands at future PBR events?\u201d</p><p>Not a snowball\u2019s chance in hell because I\u2019m a freakin\u2019 idiot wasn\u2019t an approved PR response, so he managed a curt, \u201cYou never know who\u2019ll show up.\u201d</p> <p>Lissa ended the interview. He scaled the risers to watch the remaining action; aware the cameras would keep cutting to him because he was sitting in first place with only seven riders to go.</p><p>He bullshitted with the guys while he waited to help his buddy, Dirk, pull his rope. Other riders seemed surprised he stuck around. Used to be, Chase didn\u2019t make much time for riders outside his circle of four or five since he\u2019d been so focused on finding a buckle bunny to hook up with after the event.</p><p>Getting to know Ryan, even for a brief amount of time, had changed Chase for the better in so many ways.</p><p>Dirk was up next. Chase held the bull rope taut while Dirk rosined his glove. Soon as Dirk had his wrap, Chase and another rider named Reese kept Dirk upright on the bull by holding his vest. Dirk yelled, \u201cGo!\u201d and the gate opened.</p><p>Everything went wrong from the moment the bull exited the chute. His massive rear end smacked into the barricade, immediately sending Dirk sideways. Dirk started to right himself on the next rapid fire jump, but the bull\u2019s head reared up the same time Dirk\u2019s body bounced forward. The side of Dirk\u2019s face connected with the bull\u2019s skull, knocking Dirk out completely. But his hand was hung up in the rope.</p><p>Chase stared in horror as Dirk\u2019s unmoving body dangled and was jerked about, his bloody face continually smacked into the bull\u2019s side. Twice Dirk narrowly missed the horn piercing his face.</p><p>Seemed like an eternity before the bullfighters freed Dirk\u2019s hand and got him out of harm\u2019s way. But Dirk wasn\u2019t moving and the sports medicine team was hustling out.</p><p>Just like Ryan.</p><p>No, goddammit, this was not happening again. For some reason, Chase glanced up and saw the images of Dirk\u2019s bloody, battered face splashed across the big screens.</p><p>\u201cFucking vultures.\u201d</p><p>Before Chase thought it through, he jumped down from the chute and raced across the arena. The bullfighters didn\u2019t try and stop him as he put himself between Dirk and the camera, with a snarled, \u201cBack. Off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just doing my job, man. Move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d</p><p>The cameraman dodged and weaved. So did Chase.</p><p>Chase crowded him, so the only thing the camera picked up was an extreme close up of Chase\u2019s vest. Which forced the cameraman to shuffle back, which is exactly what Chase wanted.</p><p>\u201cLet me do my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFilm something else because you\u2019re not getting close to him. I\u2019ll bust that camera into a dozen pieces and throw it and you in the dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see that you\u2019re suspended for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll see you\u2019re fined for exploiting the images of a head trauma. But you wouldn\u2019t have as many of these images to splash across the big screen if the PBR stepped up and mandated all riders wear safety helmets.\u201d</p><p>The cameraman stopped trying to circumvent Chase and kept the camera trained on him.</p><p>\u201cDoes a PBR bull rider have to die from head injures on camera in full gory detail before changes are enforced? Haven\u2019t we learned after what happened to Lane Frost? Only after the shock of his death were protective vests made mandatory for bull riders. It makes me sick to think that another bull rider will have to die before we start protecting their heads as well as their hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirk is a friend of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not just about Dirk. It\u2019s about all bull riders in all professional rodeo organizations. A few weeks back the world lost a promising young man, a friend of mine, because he wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet. And now he\u2019s...\u201d Chase looked away, fighting the hitch in his voice and squeezing back angry tears. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. Would a helmet have made a difference? Without a doubt. But no one made him wear it, so he didn\u2019t. But he sure as hell had the vest on. Didn\u2019t do a damn thing to save his head.\u201d</p><p>The stretcher was airborne and the sports medicine team hustled out to scattered applause. Chase jogged after them, ignoring the cameraman\u2019s shouts.</p><p>Once they reached the bowels of the arena where no cameras were allowed, Chase swallowed the lump of fear. \u201cHow bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcussion. Broken nose. Possibly a shattered cheekbone. They\u2019ll know more after he\u2019s admitted and tests are run.\u201d</p><p>A garage door rolled up and an ambulance backed in. Chase forced his feet to move as he headed for his truck. The last thing he wanted was to deal with the other riders and the PBR officials about his impromptu speech. Chances were good it\u2019d been cut out of the TV broadcast. But plenty of people had seen it live. And it wouldn\u2019t be the first time his actions ended up on YouTube courtesy of personal video devices.</p><p>That made him think of Ava. Everything made him think of her. Christ, he missed that woman. He hated how it ended. So abruptly. With such anger. With such a feeling of betrayal. Although she\u2019d tried to explain, he\u2019d been too irate to listen to her excuses.</p><p>Hours later, Chase left the hospital and climbed in his truck. With all that\u2019d gone on, he hadn\u2019t checked his phone since before the event. No messages or calls from Ava. Two from Elroy. Four from Ben. That quickened his pulse. Ben never left a message and he\u2019d left...four? Since seven o\u2019clock tonight?</p><p>Midnight in Wyoming. He dialed anyway.</p><p>Ben answered on the second ring. \u201cHey, little bro. Thanks for calling me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s late\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured it would be, with your buddy Dirk getting stomped and your tirade on TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. They didn\u2019t cut to commercial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But I\u2019m not calling you to rib you about that. Something has come up and you need to come home right away.\u201d</p><p>His heart dropped to his toes. \u201cWhat happened? Is it Dad? Or Mom?\u201d</p><p>Ben sighed. \u201cBoth. They asked me to call since you don\u2019t always get back to them after they\u2019ve left a message.</p><p>Guilt kicked him in the ass.</p><p>\u201cThey wanna to talk to us. And they\u2019ve refused to discuss what it is until we\u2019re all in the same room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s goddamn cryptic. What could be so important they can\u2019t tell us over the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, it came up awful damn quick. No warning, no nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you and Quinn haven\u2019t been mulling it over a few days and just decided to contact me?\u201d Not that Chase would blame them for holding back because they knew he preferred no contact until a PBR event ended.</p><p>\u201cNope. Look, we all watched you tonight. Heckuva ride. You deserve to be in first place and have a good shot of winning the whole event.\u201d Ben paused. \u201cI\u2019m sure Mom and Dad will understand if you can\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>What Ben was too kind to say? Mom and Dad will understand because they\u2019re used to you disappointing them.</p><p>After hearing the worry in Dirk\u2019s brother\u2019s voice and his promise to get to Wichita as soon as possible, Chase felt the full weight of his choice to keep his family at arm\u2019s length these last few years. If the situation was reversed, and Dirk was making the call to his family, who in his family would hop in the car and drive all night? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Quinn?

I ain\u2019t gonna be the one who lets Mom and Dad down.\u201d</p><p>Ben was very quiet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have changed. I\u2019m looking forward to seein\u2019 you. Drive safe.\u201d</p><p>Immediately after Chase hung up he called Elroy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not be calling me to bail you outta jail, McKay,\u201d Elroy barked.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning to you too, sunshine. I\u2019ll keep this brief. I have a family emergency in Wyoming and I\u2019m taking off right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Hold on. You\u2019re leaving Wichita? Chase. Did it escape your notice that you\u2019re in first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t, trust me. But it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>Elroy sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at your first event win in over a year. On your first tour stop after the suspension. How can you walk away from that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat puts us in a helluva bind, especially after the stuff you spewed on live camera tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my problem. I said my piece, I meant what I said and I won\u2019t issue a retraction. If the PBR wants to add a disclaimer that I spoke on my own behalf, and not on behalf of the organization, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re not making a calculated move? Leaving abruptly to build the buzz? And adding to the speculation you\u2019re involved with Ava Cooper since she wasn\u2019t at the event with you?\u201d</p> <p>Chase counted to twenty before he spoke. \u201cThat bullshit PR spin stuff is suited for your devious mind, Elroy, not mine. I\u2019d rather get on a bull tomorrow afternoon, win the event and pick up a big, fat check than spend twelve hours in my truck driving home to deal with family issues. As far as Ava, she\u2019s not a topic of discussion. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Elroy laughed. \u201cThe one time you\u2019ve actually got a decent hook-up that could be worth great press for months to come, you\u2019re telling me...no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you fuck no.\u201d Chase hung up. He stopped at the first convenience store and loaded up on Rockstar Energy drinks and sunflower seeds. When he saw the bag of red licorice he automatically threw it in the pile, like he always did, only realizing when he reached the truck his licorice-eating copilot wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>It\u2019d be a long goddamn drive without her.</p><p>No, it\u2019ll be a long goddamn life without her.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>Chase pulled into Ben\u2019s driveway at eleven a.m. Ace and Deuce greeted him with wagging tails, bumping into his knees expecting to be petted.</p><p>Ben opened the door and the dogs beat him inside. \u201cCoffee\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He adjusted his duffel. \u201cLemme shower and I might feel almost human.\u201d</p><p>He was down to one clean pair of jeans and one clean shirt. Maybe Ben would let him throw in a couple loads of laundry. The last time he\u2019d washed clothes was with Ava,</p><p>During the drive he\u2019d rehearsed everything he wanted to say to her. And he\u2019d say it to her face. In California, depending on what shook loose from this family meeting.</p><p>Ben sat at the enormous bar, staring into a mug of coffee. Chase poured himself a cup and joined his brother.</p><p>\u201cSo you honestly have no idea what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m thinkin\u2019...wouldn\u2019t it suck if Dad found out he has cancer right after he retired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. My thoughts ran along those same lines.\u201d</p><p>They drank their coffee in silence.</p><p>\u201cSo you and Ava Cooper, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems impossible, don\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I knew you were done for when you listed all the great things about her and then swore you weren\u2019t gonna drag her to bed the first chance you got.\u201d</p><p>Chase looked up. \u201cNot banging her is an indicator of...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, brother, say the word. Love. You\u2019re in love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her. But that was before I freaked out and said some stupid shit. Then she said stupid shit back and I left to rejoin the PBR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat day\u2019s today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all went to hell on Tuesday. Damn. Seems longer than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to cool off is rarely a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>When Ben retreated, Chase looked around. That\u2019s when he noticed two items on the far edge of the bar. A short-handled whip and a collar with a chain attached. What the fuck did Ben use those for? Did he even want to know?</p><p>Hell yes he wanted to know.</p><p>So when Ben returned, Chase said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the whip and collar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Chase pointed. \u201cOver there. Did you forget to put away your bondage toys when you finished with them?\u201d</p><p>Ben went very still.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ben. I was joking.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed. \u201cI know. Guess it\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t leave out the leather restraint straps and the caning set. That really would\u2019ve made you look at me funny.\u201d</p><p>Chase stared at him because it didn\u2019t seem Ben was joking. And how could he rattle off that type of S&amp;M stuff anyway?</p><p>The dogs barked and Quinn stepped inside. \u201cHey. You guys ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady as we\u2019ll be, considering we\u2019re goin\u2019 in blind.\u201d</p><p>The drive to their parents\u2019 house was filled with nervous chatter. They pulled up behind a Lexus with South Dakota plates.</p><p>\u201cI thought this was supposed to be a family only meeting?\u201d Chase said.</p><p>\u201cIt is. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Quinn led the way into the ranch house they\u2019d grown up in. Their parents sat side by side at the dining room table, across from a guy who seemed familiar, but also ill at ease.</p><p>\u201cHello, boys,\u201d their mother said. \u201cHave a seat. Would you like coffee?\u201d When she began to get up, Dad curled his hand over hers. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Vi. They know where the coffeepot is.\u201d</p><p>Quinn offered the man his hand first. \u201cQuinn McKay.\u201d</p><p>The man stood. \u201cGavin Daniels.\u201d He shook hands as Ben and Chase introduced themselves.</p><p>Dad cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2014we\u2014appreciate you comin\u2019. Didn\u2019t mean to be so cryptic, but this ain\u2019t something that can be said over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be straight with us. Is he your doctor or something?\u201d Ben asked. \u201cHe came here to help you break the bad news about whatever is wrong with one of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s nothin\u2019 wrong with either of us. We\u2019re both in better health than we\u2019ve been in a long while. This is about him.\u201d</p><p>Chase noticed his parents still held hands.</p><p>\u201cThis is gonna come as a shock, so I\u2019ll just say it straight out. Gavin is our son. Your brother. Not half brother, but full-blooded brother.\u201d</p><p>No one moved. No one seemed to breathe in the crushing silence.</p><p>\u201cForget the goddamn coffee. Break out the whiskey,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>Almost as if their father had expected it, he pulled out a bottle of Jameson and six shot glasses. And holy fuck, he poured Mom a shot of Irish too. Then he kissed her cheek. \u201cVi, darlin\u2019, go ahead. It\u2019s more your story to tell than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean my secret to tell.\u201d His mother, his sweet, practical, sometimes judgmental mother, tossed back the whiskey without batting an eyelash. \u201cI won\u2019t drag out the details. You boys never knew my father, God rest his soul, and I\u2019m grateful. For being a man of God, Elmore Bennett wasn\u2019t a nice man. He ruled his home with the Bible in one hand and a hickory switch in the other.</p><p>\u201cI fell in love with your father when I was fifteen years old. I had to see him on the sly because my father believed the McKays were no good. Long story short, I got knocked up at age sixteen. I was scared to death to tell my mother. But I did, and she immediately went to my father. He flew into a rage, called me every horrible name because a preacher\u2019s daughter wasn\u2019t supposed to get pregnant, especially by a McKay. He swore I\u2019d be eternally damned if I tied myself and a child to that heathen family. To save face, his and mine, he told everyone he\u2019d sent me to finish high school at a Christian academy in Colorado, when in truth, he shipped me off to an unwed mother\u2019s home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit to being a brainwashed during my time there. I never considered keeping my baby. My pregnancy was a source of shame. Baby gone, shame gone.\u201d She sent Gavin a pleading look. \u201cPlease understand times were different back then.\u201d</p><p>Gavin nodded and drained his shot.</p><p>\u201cI had a healthy boy. Then they whisked him away to his adoptive parents. I never knew the details of where he ended up. My folks never spoke of it and I didn\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even Dad?\u201d Quinn asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhen I came back to Wyoming, four years later, it was if Charlie and I hadn\u2019t been apart. We still loved each other and we married right away. How could I tell him we had a three-year-old son? I\u2019d made the choice to give the baby a better life; there was no going back. No tracking the boy down and taking him from his adoptive parents. I could never do that...\u201d Her voice caught.</p><p>Dad leaned over and murmured to her. It took a minute or so for her to regain control.</p><p>Chase picked up his shot and his stomach protested when the whiskey hit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAfter a few years, we started having you boys and... Well, my life was busy. Good. Happy. But I never forgot about that sweet baby boy I held in my arms for one short hour. Not a single day went by that I didn\u2019t wonder about him. Pray his life was good. Pray he was loved.\u201d</p><p>Gavin\u2019s eyes were on the shot glass he rolled between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cSo I was shocked when your Aunt Kimi confronted me after your grandpa Jed died. She said one night Jed was loopy on pain meds and he told her that my father told him that I was pregnant. My father bragged to Jed I\u2019d rather give the baby up than have it raised in a godless home as a McKay. Which was a total lie, but Jed must\u2019ve believed it. After Kimi told me that, I finally understood why Jed never liked me and why he refused to live with us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAunt Kimi never told Uncle Cal?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. But she told your Aunt Carolyn.\u201d</p><p>Gavin said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you tell Dad?\u201d Ben asked gently.</p><p>\u201cRight after Quinn and Libby got back together.\u201d She looked at Quinn. \u201cThe day you told me to butt out of your relationship and said my meddling wasn\u2019t appreciated and wouldn\u2019t be tolerated, I realized I\u2019d been acting just like my mother. It shamed me, the things I\u2019d said, some of the things I\u2019d done, including keeping such a big secret from Charlie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVi. Honey. Take a break. This ain\u2019t good for your blood pressure.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI have to see this through. When I told your father what I\u2019d kept from him, I was scared to death he\u2019d tell me to pack a bag. I expected his fury and everything in my life and my marriage to be over, and I knew I\u2019d deserve whatever I got. But he didn\u2019t leave me. My Charlie...forgave me and...\u201d The stalwart ranch woman Chase had seen cry maybe half a dozen times in his entire life completely broke down.</p><p>What was equally shocking? Witnessing the loving side of his father. How he automatically pulled her into his arms and soothed her. Maybe it was another sign of Chase\u2019s self-absorbedness that he\u2019d never noticed their connection beyond their parental roles. Watching them now, he saw romance. He saw unconditional love. Given the situation, there had to be a whole lot of unconditional forgiveness between them too.</p><p>That\u2019s what Chase wanted. A lifetime with Ava to learn the ins and outs of love. To be with her every day so they could face whatever curveballs life threw at them together. And he\u2019d do anything and everything to make that happen.</p><p>Chase leaned closer to stroke his mother\u2019s arm, the exact same time Quinn and Ben reached out to her too. That made her cry harder and blubber.</p><p>No one realized Gavin had stepped out until after she\u2019d calmed down.</p> <p>Gavin hadn\u2019t gone far. His back rested against the porch support pole. He stared across the field, hands in the front pockets of his dress pants. He spoke without looking at them. \u201cSorry. Got to be a little much. It\u2019s a lot to take in. I\u2019m still not convinced coming here was the best idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? What made you seek out your birth parents now?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>When Gavin faced them, Chase was struck by the familiarity of Gavin\u2019s features. Same blue eyes. His build was much like their father\u2019s. His square chin, like Quinn\u2019s. His mouth and nose were the same shape as Ben\u2019s. Gavin\u2019s hair was dark brown like their mother\u2019s, not black like the majority of the McKays.</p><p>\u201cI was an only child, and my mother made me promise I\u2019d track down my birth parents after she died.\u201d Gavin briefly glanced down at his loafers. \u201cShe wanted me to connect with my family.\u201d His gaze moved from Quinn, to Ben, to Chase. \u201cI hired a private detective to deal with the adoption records and tracing the whereabouts of the man and woman who gave me up. Didn\u2019t take him long to track them since they were in the same place. Never in a million years did I imagine I\u2019d find out my biological parents got married and had three other sons together.\u201d</p><p>Quinn asked, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just turned forty-one.\u201d Gavin crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI live in Scottsdale, Arizona. I\u2019m divorced and have joint custody of my fourteen-year-old daughter, Sierra. My father was a real estate developer and I went to work for him after I graduated from ASU with a business degree. He had a massive heart attack a year after my daughter was born and I inherited the company. My mother passed away a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to be Mr. Obvious, but what happens now?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. No offense, but this has fucked with my head in so many ways.\u201d Gavin expelled a quick puff of air. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, your parents seem like nice people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut?\u201d Ben prompted.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just it. I see the genetic similarities to them and to you guys, but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to feel when I see it.\u201d</p><p>How did any of them respond to that?</p><p>Ben, the peacemaker, changed the subject. When they\u2019d exhausted conversation about weather differences and job descriptions, Chase wished they\u2019d brought the bottle of whiskey outside with them.</p><p>\u201cLook, Gavin, you wanna come over to my place and have a beer with us?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>Gavin seemed to struggle with his answer, but shook his head. \u201cThanks for the invite, but I really need to get back to my room and finish some work I brought along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely.\u201d</p><p>Gavin wandered to his car and drove off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you guys, but I need a fuckin\u2019 drink,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>Chase returned inside to tell their parents they were leaving. But they weren\u2019t in the dining room and their bedroom door was shut, so he left them alone.</p><p>As soon as they\u2019d bellied up to the bar at Ben\u2019s house, Chase said, \u201cA brother.\u201d</p><p>Quinn kept sliding his coaster on the bar top. \u201cNo shit. Never saw that one comin\u2019. Not in a million goddamn years. It\u2019s like, Christ. I don\u2019t even know Mom. I can\u2019t imagine her just handing her baby over to a stranger and goin\u2019 on with her life.\u201d</p><p>Chase knew Quinn was imagining life without his kids after he and Libby tried for so long to have a child. \u201cCan you even fathom how Gavin feels? Finding out your birth mother gave you up, but went on to have three other kids with the same guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we shoulda checked to see if he had a clubfoot,\u201d Ben joked.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that have to do with anything?\u201d Chase demanded.</p><p>\u201cHistory books claim if firstborn sons had any kind of physical defect, the baby would be abandoned. Back then, even a clubfoot would get you a one-way ticket to the woods. The family hoped the next baby would be perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fuckin\u2019 morbid,\u201d Chase said. \u201cChrist. That\u2019s not even funny. Where do you come up with this shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry reading something other than Hustler some time,\u201d Ben shot back.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d Quinn warned. \u201cHere\u2019s where I\u2019m at. I have a hard time believing Aunt Kimi and Aunt Carolyn didn\u2019t blab to Uncle Cal and Uncle Carson about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. Without sounding like a freakin\u2019 girl, women keep other women\u2019s secrets. Especially when it comes to family stuff,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cSo do you think they\u2019ll break the news to the rest of the family about the forty-one-year-old secret McKay baby?\u201d Quinn asked.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s up to Mom and Dad? Yes. Gavin? No.\u201d</p><p>Chase sighed. \u201cThink Gavin will...hell. Sounds stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill what? Want to be part of our family?\u201d Ben supplied.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Quinn and Chase looked at each other, then Ben. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I the only one who noticed he doesn\u2019t seem happy? And that didn\u2019t have a damn thing to do with him coming here? He\u2019s a bunged-up corporate guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got that impression too,\u201d Quinn admitted.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never had siblings. Can\u2019t miss what you don\u2019t have. He\u2019s satisfied his curiosity, done his duty to his late mother, and he\u2019ll move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you sayin\u2019 he\u2019s done with us? After one meeting?\u201d</p><p>Ben passed out another round. \u201cOne of us, or all of us, will try and develop this meeting into something. Communication is two-way. Be interesting to see if Gavin reciprocates, or if he\u2019ll blow us off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 sad scene you\u2019ve created, Ben.\u201d Scene. Made him think of Ava, always setting the scene.</p><p>Ben shrugged. \u201cCalling it like I see it.\u201d</p><p>Quinn asked, \u201cYou think Mom has her heart set on us all bein\u2019 a big, happy family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made her peace long ago. I think she\u2019d like for us to get to know him and vice versa. But she won\u2019t push it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad might. If only for her.\u201d Ben lifted his bottle. \u201cTo the bright side of today. Neither Mom or Dad havin\u2019 cancer.\u201d</p><p>Bottles chinked together.</p><p>Chase raised his bottle. \u201cThis is fuckin\u2019 sappy as shit, but I just gotta say it. To us. Gavin don\u2019t know what he\u2019s missing, havin\u2019 you guys as brothers. His loss if he walks away because you guys are the best.\u201d</p><p>Neither Quinn nor Ben gave him shit for being sentimental, probably because Chase never was.</p><p>The conversation shifted, but it eventually flowed back to the shock of the day. Chase clammed up when Quinn or Ben asked questions about his future with the PBR or with Ava.</p><p>Quinn went home. Chase was surprised he\u2019d stayed as long as he had. Maybe his brothers missed hanging out with him.</p><p>But the sleepless night, long drive, and the stress caught up with him. He couldn\u2019t keep his eyes open. He mumbled to Ben about finding his cell phone, stumbled to the guest bedroom and crashed.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re watching this,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cWhy torture yourself?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ava gave Hannah an arch look. \u201cBesides I know how damn good the man looks in chaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmartass. But really, what\u2019s the point after Chase\u2019s meltdown last night?\u201d</p><p>Her heart seized, thinking about how Chase had lost it on live TV. She\u2019d wanted to jump through the screen and drag him off to comfort him. Assure him that not every wreck would have the same outcome as Ryan\u2019s. Assure him she\u2019d be there for him no matter what.</p> <p>\u201cI know you can hear me, Ava, so stop ignoring\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsh... They\u2019re giving the injury report on Dirk.\u201d</p><p>The camera cut to an interview with the head of the sports medicine team. When he finished detailing the bull rider\u2019s injuries, the announcer asked his opinion on Chase McKay\u2019s comments about mandatory safety helmets. The doctor looked directly into the camera and said, \u201cHelmets save lives. Period.\u201d</p><p>The camera returned to the main announcers. Their on-air banter circled to rider standings on tour and current matchups with bulls for the final round. When the list of the fifteen riders scrolled on screen, Chase\u2019s name wasn\u2019t listed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Why isn\u2019t he riding?\u201d</p> <p>As if they\u2019d heard her question, the camera zoomed to the younger announcer. \u201cAfter being off tour for two months, Chase McKay made a comeback with a vengeance the last two nights. So it\u2019s a pity he won\u2019t be riding in the final round this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Ava yelled at the TV.</p><p>\u201cThat is surprising, since he\u2019s seated first,\u201d the other announcer said. \u201cIs his withdrawal due to a recurrence of his previous injury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My understanding is he returned home for a family emergency. And we wish him, and his family, all the best.\u201d</p><p>Ava gasped. If that was true, why hadn\u2019t he called? She fast-forwarded through the entire program but there wasn\u2019t any other news.</p><p>Sick with worry, she paced. She should just call Chase. Find out. She scrolled to his name and clicked. One ring. Two rings. Come on, cowboy, pick up. Six rings. Then it dumped her over to voicemail.</p> <p>Maybe Chase was too busy dealing with family stuff to answer. Maybe he was dodging her calls. Dammit. She needed to talk to somebody who knew something.</p><p>Ginger? No. Just in case the family emergency only affected Chase\u2019s branch of the McKays.</p><p>But Ava also knew Chase\u2019s entire family watched the PBR, and if they weren\u2019t aware there was a problem with Chase\u2019s family, they\u2019d know now.</p><p>Maybe the PBR had kicked Chase off for his diatribe and used his family as an excuse\u2014they\u2019d done it before with his injury story. Because really. Would Chase McKay give up his big comeback, his chance to win an event, especially riding in first place...to deal with family issues in Wyoming?</p><p>The former bad boy Chase McKay might have blown off his family for eight seconds of glory, but the Chase McKay she knew had changed.</p><p>That was it. She had to find out. She scrolled through her contact list. God, she needed to weed out about three quarters of these names. Bingo. She had saved his number. She hit Dial and returned to pacing until he answered. \u201cIt\u2019s Ava.\u201d</p><p>Chase woke completely disoriented. He didn\u2019t feel like warmed-over dog crap, so he hadn\u2019t been drinking last night. He sat up and looked around. Right. He\u2019d crashed in Ben\u2019s spare bedroom.</p><p>He squinted at the sun streaming through the window. Was it really late afternoon? He fumbled for his cell phone on the nightstand, only to remember he\u2019d left it at his parents\u2019 house. He stumbled into the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cGlad you could join me at the crack of five in the afternoon,\u201d Ben said slyly.</p><p>\u201cCut me some slack. I slept about two hours out of the forty-eight before I went comatose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in time to leave for supper at Mom and Dad\u2019s with Gavin. Guess he\u2019s leaving early in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Chase scratched his head. His hair needed a damn trim. He\u2019d gotten so used to wearing it short, he wondered if he\u2019d ever go back to longer hair. Especially remembering how good Ava\u2019s hands felt on his scalp.</p><p>Ava.</p><p>He needed her. He loved her. He had to make this right with her. But he couldn\u2019t do it from here.</p><p>Naturally when he found his cell phone it was completely dead.</p><p>Supper was strained. Adam and Amelia made mealtime entertaining, until they both started shrieking and Quinn and Libby took them home.</p><p>Saying goodbye to Gavin was awkward amidst half-assed promises of staying in touch, would any of them ever see him again?</p><p>Ben sighed as they sat in his pickup in front of his house. \u201cLook, don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole, but something came up and I\u2019m gonna need you to stay somewhere else tonight.\u201d</p><p>That fucking blew. He\u2019d looked forward to hanging with Ben. Playing pool. Picking his brain about how to handle the situation with Ava once he reached LA. \u201cIt\u2019s more a douchebag move than an asshole move, kicking me to the curb at eight o\u2019clock on a Sunday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hope you\u2019d do the same for me if a good woman was involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. It\u2019s for the best anyway. I\u2019d planned on driving to Denver in the morning to catch a flight to LA, but if I leave now, I\u2019ll get an earlier one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still dragging ass, Chase. Why don\u2019t you head over to Kane\u2019s old trailer, get some rest in the peace and quiet? You know you ain\u2019t gonna get that at Quinn and Libby\u2019s place. Without bein\u2019 a dick, Mom and Dad don\u2019t need you hanging around tonight.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s place. How hard would it be to stay where he\u2019d met Ava and she wasn\u2019t there? But it wasn\u2019t like he had another choice. \u201cWill you at least let me plug my phone in for five minutes so I can check my messages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Chase had quite a few missed calls, including one from Ava last night. No voice message. Dammit. He stopped at the call from HeadGame, a sports safety equipment manufacturer. They\u2019d only called thirty minutes ago. Intrigued, he kept his phone plugged in as he called the number, expecting to get a recording. But a live person answered. \u201cThis is Chase McKay. I received a message from this number tonight.\u201d He listened. \u201cYes, sir. That sounds fine. Actually, I\u2019d planned to be in California tomorrow. Sure. I\u2019ll call you in the next couple days after I figure out my schedule. The event in Salinas starts Friday. After blasting my opinion across VERSUS airwaves...I ain\u2019t sure they\u2019ll let me compete.\u201d Chase laughed. \u201cNo idea. I\u2019m putting off returning phone calls to my PBR rep until tomorrow. Good enough. Thanks. Talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil was that about?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>Chase unplugged the charger. \u201cA company that specializes in sports helmets wants to meet with me about possibly becoming a spokesman. Which would be cool, since I\u2019ve been thinking about putting my...celebrity, for lack of a better term, to good use. Advocate safety in bull ridin\u2019. Some of the older riders ain\u2019t ever gonna change. But if I can connect with the younger kids, the ones in high school, or even elementary kids who dream of ridin\u2019 bulls, about the need for proper safety equipment, maybe I can save some kids lives. Save some parents from what Jackie Ackerman is going through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ambitious. And it\u2019s great to see you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cActing like a grown up?\u201d Chase supplied with a grin.</p><p>\u201cNo, smartass. It\u2019s great to see you believe in a cause enough to actually do something about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I better scoot so your mysterious lady friend can come over under the cover of darkness.\u201d</p><p>Ben gave him a smug smile. \u201cDon\u2019t be a stranger, bro.\u201d</p><p>He said, \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d and meant it.</p><p>Chase\u2019s mind raced as he drove to Kane\u2019s trailer. First he\u2019d book his ticket online. No, first he\u2019d call Ava. He wasn\u2019t taking any chance there\u2019d be miscommunication.</p><p>Once he was inside the quiet trailer, he caught a whiff of flowers. But this time he didn\u2019t attribute it to cleaning supplies. This time, he recognized the scent.</p><p>Ava.</p><p>His skeptical side warned about wishful thinking, while his optimistic side urged him to hurry the hell up.</p><p>Chase threw open the bedroom door. There she was, standing on the bed. Just like before. Except this time she wasn\u2019t nekkid. This time Ava didn\u2019t look like she wanted to kick his ass.</p><p>She looked like she wanted to kiss him.</p><p>He hopped up on the bed and kissed her first. \u201cMy God, woman, tell me I\u2019m not dreaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dreaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I\u2019m thanking my lucky stars...why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I didn\u2019t hear what constituted a family emergency that had you pulling out of an event you were winning, I called Ben last night. He told me you were here. So I hopped a plane in LA\u2014not a word about me using the family jet\u2014last night and drove over from Rapid City.\u201d</p><p>His wily brother hadn\u2019t been expecting a lady friend after all. \u201cI missed you like crazy.\u201d</p><p>Ava rested her forehead to Chase\u2019s. \u201cI missed you.\u201d She tugged him down until they sat on the bed. \u201cWhat happened with your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort version? My teenage mom had a baby out of wedlock with my dad, and I have a brother no one knew anything about. He showed up out of the blue this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s TV-movie-of-the-week stuff. How\u2019s your family taking it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in shock. This Gavin guy...my brother...he\u2019s pretty tight-lipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there is a family resemblance,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Chase smiled. \u201cMaybe.\u201d He kissed her knuckles. \u201cAva. I don\u2019t even know where to start to make this right between us again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start there.\u201d She inhaled deeply and let it out. \u201cFirst let me say I\u2019m so, so sorry I slapped you. There is no excuse for my behavior but it\u2019ll never happen again. I swear.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI believe you. I\u2019m sorry I left the way I did. I had a lot of time to think between Omaha and Wichita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and some other stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 about safety issues and helmets and all that since Ryan died. And then after what happened to Dirk, I realized I wanna do more than talk about it; I wanna act on it. It\u2019s a murky idea right now, but I have an opportunity to make a difference and I\u2019m going to take it.\u201d He kissed her just because he could, because she was here with him, where she belonged. \u201cEnough about that. Tell me how long you were in LA, because Hollywood, I was headed there first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of hours after you left, I got a casting call for a new sitcom and flew back to LA. I should come clean and let you know that my agent called me three times over the course of our road trip, after she\u2019d lined up auditions. And every time I declined to go back to LA to audition. I didn\u2019t know what it meant at the time, besides I didn\u2019t want to leave you. But now I understand it was a sign I\u2019m done with acting. Maybe not forever, but definitely for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut I feel freer and I\u2019m taking a chance to change the path of my career. Which sounds stupid. I could\u2019ve gotten off the path at any time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvents that force a change ain\u2019t always bad,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cTrue. When we met? I really was just using my camera for fun. But after we\u2019d been on the road a couple weeks, I began to see the potential of telling a story from three different sides, from the perspective of three riders at varied stages of their careers. I started cataloguing the video segments and realized I\u2019d shot a lot of footage. I have enough to do at least two documentaries. One with you, one without. I would never exploit Ryan\u2019s death. I hope you know I\u2019m not that heartless and willing to do anything to forge this new path.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her knuckles. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you say no, Chase, I\u2019ll shitcan the whole works and find something else to work on. I\u2019d still like to put together a memorial disk for Jackie so she can see Ryan\u2019s happiness being part of the rodeo world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t ask you to not to do that. This project is important to you.\u201d He locked his eyes to hers. \u201cWould you ask me to give up bull ridin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I worry every time you get on the back of a bull, even more now after I saw what happened with Ryan. But it\u2019s a part of what makes you, you. I\u2019d never ask you to give it up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to the same conclusion. You\u2019re talented, Ava. The little bit of your film I saw was amazing. You need to make the documentary however you see fit. If you have Jackie\u2019s blessing, and she\u2019s the one who\u2019s the most affected by all of this, then I\u2019m on board.\u201d</p><p>Ava briefly closed her eyes and mouthed, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a couple of exceptions,\u201d Chase cautioned. \u201cI want full veto power on the personal footage you use of us. That was our time, Ava. We fell in love, and we both know it had a lot to do with our conversations on the road, both on and off camera. Since we\u2019re both in the spotlight, we have to keep some things private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. I\u2019m sorry you saw that segment. And I swear I didn\u2019t tape you on a secret camera. I set it down and forgot it was on. I intended to erase it, but in my frantic file switching it ended up in the wrong place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know. Also, if you plan on using the footage, you\u2019ll hafta out me as Bill Chase. I don\u2019t know what the repercussions will be, as far as how the PRCA will react, not to mention the PBR. But I\u2019m prepared to deal with the consequences no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll stick by you no matter what happens.\u201d Ava laid her hand on his cheek. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now. Look, I\u2019m gonna ride bulls as long as I\u2019m able. There\u2019s risk with that. But I\u2019m also looking ahead to what I\u2019ll do when I\u2019m done. Maybe I\u2019ll open a bull ridin\u2019 school. I hear it\u2019s warm year-round in California.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent idea. If that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll come up with something else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUntil that time, I also plan on being very active with safety issues for riders. And to raise money, I want to host a rodeo in Ryan\u2019s hometown, in his name. With Jackie\u2019s permission, of course.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva. I don\u2019t have a lot to offer you. I\u2019m sure the heiress to the Cooper conglomerate could find a much more socially acceptable match than a height-challenged Wyoming bull rider.\u201d When she started to protest, Chase put a finger over her lips. \u201cBut them other guys? The suit-and-tie and stupid-wearin\u2019-shoes types? They\u2019re too late. You\u2019re mine now, Ava Rose, mine, through and through, and I play for keeps.\u201d He let his lips cling to hers in a kiss filled with promise. Then he eased back and smiled. \u201cSo. Were you serious about getting married on an island with just your intended and a preacher? Because I\u2019m all over that idea. As soon as possible. Heck, I\u2019m free next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there if that\u2019s your way of asking me to marry you, Chase McKay.\u201d She poked him in the chest. \u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re going to a Dumond Racing event with my family next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Ava gave him a haughty look. \u201cBe aware that I\u2019m doing this marriage thing once in my life and I expect a real proposal, with a ring, you on bended knee, spouting words of love, holding flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways setting the scene, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you need so much help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lifetime of help.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
