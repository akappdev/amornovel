Some things are better left buried and forgotten, as my mom would say. I\u2019d be happy to forget all of fifth grade, for example (the glasses-and-pink-braces period), and does anybody want to relive the first day of middle school? Add in all of the boring family vacations, pointless algebra classes, period cramps, and bad kisses I barely lived through the first time around...</p><p>The truth is, though, I wouldn\u2019t have minded reliving my greatest hits: when Rob Cokran and I first hooked up in the middle of the dance floor at homecoming, so everyone saw and knew we were together; when Lindsay, Elody, Ally, and I got drunk and tried to make snow angels in May, leaving person-sized imprints in Ally\u2019s lawn; my sweet-sixteen party, when we set out a hundred tea lights and danced on the table in the backyard; the time Lindsay and I pranked Clara Seuse on Halloween, got chased by the cops, and laughed so hard we almost threw up\u2014the things I wanted to remember; the things I wanted to be remembered for.</p> <p>But before I died I didn\u2019t think of Rob, or any other guy. I didn\u2019t think of all the outrageous things I\u2019d done with my friends. I didn\u2019t even think of my family, or the way the morning light turns the walls in my bedroom the color of cream, or the way the azaleas outside my window smell in July, a mixture of honey and cinnamon.</p><p>Instead, I thought of Vicky Hallinan.</p><p>Specifically, I thought of the time in fourth grade when Lindsay announced in front of the whole gym class that she wouldn\u2019t have Vicky on her dodgeball team. \u201cShe\u2019s too fat,\u201d Lindsay blurted out. \u201cYou could hit her with your eyes closed.\u201d I wasn\u2019t friends with Lindsay yet, but even then she had this way of saying things that made them hilarious, and I laughed along with everyone else while Vicky\u2019s face turned as purple as the underside of a storm cloud.</p><p>That\u2019s what I remembered in that before-death instant, when I was supposed to be having some big revelation about my past: the smell of varnish and the squeak of our sneakers on the polished floor; the tightness of my polyester shorts; the laughter echoing around the big, empty space like there were way more than twenty-five people in the gym.</p><p>And Vicky\u2019s face.</p> <p>The weird thing is that I hadn\u2019t thought about that in forever. It was one of those memories I didn\u2019t even know I remembered, if you know what I mean. It\u2019s not like Vicky was traumatized or anything. That\u2019s just the kind of thing that kids do to each other. It\u2019s no big deal. There\u2019s always going to be a person laughing and somebody getting laughed at. It happens every day, in every school, in every town in America\u2014probably in the world, for all I know. The whole point of growing up is learning to stay on the laughing side.</p><p>Vicky wasn\u2019t very fat to begin with\u2014she just had some baby weight on her face and stomach\u2014and before high school she\u2019d lost that and grown three inches. She even became friends with Lindsay. They played field hockey together and said hi in the halls. One time, our freshman year, Vicky brought it up at a party\u2014we were all pretty tipsy\u2014and we laughed and laughed, Vicky most of all, until her face turned almost as purple as it had all those years ago in the gym.</p><p>That was weird thing number one.</p><p>Even weirder than that was the fact that we\u2019d all just been talking about it\u2014how it would be just before you died, I mean. I don\u2019t remember exactly how it came up, except that Elody was complaining that I always got shotgun and refusing to wear her seat belt. She kept leaning forward into the front seat to scroll through Lindsay\u2019s iPod, even though I was supposed to have deejay privileges. I was trying to explain my \u201cgreatest hits\u201d theory of death, and we were all picking out what those would be. Lindsay picked finding out that she got into Duke, obviously, and Ally\u2014who was bitching about the cold, as usual, and threatening to drop dead right there of pneumonia\u2014participated long enough to say she wished she could relive her first hookup with Matt Wilde forever, which surprised no one. Lindsay and Elody were smoking, and freezing rain was coming in through the cracked-open windows. The road was narrow and winding, and on either side of us the dark, stripped branches of trees lashed back and forth, like the wind had set them dancing.</p><p>Elody put on \u201cSplinter\u201d by Fallacy to piss Ally off, maybe because she was sick of her whining. It was Ally\u2019s song with Matt, who had dumped her in September. Ally called her a bitch and unbuckled her seat belt, leaning forward and trying to grab the iPod. Lindsay complained that someone was elbowing her in the neck. The cigarette dropped from her mouth and landed between her thighs. She started cursing and trying to brush the embers off the seat cushion and Elody and Ally were still fighting and I was trying to talk over them, reminding them all of the time we\u2019d made snow angels in May. The tires skidded a little on the wet road, and the car was full of cigarette smoke, little wisps rising like phantoms in the air.</p><p>Then all of a sudden there was a flash of white in front of the car. Lindsay yelled something\u2014words I couldn\u2019t make out, something like sit or shit or sight\u2014and suddenly the car was flipping off the road and into the black mouth of the woods. I heard a horrible, screeching sound\u2014metal on metal, glass shattering, a car folding in two\u2014and smelled fire. I had time to wonder whether Lindsay had put her cigarette out.</p> <p>Then Vicky Hallinan\u2019s face came rising out of the past. I heard laughter echoing and rolling all around me, swelling into a scream.</p><p>Then nothing.</p><p>The thing is, you don\u2019t get to know. It\u2019s not like you wake up with a bad feeling in your stomach. You don\u2019t see shadows where there shouldn\u2019t be any. You don\u2019t remember to tell your parents that you love them or\u2014in my case\u2014remember to say good-bye to them at all.</p><p>If you\u2019re like me, you wake up seven minutes and forty-seven seconds before your best friend is supposed to be picking you up. You\u2019re too busy worrying about how many roses you\u2019re going to get on Cupid Day to do anything more than throw on your clothes, brush your teeth, and pray to God you left your makeup in the bottom of your messenger bag so you can do it in the car.</p><p>If you\u2019re like me, your last day starts like this:</p><p>ONE</p><p>\u201cBeep, beep,\u201d Lindsay calls out. A few weeks ago my mom yelled at her for blasting her horn at six fifty-five every morning, and this is Lindsay\u2019s solution.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d I shout back, even though she can see me pushing out the front door, trying to put on my coat and wrestle my binder into my bag at the same time.</p> <p>At the last second, my eight-year-old sister, Izzy, tugs at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whirl around. She has little-sister radar for when I\u2019m busy, late, or on the phone with my boyfriend. Those are always the times she chooses to bother me.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot your gloves,\u201d she says, except it comes out: \u201cYou forgot your gloveths.\u201d She refuses to go to speech therapy for her lisp, even though all the kids in her grade make fun of her. She says she likes the way she talks.</p><p>I take them from her. They\u2019re cashmere and she\u2019s probably gotten peanut butter on them. She\u2019s always scooping around in jars of the stuff.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you, Izzy?\u201d I say, poking her in the middle of the forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t touch my stuff.\u201d She giggles like an idiot and I have to hustle her inside while I shut the door. If it were up to her, she would follow me around all day like a dog.</p><p>By the time I make it out of the house, Lindsay\u2019s leaning out the window of the Tank. That\u2019s what we call her car, an enormous silver Range Rover. (Every time we drive around in it at least one person says, \u201cThat thing\u2019s not a car, it\u2019s a truck,\u201d and Lindsay claims she could go head-to-head with an eighteen-wheeler and come out without a scratch.) She and Ally are the only two of us with cars that actually belong to them. Ally\u2019s car is a tiny black Jetta that we named the Minime. I get to borrow my mom\u2019s Accord sometimes; poor Elody has to make do with her father\u2019s ancient tan Ford Taurus, which hardly runs anymore.</p><p>The air is still and freezing cold. The sky is a perfect, pale blue. The sun has just risen, weak and watery-looking, like it has just spilled itself over the horizon and is too lazy to clean itself up. It\u2019s supposed to storm later, but you\u2019d never know.</p><p>I get into the passenger seat. Lindsay\u2019s already smoking and she gestures with the end of her cigarette to the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee she got for me.</p><p>\u201cBagels?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIn the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSesame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d She looks me over once as she pulls out of my driveway. \u201cNice skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay tips her head, acknowledging the compliment. We\u2019re actually wearing the same skirt. There are only two days of the year when Lindsay, Ally, Elody, and I deliberately dress the same: Pajama Day during Spirit Week, because we all bought cute matching sets at Victoria\u2019s Secret last Christmas, and Cupid Day. We spent three hours at the mall arguing about whether to go for pink or red outfits\u2014Lindsay hates pink; Ally lives in it\u2014and we finally settled on black miniskirts and some red fur-trimmed tank tops we found in the clearance bin at Nordstrom.</p><p>Like I said, those are the only times we deliberately look alike. But the truth is that at my high school, Thomas Jefferson, everyone kind of looks the same. There\u2019s no official uniform\u2014it\u2019s a public school\u2014but you\u2019ll see the same outfit of Seven jeans, gray New Balance sneakers, a white T-shirt, and a colored North Face fleece jacket on nine out of ten students. Even the guys and the girls dress the same, except our jeans are tighter and we have to blow out our hair every day. It\u2019s Connecticut: being like the people around you is the whole point.</p><p>That\u2019s not to say that our high school doesn\u2019t have its freaks\u2014it does\u2014but even the freaks are freaky in the same way. The Eco-Geeks ride their bikes to school and wear clothing made of hemp and never wash their hair, like having dreadlocks will somehow help curb the emission of greenhouse gases. The Drama Queens carry big bottles of lemon tea and wear scarves even in summer and don\u2019t talk in class because they\u2019re \u201cconserving their voices.\u201d The Math League members always have ten times more books than anyone else and actually still use their lockers and walk around with permanently nervous expressions, like they\u2019re just waiting for somebody to yell, \u201cBoo!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t mind it, actually. Sometimes Lindsay and I make plans to run away after graduation and crash in a loft in New York City with this tattoo artist her stepbrother knows, but secretly I like living in Ridgeview. It\u2019s reassuring, if you know what I mean.</p><p>I lean forward, trying to apply mascara without gouging my eye out. Lindsay\u2019s never been the most careful driver and has a tendency to jerk the wheel around, come to sudden stops, and then gun the engine.</p><p>\u201cPatrick better send me a rose,\u201d Lindsay says as she shoots through one stop sign and nearly breaks my neck slamming on the brakes at the next one. Patrick is Lindsay\u2019s on-again, off-again boyfriend. They\u2019ve broken up a record thirteen times since the start of the school year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had to sit next to Rob while he filled out the request form,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes. \u201cIt was like forced labor.\u201d</p><p>Rob Cokran and I have been going out since October, but I\u2019ve been in love with him since sixth grade, when he was too cool to talk to me. Rob was my first crush, or at least my first real crush. I did once kiss Kent McFuller in third grade, but that obviously doesn\u2019t count since we\u2019d just exchanged dandelion rings and were pretending to be husband and wife.</p><p>\u201cLast year I got twenty-two roses.\u201d Lindsay flicks her cigarette butt out of the window and leans over for a slurp of coffee. \u201cI\u2019m going for twenty-five this year.\u201d</p><p>Each year before Cupid Day the student council sets up a booth outside the gym. For two dollars each, you can buy your friends Valograms\u2014roses with little notes attached to them\u2014and then they get delivered by Cupids (usually freshman or sophomore girls trying to get in good with the upperclassmen) throughout the day.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy with fifteen,\u201d I say. It\u2019s a big deal how many roses you get. You can tell who\u2019s popular and who isn\u2019t by the number of roses they\u2019re holding. It\u2019s bad if you get under ten and humiliating if you don\u2019t get more than five\u2014it basically means that you\u2019re either ugly or unknown. Probably both. Sometimes people scavenge for dropped roses to add to their bouquets, but you can always tell.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Lindsay shoots me a sideways glance. \u201cAre you excited? The big day. Opening night.\u201d She laughs. \u201cNo pun intended.\u201d</p><p>I shrug and turn toward the window, watching my breath frost the pane. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Rob\u2019s parents are away this weekend, and a couple of weeks ago he asked me if I could spend the whole night at his house. I knew he was really asking if I wanted to have sex. We\u2019ve gotten semi-close a few times, but it\u2019s always been in the back of his dad\u2019s BMW or in somebody\u2019s basement or in my den with my parents asleep upstairs, and it\u2019s always felt wrong.</p><p>So when he asked me to stay the night, I said yes without thinking about it.</p><p>Lindsay squeals and hits her palm against the steering wheel. \u201cNo big deal? Are you kidding? My baby\u2019s growing up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d I feel heat creeping up my neck and know my skin\u2019s probably going red and splotchy. It does this whenever I\u2019m embarrassed. All the dermatologists, creams, and powders in Connecticut don\u2019t help. When I was younger kids used to sing, \u201cWhat\u2019s red and white and weird all over? Sam Kingston!\u201d</p><p>I shake my head a little and rub the vapor off the window. Outside the world sparkles, like it\u2019s been coated in varnish. \u201cWhen did you and Patrick do it, anyway? Like three months ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we\u2019ve been making up for lost time since then.\u201d Lindsay rocks against her seat.</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, kid. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me kid.\u201d This is one reason I\u2019m happy I decided to have sex with Rob tonight: so Lindsay and Elody won\u2019t make fun of me anymore. Thankfully, since Ally\u2019s still a virgin it means I won\u2019t be the very last one, either. Sometimes I feel like out of the four of us I\u2019m always the one tagging along, just there for the ride. \u201cI told you it was no big deal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay has made me nervous, so I count all the mailboxes as we go by. I wonder if by tomorrow everything will look different to me; I wonder if I\u2019ll look different to other people. I hope so.</p><p>We pull up to Elody\u2019s house and before Lindsay can even honk, the front door swings open and Elody starts picking her way down the icy walkway, balancing on three-inch heels, like she can\u2019t get out of her house fast enough.</p><p>\u201cNipply outside much?\u201d Lindsay says when Elody slides into the car. As usual she\u2019s wearing only a thin leather jacket, even though the weather report said the high would be in the mid-twenties.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of looking cute if you can\u2019t show it off?\u201d Elody shimmies her boobs and we crack up. It\u2019s impossible to stay stressed when she\u2019s around, and the knot in my stomach loosens.</p><p>Elody makes a clawing gesture with her hand and I pass her a coffee. We all take it the same way: large hazelnut, no sugar, extra cream.</p><p>\u201cWatch where you\u2019re sitting. You\u2019ll squish the bagels.\u201d Lindsay frowns into the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou know you want a piece of this.\u201d Elody gives her butt a smack and we all laugh again.</p> <p>\u201cSave it for Muffin, you horn dog.\u201d</p><p>Steve Dough is Elody\u2019s latest victim. She calls him Muffin because of his last name, and because he\u2019s yummy (she says; he looks too greasy for me, and he always smells like pot). They have been hooking up for a month and a half now.</p><p>Elody\u2019s the most experienced of any of us. She lost her virginity sophomore year and has already had sex with two different guys. She was the one who told me she was sore after the first couple of times she had sex, which made me ten times more nervous. It may sound crazy, but I never really thought of it as something physical, something that would make you sore, like soccer or horseback riding. I\u2019m scared that I won\u2019t know what to do, like when we used to play basketball in gym and I\u2019d always forget who I was supposed to be guarding or when I should pass the ball and when I should dribble it.</p><p>\u201cMmm, Muffin.\u201d Elody puts a hand on her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bagel for you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSesame?\u201d Elody asks.</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Lindsay and I say at the same time. Lindsay winks at me.</p><p>Just before we get to school we roll down the windows and blast Mary J. Blige\u2019s \u201cNo More Drama.\u201d I close my eyes and think back to homecoming and my first kiss with Rob, when he pulled me toward him on the dance floor and suddenly my lips were on his and his tongue was sliding under my tongue and I could feel the heat from all the colored lights pressing down on me like a hand, and the music seemed to echo somewhere behind my ribs, making my heart flutter and skip in time. The cold air coming through the window makes my throat hurt and the bass comes through the soles of my feet just like it did that night, when I thought I would never be happier; it goes all the way up to my head, making me dizzy, like the whole car is going to split apart from the sound.</p><p>POPULARITY: AN ANALYSIS</p><p>Popularity\u2019s a weird thing. You can\u2019t really define it, and it\u2019s not cool to talk about it, but you know it when you see it. Like a lazy eye, or porn.</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s gorgeous, but the rest of us aren\u2019t that much prettier than anybody else. Here are my good traits: big green eyes, straight white teeth, high cheekbones, long legs. Here are my bad traits: a too-long nose, skin that gets blotchy when I\u2019m nervous, a flat butt.</p><p>Becky DiFiore\u2019s just as pretty as Lindsay, and I don\u2019t think Becky even had a date to junior homecoming. Ally\u2019s boobs are pretty big, but mine are borderline nonexistent (when Lindsay\u2019s in a bad mood she calls me Samuel, not Sam or Samantha). And it\u2019s not like we\u2019re shiny perfect or our breath always smells like lilacs or something. Lindsay once had a burping contest with Jonah Sasnoff in the cafeteria and everyone applauded her. Sometimes Elody wears fuzzy yellow slippers to school. I once laughed so hard in social studies I spit up vanilla latte all over Jake Somers\u2019s desk. A month later we made out in Lily Angler\u2019s toolshed. (He was bad.)</p><p>The point is, we can do things like that. You know why? Because we\u2019re popular. And we\u2019re popular because we can get away with everything. So it\u2019s circular.</p><p>I guess what I\u2019m saying is there\u2019s no point in analyzing it. If you draw a circle, there will always be an inside and an outside, and unless you\u2019re a total nut job, it\u2019s pretty easy to see which is which. It\u2019s just what happens.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to lie, though. It\u2019s nice that everything\u2019s easy for us. It\u2019s a good feeling knowing you can basically do whatever you want and there won\u2019t be any consequences. When we get out of high school we\u2019ll look back and know we did everything right, that we kissed the cutest boys and went to the best parties, got in just enough trouble, listened to our music too loud, smoked too many cigarettes, and drank too much and laughed too much and listened too little, or not at all. If high school were a game of poker, Lindsay, Ally, Elody, and I would be holding 80 percent of the cards.</p><p>And believe me: I know what it\u2019s like to be on the other side. I was there for the first half of my life. The bottom of the bottom, lowest of the low. I know what it\u2019s like to have to squabble and pick and fight over the leftovers.</p><p>So now I have first pick of everything. So what. That\u2019s the way it is.</p><p>Nobody ever said life was fair.</p><p>We pull into the parking lot exactly ten minutes before first bell. Lindsay guns it toward the lower lot, where the faculty spaces are, scattering a group of sophomore girls. I can see red and white lace dresses peeking out under their coats, and one of them is wearing a tiara. Cupids, definitely.</p><p>\u201cCome on, come on, come on,\u201d Lindsay mutters as we pull behind the gym. This is the only row in the lower lot not reserved for staff. We call it Senior Alley, even though Lindsay\u2019s been parking here since junior year. It\u2019s the VIP of parking at Jefferson, and if you miss out on a spot\u2014there are only twenty of them\u2014you have to park all the way in the upper lot, which is a full .22 miles from the main entrance. We checked one time, and now whenever we talk about it we have to use the exact distance. Like, \u201cDo you really want to walk .22 miles in this rain?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay squeals when she sees an open space, jerking her wheel to the left. At the same time, Sarah Grundel is pulling up her brown Chevrolet from the other direction, angling it into the spot.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no. No way.\u201d Lindsay leans on the horn, even though it\u2019s obvious Sarah was here before us, then presses her foot on the accelerator. Elody shrieks as hot coffee sloshes all over her shirt. There is the high-pitched squeal of rubber, and Sarah Grundel slams on her brakes just before Lindsay\u2019s Range Rover takes off her bumper.</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d Lindsay pulls into the spot and throws her car in park. Then she opens her door and leans out.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetie!\u201d she calls to Sarah. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d This is obviously a lie.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Elody is mopping up coffee with a balled-up Dunkin\u2019 Donuts napkin. \u201cNow I get to go around all day with my boobs smelling like hazelnut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys like food smells,\u201d I say. \u201cI read it in Glamour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut a cookie down your pants and Muffin will probably jump you before homeroom.\u201d Lindsay flips down the rearview mirror and checks her face.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should try it with Rob, Sammy.\u201d Elody throws the coffee-stained napkin at me and I catch it and peg it back.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She\u2019s laughing. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d forget about your big night, did you?\u201d She fishes in her bag and the next thing that flies over the seat is a crumpled-up condom with bits of tobacco stuck to its wrapper. Lindsay cracks up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pagans,\u201d I say, taking the condom with two fingers and dropping it in Lindsay\u2019s glove compartment. Just touching it gets my nerves going again, and I can feel something twist at the bottom of my stomach. I\u2019ve never understood why condoms are kept in those little foil wrappers. They look so clinical, like something your doctor would prescribe for allergies or intestinal problems.</p><p>\u201cNo glove, no love,\u201d Elody says, leaning forward and kissing my cheek. She leaves a big circle of pink lip gloss there.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I get out of the car before they can see I\u2019m blushing.</p><p>Mr. Otto, the athletic director, is standing outside the gym when we\u2019re getting out of the car, probably checking out our asses. Elody thinks the reason he insisted his office be right next to the girls\u2019 dressing room is because he rigged up a camera feed from his computer to the toilet. Why else would he even need a computer? He\u2019s the athletic director. Now every time I pee in the gym I get paranoid.</p> <p>\u201cMove it, ladies,\u201d he calls to us. He\u2019s also the soccer coach, which is ironic since he probably couldn\u2019t run to the vending machine and back. He looks like a walrus. He even has a mustache. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to give you a late slip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to have to spank you.\u201d I do an impression of his voice, which is strangely high-pitched\u2014another reason Elody thinks he might be a pedophile. Elody and Lindsay crack up.</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes to bell,\u201d Otto says, more sharply. Maybe he heard me. I don\u2019t really care.</p><p>\u201cHappy Friday,\u201d Lindsay grumbles, and puts her arm through mine.</p><p>Elody has taken out her cell phone and is checking her teeth in its reflective back, picking out sesame seeds with a pinkie nail.</p> <p>\u201cThis sucks,\u201d she says, without looking up.</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d I say. Fridays are the hardest in some ways: you\u2019re so close to freedom. \u201cKill me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Lindsay squeezes my arm. \u201cCan\u2019t let my best friend die a virgin.\u201d</p><p>You see, we didn\u2019t know.</p><p>My first two periods\u2014art and AHAP (American History Advanced Placement; history\u2019s always been my best subject)\u2014I get only five roses. I\u2019m not that stressed about it, although it does kind of piss me off that Eileen Cho gets four roses from her boyfriend, Ian Dowel. It didn\u2019t even occur to me to ask Rob to do that, and in a way I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. It makes people think you\u2019ve got more friends than you do.</p><p>As soon as I make it to chemistry, Mr. Tierney announces a pop quiz. This is a big problem since (1) I haven\u2019t understood a word of my homework in four weeks (okay, so I stopped trying after week one) and (2) Mr. Tierney\u2019s always threatening to phone in failing grades to college admissions committees, since a lot of us haven\u2019t been accepted to school yet. I\u2019m not sure whether he\u2019s serious or whether he\u2019s just trying to keep the seniors in line, but there is no way I\u2019m letting some fascist teacher ruin my chances of getting into BU.</p> <p>Even worse, I\u2019m sitting next to Lauren Lornet, possibly the only person in the class more clueless about this stuff than I am.</p><p>Actually my grades have been pretty good in chem this year, but it isn\u2019t because I\u2019ve had a sudden epiphany about proton-electron interaction. My straight A\u2013average can be summarized in two words: Jeremy Ball. He\u2019s skinnier than I am and his breath always smells like cornflakes, but he lets me copy his homework and inches his desk closer to mine on test days so I can peek over at his answers without being obvious. Unfortunately, since I stop before Tierney\u2019s class to pee and check in with Ally\u2014we always meet in the bathroom before fourth period, since she has biology at the same time I have chem\u2014I arrive too late to get my usual seat next to Jeremy.</p><p>There are three questions on Mr. Tierney\u2019s quiz, and I don\u2019t know enough to fake an answer to a single one. Next to me, Lauren\u2019s doubled over her paper, tongue just poking out between her teeth. She always does that when she thinks. Her first answer\u2019s looking pretty good, actually: her answers are neat and deliberate, not frantically scribbled like you do when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about and are hoping if you scrawl enough your teacher won\u2019t notice. (For the record, it never works.) Then I remember that Mr. Tierney lectured Lauren about improving her grade last week. Maybe she\u2019s been studying extra hard.</p><p>I peek over Lauren\u2019s shoulder and copy down two of her answers\u2014I\u2019m good at being subtle about it\u2014when Mr. Tierney calls out, \u201cThreeeeee minutes.\u201d He says it dramatically, like he\u2019s doing a voice-over for a movie, and it makes the fat under his chin wiggle.</p><p>It looks like Lauren\u2019s finished and checking her work, but she\u2019s leaning so I can\u2019t see the third answer. I watch the second hand tick its way around the clock\u2014\u201cTwo miiinnnuuutes and thirrrrty secondssss,\u201d Tierney booms\u2014and I lean over and poke Lauren with my pen. She looks up, startled. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve talked to her in years, and for a second I see a look pass over her face that I can\u2019t quite identify.</p><p>Pen, I mouth to her.</p><p>She looks confused and shoots a glance up at Tierney, who is thankfully bent over the textbook.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispers.</p> <p>I make some gestures with my pen, trying to communicate to her that I\u2019ve run out of ink. She\u2019s staring at me dumbly, and for a second I feel like reaching out and shaking her\u2014\u201cTwwooooo minnnutttesss\u201d\u2014but finally her face clears up and she grins like she\u2019s just figured out how to cure cancer. I don\u2019t want to sound harsh, but it\u2019s such a waste to be a dork and kind of slow on the uptake. What\u2019s the point if you can\u2019t at least play Beethoven or win state spelling bees or go to Harvard or something?</p><p>While Lauren\u2019s bent over rummaging for a pen in her bag, I copy down the final answer. I kind of forget I even asked her for a pen, actually, because she has to whisper at me to get my attention.</p><p>\u201cThirrrrttttyyyy seconnndss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>I take it from her. One end is chewed: gross. I give her a tight smile and look away, but a second later she whispers, \u201cDoes it work?\u201d</p><p>I give her a look so she\u2019ll know that now she\u2019s being annoying. I guess she takes it as a sign I don\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cThe pen. Does it work?\u201d she whispers a little louder.</p><p>That\u2019s when Tierney slams the textbook against his desk. The sound is so loud we all jump.</p><p>\u201cMiss Lornet,\u201d he bellows, glaring at Lauren. \u201cAre you talking during my quiz?\u201d</p><p>She turns bright red and looks back and forth from me to the teacher, licking her lips. I don\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI was just\u2014\u201d she says faintly.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He stands up, frowning so hard his mouth looks like it\u2019s going to melt into his neck, and crosses his arms. I think he\u2019s going to say something more to Lauren because he\u2019s shooting her a death stare, but instead he just says, \u201cTime, everybody. Pencils and pens down.\u201d</p><p>I go to give Lauren\u2019s pen back to her but she won\u2019t take it.</p><p>\u201cKeep it,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I say. I hold it between two fingers and lean over, dangling it above her desk, but she tucks her hands behind her back.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d she says, \u201cyou\u2019re going to need a pen. For notes and stuff.\u201d She\u2019s looking at me like she\u2019s offering me something miraculous and not a Bic pen with slobber on it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s her expression or not, but all of a sudden I remember the time we went on a field trip in second grade, and the two of us were the only ones left after everyone had chosen their buddies. We had to hold hands for the rest of the day whenever we crossed the street, and hers were always sweaty. I wonder if she remembers. I hope not.</p><p>I smile tightly and drop the pen in my bag. She grins from ear to ear. I\u2019ll throw it out as soon as we\u2019re done with class, of course; you never know what kind of diseases get carried through slobber.</p><p>On the bright side: my mom always said you should do one nice thing a day. So I guess that means I\u2019m in the clear.</p><p>MATH CLASS:</p><p>FURTHER LESSONS IN CHEMISTRY</p><p>Fourth period I have \u201clife skills,\u201d which is what they call gym when you\u2019re old enough to be offended by forced physical activity (Elody thinks they should call it slavery instead, for accuracy). We\u2019re studying CPR, which means we get to make out with life-sized dummies in front of Mr. Otto. More proof of his perviness.</p><p>Fifth period I have calc and the Cupids come early, just after class has started. One of them is wearing a shiny, red unitard and has devil\u2019s horns; one of them looks like she might be dressed as the Playboy bunny, or maybe the Easter bunny in heels; one of them is dressed up like an angel. Their costumes don\u2019t really make sense in the context of the holiday, but like I said, the whole point is to show off in front of the junior and senior boys. I don\u2019t blame them. We did it too. Freshman year Ally dated Mike Harmon\u2014a senior at the time\u2014for two months after she delivered a Valogram to him and he said her butt looked cute in her tights. That\u2019s a real love story right there.</p><p>The devil gives me three roses\u2014one from Elody, one from Tara Flute, who\u2019s kind of in our group but not really, and one from Rob. I make a big deal of unfolding the tiny card that\u2019s looped around the rose stem and acting moved when I read the note, even though all he\u2019s written is Happy Cupid Day. Luv ya and then in smaller letters near the bottom: Happy now?</p><p>\u201cLuv ya\u201d isn\u2019t exactly \u201cI love you\u201d\u2014which we\u2019ve never said\u2014but it\u2019s getting close. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s saving it for tonight, actually. Last week it was late and we were sitting on his couch and he was staring at me and I was sure\u2014sure\u2014he was going to say it\u2014but instead he just said from a certain angle I looked like Scarlett Johansson.</p><p>At least my note is better than the one Ally got from Matt Wilde last year: Roses are red, violets are blue, if I get you in bed, it would be really cool. He was kidding, obviously, but still. Blue and cool don\u2019t even rhyme.</p><p>I think that\u2019s going to be all of my Valograms, but then the angel comes over to my desk and hands me another one. The roses are all different colors and this one\u2019s pretty amazing: cream and pink swirled petals, like it\u2019s made out of some kind of ice cream.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>I look up. The angel is just standing there, staring at the rose lying on my desk. It\u2019s pretty shocking for a lowerclassman to have the balls to speak to a senior, and it annoys me for a second. She doesn\u2019t look like the average Cupid either. She has hair so pale blond it\u2019s almost white, and I can see individual veins through her skin. She reminds me of someone, but I can\u2019t remember who.</p><p>She catches me looking at her and gives me a quick, embarrassed smile. I\u2019m happy to see some color rush into her face\u2014at least it makes her look alive.</p><p>\u201cMarian.\u201d</p><p>She turns around when the devil girl calls to her. The devil makes an impatient gesture with the roses she\u2019s still carrying, and the angel\u2014Marian, I guess\u2014quickly rejoins the other Cupids. All three of them leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I brush my finger over the rose petals\u2014they\u2019re as soft as anything, as air or a breath\u2014and then instantly feel stupid. I open the note, expecting something from Ally or Lindsay (hers always say Love you to death, bitch), but instead I see a cartoon drawing of a fat cupid accidentally shooting a bird out of a tree. The bird is labeled American Bald Eagle, and it looks like it\u2019s about to fall directly on top of a couple sitting on a bench\u2014Cupid\u2019s original target, presumably. Cupid\u2019s eyes are spirals and he has a stupid grin on his face.</p><p>Underneath the cartoon it says: Don\u2019t drink and love.</p><p>It\u2019s obviously from Kent McFuller\u2014he draws cartoons for The Tribulation, the school humor paper\u2014and I look up and glance in his direction. He always sits in the back left corner of the room. It\u2019s one weird thing about him but definitely not the only one. Sure enough, he\u2019s watching me. He gives me a quick smile and a wave, then makes a motion with his arms like he\u2019s pulling back an arrow on a bowstring and shooting it at me. I make a point of frowning and deliberately take his note, fold it up quickly, and toss it in the bottom of my bag. He doesn\u2019t seem to mind, though. It\u2019s like I can feel his smile burning on me.</p><p>Mr. Daimler comes up and down the aisles, collecting homework, and he pauses at my desk. I have to admit it: he\u2019s the reason I\u2019m psyched to get four Valograms in calc. Mr. Daimler\u2019s only twenty-five and he\u2019s gorgeous. He\u2019s assistant coach of the soccer team, and it\u2019s pretty funny to see him standing next to Otto. They\u2019re complete physical opposites. Mr. Daimler\u2019s over six feet, always tan, and dresses like we do, in jeans and fleeces and New Balance sneakers. He graduated from Thomas Jefferson. We looked him up once in the old yearbooks in the library. He was prom king, and in one picture he\u2019s wearing a tux and smiling with his arm around his prom date. You can just see a hemp necklace peeking out of his shirt collar. I love that picture. But you know what I love even more? He still wears that hemp necklace.</p> <p>It\u2019s so ironic that the hottest guy at Thomas Jefferson is on the faculty.</p><p>As usual, when he smiles my stomach does a little flip. He runs a hand through his messy brown hair, and I fantasize about doing the same thing.</p><p>\u201cNine roses already?\u201d He raises his eyebrows, makes a big show of checking his watch. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only eleven fifteen. Well done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d I make my voice as smooth and flirtatious as possible. \u201cThe people love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d he says, and winks at me.</p> <p>I let him move a little farther down the aisle before I say, loudly, \u201cI still haven\u2019t gotten my rose from you, Mr. Daimler.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t turn around, but I can see the tips of his ears go red. There are giggles and snorts from the class. I get that rush that comes when you know you\u2019re doing something wrong and are getting away with it, like stealing something from the school cafeteria or getting tipsy at a family holiday without anyone knowing.</p><p>Lindsay says Mr. Daimler\u2019s going to sue me for harassment one day. I don\u2019t think so. I think he secretly likes it.</p><p>Case in point: when he turns around to face the class, he\u2019s smiling.</p><p>\u201cAfter reviewing last week\u2019s test results, I realize there\u2019s still a lot of confusion about asymptotes and limits,\u201d he begins, leaning against his desk and crossing his legs at the ankle. Nobody else could make calculus even remotely interesting, I\u2019m sure of it.</p><p>For the rest of the class he barely looks at me, and even then only when I raise my hand. But I swear that when our eyes do meet, it makes my whole body feel like a giant shiver. And I swear he\u2019s feeling it too.</p> <p>After class Kent catches up with me.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d I say to irritate him. I know he\u2019s talking about the cartoon and the rose.</p><p>Kent just smiles and changes the subject. \u201cMy parents are away this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>His smile doesn\u2019t waver. \u201cI\u2019m having a party tonight. Are you coming?\u201d</p><p>I look at him. I\u2019ve never understood Kent. Or at least I haven\u2019t understood him in years. We were super close when we were little\u2014technically I suppose he was my best friend as well as my first kiss\u2014but as soon as he hit middle school, he started getting weirder and weirder. Since freshman year he\u2019s always worn a blazer to school, even though most of the ones he owns are ripped at the seams or have holes in the elbows. He wears the same scuffed-up black-and-white checkered sneakers every day and his hair is so long it\u2019s like a curtain that swings down over his eyes every five seconds. But the real deal breaker is this: he actually wears a bowler hat. To school.</p><p>The worst thing is that he could be cute. He has the face and the body for it. He has a tiny heart-shaped mole under his left eye, no joke. But he has to screw it up by being such a freak.</p> <p>\u201cNot sure what my plans are yet,\u201d I say. \u201cIf that\u2019s where everyone ends up...\u201d I let my voice trail off so he knows I\u2019ll only show if there\u2019s nothing better to do.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be great,\u201d he says, still smiling. Another infuriating thing about Kent: he acts like the world is one big, shiny present he gets to unwrap every morning.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I say. Down the hall I see Rob ducking into the cafeteria and I start walking faster, hoping Kent will get the picture and back off. It\u2019s pretty optimistic thinking on my part. Kent has had a crush on me for years. Possibly even since our kiss.</p><p>He stops walking entirely, maybe hoping I\u2019ll stop too. But I don\u2019t. For a second I feel bad, like I was too harsh, but then his voice rings out after me, and I can tell just by the sound of it that he\u2019s still smiling.</p><p>\u201cSee you tonight,\u201d he says. I hear the squeak of his sneakers on the linoleum, and I know he has turned around and started off in the opposite direction. He starts whistling. The sound of it carries back to me, getting fainter. It takes me a while to place the tune.</p><p>The sun\u2019ll come out tomorrow, bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow there\u2019ll be sun. From Annie, the musical. My favorite song\u2014when I was seven.</p><p>I know no one else in the hall will get it, but still I\u2019m embarrassed and can feel heat creeping up my neck. He\u2019s always doing things like that: acting like he knows me better than anyone else just because we used to play in the sandbox together a hundred years ago. Acting like nothing that\u2019s happened in the past ten years has changed anything, even though it\u2019s changed everything.</p><p>My phone\u2019s buzzing in my back pocket and before I go in to lunch I snap it open. There\u2019s one new text from Lindsay.</p><p>Party @ Kent McFreaky\u2019s 2nite. In?</p><p>I pause for just a second, blowing out a long breath, before I text back.</p><p>Obv.</p><p>There are three acceptable things to eat in the Thomas Jefferson cafeteria:</p><p>1. A bagel, plain or with cream cheese.</p><p>2. French fries.</p><p>3. A deli sandwich from the make-your-own sandwich bar.</p><p>a. But only with turkey, ham, or chicken breast. Salami and bologna are obvious no-nos, and roast beef is questionable. Which is a shame, because roast beef is my favorite.</p><p>Rob is standing over by the cash register with a group of his friends. He\u2019s holding an enormous tray of fries. He eats them every day. He catches my eye and gives me a nod. (He\u2019s not the kind of guy who does so well with feelings, his or mine. Thus the \u201cluv ya\u201d on the note he sent me.)</p><p>It\u2019s weird. Before we were going out, I liked him so much, and for so long, that every time he even looked in my direction I would get this bubbling, fizzing feeling so strong it would make me dizzy. No lie: sometimes I got light-headed thinking about him and had to sit down.</p><p>But now that we\u2019re officially a couple, I sometimes have the strangest thoughts when I look at him, like I wonder if all those fries are clogging his arteries or whether he flosses or how long it\u2019s been since he washed the Yankees hat he wears pretty much every day. Sometimes I\u2019m worried there\u2019s something wrong with me. Who wouldn\u2019t want to go out with Rob Cokran?</p><p>It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not totally happy\u2014I am\u2014but it\u2019s almost like sometimes I have to keep running over and over in my head why I liked him in the first place, like if I don\u2019t I\u2019ll somehow forget. Thankfully there are a million good reasons: the fact that he has black hair and a billion freckles but somehow they don\u2019t look stupid on him; that he\u2019s loud but in a funny way; that everyone knows him and likes him and probably half of the girls in the school have a crush on him; that he looks good in his lacrosse jersey; that when he\u2019s really tired he lays his head on my shoulder and falls asleep. That\u2019s my favorite thing about him. I like to lie next to him when it\u2019s late, dark, and so quiet I can hear my own heartbeat. It\u2019s times like that when I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m in love.</p><p>I ignore Rob as I get in line to pay for my bagel\u2014I can play hard to get too\u2014and then head for the senior section. The rest of the cafeteria is a rectangle. Special ed kids sit all the way down, at the table closest to the classrooms, and then there are the freshman tables, and then the sophomore tables, and then the junior tables. The senior section is at the very head of the cafeteria. It\u2019s an octagon lined completely with windows. Okay, so it only looks out over the parking lot, but it\u2019s still better than getting a straight view of the short-bus brigade dribbling their applesauce. No offense.</p><p>Ally\u2019s already sitting at a small circular table right by the window: our favorite.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I put down my tray and my roses. Ally\u2019s bouquet is sitting on the table and I do a quick count.</p><p>\u201cNine roses.\u201d I gesture to hers and then give my bouquet a rattle. \u201cSame as me.\u201d</p><p>She makes a face. \u201cOne of mine doesn\u2019t count. Ethan Shlosky sent one to me. Can you believe it? Stalker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I got one from Kent McFuller, so one of mine doesn\u2019t count either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looves you,\u201d she says, drawing out the o. \u201cDid you get Lindsay\u2019s text?\u201d</p><p>I pick the mushy center out of my bagel and pop it in my mouth. \u201cAre we really going to go to his party?\u201d</p><p>Ally snorts. \u201cAfraid he\u2019ll date-rape you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s gonna be a keg,\u201d Ally says. She takes a tiny nibble of her turkey sandwich. \u201cMy house after school, okay?\u201d She doesn\u2019t really have to ask. It\u2019s our tradition on Fridays. We order food, raid her closet, blast music, and dance around swapping eye shadows and lip glosses.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been watching Rob come closer out of the corner of my eye, and suddenly he\u2019s there, plopping into a chair next to me and leaning in until his mouth is touching my left ear. He smells like Total cologne. He always does. I think it smells a little like this tea my grandmother used to drink\u2014lemon balm\u2014but I haven\u2019t told him that yet.</p><p>\u201cHey, Slammer.\u201d He\u2019s always making up names for me: Slammer, Samwich, Sammy Says. \u201cDid you get my Valogram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get mine?\u201d I say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He swings his backpack off his shoulder and unzips it.

He\u2019s not so much into studying.</p><p>\u201cWho are the other roses from?\u201d I say, teasing him.</p><p>\u201cYour competition,\u201d he says, arching his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cVery classy,\u201d Ally says. \u201cAre you going to Kent\u2019s party tonight, Rob?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Rob shrugs and suddenly looks bored.</p><p>Here\u2019s a secret: one time when we were kissing, I opened my eyes and saw that his eyes were open. He wasn\u2019t even looking at me. He was looking over my shoulder, watching the room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting a keg,\u201d Ally says for the second time.</p><p>Everyone jokes that going to Jefferson prepares you for the total college experience: you learn to work, and you learn to drink. Two years ago the New York Times ranked us among the top ten booziest public schools in Connecticut.</p><p>It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything else to do around here, though. We\u2019ve got malls and basement parties. That\u2019s it. Let\u2019s face it: that\u2019s how most of the country is. My dad always said that they should take down the Statue of Liberty and put up a big strip mall instead, or those golden McDonald\u2019s arches. He said at least that way people would know what to expect.</p> <p>\u201cAhem. Excuse me.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay is standing behind Rob, clearing her throat. She has her arms folded and she\u2019s tapping her foot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my seat, Cokran,\u201d she says. She\u2019s only pretending to be hard-core. Rob and Lindsay have always been friends. At least, they\u2019ve always been in the same group, and by necessity have always had to be friends.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, Edgecombe.\u201d He gets up and makes a big flourish, like a bow, when she sits down.</p><p>\u201cSee you tonight, Rob,\u201d Ally says, and adds, \u201cbring your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Rob leans down and buries his face in my hair, making his voice deep and quiet. That voice used to make all of the nerves in my body light up like a firework explosion. Now, sometimes, I think it\u2019s cheesy. \u201cDon\u2019t forget. It\u2019s all about you and me tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten,\u201d I say, hoping my voice sounds sexy and not scared. My palms are sweating and I pray he doesn\u2019t try to take my hand.</p><p>Thankfully, he doesn\u2019t. Instead he bends down and presses his mouth into mine. We make out for a bit until Lindsay squeals, \u201cNot while I\u2019m eating,\u201d and throws a fry in my direction. It hits me on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBye, ladies,\u201d Rob says, and saunters off with his hat just tilted on an angle.</p><p>I wipe my mouth on a napkin when nobody\u2019s looking, since the bottom half of my face is now coated with Rob\u2019s saliva.</p><p>Here\u2019s another secret about Rob: I hate the way he kisses.</p><p>Elody says all my stressing is just insecurity because Rob and I haven\u2019t actually sealed the deal yet. Once we do, she\u2019s positive I\u2019ll feel better, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s right. After all, she\u2019s the expert.</p><p>Elody is the last to join us at lunch, and we all make a grab for her fries when she sets down her tray. She makes a halfhearted attempt to swat our hands away.</p><p>She slaps her bouquet of roses down next. She has twelve, and I feel a momentary twinge of jealousy.</p> <p>I guess Ally feels it too because she says, \u201cWhat did you have to do for those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did you have to do?\u201d Lindsay corrects her.</p><p>Elody sticks her tongue out but seems pleased that we noticed.</p><p>All of a sudden, Ally looks at something over my shoulder and starts giggling. \u201cPsycho killer, qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est.\u201d</p><p>We all turn around. Juliet Sykes, or Psycho, has just drifted into the senior section. That\u2019s how she walks: like she\u2019s drifting, being blown around by forces outside of her control. She\u2019s carrying a brown paper bag in her long pale fingers. Her face is shielded behind a curtain of pale blond hair, shoulders hunched up around her ears.</p><p>For the most part, everyone in the cafeteria ignores her\u2014she\u2019s the definition of forgettable\u2014but Lindsay, Ally, Elody, and I start making that screeching and stabbing motion from Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho, which we all watched at a sleepover a couple of years ago. (Afterward we had to sleep with the lights on.)</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if Juliet hears us. Lindsay always says she can\u2019t hear at all because the voices in her head are too loud. Juliet keeps up that same slow pace across the room, eventually reaching the door that leads out into the parking lot. I\u2019m not sure where she eats every day. I hardly ever see her in the cafeteria.</p><p>She has to shove her shoulder against the door a few times before it will open, like she\u2019s too frail to make it work.</p><p>\u201cDid she get our Valogram?\u201d Lindsay says, licking salt off a fry before popping it in her mouth.</p><p>Ally nods. \u201cIn bio. I was sitting right behind her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she ever say anything?\u201d Ally puts one hand across her heart, pretending to be upset. \u201cShe threw the rose out as soon as class was over. Can you believe it? Right in front of me.\u201d</p><p>Freshman year Lindsay somehow found out that Juliet hadn\u2019t been sent a single Valogram. Not one. So Lindsay put a note on one of her roses and duct-taped it on Juliet\u2019s locker. The note said: Maybe next year, but probably not.</p><p>Every year since then we\u2019ve sent her a rose and the same note on Cupid Day. The only note she\u2019s ever received from anyone, as far as I know. Maybe next year, but probably not.</p><p>Normally I would feel bad, but Juliet deserves her nickname. She\u2019s a freak. Rumor has it that she was once found by her parents on Route 84, stark naked at three A.M., straddling the highway divider. Last year Lacey Kennedy said she saw Juliet in the bathroom by the science wing, stroking her hair over and over and staring at her reflection. And Juliet never says a word. Hasn\u2019t for years, as far as I know.</p><p>Lindsay hates her. I think Lindsay and Juliet were in a couple of the same elementary school classes, and for all I know Lindsay has hated her since then. She makes the sign of the cross whenever Juliet\u2019s around, like Juliet might somehow go vampire and make a lunge for Lindsay\u2019s throat.</p><p>It was Lindsay who found out Juliet peed her sleeping bag during a Girl Scout camping trip in fifth grade, and Lindsay who gave her the nickname Mellow Yellow. People called Juliet that forever\u2014until the end of freshman year, if you can believe it\u2014and stayed away from her because they said she smelled like pee.</p><p>I\u2019m looking out the window and I watch Juliet\u2019s hair flash in the sunlight like it\u2019s catching fire. There\u2019s darkness on the horizon, a smudge where the storm is growing. It occurs to me for the first time that I\u2019m not exactly sure why Lindsay started hating Juliet in the first place, or when. I open my mouth to ask her, but they\u2019ve already moved on to other topics.</p><p>\u201c\u2014catfight,\u201d Elody finishes, and Ally giggles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified,\u201d Lindsay says sarcastically. Clearly I\u2019ve missed something.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I say.</p><p>Elody turns to me. \u201cSarah Grundel is going around saying Lindsay ruined her life.\u201d I have to wait while Elody folds a fry expertly into her mouth. \u201cShe can\u2019t swim in the quarter finals. And you know she lives for that shit. Remember when she forgot to take her goggles off after morning practice and she wore them until second period?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably keeps all of her blue ribbons on a wall in her room,\u201d Ally says.</p><p>\u201cSam used to do that. Didn\u2019t you, Sam? All those ribbons for playing with horsies.\u201d Lindsay elbows me.</p><p>\u201cCan we get back to the point?\u201d I wave my hands, partly because I want to hear the story, partly to take the attention off me and the fact that I used to be a dork. When I was in fifth grade, I spent more time with horses than with members of my own species. \u201cI still don\u2019t get why Sarah\u2019s pissed at Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>Elody rolls her eyes at me like I belong at the special ed table. \u201cSarah got detention\u2014she was late to homeroom for, like, the fifth time in two weeks.\u201d I\u2019m still not getting it and she heaves a sigh. \u201cShe was late to homeroom because she had to park in Upper Lot and haul ass\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c.22 miles!\u201d</p><p>We all bust it out at the same time and then start giggling like maniacs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lindz,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you guys throw down I\u2019m totally putting money on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve got your back,\u201d Elody says.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it kind of weird how that stuff happens?\u201d Ally says in this shy voice she gets when she\u2019s trying to say something serious. \u201cHow everything spirals out from everything else? Like, if Lindsay hadn\u2019t stolen that parking space...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal it. I got it fair and square,\u201d Lindsay protests, bringing her hand down on the table for emphasis. Elody\u2019s Diet Coke sloshes over the side of the can, soaking some fries. This makes us start laughing again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d Ally raises her voice to be heard over us. \u201cIt\u2019s like a web, you know? Everything\u2019s connected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been breaking into your dad\u2019s stash again, Al?\u201d Elody says.</p><p>This is all it takes to really get us going. This is a joke we\u2019ve had with Ally for years because her dad works in the music industry. He\u2019s a lawyer, not a producer or manager or musician or anything, and he wears a suit everywhere (even to the pool in the summer), but Lindsay claims he\u2019s secretly a hippie stoner.</p><p>As we\u2019re laughing, doubling over, Ally turns pink. \u201cYou guys never listen to me,\u201d she says, but she\u2019s fighting a smile. She takes a fry and throws it at Elody. \u201cI read once that if a bunch of butterflies takes off from Thailand, it can cause a rainstorm in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, one of your farts could cause a massive blackout in Portugal.\u201d Elody giggles, throwing a fry back.</p><p>\u201cYour morning breath could cause a stampede in Africa.\u201d Ally leans forward. \u201cAnd I do not fart.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay and I are laughing, and Elody and Ally keep throwing fries back and forth. Lindsay tries to say they\u2019re wasting perfectly good grease, but she\u2019s snorting so hard she can barely get the words out.</p><p>Finally she sucks in a deep breath and chokes out, \u201cYou know what I heard? That if you sneeze enough you can cause a tornado in Iowa.\u201d</p><p>Even Ally goes crazy at this, and suddenly we\u2019re all trying it, laughing and sneezing and snorting at the same time. Everybody\u2019s staring at us, but we don\u2019t care.</p><p>After about a million sneezes, Lindsay leans back in her chair, clutching her stomach and gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cThirty dead in Iowa tornadoes,\u201d she gets out, \u201canother fifty missing.\u201d</p><p>This sets us off again.</p><p>Lindsay and I decide to cut seventh period and go to TCBY. Lindsay has French, which she can\u2019t stand, and I have English. We cut seventh period a lot together. We\u2019re second-semester seniors, so it\u2019s like we\u2019re expected not to go to class. Plus I hate my English teacher, Mrs. Harbor. She\u2019s always going off on tangents. Sometimes I\u2019ll zone out for a few minutes, and all of a sudden she\u2019ll be talking about underwear in the eighteenth century or oppression in Africa or the way the sun looks rising over the Grand Canyon. Even though she\u2019s probably only in her fifties, I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s losing it. That\u2019s how it started with my grandmother: ideas swirling around and colliding with each other, causes coming after effects, and point A switched with point B. When my grandmother was still alive we would visit her, and even though I was no more than six, I remember thinking: I hope I die young. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s a definition of irony for you, Mrs. Harbor.</p><p>Or maybe foreshadowing?</p><p>Technically you need a special pass signed by your parents and the administration to leave campus during the school day. This wasn\u2019t always true. For a long time one of the perks to being a senior was getting to leave campus whenever you wanted, as long as you had a free period. That was twenty years ago, though, a few years before Thomas Jefferson got the reputation for one of the highest teen suicide rates in the country. We looked up the article online once: the Connecticut Post called us Suicide High.</p><p>And then one day a bunch of kids left campus and drove off a bridge\u2014a suicide pact, I guess. Anyway, after that the school forbade anyone from leaving school during the day without special permission. It\u2019s kind of stupid if you think about it. That\u2019s like finding out that kids are bringing vodka to school in water bottles and forbidding anyone to drink water.</p> <p>Fortunately, there\u2019s another way to get off campus: through a hole in the fence beyond the gym by the tennis court, which we call the Smokers\u2019 Lounge, since that\u2019s where all the smokers hang out. No one\u2019s around, though, when Lindsay and I slip through the fence and get started across the woods. In a little while we\u2019ll come on to Route 120. Everything is still and frozen. Twigs and black leaves crack under our shoes, and our breath rises in solid white puffs.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson is about three miles outside of downtown Ridgeview\u2014or what you can call the downtown\u2014but only about a half mile from a small strip of dingy stores we\u2019ve named the Row. There\u2019s a gas station, a TCBY, a Chinese restaurant that once made Elody sick for two days, and a random Hallmark store where you can buy pink glittery ballerina figurines and snow globes and crap like that. That\u2019s where we head. I know we must look like total freaks, stomping along the road in our skirts and tights, our jackets flapping open to show off our fur-trimmed tank tops.</p><p>We pass Hunan Kitchen on our way to TCBY. Through the grime-coated windows we spot Alex Liment and Anna Cartullo bent over a bowl of something.</p><p>\u201cOoo, scandal,\u201d Lindsay says, raising her eyebrows, although it\u2019s really only a half scandal. Everyone knows that Alex has been cheating on Bridget McGuire with Anna for the past three months. Everyone except Bridget, obviously.</p><p>Bridget\u2019s family is super-Catholic. She\u2019s pretty and really clean-looking, like every time you see her she\u2019s just scrubbed her face really hard. Apparently she\u2019s saving herself for marriage. That\u2019s what she says, anyway, although Elody thinks Bridget might be a closet lesbo. Anna Cartullo is only a junior, but if the rumors are true she\u2019s already had sex with at least four people. She\u2019s one of the few kids in Ridgeview who doesn\u2019t come from any money. Her mom\u2019s a hairdresser, and I don\u2019t even know if she has a dad. She lives in one of the shitty rental condos right off the Row. I once heard Andrew Singer saying her bedroom always smelled like General Tso\u2019s chicken.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in and say hi,\u201d Lindsay says, reaching for my hand.</p><p>I hang back. \u201cI\u2019m going through sugar withdrawal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Take these.\u201d She pulls a pack of SweeTarts from the waistband of her skirt. Lindsay always carries candy on her, 24/7, like she\u2019s packing drugs. I guess she kind of is. \u201cJust for a second, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I let myself be dragged inside. A bell tinkles as we come through the door. There\u2019s a woman flipping through Us Weekly behind the counter. She looks at us, then looks down again when she realizes we\u2019re not going to order.</p><p>Lindsay slides right up to Alex and Anna\u2019s booth, leaning against the table. She\u2019s kinda, sorta friends with Alex. Alex is kinda, sorta friends with a lot of people, since he deals pot out of a shoe box in his bedroom. He and I have a head-nod friendship, since that\u2019s pretty much the limit of our interaction. He\u2019s actually in English with me, though he shows even less than I do. I guess the rest of the time he\u2019s with Anna. Every so often he\u2019ll say something like, \u201cThat essay assignment blows, huh?\u201d but other than that we don\u2019t talk.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cYou going to Kent\u2019s party tonight?\u201d</p> <p>Alex\u2019s face is red and splotchy. At least he\u2019s embarrassed to be caught out with Anna so blatantly. Or maybe he\u2019s just having a reaction to the food. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.</p><p>\u201cUm...I don\u2019t know. Maybe. Gotta see....\u201d He trails off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be super fun.\u201d Lindsay makes her voice extra perky. \u201cAre you going to bring Bridget? She\u2019s such a sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Actually, we both think Bridget is annoying\u2014she\u2019s always really cheerful and she wears T-shirts with lame slogans like Unless You\u2019re the Lead Dog the View Never Changes (no lie)\u2014but Lindsay despises Anna and once wrote AC=WT all over the bathroom right across from the cafeteria\u2014the one everyone uses. WT stands for white trash.</p><p>The situation is beyond awkward, so I blurt out, \u201cSesame chicken?\u201d I point at the meat congealing in a grayish sauce in a bowl on the table, next to two fortune cookies and a sad-looking orange.</p><p>\u201cOrange beef,\u201d Alex says. He seems relieved by the change of topic.</p><p>Lindsay gives me a look, annoyed, but I keep rattling on. \u201cYou should be careful about eating here. The chicken once poisoned Elody. She threw up for, like, two days straight. If it was chicken. She swears she found a fur ball in it.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I say this Anna picks up her chopsticks and takes an enormous bite, looking up and smiling at me as she chews so I can see the food in her mouth. I\u2019m not sure whether she\u2019s doing it deliberately to gross me out, but it seems like it.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s nasty, Kingston,\u201d Alex says, but he\u2019s smiling now.</p><p>Lindsay rolls her eyes, like Alex and Anna are both a total waste of our time. \u201cCome on, Sam.\u201d</p><p>She pockets a fortune cookie and breaks it open when we get outside. \u201cHappiness is found when one is not looking,\u201d she reads, and I crack up when she makes a face. She balls up the little slip of paper and lets it flutter to the ground. \u201cUseless.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cThe smell in there always makes me sick.\u201d It does, too: that smell of old meat and cheap oil and garlic. The clouds on the horizon are slowly taking over the sky, turning everything gray and blurry.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d Lindsay puts a hand on her stomach. \u201cYou know what I need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA jumbo cup of The Country\u2019s Best Yogurt!\u201d I say, smiling. TCBY is another thing we can\u2019t bring ourselves to abbreviate.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely a jumbo cup of The Country\u2019s Best Yogurt,\u201d Lindsay echoes.</p><p>Even though we\u2019re both freezing, we order double-chocolate soft-serve with sprinkles and crushed peanut butter cups on top, which we eat on our way back to school, blowing on our fingers to keep them warm. Alex and Anna are gone from Hunan Kitchen when we pass, but we run into them again at the Smokers\u2019 Lounge. We have exactly seven minutes left until the bell for eighth period, and Lindsay pulls me behind the tennis courts so she can have a cigarette without listening to Alex and Anna argue. That\u2019s what it looks like they\u2019re doing, anyway. Anna\u2019s head is bent and Alex is grabbing her shoulders, whispering to her. The cigarette in his hand burns so close to her dull brown hair I\u2019m positive it\u2019s going to catch fire, and I picture her whole head just going up like that, like a match.</p><p>Lindsay finishes her smoke and we dump our yogurt cups right there, on top of the frozen black leaves and trampled cigarette packs and plastic bags half filled with rainwater. I\u2019m feeling anxious about tonight\u2014half dread and half excitement\u2014like when you hear thunder and know that any second you\u2019ll see lightning tearing across the sky, nipping at the clouds with its teeth. I shouldn\u2019t have skipped out on English. It has given me too much time to think. And thinking never did anybody any good, no matter what your teachers and parents and the science-club freaks tell you.</p><p>We skirt the perimeter of the tennis courts and go up along Senior Alley. Alex and Anna are still standing half concealed behind the gym. Alex is on his second cigarette at least. Definitely an argument. I feel a momentary rush of satisfaction: Rob and I hardly ever fight, at least not about anything serious. That must mean something.</p><p>\u201cTrouble in paradise,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMore like trouble in the trailer park,\u201d Lindsay says.</p><p>We start cutting across the teachers\u2019 lot when we see Ms. Winters, the vice principal, threading between cars, trying to rout out the smokers who don\u2019t have time or are too lazy to walk all the way down to the Lounge and instead try to hide out between the teachers\u2019 old Volvos and Chevrolets. Ms. Winters has some crazy vendetta against people who smoke. I heard that her mom died of lung cancer or emphysema or something. If you get caught smoking by Ms. Winters you get three Friday detentions, no questions asked.</p><p>Lindsay frantically rifles in her bag for her Trident and pops two pieces in her mouth. \u201cShit, shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t get busted just for smelling like smoke,\u201d I say, even though Lindsay knows this. She likes the drama, though. Funny how you can know your friends so well, but you still end up playing the same games with them.</p><p>She ignores me. \u201cHow\u2019s my breath?\u201d She breathes on me.</p><p>\u201cLike a friggin\u2019 menthol factory.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Winters hasn\u2019t spotted us yet. She\u2019s making her way down the rows, sometimes stooping to peer underneath the cars as though someone might be sandwiched against the ground, trying to light up. There\u2019s a reason everyone calls her the Nicotine Nazi behind her back.</p><p>I hesitate, looking back toward the gym. I don\u2019t especially like Alex and I don\u2019t like Anna, but anyone who\u2019s ever been through high school understands you have to stick together against parents, teachers, and cops. It\u2019s one of those invisible lines: us against them. You just know this, like you know where to sit and who to talk to and what to eat in the cafeteria, without even knowing how you know. If that makes sense.</p><p>\u201cShould we go back and warn them?\u201d I ask Lindsay, and she pauses too and squints at the sky like she\u2019s thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cScrew it,\u201d she says finally. \u201cThey can take care of themselves.\u201d As if to reinforce her point, the bell for final period rings and she gives me a shove. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right, as usual. After all, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ve ever done anything for me.</p><p>FRIENDSHIP: A HISTORY</p><p>Lindsay and I became friends in seventh grade. Lindsay picked me out. I\u2019m still not sure why. After years of trying, I had only just clawed my way up from the social bottom to the social middle. Lindsay\u2019s been popular since first grade, when she moved here. In the class circus that year she was the ringleader; when we did a production of The Wizard of Oz the next year she was Dorothy. And in third grade, when we all performed Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, she got to play Charlie.</p><p>I think that pretty much gives you an idea. She\u2019s the kind of person who makes you feel drunk just by being around her, like suddenly the world\u2019s edges are dulled and all of the colors are spinning together. I\u2019ve never told her that, obviously. She\u2019d make fun of me for lezzing out on her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anyway, the summer before seventh grade a bunch of us were at Tara Flute\u2019s pool party. Beth Schiff was showing off by doing cannonballs in the deep end, but really she was showing off the fact that between May and July she\u2019d sprouted a pair of C-cup boobs\u2014definitely the biggest of any girl there. I was in the house getting a soda when all of a sudden Lindsay came up to me, eyes shining. She\u2019d never spoken to me before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to come see this,\u201d she said, grabbing my arm. Her breath smelled like ice cream.</p><p>She pulled me into Tara\u2019s room, where all the girls had piled their bags and their changes of clothes. Beth\u2019s bag was pink and had her initials marked in purple embroidery on the side. Lindsay had obviously gone through it, because she immediately crouched down and reached for a clear zipper case, like the kind we had to store pens in when we were in grade school.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d She held it up, rattling it. Inside were two tampons.</p> <p>I don\u2019t remember how it started, but suddenly Lindsay and I were running through the house, checking bathroom cabinets and drawers, gathering up all the tampons and pads that Tara\u2019s mother and older sister had in the house. I was so happy I was dizzy. Lindsay Edgecombe and I were talking, and not just talking but laughing, and not just laughing but laughing so hard I had to squeeze my legs together to keep from peeing. Then we ran out onto the deck and started throwing handful after handful of tampons down onto the pool party below. Lindsay was screaming, \u201cBeth! These fell out of your bag!\u201d Some of the tampons swirled down into the water and all the guys were suddenly pushing and shoving to get out of the pool like they were going to be contaminated. Beth stood on the diving board, dripping wet and shaking, while the rest of us nearly died laughing.</p><p>It reminded me of the time my parents took me to the Grand Canyon in fourth grade and made me stand on a ledge to get photographed. My legs hadn\u2019t been able to stop shaking and my feet got a tingling feeling in the soles, like they were itching to jump: I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how easy it would be to fall, how high up we were. After my mom took the picture and let me back away from the ledge, I started laughing and couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Standing on the deck with Lindsay I got that exact same feeling.</p><p>After that Lindsay and I were best friends. Ally came in later, after she and Lindsay were in a field hockey league together the summer before eighth grade. Elody moved to Ridgeview freshman year. At one of the first parties of the year she hooked up with Sean Morton, who Lindsay had had a crush on for six months. Everyone thought Lindsay would kill Elody. But the next Monday at school Elody was at our lunch table, and she and Lindsay were bent over a plate of curly fries, giggling and acting like they\u2019d known each other forever. I\u2019m glad. Even though Elody can sometimes be embarrassing, I think deep down she\u2019s the nicest of any of us.</p><p>THE PARTY</p> <p>After school we go to Ally\u2019s. When we were younger\u2014freshman year and even half of sophomore year\u2014we\u2019d sometimes stay in and put on clay masks and order as much Chinese food as we could eat, taking twenties from the cookie jar on the third shelf next to Ally\u2019s refrigerator, where her dad keeps an emergency thousand dollars at all times. We called them our \u201cegg-roll emergency\u201d nights. Then we\u2019d stretch out on her enormous couch and watch movies until we fell asleep\u2014the TV in Ally\u2019s living room is as big as the screen in a movie theater\u2014our legs tangled together under an enormous fleece blanket. Since junior year, though, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve stayed in even once, except when Matt Wilde broke up with Ally, and she cried so hard that the next morning her face was puffy, like a mole\u2019s.</p><p>Today we raid Ally\u2019s closet so we don\u2019t have to wear the same outfit to Kent\u2019s party. Elody, Ally, and Lindsay are paying special attention to how I look. Elody puts bright red polish on my nails, her hands shaking a little so some of it gets on my cuticles and makes it look like I\u2019m bleeding, but I\u2019m too nervous to care. Rob and I are going to meet up at Kent\u2019s and he\u2019s already sent me a text that says I evn made my bed 4 u. I let Ally pick out my outfit\u2014a metallic gold tank top, too big in the chest, and a pair of Ally\u2019s crazy four-inch heels (she calls them her stripper shoes). Lindsay does my makeup, humming and breathing vodka onto me. We\u2019ve all taken two shots, chasing them with cranberry juice.</p><p>Afterward I lock myself in the bathroom, warmth tingling from my fingertips up to my head, and try to memorize exactly how I look there, in that second. But after a while all of my features seem like they\u2019re just hanging there, like something I\u2019m seeing on a stranger.</p><p>When I was little I used to do this a lot: lock myself in the bathroom and take showers so hot the mirrors would cloud completely over, then stand there, watching as my face took shape slowly behind the steam, rough outlines at first, then details appearing gradually. Each time I\u2019d think that when my face came back I would see somebody beautiful, like during my shower I would have transformed into someone brighter and better. But I always looked the same.</p><p>Standing in Ally\u2019s bathroom, I smile and think, Tomorrow I\u2019ll finally be different.</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s kind of music-obsessed, so she makes us a playlist for the ride to Kent\u2019s house, even though he lives only a few miles away. We listen to Dr. Dre and Tupac, and then we blast \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d and all sing along.</p> <p>It\u2019s the weirdest thing, though: as we\u2019re driving there along all those familiar streets\u2014streets I\u2019ve known my whole life, streets so familiar I might as well have imagined them myself\u2014I get this feeling like I\u2019m floating above everything, hovering above all of the houses and the roads and the yards and the trees, going up, up, up, above Rocky\u2019s and the Rite Aid and the gas station and Thomas Jefferson and the football field and the metal bleachers where we sit and scream our heads off every homecoming. Like everything is tiny and insignificant. Like I\u2019m already only remembering it.</p><p>Elody\u2019s howling at the top of her lungs. She has the lowest tolerance out of all of us. Ally\u2019s got the rest of the vodka tucked into her bag but nothing to chase it with. Lindsay\u2019s driving because she can drink all night and hardly feel it.</p><p>The rain starts when we\u2019re almost there, but it\u2019s so light it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s just hanging in the air, like a big curtain of white vapor. I don\u2019t remember the last time I was at Kent\u2019s house\u2014his ninth birthday party, maybe?\u2014and I\u2019ve forgotten how far it\u2019s set back in the woods. The driveway seems to snake on forever. All we see is the dull light from the headlights bouncing off a twisting, gravelly path and revealing dead tree branches crowding closely overhead, and tiny pellets of rain like diamonds.</p><p>\u201cThis is how horror movies start,\u201d Ally says, adjusting her tank top. We\u2019ve all borrowed new tops from her, but she\u2019s insisted on keeping on the fur-trimmed one, even though she was the one who was initially against it. \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s number forty-two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a little farther,\u201d I say, even though I have no idea, and I\u2019m starting to wonder whether we turned too early. I have butterflies in my stomach, but I\u2019m not sure whether they\u2019re good or bad.</p><p>The woods press closer and closer until they\u2019re nearly brushing up against the car doors. Lindsay starts complaining about the paint job. Just when it seems like we\u2019ll be sucked up into the darkness, all of a sudden the woods stop completely and there\u2019s the biggest, most beautiful lawn you can imagine, with a white house at its center that looks like it\u2019s made out of frosting. It\u2019s got balconies and a long porch that runs along two sides. The shutters are white too, and carved with designs it\u2019s too dark to make out. I don\u2019t remember any of it. Maybe it\u2019s the alcohol, but I think it\u2019s the most beautiful house I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>We\u2019re all silent for a minute, looking. Half the house is dark, but warm light is shining from the top floor, and where it makes it to the lawn it turns the grass silver.</p><p>Lindsay says, \u201cIt\u2019s almost as big as your house, Al.\u201d I\u2019m sorry she spoke: it feels like a spell has been broken.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d Ally says. She takes the vodka out of her bag and swigs it, coughs, burps, and wipes her mouth.</p><p>\u201cGive me a shot of that,\u201d Elody says, reaching for the bottle.</p><p>The bottle\u2019s in my hand before I realize it. I take a sip. It burns my throat and tastes awful, like paint or gasoline, but as soon as it\u2019s down I get a rush. We climb out of the car and the light from the house surges and expands, winking at me.</p><p>Walking into parties always gives me a crampy feeling at the bottom of my stomach. It\u2019s a good feeling, though: the feeling of knowing anything can happen. Most of the time nothing does, of course. Most of the time one night blends into the next, and weeks blend into weeks, and months into other months. And sooner or later we all die.</p><p>But at the beginning of the night anything\u2019s possible.</p><p>The front door is locked and we have to go around the side, where a door opens onto a really narrow hallway all paneled in wood and a tiny flight of steep wooden stairs. It smells like something I remember from childhood, but I can\u2019t quite place it. I hear the tinkle of breaking glass and someone yells, \u201cFire in the hole!\u201d Then Dujeous roars from the speakers: All MCs in the house tonight, if your lyrics sound tight then rock the mic. The stairs are so narrow we have to squeeze up in single file because people are coming down in the opposite direction, empty beer cups in hand. Most of them have to turn so their backs are against the wall. We say hi to a few people and ignore the rest. As usual I can feel all of them looking at us. That\u2019s another nice thing about being popular: you don\u2019t have to pay any attention to the people paying attention to you.</p><p>At the top of the stairs a dim hallway is hung all over with multicolored Christmas lights. There are a series of rooms, each leading off the next, and all seem to be filled with draped fabrics and big pillows and couches and all are packed with people. Everything is soft\u2014the colors, the surfaces, the way people look\u2014except the music, which pumps through the walls, making the floor vibrate. People are smoking inside too, so everything\u2019s happening behind a thick blue veil. I\u2019ve only smoked pot once, but this is what I imagine it\u2019s like to be stoned.</p><p>Lindsay leans back and says something to me, but it gets lost in the murmur of voices. Then she\u2019s moving away from me, weaving through the crowd. I turn around, but Elody and Ally are gone too, and before I know it my heart is pounding and I get this itchy feeling in my palms.</p><p>Recently I\u2019ve been having this nightmare where I\u2019m standing in the middle of an enormous crowd, being pushed from left to right. The faces look familiar, but there\u2019s something horribly wrong with all of them: someone will walk by who looks like Lindsay, but then her mouth is weird and droopy like it\u2019s melting off. And none of them recognize me.</p><p>Obviously standing in Kent\u2019s house isn\u2019t the same thing, since I pretty much know everybody except for some of the juniors and a couple of girls who I think might be sophomores. But still, it\u2019s enough to make me freak out a little. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m about to head over to Emma Howser\u2014she\u2019s super cheesy and normally I wouldn\u2019t be caught dead talking to her, but I\u2019m getting desperate\u2014when I feel thick arms around me and smell lemon balm. Rob.</p><p>He puts a wet mouth against my ear. \u201cSexy Sammy. Where\u2019ve you been all my life?\u201d</p><p>I turn around. His face is bright red. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d I say, and it comes out more accusatory than I meant it to.</p><p>\u201cSober enough,\u201d he says, trying and failing to raise one eyebrow. \u201cAnd you\u2019re late.\u201d His grin is lazy. Only one half of it curves upward. \u201cWe did a keg stand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s ten o\u2019clock,\u201d I point out. \u201cWe\u2019re not late. I called you, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He pats his fleece and his pockets. \u201cMust\u2019ve put my phone down somewhere.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a delinquent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it when you use those big words.\u201d The other half of his smile is creeping upward slowly and I know he\u2019s going to kiss me. I turn partly away, searching the room for my friends, but they\u2019re still MIA.</p><p>In the corner I spot Kent, wearing a tie and a collared shirt about three sizes too big for him, which is half tucked into a pair of ratty khakis. At least he\u2019s not wearing his bowler hat. He\u2019s talking to Phoebe Rifer and they\u2019re laughing about something. It annoys me that he hasn\u2019t noticed me yet. I\u2019m kind of hoping he\u2019ll look up and come barreling over to me like he usually does, but he just bends closer toward Phoebe like he\u2019s trying to hear her better.</p> <p>Rob pulls me into him. \u201cWe\u2019ll only stay for an hour, okay? Then we\u2019ll leave.\u201d His breath smells like beer and a little like cigarettes when he kisses me. I close my eyes and think about how in sixth grade I saw him kissing Gabby Haynes and was so jealous I couldn\u2019t eat for two days. I wonder if I look like I\u2019m enjoying it. Gabby did, in sixth grade.</p><p>It relaxes me to think about things like that: how funny life is.</p><p>I haven\u2019t even taken off my jacket, but Rob unzips it and moves his hands along my waist and then under my tank top. His palms are sweaty and big.</p><p>I pull away long enough to say, \u201cNot right here, in the middle of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019s watching,\u201d he says, and clamps down on me again. This is a lie. He knows everyone watches us. He can see it. He doesn\u2019t even close his eyes.</p><p>His hands inch over my stomach and his fingers are pulling at the underwire of my bra. He\u2019s not very good with bras. He\u2019s not that good with breasts in general, actually. I mean, it\u2019s not like I really know what it\u2019s supposed to feel like, but every time he touches my boobs he kind of just massages them hard in a circle. My gyno does the same thing when I go in for an exam, so one of them has to be doing it wrong. And to be honest, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my gyno.</p> <p>If you want to know my biggest secret, here it is: I know you\u2019re supposed to wait to have sex with someone you love and all that, and I do love Rob\u2014I mean, I\u2019ve kind of been in love with him forever, so how could I not?\u2014but that\u2019s not why I decided to have sex with him tonight.</p><p>I decided to have sex with him because I want to get it over with, and because sex has always scared me and I don\u2019t want to be scared of it anymore.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to wake up next to you,\u201d Rob says, his mouth against my ear.</p><p>It\u2019s a sweet thing to say, but I can\u2019t concentrate while his hands are on me. And it occurs to me all of a sudden that I\u2019d never thought about the waking-up part. I have no idea what you\u2019re supposed to talk about the day after you\u2019ve had sex, and I imagine us lying side by side, not touching, silent, while the sun rises. Rob doesn\u2019t have any blinds in his room\u2014he ripped them down once when he was drunk\u2014and during the day it\u2019s like a spotlight has been turned on his bed, a spotlight or an eye.</p><p>\u201cGet a room!\u201d</p><p>I pull away from Rob as Ally appears next to me, making a face. \u201cYou two are perverts,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cThis is a room.\u201d Rob lifts both arms and gestures around him. He sloshes a little bit of beer onto my shirt, and I make a noise, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, babe.\u201d He shrugs. Now there\u2019s only a half inch of beer in his cup and he stares at it, frowning. \u201cGonna go for a topper. You guys want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe brought our own.\u201d Ally pats the vodka in her purse.</p><p>\u201cSmart thinking.\u201d Rob brings a finger up to tap the side of his head but nearly takes an eye out instead. He\u2019s drunker than I thought. Ally covers her mouth and giggles.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend\u2019s an idiot,\u201d I say as soon as he lurches away.</p><p>\u201cA cute idiot,\u201d Ally corrects me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s like saying \u2018a cute mutant.\u2019 Doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it does.\u201d Ally\u2019s looking around the room, pouting her lips to make them look more kissable.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go, anyway?\u201d I\u2019m feeling more annoyed than I should by everything: by the fact that my friends ditched me after thirty whole seconds, by the fact that Rob\u2019s so drunk, by the fact that Kent\u2019s still talking to Phoebe Rifer, even though he\u2019s supposed to be obsessively in love with me. Not that I want him to be in love with me, obviously. It\u2019s just a constant that\u2019s always been comforting, in a weird way. I wrestle the bottle out of Ally\u2019s bag and take another sip.</p><p>\u201cWe made a round. There\u2019s, like, seventeen different rooms up here. You should check it out.\u201d Ally looks at me, notices the face I\u2019m pulling, and holds up her hands. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not like we abandoned you in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m feeling so pissy. \u201cWhere did Lindsay and Elody go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElody\u2019s suctioned to Muffin\u2019s lap. And Lindsay and Patrick are fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, they kissed for the first three minutes. They waited until minute four to start going at it.\u201d</p><p>This cracks me up and Ally and I laugh over it. I start to feel better, more comfortable. The vodka fills my head with warmth. More people are arriving all the time and the room seems to be revolving just a little bit. It\u2019s a nice feeling, though, like being on a really slow carousel. Ally and I decide to go on a mission to save Lindsay before her fight with Patrick turns into an all-out brawl.</p><p>It seems like the whole school has shown up, but really there are only sixty or seventy kids. This is the most that ever shows up at a party. There\u2019s the top and middle of the senior class, popularity-wise\u2014Kent\u2019s just holding on to the lower rung of the ladder, but he\u2019s hosting so it\u2019s okay\u2014some of the cooler juniors, and a couple of really cool sophomores. I know I\u2019m supposed to hate them, like we were hated when we were sophomores at all the senior parties, but I can\u2019t bring myself to care. Ally gives a group of them one of her ice stares as we go by, though, and says \u201cSkanks\u201d loudly. One of them, Rachel Kornish, supposedly hooked up with Matt Wilde not long ago.</p><p>Obviously no freshmen are allowed in. The social bottom doesn\u2019t show either. It isn\u2019t because people would make fun of them, although they probably would. It\u2019s more than that. They don\u2019t hear about these parties until after they\u2019ve happened. They don\u2019t know the things we know: they don\u2019t know about the secret side entrance to Andrew Roberts\u2019s guesthouse, or the fact that Carly Jablonski stashed a cooler in her garage where you can keep your beers cold, or the fact that Rocky\u2019s doesn\u2019t check IDs very closely, or the fact that Mic\u2019s stays open around the clock and makes the best egg and cheeses in the world, absolutely dripping with oil and ketchup, perfect for when you\u2019re drunk. It\u2019s like high school holds two different worlds, revolving around each other and never touching: the haves and the have-nots. I guess it\u2019s a good thing. High school is supposed to prepare you for the real world, after all.</p><p>There are so many tiny hallways and rooms, it feels like a maze. All of them are filled with people and smoke. Only one door is closed. It has a big KEEP OUT sign plastered on it over a bunch of weird bumper stickers that say things like VISUALIZE WHIRLED PEAS and KISS ME. I\u2019M IRISH.</p><p>By the time we get to Lindsay, she and Patrick have made up, big surprise. She\u2019s sitting on his lap and he\u2019s smoking a joint. Elody and Steve Dough are in a corner. He\u2019s leaning against the wall and she\u2019s half dancing and half grinding against him. She has an unlit cigarette dangling from her lips, butt end out, and her hair is a mess. Steve is steadying her, using one arm to keep her on her feet, but he\u2019s having a conversation with Liz Hummer (her real name\u2014and, coincidentally, her car) like Elody isn\u2019t even there, much less rubbing on him.</p><p>\u201cPoor Elody,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t know why I suddenly feel bad for her. \u201cShe\u2019s too nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a whore,\u201d Ally says, but not meanly.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019ll remember any of this?\u201d I\u2019m not sure where the words come from. My whole head feels light and fuzzy, ready to float away. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll remember any of it two years from now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t even remember tomorrow.\u201d Ally laughs, tapping the bottle in my hand. There\u2019s only a quarter of it left. I can\u2019t think when we drank it all.</p><p>Lindsay squeals when she sees us and stumbles off Patrick\u2019s lap, throwing an arm around each of us like it\u2019s been years since we were together. She snatches the vodka from me and takes a sip while her arm is still wrapped around my shoulders, her elbow tightening momentarily against my neck.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d she yells. Her voice is loud, even over the music and the sound of everybody talking and laughing. \u201cI was looking everywhere for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d I say, and Ally says, \u201cIn Patrick\u2019s mouth, maybe.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re laughing over the fact that Lindsay\u2019s a bullshitter and Elody\u2019s a drunk and Ally\u2019s OCD and I\u2019m antisocial, and someone cracks a window to let out the smoke, and a fine mist of rain comes in, smelling like grass and fresh things, even though it\u2019s the dead middle of winter. Without anyone noticing I reach my hand back and rest it on the sill, enjoying the freezing air and the sensation of a hundred pinpricks of rain. I close my eyes and promise myself I\u2019ll never forget this moment: the sound of my friends\u2019 laughter and the heat from so many bodies and the smell of rain.</p><p>When I open my eyes I get the shock of my life. Juliet Sykes is standing in the doorway, staring at me.</p><p>She\u2019s staring at us, actually: Lindsay, Ally, and Elody, who has just left Steve and come over to stand with us, and me. Juliet\u2019s hair is pulled back in a ponytail, and I think it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever really seen her face.</p><p>It\u2019s shocking that she\u2019s there, but it\u2019s even more shocking that she\u2019s pretty. She has blue eyes set wide apart and high cheekbones, like a model\u2019s. Her skin is perfectly clear and white. I can\u2019t stop staring at her.</p><p>People are elbowing and pushing her because she\u2019s blocking the doorway, but she just stands there, staring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ally catches on first and her mouth drops open. \u201cWhat the...?\u201d</p><p>Elody and Lindsay turn to see what we\u2019re both staring at. Lindsay goes pale at first\u2014she actually looks afraid, which is beyond strange, but I don\u2019t have time to wonder about it because just as quickly her face goes purple, and she looks ready to rip someone\u2019s head off. That\u2019s a more natural look for her. Elody begins giggling hysterically until she doubles over and has to cover her mouth with both hands.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d She tries to start singing \u201cPsycho killer, qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est,\u201d but we\u2019re all still in shock and don\u2019t join in.</p><p>You know how in movies someone says or does something inappropriate and the record scratches and there\u2019s dead silence all of a sudden? Well, that isn\u2019t exactly what happens, but it\u2019s close. The music doesn\u2019t stop, but as everyone in the room starts to pick up on the fact that Juliet Sykes\u2014bedwetter, freak, and all-around psycho\u2014is standing in the middle of a party giving four of the most popular girls at Thomas Jefferson the stink eye, conversation drops off and a low sound of whispering fills the room, getting louder and more insistent until it\u2019s a constant hum, until it sounds like wind or the ocean.</p> <p>Juliet Sykes finally steps away from the door and into the room. She walks slowly and confidently toward us\u2014I\u2019ve never seen her look so calm\u2014stopping three feet in front of Lindsay.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch,\u201d she says. Her voice is steady and too loud, like she\u2019s deliberately addressing everyone in the room. I\u2019d always imagined her voice would be high-pitched or breathy, but it\u2019s as full and deep as a boy\u2019s.</p><p>It takes Lindsay a half second to find her voice. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d she croaks out. Juliet hasn\u2019t made eye contact with Lindsay since the fifth grade, much less spoken to her. Much less insulted her.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. A bitch. A mean girl. A bad person.\u201d Juliet turns to Ally next. \u201cYou\u2019re a bitch too.\u201d To Elody, \u201cYou\u2019re a bitch.\u201d She turns her eyes to me and for a second I see something flashing there\u2014something familiar\u2014but just as quickly it\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re all so shocked we don\u2019t know how to respond. Elody giggles again nervously, hiccups, and goes silent. Lindsay\u2019s mouth is opening and shutting like a fish\u2019s, but nothing\u2019s coming out. Ally\u2019s balling up her fists like she\u2019s thinking of clocking Juliet in the face.</p><p>And even though I\u2019m infuriated and embarrassed, the only thing I can think when I look at Juliet is: I never knew you were so pretty.</p><p>Lindsay pulls herself together. She leans forward so her face is only inches from Juliet\u2019s. I\u2019ve never seen her so angry. I think her eyes are going to pop out of her head. Her mouth is twisted into a snarl, like a dog\u2019s. For a second she looks really and truly ugly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be a bitch than a psycho,\u201d she hisses, grabbing Juliet by the shirt. Spit is coming out of her mouth\u2014that\u2019s how angry she is. She shoves Juliet backward, and Juliet stumbles into Matt Dorfman. He pushes Juliet again and she careens into Emma McElroy. Lindsay starts screaming, \u201cPsycho, Psycho,\u201d and making the high-pitched knifing noises from the movie, and suddenly everyone\u2019s screaming out, \u201cPsycho!\u201d and making the motion of an invisible knife and screeching and pushing Juliet back and forth. Ally\u2019s the first to overturn a beer on her head, but everyone catches on to that too; Lindsay splashes her with vodka, and when Juliet stumbles my way, half drenched, arms outstretched, trying to get her balance, I grab a half-finished beer from the windowsill and dump it on her. I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m screaming along with everybody else until my throat is sore.</p><p>Juliet looks up at me after I dump the beer out. I can\u2019t explain it\u2014it\u2019s crazy\u2014but it\u2019s almost a pitying look, like she feels bad for me.</p><p>All of the breath leaves my body in a rush, and I feel like I\u2019ve been punched in the stomach. Without thinking, I lunge at her and shove as hard as I can, and she goes backward into a bookshelf that almost falls over. I\u2019ve pushed her back toward the door, and as everyone is still squealing and laughing and screaming \u201cPsycho,\u201d she runs out of the room. She has to squeeze by Kent. He\u2019s just come in, probably to see what everyone\u2019s screaming about.</p> <p>We lock eyes for a moment. I can\u2019t exactly tell what he\u2019s thinking, but whatever it is, it\u2019s not good. I look away, feeling hot and uncomfortable. Everyone\u2019s buzzing with energy now, laughing and talking about Juliet, but my breathing won\u2019t go back to normal and I feel the vodka burning my stomach, creeping back up my throat. The room is stifling, spinning faster than before. I have to get out for some air.</p><p>I try to push my way out of the room, but Kent gets in my face and blocks my way.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that about?\u201d he demands.</p><p>\u201cCan you let me by, please?\u201d I\u2019m not in the mood to deal with anyone, and I\u2019m especially not in the mood to deal with Kent and his stupid button-down shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she ever do to you?\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms. \u201cI get it. You\u2019re friends with Psycho. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>He narrows his eyes. \u201cPretty clever nickname. Did you think of that all by yourself, or did your friends have to help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way.\u201d I manage to squeeze past him, but he grabs my arm.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he says. We\u2019re standing so close together I can smell that he\u2019s just eaten peppermints and see the heart-shaped mole under his left eye, even though everything else is blurry. He\u2019s looking at me like he\u2019s desperate to understand something, and it\u2019s worse, much worse than anything else so far\u2014than Juliet or his anger or the feeling I\u2019m going to be sick any second.</p><p>I try to shake his hand off my arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t just grab people, you know. You can\u2019t just grab me. I have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down. I\u2019m just trying to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d I succeed in shaking him off. I know I\u2019m talking too loud and too fast. I know I sound hysterical, but I can\u2019t help it. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your problem is, okay? I\u2019m not going to go out with you. I would never go out with you in a million years. So you can stop obsessing over me. I mean, I shouldn\u2019t even know your name.\u201d The words fly out and it\u2019s as though they strangle me on the way up: suddenly I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Kent stares at me hard. Then he leans in even closer. For a second I think he\u2019s going to try to kiss me and my heart stops.</p><p>But he just puts his mouth up to my ear and says, \u201cI see right through you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d I jerk backward, shaking. \u201cYou don\u2019t know one thing about me.\u201d</p><p>He holds his hands up in surrender and backs off. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t.\u201d He starts to turn away and mutters something else.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d My heart is pounding in my chest so hard I think it will explode.</p><p>He turns to look at me. \u201cI said, \u2018Thank God.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I spin around, wishing I hadn\u2019t borrowed a pair of Ally\u2019s heels. The room spins with me and I have to steady myself against the banister.</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend\u2019s downstairs, puking in the kitchen sink,\u201d Kent calls after me.</p><p>I give him the finger over my shoulder without turning around to see if he\u2019s watching me, but I get the feeling he\u2019s not.</p><p>Even before I go downstairs to see whether what Kent said about Rob is true, I know it: tonight isn\u2019t the night after all. The combination of disappointment and relief is so overwhelming I have to hold on to the walls as I walk, feeling the stairs spiral up under me like they\u2019re going to slip away any second. Tonight isn\u2019t the night. Tomorrow I\u2019ll wake up and be exactly the same, and the world will look the same, and everything will feel and taste and smell the same. My throat gets tight and my eyes start to burn, and all I can think in that moment is that it\u2019s all Kent\u2019s fault, Kent\u2019s and Juliet Sykes\u2019s.</p><p>Half an hour later the party starts to wind down. Inside, someone has ripped the Christmas lights off the wall and they\u2019re trailing along the floor like a snake, lighting up the dust mites in the corners.</p><p>I\u2019m feeling better now, more like myself. \u201cThere\u2019s always tomorrow,\u201d Lindsay said to me, when I told her about Rob, and I run the phrase over and over in my head like a mantra: There\u2019s always tomorrow. There\u2019s always tomorrow.</p><p>I spend twenty minutes in the bathroom, first washing my face and then reapplying makeup, even though my hands are unsteady and my face keeps doubling in the mirror. Every time I put on makeup it reminds me of my mother\u2014I used to watch her bend over her vanity, getting ready for dates with my father\u2014and it calms me down. There\u2019s always tomorrow.</p><p>It\u2019s the time of the night I like best, when most people are asleep and it feels like the world belongs completely to my friends and me, as though nothing exists apart from our little circle: everywhere else is darkness and quiet.</p><p>I leave with Elody, Ally, and Lindsay. The crowd is thinning as people take off, but it\u2019s still hard to move. Lindsay keeps calling out, \u201cExcuse me, excuse me, move it, feminine emergency!\u201d Years ago we discovered at an under-eighteen concert in Poughkeepsie that nothing clears people faster than referencing a feminine emergency. It\u2019s like people think they\u2019ll catch it.</p><p>On our way out we pass people hooking up in corners and pressed against the stairwell. Behind closed doors we hear the muffled sounds of people giggling. Elody slams her fist against each door and yells out, \u201cNo glove, no love!\u201d Lindsay turns around and whispers something to Elody, and Elody shuts up and looks at me guiltily. I want to tell them I don\u2019t care\u2014I don\u2019t care about Rob or missing my chance\u2014but I\u2019m suddenly too tired to talk.</p><p>We see Bridget McGuire sitting on the edge of a bathtub with the door just cracked open. She has her head in her hands and she\u2019s crying.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d I say, trying to fight the feeling of swimming in my own head, of my words coming from a distance.</p><p>\u201cShe dumped Alex.\u201d Lindsay grabs on to my elbow. She seems sober, but her pupils are enormous and the whites of her eyes bloodshot. \u201cYou\u2019ll never believe it. She found out that the Nic Nazi busted Alex and Anna together. He was supposed to be at a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d The music\u2019s still going so we can\u2019t hear Bridget, but her shoulders are shaking up and down like she\u2019s convulsing. \u201cShe\u2019ll be better off. Scumbag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all scumbags!\u201d Elody says, raising her beer and spilling some of it. I don\u2019t even think she knows what we\u2019re talking about.</p><p>Lindsay takes her cup and sets it on a side table, on top of a worn copy of Moby Dick. She pockets a little ceramic figurine too: a shepherd with curly blond hair and painted eyelashes. She always steals something from parties. She calls them her souvenirs.</p><p>\u201cShe better not hurl in the Tank,\u201d she says in a whisper, tipping her head back toward Elody. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rob is stretched out on a sofa downstairs, but he manages to grab my hand as I go by and tries to pull me down on top of him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you goin\u2019?\u201d he says. His eyes are unfocused and his voice is hoarse.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rob. Let me go.\u201d I push him off me. This is his fault, too.</p><p>\u201cWe were supposed to...\u201d His voice trails off and he shakes his head, confused, then narrows his eyes at me. \u201cAre you cheating on me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d I want to rewind the whole evening, rewind the past few weeks, go back to the moment when Rob leaned over, rested his chin on my shoulder, and told me he wanted to sleep next to me, go back to that quiet moment in that dark room with the TV blue and muted in front of us and the sound of his breathing and my parents sleeping upstairs, go back to the moment I opened my mouth and heard \u201cI do too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are. You\u2019re cheating. I knew it.\u201d He lurches to his feet and looks around wildly. Chris Harmon, one of Rob\u2019s best friends, is standing in the corner laughing about something, and Rob stumbles over to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you cheating with my girlfriend, Harmon?\u201d Rob roars, and pushes Chris. Chris stumbles and knocks against a bookshelf. A porcelain figurine topples over and shatters and a girl screams.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Chris jumps back on Rob and suddenly they\u2019re locked together, wrestling, shuffling around the room and knocking into things, grunting and yelling. Somehow Rob gets Chris down on his knees and then they\u2019re both on the floor. Girls are shrieking and jumping out of the way. Someone cries out, \u201cWatch the beer!\u201d just before Rob and Chris roll up against the entrance of the kitchen, where the keg is sitting.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Sam.\u201d Lindsay squeezes my shoulders from behind.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t just leave him,\u201d I say, though a part of me wants to.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. Look\u2014he\u2019s laughing.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. He and Chris are already done fighting and are sprawled on the floor, laughing their heads off.</p><p>\u201cRob\u2019s going to be so pissed,\u201d I say, and I know Lindsay knows I\u2019m talking about more than just ditching him at the party.</p><p>She gives me a quick hug. \u201cRemember what I said.\u201d She starts to singsong, \u201cJust thinkin\u2019 about tomorrow clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow....\u201d</p><p>For a moment my stomach clenches, thinking she\u2019s making fun of me, but it\u2019s a coincidence. Lindsay didn\u2019t know me when I was little, wouldn\u2019t even have spoken to me. She has no way of knowing I used to lock myself in my room with the Annie soundtrack and belt that song at the top of my lungs until my parents threatened to throw me out onto the street.</p> <p>The melody starts repeating in my head and I know I\u2019ll be singing it for days. Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya tomorrow. A beautiful word, when you really think about it.</p><p>\u201cLame party, huh?\u201d Ally says, coming up on the other side of me. Even though I know she\u2019s only pissed Matt Wilde didn\u2019t show, I\u2019m glad she says it.</p><p>The sound of the rain is louder than I thought it would be and it startles me. For a moment we stand under the porch eaves, watching our breath condense into clouds, hugging ourselves. It\u2019s freezing. Water is falling in steady streams from the eaves. Christopher Tomlin and Adam Wu are throwing empty beer bottles into the woods. Every so often we hear one shatter, and the sound comes back to us like a gunshot.</p><p>People are laughing and screaming and running in the rain, which is coming down so hard everything looks as though it\u2019s melting into everything else. There are no neighbors to call the cops for miles. The grass is churned up, great black pits of mud exposed. Headlights are flashing in the distance, in and out, on and off, as cars sweep down the driveway toward Route 9.</p><p>\u201cRun for it!\u201d Lindsay yells, and I feel Ally tugging on me and then we\u2019re running, screaming, the rain blinding us and streaming down our jackets, the mud oozing into our shoes; rain so hard it\u2019s like everything is melting away.</p><p>By the time we get to Lindsay\u2019s car I really don\u2019t care about the awful way the night turned out. We\u2019re laughing hysterically, soaked and shivering, woken up from the cold and the rain. Lindsay\u2019s squealing about wet butt marks on her leather seats and mud on the floor, and Elody\u2019s begging her to go to Mic\u2019s for an egg and cheese and complaining that I always get shotgun, and Ally\u2019s yelling for Lindsay to turn on the heat and threatening to drop dead right there from pneumonia.</p><p>I guess that\u2019s how we get started talking about it: dying, I mean. I figure Lindsay\u2019s okay to drive, but I notice she\u2019s going faster than usual down that awful, long, penned-in driveway. The trees look like stripped skeletons on either side of us, moaning in the wind.</p><p>\u201cI have this theory,\u201d I\u2019m saying as Lindsay skids out onto Route 9 and the tires shriek against the slick black road. The clock on the dashboard is glowing: 12:38. \u201cI have this theory that before you die you see your greatest hits, you know? The best things you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDuke, baby,\u201d Lindsay says, and takes one hand off the wheel to pump her fist in the air.</p><p>\u201cFirst time I hooked up with Matt Wilde,\u201d Ally says immediately.</p><p>Elody groans and leans forward, reaching for the iPod. \u201cMusic, please, before I kill myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get a cigarette?\u201d Lindsay asks, and Elody lights one for her off the butt she\u2019s holding. Lindsay cracks the windows, and the freezing rain comes in. Ally starts to complain about the cold again.</p><p>Elody puts on \u201cSplinter,\u201d by Fallacy, to piss Ally off, maybe because she\u2019s sick of her whining. Ally calls her a bitch and unbuckles her seat belt, leaning forward and trying to grab the iPod. Lindsay complains that someone is elbowing her in the neck. The cigarette drops from her mouth and lands between her thighs. She starts cursing and trying to brush the embers off the seat cushion, and Elody and Ally are still fighting and I\u2019m trying to talk over them, reminding them all of the time we made snow angels in May. The clock ticks forward: 12:39. The tires skid a little on the wet road and the car is full of cigarette smoke, little wisps rising like phantoms in the air.</p><p>Then all of a sudden there\u2019s a flash of white in front of the car. Lindsay yells something\u2014words I can\u2019t make out, something like sit or shit or sight\u2014and suddenly the car is flipping off the road and into the black mouth of the woods. I hear a horrible, screeching sound\u2014metal on metal, glass shattering, a car folding in two\u2014and smell fire. I have time to wonder whether Lindsay had put out her cigarette\u2014</p><p>And then\u2014</p><p>That\u2019s when it happens. The moment of death is full of heat and sound and pain bigger than anything, a funnel of burning heat splitting me in two, something searing and scorching and tearing, and if screaming were a feeling it would be this.</p><p>Then nothing.</p><p>I know some of you are thinking maybe I deserved it. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have sent that rose to Juliet or dumped my drink on her at the party. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have copied off Lauren Lornet\u2019s quiz. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have said those things to Kent. There are probably some of you who think I deserved it because I was going to let Rob go all the way\u2014because I wasn\u2019t going to save myself.</p><p>But before you start pointing fingers, let me ask you: is what I did really so bad? So bad I deserved to die? So bad I deserved to die like that?</p><p>Is what I did really so much worse than what anybody else does?</p><p>Is it really so much worse than what you do?</p><p>Think about it.</p><p>TWO</p><p>In my dream I know I am falling though there is no up or down, no walls or sides or ceilings, just the sensation of cold, and darkness everywhere. I am so scared I could scream, but when I open my mouth nothing happens, and I wonder if you fall forever and ever and never touch down, is it really still falling?</p><p>I think I will fall forever.</p><p>A noise punctuates the silence, a thin bleating growing louder and louder until it is like a scythe of metal slicing the air, slicing into me\u2014</p><p>Then I wake up.</p><p>My alarm has been blaring for twenty minutes. It\u2019s six fifty A.M.</p><p>I sit up in bed, pushing away the comforter. I\u2019m covered with sweat even though my room is cold. My throat is dry and I\u2019m desperate for water, like I\u2019ve just been running a long way.</p><p>For a second when I look around the room everything seems fuzzy and slightly distorted, like I\u2019m not really looking at my room but only at a transparency of my room that\u2019s been laid down incorrectly so the corners don\u2019t match up with the real thing. Then the light shifts and everything looks normal again.</p><p>All at once it comes back to me, and blood starts pounding in my head: the party, Juliet Sykes, the argument with Kent\u2014</p><p>\u201cSammy!\u201d My door swings open, banging once against the wall, and Izzy comes galloping across the room, stepping all over my notebooks and discarded jeans and my Victoria\u2019s Secret Team Pink sweatshirt. Something seems wrong; something skirts the edges of my memory, but then it is gone and Izzy is bouncing on my bed, throwing her arms around me. They are hot. She curls a fist around the necklace I always wear\u2014a thin gold chain with a tiny bird charm hanging from it, a gift from my grandmother\u2014and tugs gently.</p><p>\u201cMommy says you have to get up.\u201d Her breath smells like peanut butter, and it\u2019s not until I push her off me that I realize how badly I\u2019m shaking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday,\u201d I say. I have no idea how I got home last night. I have no idea what happened to Lindsay or Elody or Ally, and just thinking about it makes me sick.</p><p>Izzy starts giggling like a maniac and bounces off the bed, scurrying back toward the door. She disappears down the hallway, and I hear her call out, \u201cMommy, Sammy won\u2019t get up!\u201d She says my name: Thammy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me come up there, Sammy!\u201d My mom\u2019s voice echoes from the kitchen.</p><p>I put my feet on the ground. The feel of the cold wood reassures me. When I was younger I would lie on the floor all summer when my dad refused to turn the air-conditioning on; it was the only place that stayed cool. I\u2019m tempted to do the same thing now. I feel feverish.</p><p>Rob, the rain, the sound of bottles shattering in the woods\u2014</p><p>My phone chimes, making me jump. I reach over and flip it open. There\u2019s a new text from Lindsay.</p><p>I\u2019m outside. Where r u?</p><p>I snap my phone shut quickly but not before I see the date blinking up at me: Friday, February 12.</p><p>Yesterday.</p><p>Another chime. Another text.</p><p>Don\u2019t make me l8 on Cupid Day, beeyatch!!!</p><p>I suddenly feel like I\u2019m moving underwater, like I\u2019m weightless, or watching myself from a distance. I try to stand up, but when I do my stomach bottoms out and I have to rush to the bathroom in the hall, legs shaking, certain I\u2019m going to throw up. I lock the door and turn on the water in both the sink and the shower. Then I stand over the toilet.</p><p>My stomach clenches on itself, but nothing comes up.</p><p>The car, the skidding, the screams\u2014</p><p>Yesterday.</p><p>I hear voices in the hallway, but the water\u2019s rushing so hard I can\u2019t make them out. It\u2019s not until someone starts pounding on the door that I straighten up and yell, \u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGet out of the shower. There\u2019s no time.\u201d It\u2019s Lindsay\u2014my mom\u2019s let her in.</p><p>I crack the door a little and there she is, her big puffy jacket zipped to her chin, looking pissed. I\u2019m happy to see her, anyway. She looks so normal, so familiar.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened last night?\u201d I say.</p><p>She frowns for a second. \u201cYeah, sorry about that. I couldn\u2019t call back. I didn\u2019t get off the phone with Patrick until, like, three A.M.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall back?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cNo, I meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was freaking out over the fact that his parents are going to Acapulco without him.\u201d She rolls her eyes. \u201cPoor baby. I swear to you, Sam, guys are like pets. Feed \u2019em, pet \u2019em, and put \u2019em to bed.\u201d She leans forward. \u201cSpeaking of which\u2014are you excited about tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I don\u2019t even know what she\u2019s talking about. Her words are all running past me, blurring together. I\u2019m holding on to the towel rack, afraid I\u2019ll fall over. The shower is on way too hot and there\u2019s thick steam everywhere, clouding up the mirror, condensing on the tiles.</p><p>\u201cYou, Rob, some Miller Lite, and his flannel sheets.\u201d She laughs. \u201cVery romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to shower.\u201d I try to close the door, but she wedges her elbow in at the last second and pushes into the bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t showered yet?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cUh-uh. No way. You\u2019ll have to do without.\u201d</p><p>She reaches into the shower and turns off the water, then grabs me by the hand and drags me into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cYou definitely need some makeup, though,\u201d she says, scanning my face. \u201cYou look like shit. Nightmares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my MAC stuff in the Tank.\u201d She unzips her coat and I see a white tuft of fur peeking out from her cleavage: our Cupid Day tank tops. I suddenly have the urge to sit down on the floor and laugh and laugh, and I have to struggle not to have a fit right there while Lindsay\u2019s shoving me into my room.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed,\u201d she says, and pulls out her cell phone, probably to text Elody we\u2019re going to be late. She watches me for a second and then sighs, turning away.</p> <p>\u201cHope Rob doesn\u2019t mind a little BO,\u201d she says, and as she giggles over this, I start pulling on my clothes: the tank top, the skirt, the boots.</p><p>Again.</p><p>DOES THIS STRAITJACKET MAKE MY BUTT LOOK BIG?</p><p>When Elody gets into the car she leans forward to grab her coffee, and the smell of her perfume\u2014raspberry body spray she still buys religiously from the Body Shop in the mall, even though it stopped being cool in seventh grade\u2014is so real and sharp and familiar I have to close my eyes, overwhelmed.</p><p>Bad idea. With my eyes shut I see the beautiful warm lights of Kent\u2019s house receding in the rearview mirror and the sleek black trees crowding on either side of us like skeletons. I smell burning. I hear Lindsay yelling and feel my stomach bottom out as the car lurches to one side, tires squealing\u2014</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>I snap my eyes open as Lindsay swerves to avoid a squirrel. She chucks her cigarette out the window and the smell of smoke is strangely double: I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m smelling it or remembering it or both.</p><p>\u201cYou really are the worst driver.\u201d Elody giggles.</p> <p>\u201cBe careful, please,\u201d I mutter. I\u2019m clutching the sides of my seat without meaning to.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Lindsay leans over and pats my knee. \u201cI won\u2019t let my best friend die a virgin.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m desperate to spill everything to Lindsay and Elody at that moment, to ask them what\u2019s happening to me\u2014to us\u2014but I can\u2019t think of any way to say it.</p><p>We were in a car accident after a party that hasn\u2019t happened yet.</p><p>I thought I died yesterday. I thought I died tonight.</p><p>Elody must think I\u2019m quiet because I\u2019m worried about Rob. She loops her arms around the back of my seat and leans forward.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sam. You\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s just like riding a bike,\u201d Elody says.</p><p>I try to force a smile, but I can barely focus. It seems like a long time ago that I went to bed imagining being side-by-side with Rob, imagining the feel of his cool, dry hands. Thinking about him makes me ache, and my throat threatens to close up. I suddenly can\u2019t wait to see him, can\u2019t wait to see his crooked smile and his Yankees hat and even his dirty fleece that always smells a little bit like boy sweat, even after his mom makes him wash it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like riding a horse,\u201d Lindsay corrects Elody. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a blue-ribbon champion in no time, Sammy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always forget you used to ride horses.\u201d Elody flips open the lid of her coffee and blows steam off the top.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was, like, seven,\u201d I say, before Lindsay can turn this into a joke. I think if she starts making fun of me now I really will cry. I could never explain the truth to her: that riding was my favorite thing in the world. I loved to be alone in the woods, especially in the late fall when everything is crisp and golden, the leaves the color of fire, and it smells like things turning into earth. I loved the silence\u2014the only sound the steady drum of the hooves and the horse\u2019s breathing.</p><p>No phones. No laughter. No voices. No houses.</p><p>No cars.</p><p>I\u2019ve flipped the visor down to keep the glare out of my eyes, and in the mirror I see Elody smiling at me. Maybe I\u2019ll tell her what\u2019s happening to me, I think, but at the same time I know that I won\u2019t. She would think I was crazy. They all would.</p><p>I keep quiet and look out the window. The light is weak and watery-looking, like the sun has just spilled itself over the horizon and is too lazy to clean itself up. The shadows are as sharp and pointed as needles. I watch three black crows take off simultaneously from a telephone wire and wish I could take off too, move up, up, up, and watch the ground drop away from me the way it does when you\u2019re on an airplane, folding and compressing into itself like an origami figure, until everything is flat and brightly colored\u2014until the whole world is like a drawing of itself.</p><p>\u201cTheme song, please,\u201d Lindsay says, and I scroll through her iPod until I find the Mary J. Blige, then lean back and try not to think of anything except the music and the beat.</p><p>And I keep my eyes open.</p><p>By the time we pull into the drive that winds past the upper parking area and down to the faculty lot and Senior Alley, I\u2019m actually feeling better, even though Lindsay\u2019s cursing and Elody\u2019s complaining that one more tardy will get her Friday detention and it\u2019s already two minutes after first bell.</p><p>Everything looks so normal. I know that because it\u2019s Friday, Emma McElroy will be coming from Evan Danzig\u2019s house, and sure enough there she is, ducking through a clipped portion of the fence. I know Peter Kourt will be wearing a pair of Nike Air Force 1s he\u2019s had for a million years because he wears them every day, even though there are so many holes in them you can see what color socks he\u2019s wearing (usually black). I watch them go flashing by as he books it down toward the main building.</p><p>Seeing all these things makes me feel a thousand times better, and I start thinking maybe all of yesterday\u2014everything that happened\u2014was just some kind of long, strange dream.</p><p>Lindsay cruises down to the Senior Alley, even though there\u2019s zero chance of finding a spot. It\u2019s a religion for her. My stomach dips when we pass the third spot from the tennis courts, and there\u2019s Sarah Grundel\u2019s brown Chevrolet with its Thomas Jefferson Swim Team sticker\u2014and another one, smaller, that reads GET WET\u2014staring at me from the bumper. I think: she got the last spot because we\u2019re so late, and I have to squeeze my nails into my palms and repeat to myself that I\u2019ve only been dreaming\u2014that none of this has happened before.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we have to walk .22 miles,\u201d Elody says, pouting. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who left the house half naked,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cIt is February.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be outside.\u201d</p><p>We pass the soccer fields on our right as we loop back toward Upper Lot. At this time of year the fields are all churned up, just mud and a few patches of brown grass.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d Elody says. \u201cFlashback to freshman year, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all morning,\u201d I blurt out before I can stop myself. Instantly I feel better, sure that that\u2019s what this is.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess.\u201d Lindsay brings one hand to her temples and frowns, pretending to concentrate. \u201cYou\u2019re having flashbacks to the last time Elody was this annoying before nine A.M.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Elody leans forward and smacks Lindsay\u2019s arm and they start laughing. I smile too, relieved to have spoken the words out loud. It makes sense: one time on a trip to Colorado, my parents and I hiked up three miles to this little waterfall smack in the middle of the woods. The trees were big and old, all of them pine. The clouds were streaked across the sky like spun sugar. Izzy was too young to walk or talk. She was riding in my dad\u2019s baby backpack, and she kept punching her tiny fat fists at the sky like she wanted to grab it.</p><p>Anyway, as we were standing there watching the spray of water on the rocks, I had the craziest feeling that it had all happened before, down to the smell of the orange my mom was peeling and the exact reflections of the trees in the surface of the water. I was positive. It became the big joke that day, because I\u2019d complained about having to hike three miles, and when I told my parents I was having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, they kept laughing and saying it really would be a miracle if I\u2019d ever agreed to walk that far in a past life.</p><p>I guess my point is only that I was sure then, just like I\u2019m feeling sure now. It happens.</p><p>\u201cOooh!\u201d Elody squeals, and starts digging through her purse. She knocks out a pack of cigarettes and two empty tubes of lip gloss, plus a misshapen eyelash curler. \u201cI almost forgot your present.\u201d</p><p>She sends the condom sailing over the front seat, and Lindsay claps her hands and bounces in her seat when I hold it up.</p><p>\u201cNo glove, no love?\u201d I say, managing a smile.</p><p>Elody leans forward and kisses my cheek, leaving a ring of pink gloss. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be great, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d I say, and drop the condom in my bag. We step out of the car and the air is so cold my eyes sting and start to water. I ignore the bad feeling buzzing through me, and I think, This is my day, this is my day, this is my day, so I can\u2019t think of anything else.</p><p>A SHADOW WORLD</p><p>I read once that you get d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when the two halves of your brain process things at different speeds: the right half a few seconds before the left, or vice versa. Science is probably my worst subject, so I didn\u2019t understand the whole article, but that would explain the weird double feeling that it leaves you with, like the world is splitting in half\u2014or you are.</p><p>That\u2019s the way I feel, at least: like there\u2019s a real me and a reflection of me, and I have no way of telling which is which. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The thing about d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is that it has always passed really quickly\u2014thirty seconds, a minute at most.</p><p>But this doesn\u2019t pass.</p><p>Everything is the same: Eileen Cho squealing over her roses in first period and Samara Phillips leaning over and crooning, \u201cHe must really love you.\u201d I pass the same people in the halls at the same time. Aaron Stern spills his coffee all over the hallway again, and Carol Lin starts screaming at him again.</p><p>Even her words are the same. \u201cWere you dropped on your head one too many times or something?\u201d I have to admit it\u2019s pretty funny, even the second time around. Even when I feel like I\u2019m crazy; even when I feel like I could scream.</p> <p>But even weirder are the little blips and wrinkles, the things that have shifted around. Sarah Grundel, for example. On my way to second period I see her standing against a bank of lockers, twirling her goggles around her index finger and talking to Hillary Hale. As I walk by I catch just a bit of their conversation.</p><p>\u201c...so excited. I mean, Coach says my time could still go down by a half second\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have two weeks before the semis. You can totally do it.\u201d</p><p>I stop dead when I hear this. Sarah sees me staring at her and gets really uncomfortable. She smoothes her hair and tugs on her skirt, which is riding up on her waist.</p><p>Then she waves.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Sam,\u201d she says. She pulls on her skirt again.</p><p>\u201cWere you\u2014\u201d I take a deep breath to keep from stuttering like an idiot. \u201cWere you just talking about semifinals? For swim team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Sarah\u2019s face lights up. \u201cAre you going to come?\u201d</p><p>Even though I\u2019m freaking out, it still occurs to me that this is a really stupid question. I\u2019ve never gone to a swim meet in my life, and the idea of sitting on a slimy tile floor and watching Sarah Grundel splash around in a bathing suit is about as appealing as the chow mein from Hunan Kitchen. To be honest, the only sporting event I ever go to is homecoming, and after four years I still don\u2019t understand any of the rules. Lindsay usually brings a flask of something for the four of us to share, so that could have something to do with it.</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t competing.\u201d I try hard to act casual. \u201cI heard some rumor...like maybe you were late and the coach freaked out....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard a rumor? About me?\u201d Sarah\u2019s eyes go wide and she looks like I just handed her a winning lotto ticket. I guess she\u2019s of the \u201cno press is bad press\u201d philosophy.</p> <p>\u201cI guess I was wrong.\u201d I think of seeing her car in the third-to-last spot and feel heat flood my face. Of course she wasn\u2019t late today. Of course she\u2019s still competing. She didn\u2019t have to walk from Upper Lot today. She was late yesterday.</p><p>My head starts pounding and suddenly I just want to get out of there.</p><p>Hillary\u2019s looking at me strangely. \u201cAre you okay? You look really pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Fine. Bad sushi last night.\u201d I put one hand on the lockers to steady myself. Sarah starts babbling about the time she got food poisoning from the mall, but I\u2019m already walking away, feeling like the hallway is rolling and buckling underneath me.</p><p>D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It\u2019s the only explanation.</p><p>If you repeat something enough, you can almost make yourself believe it.</p><p>I\u2019m feeling so shaken up I almost forget that Ally\u2019s waiting for me in the bathroom by the science wing. I go into the stall and flip the lid of a toilet down and just sit there, only half listening while she babbles. I remember something Mrs. Harbor once said on one of her crazy tangents in English: that Plato believed that the whole world\u2014everything we can see\u2014was just like shadows on a cave wall. We can\u2019t actually see the real thing, the thing that\u2019s casting the shadow in the first place. I have that feeling now, of being surrounded by shadows, like I\u2019m seeing the impression of the thing before the thing itself.</p><p>\u201cHello? Are you even listening to me?\u201d</p> <p>Ally rattles the door and I look up, startled. I notice AC=WT scrawled on the inside of the door. Below it a smaller note reads: Go back to the trailer, ho.</p><p>\u201cYou said pretty soon you\u2019d have to shop for bras in the maternity section,\u201d I say automatically. Of course I wasn\u2019t really listening. Not this time, anyway.</p><p>I\u2019m wondering, vaguely, why Lindsay came all the way down here to write on the bathroom wall\u2014why it was important to her, I mean. She\u2019d already written it a dozen times in the stalls across from the cafeteria, and that\u2019s the bathroom everyone uses. I\u2019m not even sure why she dislikes Anna, and it reminds me that I still don\u2019t know when she started hating Juliet Sykes so much either. It\u2019s weird how much you can know about someone without knowing everything. You\u2019d think someday you\u2019d come to the end of it.</p><p>I stand up and swing the door open, pointing to the graffiti. \u201cWhen did Lindsay do this?\u201d</p><p>Ally rolls her eyes. \u201cShe didn\u2019t. Copycat artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. There\u2019s one in the girls\u2019 locker room too. Copycat.\u201d She whips her hair into a ponytail and starts pinching her lips to make them swell up. \u201cIt\u2019s so lame. We can\u2019t do anything in this school without everyone doing the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLame.\u201d I run my fingers over the words. They\u2019re thick and black, like worms, drawn in permanent marker. I wonder, briefly, whether Anna uses this bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWe should sue for copyright infringement. Can you imagine? Twenty bucks for every time somebody bites our style. We\u2019d be rolling in it.\u201d She giggles. \u201cMint?\u201d</p><p>Ally holds out an Altoids tin. Even though she\u2019s still a virgin\u2014and will be, for the foreseeable future (or at least until she goes to college), since she\u2019s completely obsessed with Matt Wilde\u2014she insists on taking birth control pills, which she keeps crumpled up in their foil pack right there alongside her mints. She claims it\u2019s so her dad won\u2019t find them, but everyone knows she likes to flash them during class so that people will think she\u2019s having sex. Not that anybody\u2019s fooled. Thomas Jefferson is small: you know these things.</p><p>One time Elody told Ally she had \u201cpregnancy breath\u201d and we all died over it. It was junior year in May and we were all lying out on Ally\u2019s trampoline. It was the Saturday morning after she\u2019d had one of her best parties yet. We were all just a little hungover, our brains fuzzy, stuffed on all the pancakes and bacon we\u2019d put down at the diner, totally happy. I lay there while the trampoline dipped and swayed, closing my eyes against the sun, wishing that the day would never end.</p><p>The bell rings and Ally squeals, \u201cOoh! We\u2019re gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>Again that pit opens in my stomach. A part of me is tempted to hide all day in the bathroom, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>I know you know what happens next. That I get to chem late. That I take the last seat next to Lauren Lornet. That Mr. Tierney passes out a quiz with three questions on it.</p><p>The worst part of it? I\u2019ve seen the quiz before and I still don\u2019t know the answers.</p><p>I ask to borrow a pen. Lauren starts whispering to me; she wants to know if it\u2019s working okay. Mr. Tierney\u2019s book comes down with a bang.</p><p>Everyone jumps but me.</p><p>Class. Bell. Class. Bell.</p><p>Crazy. I\u2019m going crazy.</p><p>By the time the roses get delivered in math class my hands are shaking. I take a deep breath before I open the little laminated card attached to the rose Rob sent me. I imagine it will say something incredible, something surprising, something that will make everything better.</p><p>You\u2019re beautiful, Sam.</p><p>I\u2019m so happy to be with you.</p><p>Sam, I love you.</p><p>I lift the corner of the card gently and peek inside.</p><p>Luv y\u2014</p><p>I close the card quickly and put it in my bag.</p><p>\u201cWow. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I look up. The girl dressed like an angel is standing there, staring at the rose she\u2019s just laid on my desk: pink and cream petals swirled together like ice cream. She still has her hand outstretched and tiny blue veins crisscross her skin like a web.</p><p>\u201cTake a picture. It\u2019ll last longer,\u201d I snap at her. She blushes as red as the roses she\u2019s holding and stammers out an apology.</p><p>I don\u2019t bother reading the note that\u2019s attached to this one, and for the rest of class I keep my eyes glued to the blackboard to avoid any sign from Kent. I\u2019m concentrating so hard on not looking at him I almost miss it when Mr. Daimler winks at me and smiles.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>After class Kent catches up with me, holding the pink-and-cream rose, which I\u2019d deliberately left on my desk.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot this,\u201d he says. As always his hair is flopping over one eye. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can say it: I\u2019m amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t forget it.\u201d I\u2019m struggling not to look at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>I sneak a glance at him and see his smile fade for a second. Then it\u2019s back on full-force, like a friggin\u2019 laser beam.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He tries to pass it to me. \u201cDidn\u2019t anybody ever tell you that the more roses you get on Cupid Day, the more popular you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I need any help in that department. Especially from you.\u201d</p><p>His smile definitely drops then. Part of me hates what I\u2019m doing, but all I can think of is the memory\u2014or dream\u2014or whatever it is\u2014when he leans in and I think he\u2019s going to kiss me, I\u2019m sure of it, but instead he whispers, I see right through you.</p><p>You don\u2019t know me. You don\u2019t know anything about me.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>I dig my nails into my palms.</p><p>\u201cI never said the rose was from me,\u201d he says. His voice is so low and serious it startles me. I meet his eyes; they\u2019re bright green. I remember when I was little my mom used to say that God mixed the grass and Kent\u2019s eyes from the same color.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. It\u2019s pretty obvious.\u201d I just want him to stop looking at me like that.</p><p>He takes a deep breath. \u201cLook. I\u2019m having a party tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I see Rob loping into the cafeteria. Normally I would wait for him to notice me, but today I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cRob!\u201d I yell out.</p><p>He turns and sees me, gives me half a wave, and starts to turn around again.</p><p>\u201cRob! Wait!\u201d I take off down the hallway. I\u2019m not exactly running\u2014Lindsay, Ally, Elody, and I made a pact years ago never to run on school grounds, not even in gym class (let\u2019s face it: sweating and huffing aren\u2019t exactly attractive)\u2014but it\u2019s a close call.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, Slamster. Where\u2019s the fire?\u201d</p><p>Rob puts his arms around me and I bury my nose in his fleece. It smells a little like old pizza\u2014not the best smell, especially when it\u2019s mixed with lemon balm\u2014but I don\u2019t care. My legs are shaking so badly I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll give out. I just want to stand there forever, holding on to him.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d I say into his chest.</p><p>For a second his arms tense around me. But when he tilts my face up toward his, he\u2019s smiling.</p><p>\u201cDid you get my Valogram?\u201d he asks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nod. \u201cThanks.\u201d My throat is tight and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll start to cry. It feels so good to have his arms around me, like he\u2019s the only thing holding me up. \u201cListen, Rob. About tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure what I\u2019m going to say, but he cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cOkay. What is it now?\u201d</p><p>I pull back just a little bit so I can look at him. \u201cI\u2014I want to...I\u2019m just\u2014things are all crazy today. I think I might be sick or\u2014or something else.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs and pinches my nose with two fingers. \u201cOh, no. You\u2019re not getting out of this one.\u201d He puts his forehead to mine and whispers, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to this for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, me too....\u201d I\u2019ve imagined it so many times: the way the moon will be dipping past the trees and coming through the windows and lighting up triangles and squares on the walls; the way his fleece blanket will feel against my bare skin when I take my clothes off.</p><p>And then I\u2019ve imagined the moment afterward, after Rob has kissed me and told me he loved me and fallen asleep with his mouth just parted and I sneak off to the bathroom and text Elody and Lindsay and Ally.</p><p>I did it.</p><p>It\u2019s the middle part that\u2019s harder to picture.</p> <p>I feel my phone buzz in my back pocket: a new text. My stomach flips. I already know what it will say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say to Rob, squeezing my arms around him. \u201cMaybe I should come over right after school. We can hang out all afternoon, all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cute.\u201d Rob pulls away, adjusts his hat and his backpack. \u201cMy parents don\u2019t clear out until dinnertime, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. We can watch a movie or someth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides.\u201d Rob\u2019s looking over my shoulder now. \u201cI heard about some party at what\u2019s-his-name\u2019s\u2014dude with the bowler hat. Ken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKent,\u201d I say automatically. Rob knows his name, obviously\u2014everyone knows everyone here\u2014but it\u2019s a power thing. I remember telling Kent, I shouldn\u2019t even know your name, and feel queasy. Voices are swelling through the hall, and people start passing Rob and me. I can feel them staring. They\u2019re probably hoping for a fight.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Kent. I might stop by for a while. We can meet up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to go?\u201d I\u2019m trying to squash the panic welling up inside me. I lower my head and look up at him the way I\u2019ve seen Lindsay do with Patrick when she\u2019s really desperate for something. \u201cIt\u2019ll just mean less time with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have plenty of time.\u201d Rob kisses his fingers and taps them, twice, against my cheek. \u201cTrust me. Have I ever let you down?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ll let me down tonight. The thought comes to me before I can stop it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say too loudly. Rob\u2019s not listening, though. Adam Marshall and Jeremy Forker have just joined us, and they\u2019re all doing the greeting thing where they jump on one another and wrestle. Sometimes I think Lindsay\u2019s right and guys are just like animals.</p><p>I pull out my phone to check my text, though I don\u2019t really need to.</p><p>Party @ Kent McFreaky\u2019s 2nite. In?</p><p>My fingers are numb as I text back, Obv. Then I go into lunch, feeling like the sound of three hundred voices has weight, like it\u2019s a solid wind that will carry me up, up, and away.</p> <p>BEFORE I WAKE</p><p>\u201cSo? You nervous?\u201d Lindsay lifts one leg in the air and swivels it back and forth, admiring the shoes she\u2019s just stolen from Ally\u2019s closet.</p><p>Music thumps from the living room. Ally and Elody are out there singing their heads off to \u201cLike a Prayer.\u201d Ally\u2019s not even close to on key. Lindsay and I are lying on our backs on Ally\u2019s mongo bed. Everything in Ally\u2019s house is 25 percent bigger than in a normal person\u2019s: the fridge, the leather chairs, the televisions\u2014even the magnums of champagne her dad keeps in the wine cellar (strictly hands-off). Lindsay once said it made her feel like Alice in Wonderland.</p><p>I settle my head against an enormous pillow that says THE BITCH IS IN. I\u2019ve had four shots already, thinking it would calm me down, and above me the lights are winking and blurring. We\u2019ve cracked all the windows open, but I\u2019m still feeling feverish.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to breathe,\u201d Lindsay\u2019s saying. \u201cDon\u2019t freak out if it hurts a little\u2014especially at first. Don\u2019t tense up. You\u2019ll make it worse.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m feeling pretty nauseous and Lindsay\u2019s not making it better. I couldn\u2019t eat all day, so by the time we got to Ally\u2019s house, I was starving and scarfed about twenty-five of the toast-pesto-goat-cheese snacks that Ally whipped up. I\u2019m not sure how well the goat cheese is mixing with the vodka. On top of it, Lindsay made me eat about seven Listerine breath strips because the pesto had garlic in it, and she said Rob would feel like he was losing his virginity to an Italian line cook.</p><p>I\u2019m not even that nervous about Rob\u2014I mean, I can\u2019t focus on being nervous about him. The party, the drive, the possibility of what will happen there: that\u2019s what\u2019s really giving me stomach cramps. At least the vodka\u2019s helped me breathe, and I\u2019m not feeling shaky anymore.</p><p>Of course, I can\u2019t tell Lindsay any of this, so instead I say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to freak. I mean, everybody does it, right? If Anna Cartullo can do it...\u201d</p><p>Lindsay pulls a face. \u201cEw. Whatever you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s not what Anna Cartullo does. You and Rob are \u2018making love.\u2019\u201d She puts quotes in the air with her fingers and giggles, but I can tell she means it.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She tilts her head to look at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I want to ask, How do you know the difference?</p><p>In movies you can always tell when people are supposed to be together because music swells up behind them\u2014dumb, but true. Lindsay\u2019s always saying she couldn\u2019t live without Patrick and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s how you\u2019re supposed to feel or not.</p><p>Sometimes when I\u2019m standing in the middle of a crowded place with Rob, and he puts his arm around my shoulders and pulls me close\u2014like he doesn\u2019t want me to get bumped or spilled on or whatever\u2014I feel a kind of heat in my stomach like I\u2019ve just had a glass of wine, and I\u2019m completely happy, just for that second. I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what love is.</p><p>So I say to Lindsay, \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay giggles again and nudges me. \u201cSo? Did he bite the bullet and just say it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cThat he loves you.\u201d</p><p>I pause for just a second too long, thinking of his note: Luv ya. The kind of thing you pencil in somebody\u2019s yearbook when you don\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>Lindsay rushes on. \u201cHe will. Guys are idiots. Bet you he says it tonight. Just after you...\u201d She trails off and starts humping her hips up and down.</p><p>I smack her with a pillow. \u201cYou\u2019re a dog, you know that?\u201d</p><p>She growls at me and bares her teeth. We laugh and then lie in silence for a minute, listening to Elody\u2019s and Ally\u2019s howls from the other room. They\u2019re on to \u201cTotal Eclipse of the Heart\u201d now. It feels nice to be lying there: nice and normal. I think of all the times we must\u2019ve laid in exactly this spot, waiting for Elody and Ally to finish getting ready, waiting to go out, waiting for something to happen\u2014time ticking and then falling away, lost forever\u2014and I suddenly wish I could remember each one singularly, like somehow if I could remember them all, I could have them back.</p><p>\u201cWere you nervous? The first time, I mean.\u201d I\u2019m kind of embarrassed to ask so I say it quietly.</p><p>I think the question catches Lindsay off guard. She blushes and starts picking at the braiding on Ally\u2019s bedspread, and for a moment there\u2019s an awkward silence. I\u2019m pretty sure I know what she\u2019s thinking, though I would never say it out loud. Lindsay, Ally, Elody, and I are as close as you can be, but there are still some things we never talk about. For example, even though Lindsay says Patrick is her first and only, this isn\u2019t technically true. Technically, her first was a guy she met at a party when she was visiting her stepbrother at NYU. They smoked pot, split a six-pack, and had sex, and he never knew she hadn\u2019t done it before.</p><p>We don\u2019t talk about that. We don\u2019t talk about the fact that we can never hang out at Elody\u2019s house after five o\u2019clock because her mother will be home, and drunk. We don\u2019t talk about the fact that Ally never eats more than a quarter of what\u2019s on her plate, even though she\u2019s obsessed with cooking and watches the Food Network for hours on end.</p><p>We don\u2019t talk about the joke that for years trailed me down hallways, into classrooms, and on the bus, that wove its way into my dreams: \u201cWhat\u2019s red and white and weird all over? Sam Kingston!\u201d And we definitely don\u2019t talk about the fact that Lindsay was the one who made it up.</p><p>A good friend keeps your secrets for you. A best friend helps you keep your own secrets.</p><p>Lindsay rolls over on her side and props herself on one elbow. I wonder if she\u2019s finally going to mention the guy at NYU. (I don\u2019t even know his name, and the few times she\u2019s ever made reference to him she called him the Unmentionable.)</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t nervous,\u201d she says quietly. Then she sucks in a deep breath and her face splits into a grin. \u201cI was horny, baby. Randy.\u201d She says it in a fake British accent and then jumps on top of me and starts making a humping motion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible,\u201d I say, pushing her off me. She rolls all the way off the bed, cackling.</p><p>\u201cYou love me.\u201d Lindsay gets up on her knees and blows the bangs out of her face. She leans forward and rests her elbows on the bed. She suddenly gets serious.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d Her eyes are wide and she drops her voice. I have to sit up to hear her over the music. \u201cCan I tell you a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d My heart starts fluttering. She knows what\u2019s happening to me. It\u2019s happening to her, too.</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise not to tell. You have to swear not to freak out.\u201d</p><p>She knows; she knows. It\u2019s not just me. My head clears and everything sharpens around me. I feel totally sober. \u201cI swear.\u201d The words barely come out.</p><p>She leans forward until her mouth is only an inch from my ear. \u201cI...\u201d</p><p>Then she turns her head and burps, loudly, in my face.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lindz!\u201d I fan the air with my hand. She sinks onto her back again, kicking her legs into the air and laughing hysterically. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ever serious?\u201d I say it jokingly, but my whole body feels heavy with disappointment. She doesn\u2019t know. She doesn\u2019t understand. Whatever is happening, it\u2019s happening only to me. A feeling of complete aloneness overwhelms me, like a fog.</p><p>Lindsay dabs the corners of her eyes with a thumb and jumps to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll be serious when I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>That word sends a shock straight through me. Dead. So final, so ugly, so short. The warm feeling I\u2019ve had since taking the shots drains out of me, and I lean over to shut Ally\u2019s window, shivering. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The black mouth of the woods, yawning open. Vicky Hallinan\u2019s face...</p><p>I try to decide what will happen to me if it turns out I really have gone bat-shit insane. Just before eighth period I stood ten feet away from the main office\u2014home to the principal, Ms. Winters, and the school psychiatrist\u2014willing myself to go in and say the words: I think I\u2019m going crazy. But then there was a bang and Lauren Lornet shot into the hall, sniffling, probably crying over some boy drama or fight with her parents or something normal. In that second all of the work I\u2019d done to fit in vanished. Everything is different now. I\u2019m different.</p><p>\u201cSo are we going or what?\u201d Elody bursts into the room in front of Ally. They\u2019re both breathless.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d Lindsay picks up her bag and swings it over one shoulder.</p> <p>Ally starts to giggle. \u201cIt\u2019s only nine thirty,\u201d she says, \u201cand Sam already looks like she could barf.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and wait for a second while the ground steadies underneath me. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d Lindsay says, and smiles.</p><p>THE PARTY, TAKE TWO</p><p>\u201cThis is how a horror movie starts,\u201d Ally says. \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s number forty-two?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d My voice sounds like it\u2019s coming from a distance. The huge crush of fear has returned. I can feel it pressing on me from all directions, squeezing the breath out of me.</p><p>\u201cThis better not screw with my paint job,\u201d Lindsay says as a branch scrapes along the passenger door with the sound of a nail dragging against a chalkboard.</p><p>The woods fall away, and Kent\u2019s house comes looming out of the darkness, white and sparkling, like it\u2019s made of ice. The way it just emerges there, surrounded on all sides by black, reminds me of the scene in Titanic when the iceberg rises out of the water and guts the ship open. We\u2019re all silent for a second. Tiny pellets of rain ping against the windshield and the roof, and Lindsay switches off her iPod. An old song pipes quietly from the radio. I can just make out the lyrics: Feel it now like you felt it then.... Touch me now and around again....</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as big as your house, Al,\u201d Lindsay says.</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d Ally says. I feel a tremendous wave of affection for her at that moment. Ally, who likes big houses and expensive cars and Tiffany jewelry and platform wedges and body glitter. Ally, who\u2019s not that smart and knows it, and obsesses over boys who aren\u2019t good enough for her. Ally, who\u2019s secretly an amazing cook. I know her. I get her. I know all of them.</p><p>In the house Dujeous roars through the speakers: All MCs in the house tonight, if your lyrics sound tight then rock the mic. The stairs roll underneath me. When we get upstairs Lindsay takes the bottle of vodka away from me, laughing.</p> <p>\u201cSlow down, Slam-a-Lot. You\u2019ve got business to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness?\u201d I start laughing a little, little gasps of it. It\u2019s so smoky I can hardly breathe. \u201cI thought it was making love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe business of making love.\u201d She leans in and her face swells like a moon. \u201cNo more vodka for a while, okay?\u201d</p><p>I feel myself nodding and her face recedes. She scans the room. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta find Patrick. You gonna be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I say, trying to smile. I can\u2019t manage it: it\u2019s like the muscles in my face won\u2019t respond. She starts to turn away and I grab her wrist. \u201cLindz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna come with you, okay?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cYeah, sure. Whatever. He\u2019s in the back somewhere\u2014he just texted me.\u201d</p> <p>We start pushing past people. Lindsay yells back to me, \u201cIt\u2019s like a maze up here.\u201d Things are going past me in a blur\u2014snippets of conversation and laughter, the feel of coats brushing against my skin, the smell of beer and perfume and shower gel and sweat\u2014all of it whirling and spinning together.</p><p>Everyone looks the way they do in dreams, familiar but not too clear, like they could morph into someone else at any second. I\u2019m dreaming, I think. This is all a dream: this whole day has been a dream, and when I wake up I\u2019ll tell Lindsay how the dream felt real and hours long, and she\u2019ll roll her eyes and tell me that dreams never last longer than thirty seconds.</p><p>It\u2019s funny to think about telling Lindsay\u2014who\u2019s tugging on my hand and tossing her hair impatiently in front of me\u2014that I\u2019m only dreaming of her, that she\u2019s not really here, and I giggle, starting to relax. It\u2019s all a dream; I can do whatever I want. I can kiss anybody I want to, and as we walk past groups of guys I check them off in my head\u2014Adam Marshall, Rassan Lucas, and Andrew Roberts\u2014I could kiss each and every one if I wanted to. I see Kent standing in the corner talking to Phoebe Rifer and I think, I could walk up and kiss the heart-shaped mole under his eye, and it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. I don\u2019t know where the idea comes from. I would never kiss Kent, not even in a dream. But I could if I wanted to. Somewhere I\u2019m lying stretched out under a warm blanket on a big bed surrounded by pillows, my hands folded under my head, sleeping.</p><p>I lean forward to tell Lindsay this\u2014that I\u2019m dreaming of yesterday and maybe yesterday was its own dream too\u2014when I see Bridget McGuire standing in a corner with her arm around Alex Liment\u2019s waist. She\u2019s laughing and he\u2019s bending down to nuzzle her neck. She looks up at that moment and sees me watching them. Then she takes his hand and drags him over to me, pushing other people out of the way.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll know,\u201d she\u2019s saying over her shoulder to him, and then she turns her smile on me. Her teeth are so white they\u2019re glowing. \u201cDid Mrs. Harbor give out the essay assignments today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m so confused it takes me a second to realize she\u2019s talking about English class.</p><p>\u201cThe essay assignments. For Macbeth?\u201d</p><p>She nudges Alex and he says, \u201cI missed seventh period.\u201d He meets my eyes and then looks away, taking a swig of beer.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cSo did she give them out?\u201d Bridget looks like she always does: like a puppy just waiting for a treat. \u201cAlex had to skip. Doctor\u2019s appointment. His mom made him get some shot to, like, prevent meningitis. How lame is that? I mean, four people died of it last year. You have more of a chance of being hit by a car\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should get a shot to prevent herpes,\u201d Lindsay says, snickering, but so quietly I only hear because I\u2019m standing right next to her. \u201cIt\u2019s probably too late, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say to Bridget. \u201cI cut.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m staring at Alex, watching his reaction. I\u2019m not sure whether he noticed Lindsay and me standing outside of Hunan Kitchen today, peering inside. It doesn\u2019t seem like it.</p><p>He and Anna had been huddled over some grayish meat congealing in a plastic bowl, just like I\u2019d expected them to be. Lindsay had wanted to go in and mess with them, but I\u2019d threatened to puke on her new Steve Madden boots if we even caught a whiff of the nasty meat-and-onion smell inside.</p><p>By the time we left The Country\u2019s Best Yogurt, they were gone, and we only saw them again briefly at the Smokers\u2019 Lounge. They were leaving just as Lindsay was lighting up. Alex gave Anna a quick kiss on the cheek, and we saw them walk off in two different directions: Alex toward the cafeteria, Anna toward the arts building.</p><p>They were long gone by the time Lindsay and I passed the Nic Nazi on her daily patrol. They weren\u2019t busted today.</p><p>And Bridget doesn\u2019t know where he really was during seventh.</p><p>All of a sudden things start clicking into place\u2014all the fears I\u2019ve been holding back\u2014one right after another like dominoes falling. I can\u2019t deny it anymore. Sarah Grundel got the parking space because we were late. That\u2019s why she\u2019s still in the semifinals. Anna and Alex didn\u2019t have a fight because I convinced Lindsay to keep walking. That\u2019s why they weren\u2019t caught out at the Smokers\u2019 Lounge, and that\u2019s why Bridget is hanging off Alex instead of crying in a bathroom.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a dream. And it\u2019s not d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><p>It\u2019s really happening. It\u2019s happening again.</p><p>It feels like my whole body goes to ice in that second. Bridget\u2019s babbling about having never cut a class, and Lindsay\u2019s nodding and looking bored, and Alex is drinking his beer, and then I really can\u2019t breathe\u2014fear is clamping down on me like a vise, and I feel like I might shatter into a million pieces right then and there. I want to sit down and put my head between my knees, but I\u2019m worried that if I move, or close my eyes, or do anything, I\u2019ll just start to unravel\u2014head coming away from neck coming away from shoulder\u2014all of me floating away into nothing.</p><p>The head bone disconnected from the neck bone, the neck bone disconnected from the backbone...</p><p>I feel arms wrap around me from behind and Rob\u2019s mouth is on my neck. But even he can\u2019t warm me up. I\u2019m shivering uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cSexy Sammy,\u201d he singsongs, turning me around to him. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been all my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRob.\u201d I\u2019m surprised I can still speak, surprised I can still think. \u201cI really need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, babe?\u201d His eyes are bleary and red. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m terrified, but certain things seem sharper to me than they ever have, clearer. I notice for the first time that the crescent-shaped scar under his nose makes him look kind of like a bull.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do it here. We need to...we need to go somewhere. A room or something. Somewhere private.\u201d</p><p>He grins and leans into me, breathing alcohol on my face while he tries to kiss me. \u201cI get it. It\u2019s that kind of conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Rob. I\u2019m feeling\u2014\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never feeling right.\u201d He pulls away, frowning at me. \u201cThere\u2019s always something, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He sways a little bit on his feet and imitates. \u201cI\u2019m tired tonight. My parents are upstairs. Your parents will hear.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting months for this, Sam.\u201d</p><p>The tears are coming. My head throbs with the effort of keeping them back. \u201cThis has nothing to do with that. I swear, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what does it have to do with?\u201d He crosses his arms.</p><p>\u201cI just really need you right now.\u201d I barely get the words out. I\u2019m surprised he even hears me.</p><p>He sighs and rubs his forehead. \u201cAll right, all right. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He puts one hand on the top of my head.</p><p>I nod. Tears start coming and he wipes two of them away with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk, okay? We\u2019ll go somewhere quiet.\u201d He rattles his empty beer cup at me. \u201cBut can I at least get a topper first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d I say, even though I want to beg him to stay with me, to put his arms around me and never let go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best,\u201d he says, ducking down to kiss my cheek. \u201cNo crying\u2014we\u2019re at a party, remember? It\u2019s supposed to be fun.\u201d He starts backing away and holds up his hand, fingers extended. \u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p><p>I press myself against the wall and wait. I don\u2019t know what else to do. People are going past me, and I keep my hair down and in my face so no one will be able to tell the tears are still coming. The party is loud, but somehow it seems remote. Words are distorted and music sounds the way it does at a carnival, like all the notes are off balance and just colliding with one another.</p><p>Five minutes pass, then seven. Ten minutes pass, and I tell myself I\u2019ll wait five more minutes and then go look for him, even though the idea of moving seems impossible. After twelve minutes I text, Where r u? but then remember that yesterday he told me he\u2019d set his phone down somewhere.</p><p>Yesterday. Today.</p> <p>And this time, when I imagine myself lying somewhere, I\u2019m not sleeping. This time I imagine myself stretched out on a cold stone slab, skin as white as milk, lips blue, and hands folded across my chest like they\u2019ve been placed there....</p><p>I take a deep breath and force myself to focus on other things. I count the Christmas lights framing the E.T. movie poster over a couch, and then I count the bright red glowing cigarette butts weaving around through the half darkness like fireflies. I\u2019m not a math geek or anything, but I\u2019ve always liked numbers. I like how you can just keep stacking them up, one on top of the other, until they fill any space, any moment. I told my friends this one day, and Lindsay said I was going to be the kind of old woman who memorizes phone books and keeps flattened cereal boxes and newspapers piled from floor to ceiling in her house, looking for messages from space in the bar codes.</p><p>But a few months later I was sleeping over, and she confessed that sometimes when she\u2019s upset about something she recites this Catholic bedtime prayer she memorized when she was little, even though she\u2019s half Jewish and doesn\u2019t even believe in God anyway.</p><p>Now I lay me down to sleep,</p><p>I pray thee, Lord, my soul to keep.</p> <p>If I should die before I wake,</p><p>I pray thee, Lord, my soul to take.</p><p>She\u2019d seen it embroidered on a pillow in her piano teacher\u2019s house, and we laughed about how lame embroidered pillows were. But until I fell asleep that night I couldn\u2019t get the prayer out of my head. That one line kept replaying over and over in my mind: If I should die before I wake.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to force myself away from the wall when I hear Rob\u2019s name. Two sophomores have stumbled into the room, giggling, and I strain to hear what they\u2019re saying.</p><p>\u201c...his second in two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Matt Kessler did the first one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey both did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see how Aaron Stern is, like, holding him above the keg? Completely upside down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what a keg stand is, duh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRob Cokran is so hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. Oh my God.\u201d</p><p>One of the girls elbows the other one when she notices me. Her face goes white. She\u2019s probably terrified: she\u2019s been talking about my boyfriend (misdemeanor), but, more specifically, she\u2019s been talking about how hot he is (felony). If Lindsay were here, she would freak out, call the girls whores, and get them booted from the party. If she were here she would expect me to freak out. Lindsay thinks that underclassmen\u2014specifically sophomore girls\u2014need to be put in their place. Otherwise they\u2019ll overrun the universe like cockroaches, protected from nuclear attack by an armor of Tiffany jewelry and shiny lip-gloss shells.</p><p>I don\u2019t have the energy to give these girls attitude, though, and I\u2019m glad Lindsay\u2019s not with me so she can\u2019t give me crap about it. I should have known Rob wouldn\u2019t come back. I think about today, when he told me to trust him, when he said that he\u2019d never let me down. I should have told him he was full of it.</p><p>I need to get out. I need to be away from the smoke and the music. I need a place to think. I\u2019m still freezing, and I\u2019m sure I look awful, though I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going to cry anymore. We once watched this health video about the symptoms of shock, and I\u2019m pretty much the poster child for all of them. Difficulty breathing. Cold, clammy hands. Dizziness. Knowing this makes me feel even worse.</p> <p>Which just goes to show you should never pay attention in health class.</p><p>The line for both bathrooms is four deep and all of the rooms are packed. It\u2019s eleven o\u2019clock and everyone who has planned on showing is here. A couple of people say my name, and Tara Flute gets in my face and says, \u201cOh my God. I love your earrings. Did you get them at\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d I cut her off and keep going, desperate to find somewhere dark and quiet. To my left is a closed door, the one with all of the bumper stickers plastered to it. I grip the doorknob and shake it. It doesn\u2019t open, of course.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the VIP room.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and Kent is standing behind me, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be on the list.\u201d He leans against the wall. \u201cOr slip the bouncer a twenty. Whichever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I was looking for the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Kent tilts his head toward the other side of the hall, where Ronica Masters, obviously drunk, is hammering on a door with her fist.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kristen!\u201d she\u2019s yelling. \u201cI really have to pee.\u201d</p><p>Kent turns back to me and raises his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cMy bad,\u201d I say, and try to push past him.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kent doesn\u2019t exactly touch me, but he holds his hand up like he\u2019s thinking about it. \u201cYou look\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d The last thing in the world I need right now is pity from Kent McFuller, and I shove back into the hallway.</p><p>I\u2019ve just decided to go outside and call Lindsay from the porch\u2014I\u2019ll tell her I need to leave ASAP, I have to leave\u2014when Elody barrels into the hall, throwing her arms around me.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d she screeches, kissing me. She\u2019s sweating, and I think of Izzy climbing into my bed and putting her arms around me, tugging on my necklace. I should never have gotten out of bed today.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess, let me guess.\u201d Elody leaves her arms around me and starts bumping her hips like we\u2019re grinding on a dance floor. She rolls her eyes to the ceiling and starts moaning, \u201cOh, Rob, oh, Rob. Yeah. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pervert.\u201d I push her off me. \u201cYou\u2019re worse than Otto.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and grabs my hand, starts dragging me toward the back room. \u201cCome on. Everyone\u2019s in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I say. The music back here is louder and I\u2019m yelling. \u201cI don\u2019t feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel good!\u201d</p><p>She points to her ear like, I can\u2019t hear you. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s true or not. Her palms are wet and I try to pull away, but at that second Lindsay and Ally spot me, and they start squealing, jumping all over me.</p><p>\u201cI was looking for you for ages,\u201d Lindsay says, waving her cigarette.</p><p>\u201cIn Patrick\u2019s mouth, maybe.\u201d Ally snorts.</p><p>\u201cShe was with Rob.\u201d Elody points at me, swaying on her feet. \u201cLook at her. She looks guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHussy!\u201d Lindsay screeches. Ally pipes in with, \u201cTrollop!\u201d and Elody yells out, \u201cHarlot!\u201d This is an old joke of ours: Lindsay decided slut was too boring last year.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d I say. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to drive me. I\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay must think I\u2019m kidding. \u201cGo home? We only got here, like, an hour ago.\u201d She leans forward and whispers, \u201cBesides, I thought you and Rob were going to...you know.\u201d As though she didn\u2019t just scream out in front of everybody that I already had.</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d I do my best to sound like I don\u2019t care, and the effort it takes is exhausting. I\u2019m angry at Lindsay without knowing why\u2014for not ditching the party with me, I guess. I\u2019m angry at Elody for dragging me back here and at Ally for always being so clueless. I\u2019m angry at Rob for not caring how upset I am, and I\u2019m angry at Kent for caring. I\u2019m angry at everyone and everything, and in that second I fantasize about the cigarette Lindsay\u2019s waving catching on the curtains, about fire racing over the room and consuming everyone. Then, immediately, I feel guilty. The last thing I need is to morph into one of those people who\u2019s always wearing black and doodling guns and bombs on her notebook.</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s gaping at me like she can see what I\u2019m thinking. Then I realize she\u2019s looking over my shoulder. Elody turns pink. Ally\u2019s mouth starts opening and closing like a fish\u2019s. There\u2019s a dip in the noise of the party, like someone has just hit pause on a soundtrack.</p><p>Juliet Sykes. I know it will be her before I turn around, but I\u2019m still surprised when I see her, still struck with that same sense of wonder.</p><p>She\u2019s pretty.</p><p>Today when I saw her drifting through the cafeteria she looked like she always did, hair hanging in her face, baggy clothing, shrunken into herself like she could be anyone, anywhere, a phantom or a shadow.</p><p>But now she\u2019s standing straight and her hair is pulled back and her eyes are glittering.</p><p>She walks across the room toward us. My mouth goes dry. I want to say no, but she\u2019s standing in front of Lindsay before I can get the word out. I see her mouth moving, but what she says takes a second to understand, like I\u2019m hearing it from underwater.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Everyone is whispering, staring at our little huddle: me, Lindsay, Elody, Ally, and Juliet Sykes. I feel my cheeks burning. The sound of voices begins to swell.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Lindsay is gritting her teeth.</p><p>\u201cA bitch. A mean girl. A bad person.\u201d Juliet turns to Elody. \u201cYou\u2019re a bitch.\u201d To Ally. \u201cYou\u2019re a bitch.\u201d Finally her eyes click on mine. They\u2019re exactly the color of sky.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch.\u201d</p><p>The voices are a roar now, people laughing and screaming out, \u201cPsycho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d I croak out at last, finding my voice, but Lindsay has already stepped forward and drowns me out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be a bitch than a psycho,\u201d she snarls, and puts two hands on Juliet\u2019s shoulders and shoves. Juliet stumbles backward, pinwheeling her arms, and it\u2019s all so horrible and familiar. It\u2019s happening again; it\u2019s actually happening. I close my eyes. I want to pray, but all I can think is, Why, why, why, why.</p><p>When I open my eyes Juliet is coming toward me, drenched, arms outstretched. She looks up at me, and I swear to God it\u2019s like she knows, like she can see straight into me, like this is somehow my fault. I feel like I\u2019ve been punched in the stomach and the air goes out of me and I lunge at her without thinking, push her and send her backward. She collapses into a bookshelf and then spins off of it, grabbing the doorframe to steady herself. Then she ducks out into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe it?\u201d someone is screeching behind me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJuliet Sykes is packing some cojones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, man.\u201d</p><p>People are laughing, and Lindsay leans over to Elody and says, \u201cFreak.\u201d The empty bottle of vodka is dangling from her hand. She must have dumped the rest on Juliet.</p><p>I start shoving my way out of the room. It seems as though even more people have come in and it\u2019s almost impossible to move. I\u2019m really pushing, using my elbows when I have to, and everyone\u2019s giving me weird looks. I don\u2019t care. I need out.</p> <p>I finally make it to the door and there\u2019s Kent, staring at me with his mouth set in a line. He shifts like he\u2019s about to block me.</p><p>I hold up my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d The words come out as a growl.</p><p>Without a sound he moves so I can squeeze past him. When I\u2019m halfway down the hall I hear him shout out, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d I yell back. But really I\u2019m thinking the same thing.</p><p>Why is this happening to me?</p> <p>Why, why, why?</p><p>\u201cHow come Sam always gets shotgun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re always too drunk to call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you bailed on Rob like that,\u201d Ally says. She\u2019s got her coat hunched up around her ears. Lindsay\u2019s car is so cold our breaths are all solid white vapor. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be in so much trouble tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>If there is a tomorrow, I almost say. I left the party without saying good-bye to Rob, who was stretched out on a sofa, his eyes half shut. I\u2019d been locked in an empty bathroom on the first floor for a half hour before that, sitting on the cold, hard rim of a bathtub, listening to the music pulsing through the walls and ceiling. Lindsay had insisted I wear bright red lipstick, and when I checked my face in the mirror, I saw that it had begun to bleed away from my lips, like a clown\u2019s. I took it off slowly with balled-up tissues, which I left floating in the toilet bowl, little blooming flowers of pink.</p><p>At a certain point your brain stops trying to rationalize things. At a certain point it gives up, shuts off, shuts down. Still, as Lindsay turns the car around\u2014driving up on Kent\u2019s lawn to do it, tires spinning in the mud\u2014I\u2019m afraid.</p> <p>Trees, as white and frail as bone, are dancing wildly in the wind. The rain is hammering the roof of the car, and sheets of water on the windows make the world look like it\u2019s disintegrating. The clock on the dashboard is glowing: 12:38.</p><p>I\u2019m gripping my seat as Lindsay speeds down the driveway, branches whipping past us on either side.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the paint job?\u201d I say, my heart hammering in my chest. I try to tell myself I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m fine, that nothing\u2019s going to happen. But it doesn\u2019t do any good.</p><p>\u201cScrew it,\u201d she says. \u201cCar\u2019s busted anyway. Have you seen the bumper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you stopped hitting parked cars,\u201d Elody says with a snort.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you had a car.\u201d Lindsay takes one hand off the wheel and leans over, reaching for her bag at my feet. As she tips she jerks the steering wheel, and the car runs up a little into the woods. Ally slides across the backseat and collapses into Elody, and they both start laughing.</p><p>I reach over and try to grab the wheel. \u201cJesus, Lindz.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay straightens up and elbows me off. She shoots me a look and then starts fumbling with a pack of cigarettes. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing. I\u2014\u201d I look out the window, biting back tears that are suddenly threatening to come. \u201cI just want you to pay attention, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, I want you to keep off the wheel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, guys. No fighting,\u201d Ally says.</p><p>\u201cGive me a smoke, Lindz.\u201d Elody\u2019s half reclining on the backseat, and she flails her arm wildly.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you light one for me,\u201d Lindsay says, tossing her pack into the backseat. Elody lights two cigarettes and passes one to Lindsay. Lindsay cracks a window and exhales a plume of smoke. Ally screeches.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, no windows. I\u2019m about to drop dead from pneumonia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about to drop dead when I kill you,\u201d Elody says.</p><p>\u201cIf you were gonna die,\u201d I blurt out, \u201chow would you want it to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Lindsay says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d My palms are damp with sweat and I wipe them on the seat cushion.</p><p>\u201cIn my sleep,\u201d Ally says.</p><p>\u201cEating my grandma\u2019s lasagna,\u201d Elody says, and then pauses and adds, \u201cor having sex,\u201d which makes Ally shriek with laughter.</p><p>\u201cOn an airplane,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I want everyone to go down with me.\u201d She makes a diving motion with her hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll know, though?\u201d It\u2019s suddenly important for me to talk about this. \u201cI mean, do you think you\u2019ll have an idea of it...like, before?\u201d</p><p>Ally straightens up and leans forward, hooking her arms over the back of our seats. \u201cOne day my grandfather woke up, and he swore he saw this guy all in black at the foot of his bed\u2014big hood, no face. He was holding this sword or whatever that thingy is called. It was Death, you know? And then later that day he went to the doctor and they diagnosed him with pancreatic cancer. The same day.\u201d</p><p>Elody rolls her eyes. \u201cHe didn\u2019t die, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat story doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we change the subject?\u201d Lindsay brakes for just a second before yanking the car out onto the wet road. \u201cThis is so morbid.\u201d</p><p>Ally giggles. \u201cSAT word alert.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay cranes her neck back and tries to blow smoke in Ally\u2019s face. \u201cNot all of us have the vocabulary of a twelve-year-old.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay turns onto Route 9, which stretches in front of us, a giant silver tongue. A hummingbird is beating its wings in my chest\u2014rising, rising, fluttering into my throat.</p><p>I want to go back to what I was saying\u2014I want to say, You would know, right? You would know before it happened\u2014but Elody bumps Ally out of the way and leans forward, the cigarette dangling from her mouth, trumpeting, \u201cMusic!\u201d She grabs for the iPod.</p><p>\u201cAre you wearing your seat belt?\u201d I say. I can\u2019t help it. The terror is everywhere now, pressing down on me, squeezing the breath from me, and I think: if you don\u2019t breathe, you\u2019ll die. The clock ticks forward. 12:39.</p><p>Elody doesn\u2019t even answer, just starts scrolling through the iPod. She finds \u201cSplinter,\u201d and Ally slaps her and says it should be her turn to pick the music, anyway. Lindsay tells them to stop fighting, and she tries to grab the iPod from Elody, taking both hands off the wheel, steadying it with one knee. I grab for it again and she shouts, \u201cGet off!\u201d She\u2019s laughing.</p><p>Elody knocks the cigarette out of Lindsay\u2019s hand and it lands between Lindsay\u2019s thighs. The tires slide a little on the wet road, and the car is full of the smell of burning.</p><p>If you don\u2019t breathe...</p><p>Then all of a sudden there\u2019s a flash of white in front of the car. Lindsay yells something\u2014words I can\u2019t make out, something like sit or shit or sight\u2014and suddenly\u2014</p><p>Well.</p><p>You know what happens next.</p><p>THREE</p><p>In my dream I am falling forever through darkness.</p><p>Falling, falling, falling.</p><p>Is it still falling if it has no end?</p><p>And then a shriek. Something ripping through the soundlessness, an awful, high wailing, like an animal or an alarm\u2014</p><p>Beepbeepbeepbeepbeepbeep.</p><p>I wake up stifling a scream.</p><p>I shut off the alarm, trembling, and lie back against my pillows. My throat is burning and I\u2019m covered in sweat. I take long, slow breaths and watch my room lighten as the sun inches its way over the horizon, things beginning to emerge: the Victoria\u2019s Secret sweatshirt on my floor, the collage Lindsay made me years ago with quotes from our favorite bands and cut-up magazines. I listen to the sounds from downstairs, so familiar and constant it\u2019s like they belong to the architecture, like they\u2019ve been built up out of the ground with the walls: the clanking of my father in the kitchen, shelving dishes; the frantic scrabbling sound of our pug, Pickle, trying to get out the back door, probably to pee and run around in circles; a low murmur that means my mom\u2019s watching the morning news.</p><p>When I\u2019m ready, I suck in a deep breath and reach for my phone. I flip it open.</p><p>The date flashes up at me.</p><p>Friday, February 12.</p><p>Cupid Day.</p><p>\u201cGet up, Sammy.\u201d Izzy pokes her head in the door. \u201cMommy says you\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Mom I\u2019m sick.\u201d Izzy\u2019s blond bob disappears again.</p><p>Here\u2019s what I remember: I remember being in the car. I remember Elody and Ally fighting over the iPod. I remember the wild spinning of the wheel and seeing Lindsay\u2019s face as the car sailed toward the woods, her mouth open and her eyebrows raised in surprise, as though she\u2019d just run into someone she knew in an unexpected place. But after that? Nothing.</p><p>After that, only the dream.</p><p>This is the first time I really think it\u2014the first time I allow myself to think it.</p><p>That maybe the accidents\u2014both of them\u2014were real.</p><p>And maybe I didn\u2019t make it.</p><p>Maybe when you die time folds in on you, and you bounce around inside this little bubble forever. Like the after-death equivalent of the movie Groundhog Day. It\u2019s not what I imagined death would be like\u2014not what I imagined would come afterward\u2014but then again it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anyone around to tell you about it.</p><p>Be honest: are you surprised that I didn\u2019t realize sooner? Are you surprised that it took me so long to even think the word\u2014 death? Dying? Dead?</p><p>Do you think I was being stupid? Naive?</p><p>Try not to judge. Remember that we\u2019re the same, you and me.</p><p>I thought I would live forever too.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d My mom pushes open the door and leans against the frame. \u201cIzzy said you felt sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I think I have the flu or something.\u201d I know I look like crap so it should be believable.</p><p>My mom sighs like I\u2019m being difficult on purpose. \u201cLindsay will be here any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can go in today.\u201d The idea of school makes me want to curl up in a ball and sleep forever.</p><p>\u201cOn Cupid Day?\u201d My mom raises her eyebrows. She glances at the fur-trimmed tank top that\u2019s laid out neatly over my desk chair\u2014the only item of clothing that isn\u2019t lying on the floor or hanging from a bedpost or a doorknob. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom.\u201d I try to swallow the lump in my throat. The worst is knowing I can\u2019t tell anybody what\u2019s happening\u2014or what\u2019s happened\u2014to me. Not even my mom. I guess it\u2019s been years since I talked to her about important stuff, but I start wishing for the days when I believed she could fix anything. It\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it? When you\u2019re young you just want to be older, and then later you wish you could go back to being a kid.</p><p>My mom\u2019s searching my face really intensely. I feel like at any second I could break down and blurt out something crazy so I roll away from her, facing the wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou love Cupid Day,\u201d my mom prods. \u201cAre you sure nothing happened? You didn\u2019t fight with your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not.\u201d</p><p>She hesitates. \u201cDid you fight with Rob?\u201d</p><p>That makes me want to laugh. I think about the fact that he left me waiting upstairs at Kent\u2019s party and I almost say, Not yet. \u201cNo, Mom. God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t use that tone of voice. I\u2019m just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re not.\u201d I bury deeper under the covers, keeping my back turned to her. I hear rustling and think she\u2019ll come and sit next to me. She doesn\u2019t, though. Freshman year after a big fight I drew a line in red nail polish just inside my door, and I told her if she ever came past the line I\u2019d never speak to her again. Most of the nail polish has chipped off by now, but in places you can still see it spotted over the wood like blood.</p><p>I meant it at the time, but I\u2019d expected her to forget after a while. But since that day she\u2019s never once stepped foot in my room. It\u2019s a bummer in some ways, since she never surprises me by making up my sheets anymore, or leaving folded laundry or a new sundress on my bed like she did when I was in middle school. But at least I know she\u2019s not rooting through my drawers while I\u2019m at school, looking for drugs or sex toys or whatever.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to come out here, I\u2019ll get the thermometer,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have a fever.\u201d There\u2019s a chip in the wall in the exact shape of an insect, and I push my thumb against the wall, squishing it.</p> <p>I can practically feel my mom put her hands on her hips. \u201cListen, Sam. I know it\u2019s second semester. And I know you think that gives you the right to slack off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, that is not it.\u201d I bury my head under the pillow, feeling like I could scream. \u201cI told you, I don\u2019t feel good.\u201d I\u2019m half afraid she\u2019ll ask me what\u2019s wrong and half hoping she will.</p><p>She only says, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll tell Lindsay you\u2019re thinking of going in late. Maybe you\u2019ll feel better after a little more sleep.\u201d</p><p>I doubt it. \u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, and a second later I hear the door click shut behind her.</p><p>I close my eyes and reach back into those final moments, the last memories\u2014Lindsay\u2019s look of surprise and the trees lit up like teeth in the headlights, the wild roar of the engine\u2014searching for a light, a thread that will connect this moment to that one, a way to sew together the days so that they make sense.</p><p>But all I get is blackness.</p> <p>I can\u2019t hold back my tears anymore. They come all at once, and before I know it I\u2019m sobbing and snotting all over my best Ethan Allen pillows. A little later I hear scratching against my door. Pickle has always had a dog sense for when I\u2019m crying, and in sixth grade after Rob Cokran said I was too big of a dork for him to go out with\u2014right in the middle of the cafeteria, in front of everybody\u2014Pickle sat on my bed and licked the tears off one after another.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s the example that pops into my head, but thinking about that moment makes a new rush of anger and frustration swell up inside of me. It\u2019s strange how much the memory affects me. I\u2019ve never mentioned that day to Rob\u2014I doubt he remembers\u2014but I\u2019ve always liked to think about it when we\u2019re walking down the hallway, our fingers interlaced, or when we\u2019re all hanging out in Tara Flute\u2019s basement, and Rob looks over at me and winks. I like to think how funny life is: how so much changes. How people change.</p><p>But now I just wonder when, exactly, I became cool enough for Rob Cokran.</p><p>After a while the scratching on my door stops. Pickle has finally realized he\u2019s not getting in, and I hear his paws ticking against the floor as he trots off. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so alone in my life.</p><p>I cry until it seems amazing that one person could have so many tears. It seems like they must be coming from the very tips of my toes.</p><p>Then I sleep without dreaming.</p><p>ESCAPE TACTICS</p><p>I wake up thinking about a movie I once saw. The main character dies somehow\u2014I forget how\u2014but he\u2019s only half dead. One part of him is lying there in a coma, and one part of him is wandering the world, kind of in limbo. The point is, so long as he\u2019s not completely 100 percent dead, a piece of him is trapped in this in-between place.</p> <p>This gives me hope for the first time in two days. The idea that I might be lying somewhere in a coma, my family bending over me and everyone worrying and filling my hospital room with flowers, actually makes me feel good.</p><p>Because if I\u2019m not dead\u2014at least not yet\u2014there may be a way to stop it.</p><p>My mom drops me off in Upper Lot just before third period starts (.22 miles or not, I will not be seen getting out of my mom\u2019s maroon 2003 Accord, which she won\u2019t trade in because she says it\u2019s \u201cfuel efficient\u201d). Now I can\u2019t wait to get to school. I have a gut feeling I\u2019ll find the answers there. I don\u2019t know how or why I\u2019m stuck in this time loop, but the more I think about it, the more convinced I am that there\u2019s a reason for it.</p><p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d I say, and start to pop out of the car.</p><p>But something stops me. It\u2019s the idea that\u2019s been bugging me for the past twenty-four hours, what I was trying to talk to my friends about in the Tank: how you might not ever really know. How you might be walking down the street one day and\u2014bam!</p><p>Blackness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold, Sam.\u201d My mom leans over the passenger seat and gestures for me to shut the door.</p><p>I turn around and stoop down to look at her. It takes me a second to work the words out of my mouth, but I mumble, \u201cIloveyou.\u201d</p><p>I feel so weird saying it, it comes out more like olivejuice. I\u2019m not even sure if she understands me. I slam the door quickly before she can respond. It\u2019s probably been years since I\u2019ve said \u201cI love you\u201d to either of my parents, except on Christmas or birthdays or when they say it first and it\u2019s pretty much expected. It leaves me with a weird feeling in my stomach, part relief and part embarrassment and part regret.</p><p>As I\u2019m walking toward school I make a vow: there\u2019s not going to be an accident tonight.</p><p>And whatever it is\u2014this bubble or hiccup in time\u2014I\u2019m busting out.</p><p>Here\u2019s another thing to remember: hope keeps you alive. Even when you\u2019re dead, it\u2019s the only thing that keeps you alive.</p><p>The bell has already rung for third period, so I book it to chem. I get there just in time to take a seat\u2014big surprise\u2014next to Lauren Lornet. The quiz goes off, same as yesterday and the day before\u2014except by now I can answer the first question myself.</p><p>Pen. Ink. Working? Mr. Tierney. Book. Slam. Jump.</p><p>\u201cKeep it,\u201d Lauren whispers to me, practically batting her eyelashes at me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a pen.\u201d I start to try to pass it back, as usual, but something in her expression sparks a memory. I remember coming home after Tara Flute\u2019s pool party in seventh grade and seeing my face in the mirror lit up exactly like that, like somebody had handed me a winning lottery ticket and told me my life was about to change.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I stuff the pen into my bag. She\u2019s still making that face\u2014I can see it out of the corner of my eye\u2014and after a minute I whip around and say, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so nice to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Now she looks completely stunned. Definitely an improvement.</p><p>I have to whisper because Tierney\u2019s started his lesson again. Chemical reactions, blah, blah, blah. Transfiguration. Put two liquids together and they form a solid. Two plus two does not equal four.</p><p>\u201cNice to me. You shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She squinches up her forehead so her eyes nearly disappear.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not nice to you.\u201d The words are surprisingly hard to get out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nice,\u201d Lauren says, looking at her hands, but she obviously doesn\u2019t mean it. She looks up and tries again. \u201cYou don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>She trails off, but I know what she\u2019s going to say. You don\u2019t have to be nice to me.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cGirls!\u201d Mr. Tierney bellows, slamming his fist down on his lab station. I swear he goes practically neon.</p><p>Lauren and I don\u2019t talk for the rest of class, but I leave chem feeling good, like I\u2019ve done the right thing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I like to see.\u201d Mr. Daimler drums his fingers on my desk as he walks the aisles at the end of class collecting homework. \u201cA big smile. It\u2019s a beautiful day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to rain later,\u201d Mike Heffner interjects, and everyone laughs. He\u2019s an idiot.</p><p>Mr. Daimler doesn\u2019t skip a beat. \u201c\u2014and it\u2019s Cupid Day. Love is in the air.\u201d He looks straight at me and my heart stops for a second. \u201cEveryone should be smiling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for you, Mr. Daimler,\u201d I say, making my voice extra sweet. More giggles and one loud snort from the back. I turn around and see Kent, head down, scribbling furiously on the cover of his notebook.</p><p>Mr. Daimler laughs and says, \u201cAnd here I thought I\u2019d gotten you excited about differential equations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got her excited about something,\u201d Mike mutters. More laughter from the class. I\u2019m not sure if Mr. Daimler hears\u2014he doesn\u2019t seem to\u2014but the tips of his ears turn red.</p><p>The whole class has been like this. I\u2019m in a good mood, certain everything will be okay. I\u2019ve got it all figured out. I\u2019m going to get a second chance. Plus Mr. Daimler\u2019s been paying me extra attention. After the Cupids came in he took a look at my four roses, raised his eyebrows, and said I must have secret admirers everywhere.</p><p>\u201cNot so secret,\u201d I said, and he winked at me.</p><p>After class I gather up my stuff and go out into the hall, pausing for just a second to check over my shoulder. Sure enough, Kent\u2019s bounding along after me, shirt untucked, messenger bag half open and slapping against his thigh. What a mess. I start walking toward the cafeteria. Today I looked more carefully at his note: the tree is sketched in black ink, each dip and shadow in the bark shaded perfectly. The leaves are tiny and diamond shaped. The whole thing must have taken him hours. I stuck it between two pages of my math book so it wouldn\u2019t get crushed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says, catching up with me. \u201cDid you get my note?\u201d</p><p>I almost say to him, It\u2019s really good, but something stops me. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t drink and love?\u2019 Is that some kind of a catchphrase I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI consider it my civic duty to spread the word.\u201d Kent puts his hand over his heart.</p><p>A thought flashes\u2014you wouldn\u2019t be talking to me if you could remember\u2014but I push it aside. This is Kent McFuller. He\u2019s lucky I\u2019m talking to him at all. Besides, I don\u2019t plan on being at the party tonight: no party, no Juliet Sykes, no reason for Kent to wig out on me. Most important, no accident.</p><p>\u201cMore like spread the weirdness,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI take that as a compliment.\u201d Kent suddenly looks serious. He scrunches up his face so that all the light freckles on his nose come together like a constellation. \u201cWhy do you flirt with Mr. Daimler? He\u2019s a perv, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m so surprised by the question it takes me a second to answer. \u201cMr. Daimler is not a perv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t flirt with him, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Kent rolls his eyes. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I shrug my shoulders. \u201cWhy so interested?\u201d</p><p>Kent goes red and drops his eyes to the floor. \u201cNo reason,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>My stomach dips a little bit, and I realize a part of me was hoping his answer would be different\u2014more personal. Of course, if Kent did confess his undying love for me right there, in the hallway, it would be disastrous. Despite his weirdness I have no desire to publicly humiliate him\u2014he\u2019s nice and we were childhood friends and all that\u2014but I could never, ever, ever date him, not in a million lifetimes. Not in my lifetime, anyway: the one I want back, where yesterdays are followed by todays and then tomorrows. The bowler hat alone makes it impossible.</p> <p>\u201cListen.\u201d Kent shoots me a look out of the corner of his eye. \u201cMy parents are going away this weekend, and I\u2019m having some people over tonight....\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Up ahead I see Rob loping toward the cafeteria. At any second he\u2019ll spot me. I can\u2019t handle seeing him right now. My stomach clenches and I leap in front of Kent, turning my back to the cafeteria. \u201cUm...where\u2019s your house again?\u201d</p><p>Kent looks at me strangely. I did basically just set myself up like a human barricade. \u201cOff Route Nine. You don\u2019t remember?\u201d I don\u2019t respond and he looks away, shrugging. \u201cI guess you wouldn\u2019t, really. You were only there a few times. We moved just before middle school. From Terrace Place. You remember my old house on Terrace Place, right?\u201d The smile is back. It\u2019s true: his eyes are exactly the color of grass. \u201cYou used to hang out in the kitchen and steal all the good cookies. And I chased you around these huge maple trees in the front yard. Remember?\u201d</p><p>As soon as he mentions the maple trees a memory rises up, expanding, like something breaking the surface of water and rippling outward. We were sitting in this little space in between two enormous roots that curved out of the ground like animal spines. I remember that he split two maple-wing seeds and stuck one on his nose and one on mine, telling me that this way everyone would know we were in love. I was probably only five or six.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I...\u201d The last thing I need is for him to remind me of the good old days, when I was all knees and nose and glasses, and he was the only boy who would come near me. \u201cMaybe. Trees kinda all look the same to me, you know?\u201d</p><p>He laughs even though I wasn\u2019t trying to be funny. \u201cSo you think you\u2019ll come tonight? To my party?\u201d</p> <p>This brings me back to reality. The party. I shake my head and start backing away. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>His smile falters a little. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fun. Big. Senior memories. Best time of our lives and all that crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cHigh school heaven.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and start walking away from him. The cafeteria is packed, and as I approach the double doors\u2014one of which is propped open with an old tennis shoe\u2014the noise of the students greets me with a roar.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come,\u201d he calls after me. \u201cI know you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath,\u201d I call back, and I almost add, It\u2019s better this way.</p><p>THE RULES OF SURVIVAL</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t go out?\u201d</p> <p>Ally\u2019s looking at me like I just said I wanted to go to prom with Ben Farsky (or Fart-sky, as we\u2019ve been calling him since fourth grade).</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like it, okay?\u201d I switch tactics and try again. \u201cWe go out every weekend. I just\u2014I don\u2019t know. I want to stay in, like we used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe used to stay in because we couldn\u2019t get into any senior parties,\u201d Ally says.</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d Lindsay says.</p><p>This is harder than I thought it would be.</p><p>I flash on my mom asking if I\u2019d had a fight with Rob and before I can think too much about it I blurt out, \u201cIt\u2019s Rob, okay? We...we\u2019re having issues.\u201d</p><p>I flip open my phone, checking for texts for the millionth time. When I first came into the cafeteria Rob was standing behind the registers, loading his fries with ketchup and barbecue sauce (his favorite). I couldn\u2019t bring myself to go up to him, so instead I hurried to our table in the senior section and sent him a text: We have 2 talk.</p><p>He texted back right away. Bout?</p><p>2nite, I wrote back, and since then my phone\u2019s been silent. Across the cafeteria, Rob is leaning against the vending machines talking to Adam Marshall. He has his hat twisted sideways on his head. He thinks it makes him look older.</p><p>I used to love collecting all these little facts about him, storing them together and holding them close inside of me, like if I gathered up all the details and remembered them\u2014the fact that he likes barbecue sauce but not mustard, that his favorite team is the Yankees even though he prefers basketball to baseball, that once when he was little he broke his leg trying to jump over a car\u2014I would totally understand him. I used to think that\u2019s what love was: knowing someone so well he was like a part of you.</p><p>But more and more I\u2019m feeling like I don\u2019t know Rob.</p><p>Ally\u2019s jaw actually drops. \u201cBut you\u2019re supposed to\u2014you know.\u201d</p><p>She kind of looks like a mounted fish with her mouth open like that, so I turn away, fighting the urge to laugh. \u201cWe were supposed to, but...\u201d I\u2019ve never been a good liar and my brain goes totally blank.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Lindsay prompts.</p><p>I reach into my bag and pull out the note he sent me, which is now crumpled and has a piece of gum, half unwrapped, sticking to it. I push it across the table. \u201cBut this.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay wrinkles her nose and flips open the card with the very tips of her fingernails. Ally and Elody lean over and they both read. They\u2019re all silent for a second afterward.</p><p>Finally Lindsay closes the card and pushes it back to me. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that good, either.\u201d I was only trying to fake an excuse to keep us away from the party tonight, but as soon as I start talking about Rob, I get really worked up. \u201cLuv ya? What kind of crap is that? We\u2019ve been going out since October.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably just waiting to say it,\u201d Elody says. She pushes the bangs out of her eyes. \u201cSteve doesn\u2019t say it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different. You don\u2019t expect him to say it.\u201d</p><p>Elody looks away quickly, and it occurs to me that maybe, despite everything, she does.</p><p>There\u2019s an awkward pause, and Lindsay jumps in. \u201cI don\u2019t see what the trauma is. You know Rob likes you. It\u2019s not like it would be a one-night stand or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes me, but...\u201d I\u2019m about to confess that I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re good together, but at the last second I can\u2019t. They would think I was insane. I don\u2019t even understand it myself, really. It\u2019s like the idea of him is better than the him of him. \u201cLook. I\u2019m not going to have sex with him just so he\u2019ll say that he loves me, you know?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even mean for the words to come out, and for a second I\u2019m so startled by them, I can\u2019t say anything else. That isn\u2019t why I was planning to have sex with Rob\u2014to hear the words, I mean. I just wanted to get it over with. I think. Actually, I\u2019m not sure why it seemed so important.</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d Ally mutters.</p><p>Then I smell lemon balm and Rob\u2019s planting a wet kiss on my cheek.</p><p>\u201cHi, ladies.\u201d He reaches over to take a fry from Elody, and she moves her tray just out of reach. He laughs. \u201cHey, Slammer. Did you get my note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d I look down at the table. I feel like if I meet his eyes I\u2019ll forget everything, forget the note and how he left me alone and how when he kisses me he keeps his eyes open.</p><p>At the same time, I don\u2019t really want anything to change.</p><p>\u201cSo? What\u2019d I miss?\u201d Rob leans forward and puts his hands on the table\u2014a little too hard, I think. Lindsay\u2019s Diet Coke jumps.</p><p>\u201cThe party at Kent\u2019s and how Sam doesn\u2019t want to go,\u201d Ally blurts out. Elody elbows her in the side and Ally yelps.</p><p>Rob swivels his head and looks at me. His face is completely expressionless. \u201cIs that what you wanted to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014well, kind of.\u201d I wasn\u2019t expecting him to mention the text, and it flusters me that I can\u2019t tell what he\u2019s thinking. His eyes look extra dark, almost cloudy. I try to smile at him, but I feel like my cheeks are all stuffed with cotton. I can\u2019t help but picture him swaying on his feet and holding up his hand and saying, \u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d He straightens up and shrugs. \u201cWhat, then?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay, Ally, and Elody are all staring at me. I can feel their eyes like they\u2019re emitting heat. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it here. I mean, not now.\u201d I tip my head in their direction.</p><p>Rob laughs: a short, harsh sound. And now I can tell he\u2019s mad and just hiding it.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He backs away, both hands raised like he\u2019s warding something off. \u201cHow \u2019bout this? You let me know when you\u2019re ready to talk. I\u2019ll wait to hear from you. I would never want to, you know, pressure you.\u201d He elongates some of the words, and I can hear the sarcasm in his voice\u2014just barely, but it\u2019s there.</p><p>It\u2019s obvious\u2014to me, at least\u2014that he\u2019s talking about way more than our having a talk, but before I can respond he gives a flourish with his hand, a kind of bow, and then turns around and walks away.</p><p>\u201cJeez.\u201d Ally pushes around the turkey sandwich on her plate. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really fighting, are you, Sam?\u201d Elody asks, eyes wide.</p><p>Before I have to answer Lindsay makes a kind of hissing noise and juts her chin up, gesturing behind me. \u201cPsychopath alert. Lock up the knives and babies.\u201d</p><p>Juliet Sykes has just walked into the cafeteria. I\u2019ve been so focused on today\u2014on fixing it, on the idea that I can fix it\u2014I\u2019ve totally forgotten about Juliet. But now I whip around, more curious about her than I\u2019ve ever been. I watch her drifting through the cafeteria. Her hair is down and concealing her face: fuzzy, soft hair, so white it reminds me of snow. That\u2019s what she looks like, actually\u2014like a snowflake being buffeted around in the wind, twisting and turning on currents of air. She doesn\u2019t even glance up in our direction, and I wonder if even now she\u2019s planning it, planning to follow us tonight and embarrass us in front of everybody. It doesn\u2019t seem like she would have it in her.</p><p>I\u2019m so focused on watching her that it takes me a second to realize Ally and Elody have just finished a round of Psycho killer, qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est and are now laughing hysterically. Lindsay\u2019s holding up her fingers, crossed, like she\u2019s warding off a curse, and she keeps repeating, \u201cOh, Lord, keep the darkness away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do you hate Juliet?\u201d I ask Lindsay. It\u2019s strange to me that I\u2019ve never thought of asking until recently. I always just accepted it.</p><p>Elody snorts and almost coughs up her Diet Coke. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s clearly not prepared for the question. She opens her mouth, closes it, and then tosses her hair and rolls her eyes like she can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even asking. \u201cI don\u2019t hate her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d It was Lindsay who found out that Juliet wasn\u2019t sent a single rose freshman year, and Lindsay\u2019s idea to send her a Valogram. It was Lindsay who nicknamed her Psycho, and who, all those years ago, spread the story of Juliet peeing on the Girl Scout camping trip.</p> <p>Lindsay stares at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind. \u201cSorry,\u201d she says, shrugging. \u201cNo breaks for mental-health patients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you feel bad for her or something,\u201d Elody says. \u201cYou know she should be locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBellevue.\u201d Ally giggles.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering,\u201d I say, stiffening when Ally says the B-word. There\u2019s still always the possibility that I\u2019ve gone totally, clinically cuckoo. But somehow I don\u2019t think so anymore. An article I once read said that crazy people don\u2019t worry about being crazy\u2014that\u2019s the whole problem.</p><p>\u201cSo are we really staying in tonight?\u201d Ally says, pouting. \u201cThe whole night?\u201d</p> <p>I suck in my breath and look at Lindsay. Ally and Elody look at her too. She has final say on all of our major decisions. If she\u2019s hell-bent on going to Kent\u2019s, I\u2019ll have a hard time getting out of it.</p><p>Lindsay leans back in her chair and stares at me. I see something flicker in her eyes, and my heart stops, thinking that she\u2019ll tell me to suck it up, that a party will do me good.</p><p>But instead she cracks a smile and winks at me. \u201cIt\u2019s just a party,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be lame anyways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can rent a scary movie,\u201d Elody pipes up. \u201cYou know, like we used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to Sam,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cWhatever she wants.\u201d</p><p>I could kiss her right then.</p> <p>I cut English with Lindsay again. We pass Alex and Anna in Hunan Kitchen, but today Lindsay doesn\u2019t even pause, probably because she\u2019s trying extra hard to be nice to me and she knows I hate confrontations.</p><p>I hesitate, though. I think of Bridget putting her arms around Alex and looking at him like he\u2019s the only guy on earth. She\u2019s annoying, okay, but she deserves way better than him. It\u2019s too bad.</p><p>\u201cHello? Stalk much?\u201d Lindsay says.</p><p>I realize I\u2019m just standing there staring past the ripped-up flyers advertising five-dollar lunch specials and local theater groups and hair salons. Alex Liment has spotted me through the window. He\u2019s staring straight back at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d It is too bad, but really, what can you do? Live and let live.</p><p>In The Country\u2019s Best Yogurt, Lindsay and I both get heaping cups of double chocolate with crushed peanut butter cups, and I add sprinkles and Cap\u2019n Crunch cereal. I have my appetite back, that\u2019s for sure. Everything is working out the way I planned it. There won\u2019t be any party tonight, at least not for us; there won\u2019t be any driving or cars. I\u2019m sure that this will fix everything\u2014that the kink in time will be ironed out, that I\u2019ll wake up from whatever nightmare I\u2019ve been living. Maybe I\u2019ll sit up, gasping, in a hospital bed somewhere, surrounded by friends and family. I can picture the scene perfectly: my mom and dad tearful, Izzy crying while she hangs on my neck, Lindsay and Ally and Elody and\u2014</p><p>An image of Kent flashes through my head and I push it away quickly.</p><p>\u2014And Rob. Of course Rob.</p> <p>But this is the key, I\u2019m sure of it. Live the day out. Follow the rules. Stay away from Kent\u2019s party. Simple.</p><p>\u201cCareful.\u201d Lindsay grins, shoveling a huge spoonful of yogurt into her mouth. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be fat and a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than fat with gonorrhea,\u201d I say, flicking a chocolate chip at her.</p><p>She flicks one back. \u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019m so clean you could eat off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lindsay buffet. Does Patrick know you\u2019re giving it up like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay is wrestling with her jumbo cup, trying to dig out the perfect bite. But we\u2019re both laughing, and she ends up lobbing a full spoonful of yogurt at me. It hits me right above the left eye.</p><p>She gasps and claps one hand over her mouth. The yogurt slides down my face and lands with a plop right on the fur covering my left boob.</p><p>\u201cI am so, so sorry,\u201d Lindsay says, her voice muffled by her hand. Her eyes are wide, and it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s trying not to laugh. \u201cDo you think your shirt is ruined?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I say, and dig out a big scoop of yogurt and flick it at her. It hits her in the side of her head, right in her hair.</p><p>She shrieks, \u201cBitch!\u201d and then we\u2019re ducking around the TCBY hiding behind chairs and tables, digging big scoops of double chocolate and using our spoons like catapults to peg each other.</p><p>YOU CAN\u2019T JUDGE A GYM TEACHER BY HIS HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE</p><p>Lindsay and I can\u2019t stop cracking up on the way back to school. It\u2019s hard to explain, but I\u2019m feeling happier than I have in years, like I\u2019m noticing everything for the first time: the sharp smell of winter, the light strange and slanted, the way the clouds are drawing over the sky slowly. The fur of our tank tops is completely matted and gross, and we have water stains everywhere. Cars keep honking at us, and we wave and blow them all kisses. A black Mercedes rolls by, and Lindsay bends over, smacks her butt, and screams, \u201cTen dollar! Ten dollar!\u201d</p><p>I punch her in the arm. \u201cThat could be my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to break it to you, but your dad does not drive a Mercedes.\u201d Lindsay pushes her hair out of her face. It\u2019s stringy and wet. We had to wash off in the bathroom as the woman at TCBY screamed at us and threatened to call the police if we ever stepped foot in the store again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou know you love me,\u201d she says, grabbing my arm and huddling up next to me. We\u2019re both freezing.</p><p>\u201cI do love you,\u201d I say, and I really mean it. I love her, I love the ugly mustard yellow bricks of Thomas Jefferson and the magenta-tinted halls. I love Ridgeview for being small and boring, and I love everyone and everything in it. I love my life. I want my life.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, babes.\u201d</p><p>When we get back to school Lindsay wants to have a cigarette, even though the bell for eighth is going to ring any second.</p><p>\u201cTwo drags,\u201d Lindsay says, widening her eyes, and I laugh and let her pull me along because she knows I can never say no to her when she makes that face. The Lounge is empty. We stand right next to the tennis courts, huddled together, while Lindsay tries to get a match lit.</p><p>Finally she does, and she takes a long drag, letting a plume of smoke out of her mouth.</p><p>A second later we hear a shout from across the parking lot: \u201cHey! You! With the cigarette!\u201d</p><p>We both freeze. Ms. Winters. Nic Nazi.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Lindsay screams after a split second, dropping her cigarette. She takes off behind the tennis courts even though I yell, \u201cOver here!\u201d I see the big blond pouf of Ms. Winters\u2019s hair bobbing over the cars\u2014I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s seen us or just heard us laughing. I duck behind a Range Rover and cut across Senior Alley to one of the back doors in the gym as Ms. Winters keeps screaming, \u201cHey! Hey!\u201d</p><p>I grab the handle and rattle it, but the door sticks. For a second my heart stops, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s locked, but then I slam up against it and it opens into a storage closet. I jump inside and close the door behind me, heart thumping in my chest. A minute later I hear feet pound past the door. Then I hear Ms. Winters mutter, \u201cShit,\u201d and the footsteps start retreating backward.</p><p>The whole thing\u2014the day, the fight in The Country\u2019s Best Yogurt, the almost-bust, the idea of Lindsay crouching somewhere in the woods in her skirt and new Steve Madden boots\u2014strikes me as so funny I have to clap my hand over my mouth to keep from laughing. The room I\u2019m standing in smells like soccer cleats and jerseys and mud, and with the stack of orange cones and bag full of basketballs piled in the corner, there\u2019s barely enough room for me to stand. One side of the room is windowed and it looks into an office: Otto\u2019s, probably, since he basically lives in the gym. I\u2019ve never actually seen his office. His desk is piled with papers, and there\u2019s a computer flashing a screen saver that looks like it\u2019s a cheesy picture of a beach. I inch closer to the window, thinking how hilarious it would be if I could bust him with something dirty, like some underwear peeking out of a desk drawer or a porn mag or something, when the door of his office swings open and there he is.</p><p>Instantly I drop to the ground. I have to scrunch up in a ball, and even then I\u2019m paranoid that my ponytail might be peeking up over the windowsill. It sounds stupid considering everything that\u2019s been happening, but all I can think in that moment is, If he sees me, I\u2019m really dead. Good-bye, Ally\u2019s house; hello, detention.</p><p>My face is sandwiched up next to a half-open duffel bag that looks like it\u2019s full of old basketball jerseys. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve never been washed or what, but the smell makes me want to gag.</p><p>I hear Otto moving around his desk, and I\u2019m praying\u2014praying\u2014that he doesn\u2019t come close enough to the desk to see me bellying up to a bunch of old sports equipment. I can already hear the rumors: Samantha Kingston found humping driver\u2019s ed cones.</p><p>There\u2019s a minute or two of shuffling, and my legs start cramping. The first bell has already rung for eighth\u2014less than three minutes to class\u2014but there\u2019s no way for me to sneak out. The door is noisy, and besides, I have no way to know which direction he\u2019s facing. He could be staring at the door.</p><p>My only hope is that Otto has class eighth, but it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s in a hustle to be anywhere. I imagine being trapped here until school ends. The stink alone will finish me off.</p><p>I hear Otto\u2019s door creak open again, and I perk up, thinking he\u2019s leaving after all. But then a second voice says, \u201cDamn. I missed them.\u201d</p><p>I would recognize that nasal whine anywhere. Ms. Winters.</p><p>\u201cSmokers?\u201d Otto says. His voice is almost as high-pitched as hers. I had no idea they even knew each other. The only times I\u2019ve ever seen them in the same room are at all-school assemblies, when Ms. Winters sits next to Principal Beneter looking like someone just set off a stink bomb directly under her chair, and Otto sits with the special ed teachers and the health instructor and the driver\u2019s ed specialist and all the other weirdos who are on faculty but aren\u2019t real teachers.</p><p>\u201cDo you know that the students call that little area the \u2018Smokers\u2019 Lounge\u2019?\u201d I can almost hear Ms. Winters pinching her nose.</p><p>\u201cDid you get a look at them?\u201d Otto asks, and my muscles tense.</p><p>\u201cNot a good one. I could hear them and I smelled the smoke.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lindsay\u2019s right: Ms. Winters is definitely half greyhound.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d Otto says.</p><p>\u201cThere must be two thousand cigarette butts out there,\u201d Ms. Winters says. \u201cYou\u2019d think with all the health videos we show them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re teenagers. They do the opposite of what you say. That\u2019s part of the deal. Pimples, pubic hair, and bad attitude.\u201d</p> <p>I almost lose it when Otto says pubic hair, and I think Ms. Winters will lecture him, but she only says, \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t know why I bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been one of those days, huh?\u201d Otto says, and there\u2019s the sound of someone bumping against a desk, and a book thudding to the ground. Ms. Winters actually giggles.</p><p>And then, I swear to God, I hear them kissing. Not little bird pecks either. Open-mouthed, slurpy, moaning kind of kissing.</p><p>Oh, shit. I literally have to bite my own hand to keep from screaming, or crying, or bursting out laughing, or getting sick\u2014or all of the above. This. Cannot. Be. Happening. I\u2019m desperate to take out my phone and text the girls, but I don\u2019t want to move. Now I really don\u2019t want to get caught, since Otto and the Nazi will think I\u2019ve been spying on their little sex party. Barf.</p><p>Just when I feel like I can\u2019t stand one more second squeezed up next to the sweaty jerseys, listening to Otto and Winters suck face like they\u2019re in some bad porno, the second bell rings. I am now officially late to eighth period.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God. I\u2019m supposed to be meeting with Beanie,\u201d Ms. Winters says. Beanie\u2019s the students\u2019 name for Mr. Beneter, the principal. Of all the shocking things that I\u2019ve heard in the past two minutes, the most shocking is that she knows the nickname\u2014and uses it.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here,\u201d Mr. Otto says, and then I swear\u2014I swear\u2014I hear him smack her butt.</p><p>Oh. My. God. This is better than the time Marcie Harris got caught masturbating in the science lab (with a test tube up her you-know-what, if you believe the rumors). This is better than the time Bryce Hanley got suspended for briefly running an online porn site. This is better than any scandal that\u2019s hit Thomas Jefferson so far.</p><p>\u201cDo you have class?\u201d Ms. Winters says, practically cooing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done for the day,\u201d Otto says. My heart sinks\u2014there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able to stay here for another forty-five minutes. Never mind the cramp snaking up my hamstrings and thighs: I\u2019ve got amazing gossip to spread. \u201cBut I have to set up for soccer tryouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, babe.\u201d Babe? \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEight o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>I hear the door open and I know Ms. Winters has left. Thank God. From the way they were pillow talking I was worried I was about to be treated to the symphony of another make-out session. I\u2019m not sure my hamstrings or my psyche could take it.</p><p>After a few seconds of moving around and tapping some things on the keyboard, I hear Otto go to the door. The room next to me goes dark. Then the door opens and closes, and I know I\u2019m in the clear.</p><p>I say a silent hallelujah and stand up. The pins and needles in my legs are so bad I nearly topple over, but I toddle over to the door and lean into it. When I make it outside I stand there stamping my feet and taking long, deep breaths of clean air. Finally I let it out: I throw my head back and laugh hysterically, cackling and snorting and not even caring if I look deranged.</p><p>Ms. Winters and Mr.-effing-Otto. Who would have guessed it in a million, trillion years?</p><p>As I head up from the gym it strikes me how strange people are. You can see them every day\u2014you can think you know them\u2014and then you find out you hardly know them at all. I feel exhilarated, kind of like I\u2019m being spun around a whirlpool, circling closer and closer around the same people and the same events but seeing things from different angles.</p><p>I\u2019m still giggling when I get to Main, even though Mr. Kummer will freak that I\u2019m late, and I still have to stop by my locker and pick up my Spanish textbook (he told us on the first day that we should treat our textbooks like children. Obviously, he doesn\u2019t have any). I\u2019m pressing Send on a text to Elody, Ally, and Lindsay\u2014u ll nvr believe what jst happnd\u2014when, bam! I run smack into Lauren Lornet.</p><p>Both of us stumble backward, and my phone flies out of my hand and skitters across the hall.</p> <p>\u201cShit!\u201d We collide so hard it takes me a second to recover my breath. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>I start toward my phone, wondering if I can ask her to pay if the screen\u2019s cracked or something, when she grabs my arm. Hard. \u201cWhat the...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them,\u201d she says wildly, pushing her face up to mine. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I try to pull away, but she grabs my other arm too, like she wants to shake me. Her face is red and splotchy and she has an all-over sticky look. It\u2019s obvious she\u2019s been crying.</p><p>\u201cTell them I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d She jerks her head back over her shoulder. We\u2019re standing directly in front of the main office, and I see her in that moment the way she was yesterday, hair hanging over her face, tearing down the hall.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I say, as gently as possible, because she\u2019s freaking me out. She probably has biweekly visits with the school psychologist to control her paranoia, or OCD, or whatever her issue is.</p><p>She takes a deep breath. Her voice is shaky. \u201cThey think I cheated off you in chem. Beanie called me in.... But I didn\u2019t. I swear to God I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been studying....\u201d</p><p>I jerk back, but she keeps her grip on my arms. The feeling of being caught in a whirlpool returns, but this time it\u2019s horrible: I\u2019m being pulled down, down, down, like there\u2019s a weight on me.</p><p>\u201cYou cheated off me?\u201d My words feel like they\u2019re coming from a distance. I don\u2019t even sound like myself.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, I swear to God I\u2014\u201d Lauren gives a shuddering sob. \u201cHe\u2019ll fail me. He said he would fail me if my grades didn\u2019t get better, and I got a tutor and now they think I\u2014he said he\u2019d call Penn State. I\u2019ll never go to college and I\u2014you don\u2019t understand. My dad will kill me. He\u2019ll kill me.\u201d She really does shake me then. Her eyes are full of panic. \u201cYou have to tell them.\u201d</p><p>I finally manage to wrench away. I feel hot and sick. I don\u2019t want to know this, don\u2019t want to know any of it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you,\u201d I say, backing away, still feeling like I\u2019m not actually saying the words, just hearing them spoken aloud from somewhere.</p><p>Lauren looks like I\u2019ve just slapped her. \u201cWhat? What do you mean you can\u2019t help? Just tell them\u2014\u201d</p><p>My hands are shaking as I go to pick up my phone. It slips out of my grasp twice and lands back on the floor both times with a clatter. It\u2019s not supposed to be like this. I feel like someone\u2019s pressed the Reverse button on a vacuum cleaner and all of the junk I\u2019ve done is spewing back onto the carpet for me to see.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t break my phone,\u201d I say, feeling numb. \u201cThis cost me two hundred dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you even listening to me?\u201d Lauren\u2019s voice is rising hysterically. I can\u2019t bring myself to meet her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m screwed, I\u2019m finished\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you,\u201d I say again. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t remember any other words.</p><p>Lauren lets out something that\u2019s halfway between a scream and a sob. \u201cYou said I shouldn\u2019t be nice to you today. You know what? You were right. You\u2019re awful, you\u2019re a bitch, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly it\u2019s like she remembers where we are: who she is, and who I am. She claps her hand over her mouth so quickly it makes a hollow, echoing sound in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d Now her voice comes out as a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even answer. Those words\u2014you\u2019re a bitch\u2014make my whole body go cold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2014please don\u2019t be mad.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stand it\u2014can\u2019t stand to hear her apologize to me. And before I know it I\u2019m running\u2014full-out running down the hall, my heart pounding, feeling like I need to scream or cry or smash my fist into something. She calls after me, but I don\u2019t know what it is, I don\u2019t care, I can\u2019t know, and when I push into the girls\u2019 bathroom, I throw my back against the door and sink down against it until my knees are pressed into my chest, my throat squeezed up so tight it hurts to breathe. My phone keeps buzzing, and once I\u2019ve calmed down a bit, I flip it open and find texts from Lindsay, Ally, and Elody: What? Dish. Spill. Did u make up w Rob?</p><p>I throw my phone into my bag and rest my head in my hands, waiting for my pulse to return to normal. All of the happiness I felt earlier is gone. Even the Otto and Winters situation doesn\u2019t seem funny anymore. Bridget and Alex and Anna and Sarah Grundel and her stupid parking space and Lauren Lornet and the chem test\u2014it feels like I\u2019ve been caught up in some enormous web and every way I turn I see that I\u2019m stuck to someone else, all of us wriggling around in the same net. And I don\u2019t want to know any of it. It\u2019s not my problem. I don\u2019t care.</p><p>You\u2019re a bitch.</p><p>I don\u2019t care. I have bigger things to worry about.</p><p>Finally I stand up. I\u2019ve given up on going to Spanish. Instead I splash cold water on my face and then reapply my makeup. My face is so pale under the harsh fluorescent lights, I hardly recognize it.</p><p>ONLY THE DREAM</p><p>\u201cCome on, cheer up.\u201d Lindsay whacks me on the head with a pillow. We\u2019re sitting on the couch in Ally\u2019s den.</p><p>Elody pops the last spicy tuna roll into her mouth, which I\u2019m not sure is such a great idea, as it\u2019s now been perched on an ottoman for the past three hours. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sammy. Rob\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>All of them think Rob\u2019s the reason I\u2019m quiet. But of course, it isn\u2019t. I\u2019m quiet because as soon as the clock inched its way past twelve, the fear crept back in. It\u2019s been filling me slowly, like sand running through an hourglass. With every second I\u2019m getting closer and closer to the Moment. Ground zero. This morning I was certain that it was simple\u2014that all I had to do was stay away from the party, stay away from the car. That time would lurch back on track. That I would be saved.</p><p>But now my heart feels like it\u2019s being squashed between my ribs, and it gets harder and harder to breathe. I\u2019m terrified that in one second\u2014in the space between a breath\u2014everything will evaporate into darkness, and I\u2019ll once again find myself alone in my bedroom at home, waking up to the screaming of the alarm. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if that happens. I think my heart will break. I think my heart will stop.</p><p>Ally switches off the television and throws down the remote. \u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me consult the spirits.\u201d Elody slides off the couch and onto the floor, where earlier we\u2019d set up a dusty Ouija board for old time\u2019s sake. We tried to play, but everyone was obviously pushing, and the indicator kept zipping onto words like penis and choad, until Lindsay started screaming \u201cPerv spirits! Child molesters!\u201d into the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elody shoves the indicator with two fingers. It spins once before settling over the word YES.</p><p>\u201cLook, Ma.\u201d She holds up her hands. \u201cNo hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a yes or no question, doofus.\u201d Lindsay rolls her eyes and takes a big sip of the Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape we swiped from the wine cellar.</p><p>\u201cThis town sucks,\u201d Ally says. \u201cNothing ever happens.\u201d</p> <p>Twelve thirty-three. Twelve thirty-four. I\u2019ve never seen seconds and minutes rush by so fast, tumble over one another. Twelve thirty-five. Twelve thirty-six.</p><p>\u201cWe need music or something,\u201d Lindsay says, jumping up. \u201cWe can\u2019t just sit around here like bums.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely music,\u201d Elody says. She and Lindsay run into the next room, where the Bose sound dock is.</p><p>\u201cNo music.\u201d I groan, but it\u2019s too late. Beyonc\u00e9 is already blasting. The vases begin to rattle on the bookshelves. My head feels like it\u2019s going to explode, and chills are running up and down my body. Twelve thirty-seven. I nestle deeper into the couch, drawing a blanket up over my knees, and cover my ears.</p><p>Lindsay and Elody march back into the room. We\u2019re all in old boxer shorts and tank tops. Lindsay\u2019s obviously just raided Ally\u2019s mudroom because she and Elody are now also decked out in ski goggles and fleece hats. Elody\u2019s hobbling along with one foot jammed in a child\u2019s snowshoe.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Ally screams. She holds her stomach and doubles over, laughing.</p><p>Lindsay gyrates with a ski pole between her legs, rocking back and forth. \u201cOh, Patrick! Patrick!\u201d</p><p>The music is so loud I can barely hear her, even when I take my hands off my ears. Twelve thirty-eight. One minute.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Elody shouts, extending her hand to me. I\u2019m so full of fear I can\u2019t move, can\u2019t even shake my head, and she leans forward and yells, \u201cLive a little!\u201d</p><p>So many thoughts and words are tumbling through my head. I want to yell, No, stop or Yes, live, but all I can do is squeeze my eyes shut and picture seconds running like water into an infinite pool, and I imagine all of us hurtling through time and I think, Now, now, it\u2019s going to happen now\u2014</p><p>And then everything goes silent.</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid to open my eyes. A deep emptiness opens up inside me. I feel nothing. This is what it\u2019s like to be dead.</p><p>Then a voice: \u201cToo loud. You\u2019ll blow out your eardrums before you\u2019re twenty.\u201d</p><p>I snap open my eyes. Mrs. Harris, Ally\u2019s mom, is standing in the doorway in a glistening raincoat, smoothing down her hair. And Lindsay\u2019s standing there in her ski goggles and hat, and Elody\u2019s awkwardly trying to pry her foot out of the snowshoe.</p><p>I made it. It worked. Relief and joy flood me with so much force I almost cry out.</p><p>But instead, I laugh. I burst out laughing in the silence, and Ally gives me a dirty look, like, Now you decide it\u2019s funny?</p><p>\u201cAre you girls drunk?\u201d Ally\u2019s mother stares at each of us in turn and then frowns at the nearly empty bottle of wine on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Ally throws herself on the couch. \u201cYou killed the buzz.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay flips the goggles onto her head. \u201cWe were having a dance party, Mrs. Harris,\u201d she says brightly, as if dancing around half naked and decked out in winter sports equipment was a Girl Scouts\u2013mandated activity.</p> <p>Mrs. Harris sighs. \u201cNot anymore. It\u2019s been a long day. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoooom,\u201d Ally whines.</p><p>Mrs. Harris shoots her a look. \u201cNo more music.\u201d</p><p>Elody finally wrenches her foot free and stumbles backward, collapsing against one of the bookshelves. Martha Stewart\u2019s Homekeeping Handbook comes flying out and lands at her feet. \u201cOops.\u201d She turns bright red and looks at Mrs. Harris like she expects to be spanked any minute.</p><p>I can\u2019t help it. I start giggling again.</p><p>Mrs. Harris rolls her eyes to the ceiling and shakes her head. \u201cGood night, girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice going.\u201d Ally leans over and pinches my thigh.</p><p>\u201cRetard.\u201d</p><p>Elody starts giggling and imitates Lindsay\u2019s voice. \u201cWe were having a dance party, Mrs. Harris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I didn\u2019t fall into a bookshelf.\u201d Lindsay bends over and wiggles her butt at us. \u201cKiss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d Elody dives for her, pretending like she\u2019s going to. Lindsay shrieks and dodges her. Ally hisses, \u201cShhhh!\u201d right as we hear Mrs. Harris yell, \u201cGirls!\u201d from upstairs. Pretty soon they\u2019re all laughing. It feels great to laugh with them.</p><p>I\u2019m back.</p><p>An hour later Lindsay, Elody, and I are settled on the L-shaped couch. Elody has the top bit, and Lindsay and I are lying end-to-end. My feet are pressed against Lindsay\u2019s, and she keeps wiggling her toes to annoy me. But nothing can annoy me right now. Ally has dragged in her air mattress and her blankets from upstairs (she insists she can\u2019t sleep without her Society comforter). It\u2019s just like freshman year. We\u2019ve put the television on low because Elody likes the sound, and in the dark room the glow of the screen reminds me of summers spent breaking into the pool club to go night-swimming, of the way the light shines up through all that black water, of stillness and feeling like you\u2019re the only person alive in the whole world.</p><p>\u201cYou guys?\u201d I whisper. I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s still awake.</p><p>\u201cMmmf,\u201d Lindsay grunts.</p><p>I close my eyes, letting the feeling of peace sweep over me, fill me from head to toe. \u201cIf you had to relive one day over and over, which one would you pick?\u201d</p><p>Nobody answers me, and in a little while I hear Ally start snoring into her pillow. They\u2019re all asleep. I\u2019m not tired yet. I\u2019m still too exhilarated to be here, to be safe, to have broken out of whatever bubble of time and space has been confining me. But I close my eyes anyway and try to imagine what kind of day I would choose. Memories speed by\u2014dozens and dozens of parties, shopping trips with Lindsay, pigging out at sleepovers and crying over The Notebook with Elody, and even before that, family vacations and my eighth birthday party and the first time I ever dove off the high board at the pool and the water fizzed up my nose and left me dizzy\u2014but all of them seem imperfect somehow, spotted and shadowy.</p><p>On a perfect day there wouldn\u2019t be any school, that\u2019s for sure. And there would be pancakes for breakfast\u2014my mom\u2019s pancakes. And my dad would make his famous fried eggs, and Izzy would set the table like she sometimes does at holidays, with different mismatched plates and fruit and flowers that she gathers from around the house and dumps in the middle of the table and calls a \u201cthenterpeeth.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and feel myself letting go, like tipping over the edge of an abyss, darkness rising up to carry me away....</p><p>Bringbringbring.</p><p>I\u2019m pulled back from the edge of sleep and for one horrible second I think: it\u2019s my alarm, I\u2019m home, it\u2019s happening again. I strike out, a spasm, and Lindsay yelps, \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>The sound of that one word makes my heart go still and my breathing return to normal.</p><p>Bringbringbring. Now that I\u2019m fully alert I realize it\u2019s not my alarm. It\u2019s the telephone, ringing shrilly in various rooms, creating a weird echo effect. I check the clock. One fifty-two.</p><p>Elody groans. Ally rolls over and murmurs, \u201cTurn it off.\u201d The telephone stops ringing and then starts again, and all of a sudden Ally sits up, straight as a rod, totally awake.</p><p>She says, \u201cShit. Shit. My mom\u2019s gonna kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it stop, Al,\u201d Lindsay says, from underneath her pillow.</p><p>Ally tries to untangle herself from her sheets, still muttering, \u201cShit. Where\u2019s the freaking phone?\u201d She trips and ends up stumbling out of bed and hitting the ground with her shoulder. Elody moans again, this time louder.</p><p>Lindsay says, \u201cI\u2019m trying to sleep, people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the phone,\u201d Ally hisses back.</p><p>It\u2019s too late, anyway. I hear footsteps moving upstairs. Mrs. Harris has obviously woken up. A second later the phone stops ringing.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Lindsay rustles around, burrowing farther under her covers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost two.\u201d Ally stands up\u2014I can see the vague outline of her form hobbling back over to the bed. \u201cWho the hell calls at two in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s Matt Wilde, confessing his love,\u201d Lindsay says.</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d Ally says. She settles back in bed and we all get quiet. I can just hear the low murmur of Mrs. Harris\u2019s voice above us, the creaking of her footsteps as she paces. Then I very distinctly hear her say: \u201cOh, no. Oh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlly\u2014\u201d I start.</p><p>But she\u2019s heard it too. She gets up and turns on the light, then switches off the television, which is still on low. The sudden brightness makes me wince. Lindsay curses and pulls the covers over her head.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d Ally hugs herself, blinking rapidly. Elody reaches for her glasses, then props herself up on two elbows. Eventually Lindsay realizes the light\u2019s not going off and she emerges from under her cocoon.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d She balls her hands into fists, rubbing her eyes.</p><p>No one answers. We all have a growing sense of it now: something is very wrong. Ally\u2019s just standing there in the middle of the room. In her oversized T-shirt and baggy shorts she looks much younger than she is.</p><p>At a certain point the voice upstairs stops, and the footsteps move diagonally across the floor, in the direction of the stairs. Ally moves back to the air mattress, folding her legs underneath her and biting her nails.</p><p>Mrs. Harris doesn\u2019t seem surprised to find us sitting up, waiting for her. She\u2019s wearing a long silk nightgown and has an eye mask perched on top of her head. I\u2019ve never seen Mrs. Harris looking less than perfect and it makes fear yawn open in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ally\u2019s voice is semihysterical. \u201cWhat happened? Is it Dad?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Harris blinks and seems to focus on us like she\u2019s just been called out of a dream. \u201cNo, no. It\u2019s not your father.\u201d She takes a breath, then blows it out loudly. \u201cListen, girls. What I\u2019m about to tell you is very upsetting. I\u2019m only telling you in the first place because you\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell us, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Harris nods slowly. \u201cYou all know Juliet Sykes.\u201d</p><p>This is a shock: we all look at one another, completely bewildered. Of all the words that Mrs. Harris could have said at this moment, I\u2019m pretty sure \u201cYou all know Juliet Sykes\u201d ranks pretty high on our list of the unexpected.</p><p>\u201cYeah. So?\u201d Ally shrugs.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2014\u201d Mrs. Harris breaks off, smoothing down her nightgown with her hands, and starts again. \u201cThat was Mindy Sachs on the phone.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay raises her eyebrows, and Ally gives a knowing sigh. We all know Mindy Sachs too. She\u2019s fifty and divorced but still dresses and acts like a sophomore. She\u2019s more gossip-obsessed than anybody at our school. Whenever I see Ms. Sachs I\u2019m reminded of the game we used to play when we were kids, where one person whispers a secret and the next person repeats it and so on and so on, except in Ridgeview Ms. Sachs is the only one doing the whispering. She and Mrs. Harris sit on the school board together, so Mrs. Harris always knows about divorces and who just lost all their money and who\u2019s having an affair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMindy lives just next to the Sykes\u2019,\u201d Mrs. Harris continues. \u201cApparently their street has been swarming with ambulances for the past half hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Ally says, and maybe it\u2019s the hour or the stress of the past few days, but I\u2019m not getting it either.</p><p>Mrs. Harris has her arms folded across her chest and she hugs herself a little, like she\u2019s cold. \u201cJuliet Sykes is dead. She killed herself tonight.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Total silence. Ally stops chewing on her nails, and Lindsay sits as still as I\u2019ve ever seen her. I really think for several seconds my heart stops beating. I feel a strange tunneling sensation, like I\u2019ve been parachuted out of my body and am now just looking at it from far away, like for a few moments we\u2019re all just pictures of ourselves.</p> <p>I\u2019m suddenly reminded of a story my parents once told me: back when Thomas Jefferson was called Suicide High, some guy hanged himself inside his own closet, right there among the mothball-smelling sweaters and old sneakers and everything. He was a loser and played in the band and had bad skin and next to no friends. So nobody thought anything of it when he died. I mean, people were sad and everything, but they got it.</p><p>But the next year\u2014the next year to the day\u2014one of the most popular guys in school killed himself in the exact same way. Everything was the same: method, time, place. Except this guy was captain of the swim team and the soccer team, and apparently when the police went into the closet, there were so many old athletic trophies on the shelves it looked like he\u2019d been entombed in a gold vault. He left only a one-line note: We are all Hangmen.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Elody asks, barely a whisper.</p><p>Mrs. Harris shakes her head, and for a second I think she might cry. \u201cMindy heard the gunshot. She thought it was a firecracker. She thought it was a prank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe shot herself?\u201d Ally says it quietly, almost reverentially, and I know we\u2019re all thinking the same thing: that\u2019s the worst way of any.</p> <p>\u201cHow are they...\u201d Elody adjusts her glasses and licks her lips. \u201cDo they know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no note,\u201d Mrs. Harris says, and I swear I can hear something go around the room: a tiny exhalation. A breath of relief. \u201cI just thought you should know.\u201d She goes to Ally and bends over, kissing her forehead. Ally pulls away, maybe in surprise. I\u2019ve never seen Mrs. Harris kiss Ally before. I\u2019ve never seen Mrs. Harris look so much like a mother before.</p><p>After Mrs. Harris leaves we all sit there while the silence stretches out and expands in huge rings around us. I feel like we\u2019re all waiting for something, but I\u2019m not sure what. Finally Elody speaks.</p><p>\u201cDo you think...\u201d Elody swallows, looking back and forth from one to the other of us. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s because of our rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d Lindsay snaps. I can tell she\u2019s upset, though. Her face is pale, and she twists and untwists the edge of her blanket. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it was the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes it even worse,\u201d Ally says.</p> <p>\u201cAt least we knew who she was.\u201d Lindsay catches me staring at her hands, and she places them firmly in her lap. \u201cMost people just acted like she was invisible.\u201d</p><p>Ally bites her lip.</p><p>\u201cStill, on her last day...\u201d Elody trails off.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s better off this way,\u201d Lindsay says. This is low, even for her, and we all stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She lifts her chin and stares back at us defiantly. \u201cYou know you\u2019re all thinking it. She was miserable. She escaped. Done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014I mean, things could have gotten better,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Lindsay says.</p><p>Ally shakes her head and draws her knees to her chest. \u201cGod, Lindsay.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m in shock. The weirdest part of it all is the gun. It seems so harsh, so loud, so physical a way to do it. Blood and brains and searing heat. If she had to do it\u2014to die\u2014she should have drowned, should have just walked into the water until it folded over her head. Or she should have jumped. I picture Juliet floating this way and that, like she\u2019s being supported by currents of air. I can imagine her spreading her arms and leaping off a bridge or a canyon somewhere, but in my head she starts soaring upward on the wind as soon as her feet leave the ground.</p><p>Not a gun. Guns are for cop dramas and 7-Eleven holdups and crack addicts and gang fights. Not for Juliet Sykes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have been nicer to her,\u201d Elody says. She looks down like she\u2019s embarrassed to say it.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Lindsay\u2019s voice is loud and hard in comparison. \u201cYou can\u2019t be mean to someone forever and then feel bad when she dies.\u201d</p><p>Elody lifts her head and stares at Lindsay. \u201cBut I do feel bad.\u201d Her voice is getting stronger.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re a hypocrite,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s worse than anything.\u201d</p><p>She gets up and shuts off the light. I hear her climb back on the couch and rustle around in the blankets, settling in.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d she says, \u201cI have sleep to catch up on.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s total silence for a while. I\u2019m not sure if Ally\u2019s lying down or not, but as my eyes adjust to the darkness I see that she isn\u2019t: she\u2019s still sitting there with her knees drawn up to her chest, staring straight ahead.</p><p>After a minute she says, \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep upstairs.\u201d She gathers up her sheets and blankets, making extra noise, probably to get back at Lindsay.</p><p>A moment later Elody says, \u201cI\u2019m going with her. The couch is too lumpy.\u201d She\u2019s obviously upset too. We\u2019ve been sleeping on this couch for years.</p><p>After she leaves I sit for a while listening to Lindsay breathe. I wonder if she\u2019s sleeping. I don\u2019t see how she could be. I feel as awake as I\u2019ve ever been. Then again, Lindsay\u2019s always been different from most people, less sensitive, more black-and-white. My team, your team. This side of the line, that side of the line. Fearless, and careless. I\u2019ve always admired her for that\u2014we all have.</p><p>I feel restless, like I need to know the answers to questions I\u2019m not sure how to ask. I ease off the couch slowly, trying not to wake Lindsay, but it turns out she\u2019s not sleeping after all. She rolls over, and in the dark I can just make out her pale skin and the deep hollows of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going upstairs, are you?\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cBathroom,\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>I feel my way out into the hallway and pause there. Somewhere a clock is ticking, but other than that it\u2019s totally silent. Everything is dark and the stone floor is cold under my feet. I run one hand along the wall to orient myself. The sound of the rain has stopped. When I look outside I see the rain has turned to snow, thousands of snowflakes melting down the latticed windows and making the moonlight that comes through the panes look watery and full of movement, shadows twisting and blurring on the floor, alive. There\u2019s a bathroom here, but that\u2019s not where I\u2019m headed. I ease open the door that leads to Ally\u2019s basement and grope my way down the stairs, holding on to both banisters.</p><p>As soon as my feet hit the carpet at the bottom of the stairs, I fumble on the wall to my left, eventually finding the light switch. The basement is suddenly revealed, big and stark and normal-looking: beige leather couches, an old Ping-Pong table, another flat-screen TV, and a circular area with a treadmill, an elliptical machine, and a three-sided mirror at its center. It\u2019s cooler here and smells like chemicals and new paint.</p><p>Just beyond the exercise area is another door, which leads into the room we\u2019ve always referred to as the Altar of Allison Harris. The room is papered with Ally\u2019s old drawings, none of them good, most dating back to elementary school. The bookshelves are crowded with pictures of her: Ally dressed up like an octopus for Halloween in first grade, Ally wearing a green velvet dress and smiling in front of an enormous Christmas tree absolutely collapsing with ornaments, Ally squinting in a bikini, Ally laughing, Ally frowning, Ally looking pensive. And on the lowest shelf, every single one of Ally\u2019s old yearbooks, from kindergarten on. Ally once showed us how Mrs. Harris had gone through all the books, one by one, placing colored sticky tabs on each one of Ally\u2019s friends from year to year. (\u201cSo you can remember how popular you always were,\u201d Mrs. Harris had told her.)</p><p>I drop to my knees. I\u2019m not sure exactly what I\u2019m looking for, but there\u2019s an idea taking shape in my head, some old memory that disappears whenever I will it to take form, like those Magic Eye games where you can only see the hidden shape when your eyes aren\u2019t in focus.</p><p>I start with the first-grade yearbook. I open it directly to Mr. Christensen\u2019s class\u2014just my luck\u2014and there I am, standing a little ways apart from the group. The flash reflected in my glasses makes it impossible to see my eyes. My smile is closer to a wince, as though the effort hurts. I flip past the picture quickly. I hate looking through old yearbooks; they don\u2019t exactly bring back a flood of positive memories. Mine are stashed somewhere in the attic, with all the other crap my mom insists I keep \u201cbecause you might want it later,\u201d like my old dolls and a ratty stuffed lamb I used to carry with me everywhere.</p><p>Two pages later I find what I\u2019m looking for: Mrs. Novak\u2019s first-grade class. And there Lindsay is, front and center as always, beaming a big smile at the camera. Next to her is a thin, pretty girl with a shy smile and hair so blond it could be white. She and Lindsay are standing so close together their arms are touching all the way from their elbows to their fingertips.</p><p>Juliet Sykes.</p><p>In the second-grade yearbook, Lindsay is kneeling in the front row of her class. Again, Juliet Sykes is next to her.</p><p>In the third-grade yearbook, Juliet and Lindsay are separated by several pages. Lindsay was in Ms. Derner\u2019s class (with me\u2014that was the year she invented the joke: \u201cWhat\u2019s red and white and weird all over?\u201d). Juliet was in Dr. Kuzma\u2019s class. Different pages, different classes, different poses\u2014Lindsay has her hands clasped in front of her; Juliet is standing with her body angled slightly to the side\u2014and yet they look exactly the same, wearing identical powder blue Petit Bateau T-shirts and matching white capri pants, which cut off just below the knee; their hair, blond and shining, parted neatly down the middle; the glint of a small silver chain around both of their necks. That was the year it was cool to dress up like your friends\u2014your best friends.</p><p>I pick up the fourth-grade yearbook next, my fingers heavy and numb, cold running through me. There\u2019s a big Technicolor portrait of the school on its cover, all neon pinks and reds, probably painted by an art teacher. It takes me a while to find Lindsay\u2019s class, but as soon as I do my heart starts racing. There she is with that same huge smile, like she\u2019s daring the camera to catch her looking less-than-perfect. And next to her is Juliet Sykes. Pretty, happy Juliet Sykes, smiling like she has a secret. I squint, focusing on a tiny blurred spot between them, and think I can just make out that their index fingers are linked together loosely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fifth grade. I find Lindsay easily, standing front and center in Mrs. Krakow\u2019s classroom, smiling so widely it looks like she\u2019s baring her teeth. It takes me longer to find Juliet. I go through all the photographs looking for her and have to start over from the beginning before I spot her, far up in the right-hand corner, sandwiched between Lauren Lornet and Eileen Cho, shrinking backward like she wants to suck herself out of the frame altogether. Her hair hangs in front of her face like a curtain. Next to her, both Lauren and Eileen are angled slightly away, as though they don\u2019t want to be associated with her, as though she has some contagious disease.</p><p>Fifth grade: the year of the Girl Scout trip, when she peed in her sleeping bag and Lindsay nicknamed her Mellow Yellow.</p><p>I put the yearbooks back carefully, making sure to order them correctly. My heart is thumping wildly, an out-of-control drum rhythm. I suddenly want to get out of the basement as quickly as possible. I shut off the lights and feel my way up the stairs blindly. The darkness seems to swirl with shapes and shadows, and terror rises in my throat. I\u2019m sure that if I turn around I\u2019ll see her, all in white, stumbling with her hands outstretched, reaching for me, face bloody and broken apart.</p><p>And then I\u2019m upstairs and there she is: a vision, a nightmare. Her face is completely in shadow\u2014a hole\u2014but I can tell she\u2019s staring at me. The room tilts; I grab on to the wall to keep myself steady.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d Lindsay steps farther into the hall, the moonlight falling differently so that her features emerge. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I bring my hand to my chest, trying to press my heart back to its normal rhythm. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing down there?\u201d Her hair is messed up, and in her white boxers and tank top she could be a ghost.</p><p>\u201cYou were friends with her,\u201d I say. It pops out like an accusation. \u201cYou were friends with her for years.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what answer I\u2019m expecting, but she looks away and then looks back at me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not our fault,\u201d she says, like she\u2019s daring me to contradict her. \u201cShe\u2019s totally wacked. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. But I get the feeling she\u2019s not even talking to me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I heard her dad\u2019s, like, an alcoholic,\u201d Lindsay presses on, her voice suddenly quick, urgent. \u201cHer whole family\u2019s wacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. For a minute we just stand there in silence. My body feels heavy, useless, the way it sometimes does in nightmares when you have to run but you can\u2019t. After a while something occurs to me and I say, \u201cWas.\u201d</p><p>Even though we\u2019ve been standing in silence, Lindsay inhales sharply, as though I\u2019ve interrupted her in the middle of a long speech. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was wacked,\u201d I say. \u201cShe\u2019s not anything anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Lindsay doesn\u2019t respond. I go past her into the dark hallway and find my way to the couch. I settle in under the blankets, and a little while later she comes in and joins me.</p><p>Lying there, convinced I won\u2019t be able to sleep, I remember the time in the middle of junior year when Lindsay and I snuck out on a random weeknight\u2014a Tuesday or a Thursday\u2014and drove around because there was nothing else to do. At some point she pulled over abruptly on Fallow Ridge Road and cut the headlights, waiting until another car began to squeeze its way toward us on the single-lane road. Then she roared the engine and blazed the lights to life and began careening straight toward it. I was screaming at the top of my lungs, the headlights growing huge as suns, certain we were going to die, and she was gripping the steering wheel and calling out over my screams, \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014they always swerve first.\u201d She was right, too. At the last second the other car jerked abruptly into the ditch.</p><p>That\u2019s what I remember just before the dream pulls me under.</p><p>In my dream I am falling through darkness.</p><p>In my dream I fall forever.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>Even before I\u2019m awake, the alarm clock is in my hand, and I break from sleep completely at the same moment I hurl the clock against the wall. It lets out a final wail before shattering.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Lindsay says, when I slide into the car fifteen minutes later. \u201cIs there a job opening in the red-light district I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust drive.\u201d I can barely look at her. Anger is seething through me like liquid. She\u2019s a fraud: the whole world is a fraud, one bright, shiny scam. And somehow I\u2019m the one paying for it. I\u2019m the one who died. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s trapped.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing: it shouldn\u2019t be me. Lindsay\u2019s the one who drives like she\u2019s in the real-life version of Grand Theft Auto. Lindsay\u2019s the one who\u2019s always thinking of ways to punk people or humiliate them, who\u2019s always criticizing everybody. Lindsay\u2019s the one who lied about being friends with Juliet Sykes and then tortured her all those years. I didn\u2019t do anything; I just followed along.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna freeze, you know.\u201d Lindsay chucks her cigarette and rolls up the window.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d I flip down the mirror to make sure that my lipstick hasn\u2019t smeared. I\u2019ve folded my skirt over a couple of times so it barely covers my ass when I sit down, and I\u2019m wearing five-inch platforms that I bought with Ally as a joke at a store that we\u2019re pretty sure only caters to strippers. I\u2019ve kept the fur-trimmed tank top, but I\u2019ve added a rhinestone necklace, again purchased as a joke one Halloween when we all dressed up as Naughty Nurses. It says SLUT in big, sparkly script.</p><p>I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m in the mood to get looked at. I feel like I could do anything right now: punch somebody in the face, rob a bank, get drunk and do something stupid. That\u2019s the only benefit to being dead. No consequences.</p><p>Lindsay misses my sarcasm, or ignores it. \u201cI\u2019m surprised your parents even let you out of the house like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t.\u201d Another thing making my mood foul is the ten-minute screaming match I had with my mother before storming out of the house. Even when Izzy went to hide in her room and my father threatened to ground me for life (Ha!), the words kept coming. It felt so good to scream, like when you pick a scab and the blood starts flowing again.</p><p>You are not walking out that door unless you go upstairs and put on some more clothing. That\u2019s what my mom said. You\u2019ll catch pneumonia. More important, I don\u2019t want people in school getting the wrong impression about you.</p><p>And suddenly it had all snapped inside of me, broken and snapped. \u201cYou care now?\u201d She jerked back at the sound of my voice like I\u2019d reached out and slapped her. \u201cYou want to help now? You want to protect me now?\u201d</p><p>What I really wanted to say was, Where were you four days ago? Where were you when my car was spinning off the edge of a road in the middle of the night? Why weren\u2019t you thinking of me? Why weren\u2019t you there? I hate both of my parents right now: for sitting quietly in our house, while out in the darkness my heart was beating away all of the seconds of my life, ticking them off one by one until my time was up; for letting the thread between us stretch so far and so thin that the moment it was severed for good they didn\u2019t even feel it.</p><p>At the same time I know that it\u2019s not really their fault, at least not completely. I did my part too. I did it on a hundred different days and in a thousand different ways, and I know it. But this makes the anger worse, not better.</p><p>Your parents are supposed to keep you safe.</p><p>\u201cJesus, what\u2019s your problem?\u201d Lindsay looks at me hard for a second. \u201cYou wake up on the wrong side of the bed or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a few days now, yeah.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m getting really sick of this low half-light, the sky a pale and sickly blue\u2014not even a real blue\u2014and the sun a wet mess on the horizon. I read once that starving people start fantasizing about food, just lying there dreaming for hours about hot mashed potatoes and creamy blobs of butter and steak running red blood over their plates. Now I get it. I\u2019m starved for different light, a different sun, different sky. I\u2019ve never really thought about it before, but it\u2019s a miracle how many kinds of light there are in the world, how many skies: the pale brightness of spring, when it feels like the whole world is blushing; the lush, bright boldness of a July noon; purple storm skies and a green queasiness just before lightning strikes and crazy multicolored sunsets that look like someone\u2019s acid trip.</p><p>I should have enjoyed them more, should have memorized them all. I should have died on a day with a beautiful sunset. I should have died on summer vacation or winter break. I should have died on any other day. Leaning my forehead against the window, I fantasize about sending my fist up through the glass, all the way into the sky, and watching it shatter like a mirror.</p><p>I think about what I\u2019ll do to survive all of the millions and millions of days that will be exactly like this one, two face-to-face mirrors multiplying a reflection into infinity. I start formulating a plan: I\u2019ll stop coming to school, and I\u2019ll jack somebody\u2019s car and drive as far as I can in a different direction every day. East, west, north, south. I allow myself to fantasize about going so far and so fast that I lift off like an airplane, zooming straight up and out to a place where time falls away like sand being blown off a surface by the wind.</p><p>Remember what I said about hope?</p><p>\u201cHappy Cupid Day!\u201d Elody singsongs when she gets into the Tank.</p><p>Lindsay stares from Elody back to me. \u201cWhat is this? Some kind of competition for Least Dressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you got it, flaunt it.\u201d Elody eyes my skirt as she leans forward to grab her coffee. \u201cForget your pants, Sam?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay snickers. I say, \u201cJealous much?\u201d without turning away from the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Elody leans back.</p><p>\u201cSomeone forgot to take her happy pills this morning.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye I see Lindsay look back at Elody and make a face like, Leave it. Like I\u2019m a kid who needs to be handled. I think of those old photos where she\u2019s standing pressed arm-to-arm with Juliet Sykes, and then I think of Juliet\u2019s head blown open and splattered on some basement wall. Again the fury returns, and it\u2019s all I can do to keep from turning to her and screaming that she\u2019s a fake, a liar, that I can see right through her.</p><p>I see right through you.... My heart flips when I remember Kent\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI know something that\u2019ll cheer you up.\u201d Elody starts rummaging around in her bag, looking pleased with herself.</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, Elody, if you\u2019re about to give me a condom right now...\u201d I press my fingers to my temples.</p><p>Elody freezes and frowns, holding up a condom between two fingers. \u201cBut...it\u2019s your present.\u201d She looks at Lindsay for support.</p><p>Lindsay shrugs. \u201cUp to you,\u201d she says. She\u2019s not looking at me, but I can tell my attitude is really starting to piss her off, and to be honest, I\u2019m happy about it. \u201cIf you want to be a walking STD farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would know all about that.\u201d I don\u2019t even mean for it to slip out; it just does. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lindsay whips around to face me. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d I lean my head against the glass.</p> <p>Elody\u2019s still sitting there with the condom dangling between her fingers. \u201cC\u2019mon, Sam. No glove, no love, right?\u201d</p><p>Losing my virginity seems absurd to me now, the plot point of a different movie, a different character, a different lifetime. I try to reach back and remember what I love about Rob\u2014what I loved about him\u2014but all I get is a random collection of images in no particular order: Rob passing out on Kent\u2019s couch, grabbing my arm and accusing me of cheating; Rob laying his head on my shoulder in his basement, whispering that he wants to fall asleep next to me; Rob turning his back on me in sixth grade; Rob holding up his hand and saying, Five minutes; Rob taking my hand for the first time ever when we were walking through the hall, a feeling of pride and strength going through me. They seem like the memories of somebody else.</p><p>That\u2019s when it really hits me: none of it matters anymore. Nothing matters anymore.</p><p>I twist around in my seat, reaching back to grab the condom from Elody.</p><p>\u201cNo glove, no love,\u201d I say, giving her a tight smile.</p> <p>Elody cheers. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m turning around again when Lindsay slams on the brakes at a red light. I jet forward and have to reach out one hand to keep from hitting the dash and then, as the car stops moving, slam back against the headrest. The coffee in the cup holder jumps its lip and splashes my thigh.</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d Lindsay giggles. \u201cSo sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really are a hazard.\u201d Elody laughs and reaches around to buckle her seat belt.</p><p>The anger I\u2019ve felt all morning pours out in a rush. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s smile freezes on her face. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said, What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d I grab some napkins from inside the glove compartment and start wiping off my leg. The coffee\u2019s not even that hot\u2014Lindsay had the lid off to cool it\u2014but it leaves a splotchy red mark on my thigh, and I feel like crying. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard. Red light: stop. Green light: go. I know that yellow might be a little harder for you to grasp, but you\u2019d think with a little practice you could come to terms with it.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay and Elody are both staring at me in stunned silence, but I don\u2019t stop, I can\u2019t stop, this is all Lindsay\u2019s fault, Lindsay and her stupid driving. \u201cThey could train monkeys to drive better than you. So what? What is it? You need to prove you don\u2019t give a shit? That you don\u2019t care about anything? You don\u2019t care about anybody? Tap a fender here, swipe a mirror there, oops, thank God we have our airbags, that\u2019s what bumpers are for, just keep going, keep driving, no one will ever know. Guess what, Lindsay? You don\u2019t have to prove anything. We already know you don\u2019t give a shit about anybody but yourself. We\u2019ve always known.\u201d</p><p>I run out of air then, and for a second after I stop speaking, there\u2019s total silence. Lindsay\u2019s not even looking at me. She\u2019s staring straight ahead, both hands on the wheel, knuckles white from clutching it so tightly. The light turns green and she presses her foot on the accelerator, hard. The engine roars, sounding like distant thunder.</p><p>It takes Lindsay a while to speak and when she does her voice is low and strangled-sounding. \u201cWhere the hell do you get off...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys.\u201d Elody pipes up nervously from the back. \u201cDon\u2019t fight, okay? Just drop it.\u201d</p><p>The anger is still running through me, an electrical current. It makes me feel sharper and more alert than I have in years. I whirl around to face Elody.</p><p>\u201cHow come you never stand up for yourself?\u201d I say. She shrinks back a little, her eyes darting between Lindsay and me. \u201cYou know it\u2019s true. She\u2019s a bitch. Go ahead, say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her out of it,\u201d Lindsay hisses.</p> <p>Elody opens her mouth and then gives a minute shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d I say, feeling triumphant and sick at the same time. \u201cYou\u2019re scared of her. I knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you to leave her alone.\u201d Lindsay finally raises her voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to leave her alone?\u201d The sharpness, the sense of clarity is disappearing. Instead everything feels like it\u2019s spinning out of my control. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who treats her like shit all the time. It\u2019s you. Elody\u2019s so pathetic. Look at Elody climbing all over Steve\u2014he doesn\u2019t even like her. Look, Elody\u2019s trashed again. Hope she doesn\u2019t puke in my car, don\u2019t want the leather to smell like alcoholic.\u201d</p><p>Elody draws in a sharp breath on the last word. I know I\u2019ve gone too far. The second I say it I want to take it back. My mirror is still flipped down, and I can see Elody staring out the window, mouth quivering like she\u2019s trying not to cry. Number one rule of best friends: there are certain things that you never, ever say.</p><p>All of a sudden Lindsay slams on the brakes. We\u2019re in the middle of Route 120, about a half mile from school, but there\u2019s a line of traffic behind us. A car has to swerve into the other lane to avoid hitting us. Thankfully there\u2019s no oncoming traffic. Even Elody cries out.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d My heart is racing. The car passes us, honking furiously. The passenger rolls down his window and yells something, but I can\u2019t hear it; I just see the flash of a baseball hat and angry eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The people in the cars in line behind us start leaning on their horns too, but Lindsay throws the car in park and doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cLindsay,\u201d Elody says anxiously, \u201cSam\u2019s right. It\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay lunges for me, and I think she\u2019s going to hit me. Instead she leans over and shoves open the door.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d she says quietly, her voice full of rage.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The cold air rushes into the car like a punch to the stomach, leaving me deflated. The last of my anger and fearlessness goes with it, and I just feel tired.</p><p>\u201cLindz.\u201d Elody tries to laugh, but the sound comes out high-pitched and hysterical. \u201cYou can\u2019t make her walk. It\u2019s freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Lindsay repeats. Cars are starting to pull around us now, everyone honking and rolling down their windows to yell at us. All of their words get lost in the roar of the engines and the bleating of the horns, but it\u2019s still humiliating. The idea of getting out now, of being forced to walk in the gutter while all of those dozens of cars roll by me, with all those people watching, makes me shrink back against my seat. I look to Elody for more support, but she looks away.</p><p>Lindsay leans over. \u201cI. Said. Get. Out,\u201d she whispers, and her mouth is so close to my ear if you couldn\u2019t hear her you\u2019d think she was telling me a secret.</p><p>I grab my bag and step into the cold. The freezing air on my legs almost paralyzes me. The second I\u2019m out of the car Lindsay guns it, peeling away with the door still swinging open.</p><p>I start walking in the leaf-and-trash-filled ditch that runs next to the road. My fingers and toes go numb almost instantly, and I stomp my feet on the frost-covered leaves to keep the blood flowing. It takes a minute for the long line of traffic to begin to unwind, and horns are still honking away, the sound like the fading wail of a passing train.</p><p>A blue Toyota pulls up next to me. A woman leans out\u2014gray-haired, probably in her sixties\u2014and shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cCrazy girl,\u201d she says, frowning at me.</p><p>For a moment I just stand there, but as the car starts to pull away, I remember that it doesn\u2019t matter, none of it matters, so I throw up my middle finger, hoping she sees.</p><p>All the way to school I repeat it again\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter, none of it matters\u2014until the words themselves lose meaning.</p><p>Here\u2019s one of the things I learned that morning: if you cross a line and nothing happens, the line loses meaning. It\u2019s like that old riddle about a tree falling in a forest, and whether it makes a sound if there\u2019s no one around to hear it.</p><p>You keep drawing a line farther and farther away, crossing it every time. That\u2019s how people end up stepping off the edge of the earth. You\u2019d be surprised at how easy it is to bust out of orbit, to spin out to a place where no one can touch you. To lose yourself\u2014to get lost.</p><p>Or maybe you wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Maybe some of you already know.</p><p>To those people I can only say: I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>I skip my first four periods just because I can, and spend a couple of hours walking the halls with no real goal or destination. I almost hope someone will stop me\u2014a teacher or Ms. Winters or a teacher\u2019s aide or someone\u2014and ask what I\u2019m doing, even accuse me point-blank of cutting and send me to the principal\u2019s office. Fighting with Lindsay left me unsatisfied, and I still feel a vague but pressing desire to do something.</p><p>Most of the teachers just nod or smile, though, or give me a half wave. They have no way of knowing my schedule, no way of knowing whether I have a free period or whether class was canceled, and I\u2019m disappointed by how easy it is to break the rules.</p><p>When I walk into Mr. Daimler\u2019s class I deliberately don\u2019t look at him, but I can feel his eyes on me, and after I slide into my desk, he comes straight over.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little early in the season for beach clothes, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He grins.</p><p>Normally whenever he looks at me for longer than a few seconds, I get nervous, but today I force myself to keep my eyes on his. Warmth spreads over my whole body; it reminds me of standing under the heat lamps in my grandmother\u2019s house when I was no older than five. It\u2019s amazing that eyes can do that, that they can transform light into heat. I\u2019ve never felt that way with Rob.</p><p>\u201cIf you got it, flaunt it,\u201d I say, making my voice soft and steady. I see something flicker in his eyes. I\u2019ve surprised him.</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d he murmurs, so quietly I\u2019m sure I\u2019m the only one who hears. Then he blushes bright red like he can\u2019t believe himself. He nods at my desk, which is empty except for a pen and the small square notebook Lindsay and I use to pass back and forth between classes, writing notes to each other. \u201cNo roses today? Or did your bouquet get too heavy to carry around?\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t been to any of my classes so I haven\u2019t collected any Valograms. I don\u2019t even care. In the past I would rather have died than be seen in the halls of Thomas Jefferson on Cupid Day without a single rose. In the past I would have considered it a fate worse than death.</p><p>Of course, that was before I actually knew.</p><p>I toss my head, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019m kind of over it.\u201d It\u2019s as though confidence is flowing into me from someone else, someone older and beautiful, like I\u2019m only playing a part.</p><p>He smiles at me, and again I see something moving in his eyes. Then he goes back to his desk and claps his hands, gesturing for everybody to take their seats. As always the dirty hemp necklace is peeking out from under his collar, and I let myself think about looping my fingers through it, pulling him toward me, and kissing him. His lips are thick\u2014but not too thick\u2014and shaped exactly how a guy\u2019s mouth should be shaped, like if he just parted his lips at all, your mouth would fit directly on top of it. I think of the picture from his high school yearbook, when he\u2019s standing with his arm around his prom date. She was thin, long brown hair, even smile. Like me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right, everyone,\u201d he\u2019s saying as people shuffle and scrape into their desks, giggling and ruffling their bouquets. \u201cI know it\u2019s Cupid Day and love is in the air, but guess what? So are derivatives.\u201d</p><p>A couple of people groan. Kent bangs in the door, almost late, his bag flapping open and papers literally scattering behind him, like he\u2019s Hansel or Gretel and he has to make sure someone can follow his trail of half-completed sketches and notes to math class. His black-and-white checkered sneakers peek out under his oversized khakis.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mutters breathlessly to Mr. Daimler. \u201cEmergency at the Tribulation. Printer problems. Malignant paper tumor in tray two. Had to operate immediately or risk losing it.\u201d As soon as he makes it halfway up the aisle to his seat, his math textbook\u2014which was riding higher and higher on a wave of crumpled paper inside his open bag\u2014pops out and slams to the floor, and everybody laughs. I feel a surge of irritation. Why is he always such a mess? How hard is it to zip up a bag?</p><p>He catches me looking at him, and I guess he mistakes my facial expression for concern, because he grins at me and mouths, Walking disaster. As though he\u2019s proud of it.</p> <p>I turn my attention back to Mr. Daimler. He\u2019s standing at the front of the room with his arms crossed, his expression fake-serious. That\u2019s another thing I like about him: he\u2019s never really mad.</p><p>\u201cGlad the printer pulled through,\u201d he says, raising his eyebrows. His sleeves are rolled up and his arms are tan. Or maybe that\u2019s just the color of his skin: like burnt honey. \u201cAs I was saying, I know there\u2019s a lot of excitement on Cupid Day, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can just ignore the regular\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCupids!\u201d someone squeals, and the class dissolves into giggles. Sure enough, there they are: the devil, the cat, and the pale white angel with her big eyes.</p><p>Mr. Daimler throws up his hands and leans against his desk. \u201cI give up,\u201d he says. Then he turns his smile to me for just a second\u2014just a second, but long enough for my whole body to light up like a Christmas display.</p><p>The angel delivers three of my roses\u2014the ones from Rob, Tara Flute, and Elody\u2014and then keeps sorting methodically through her bouquet, flipping each card over and checking for my name. There\u2019s something careful and sincere about her movements, like she\u2019s super focused on doing everything correctly. As she reads off the addressee she mouths the name quietly to herself, wonderingly, as though she can\u2019t believe there are so many people in the school, so many roses to deliver, so many friends. It\u2019s painful to watch and I stand up abruptly, grabbing the cream-and-pink rose from her hands. She jumps back, startled.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine,\u201d I say. \u201cI recognize it.\u201d</p><p>She nods at me, wide-eyed. I doubt a senior has ever spoken to her in her life. She begins to open her mouth.</p><p>I lean in so that no one else can hear me. \u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d I say, and her eyes go even wider. I can\u2019t stand to hear her say it\u2019s beautiful. I can\u2019t stand it when the rose\u2014and everything else\u2014is all garbage now, meaningless. \u201cIt\u2019s just going in the trash.\u201d</p><p>I mean it too. As soon as Mr. Daimler ushers the Cupids out the door\u2014everyone in class still giggling and showing off the notes their friends have written them and trying to predict how many roses they can expect by the end of the day\u2014I scoop up my roses and sail to the front of the classroom, dumping them in the big trash can right next to Mr. Daimler\u2019s desk.</p><p>Instantly, the giggling stops. Two people gasp and Chrissy Walker actually makes the sign of the cross, like I\u2019ve just crapped on a Bible or something. That\u2019s how big of a deal the roses are. Becca Roth half rises from her seat, like she wants to dive in after the roses and rescue them from the fate of being crushed under paper and pencil shavings, failed quizzes, and empty soda cans. I don\u2019t even look in Kent\u2019s direction. I don\u2019t want to see his face.</p><p>Becca blurts, \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw out your roses, Sam. Someone sent those to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Chrissy pipes up. \u201cIt\u2019s so not done.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou can have them if you want.\u201d I gesture to the trash can, and Becca casts a wistful look in that direction. She\u2019s probably trying to decide whether the social boost she would get from having four extra roses is worth the ego hit she would take for Dumpster-diving to get them.</p><p>Mr. Daimler smiles, winks at me. \u201cYou sure you want to do that, Sam?\u201d He raises upturned hands. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking people\u2019s hearts right and left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d All of this will be gone, vanished, erased tomorrow, and tomorrow will be erased the next day, and the next day will be erased after that, all of it wiped clean and spotless. \u201cWhat about yours?\u201d</p><p>It goes dead silent in the room; somebody coughs. I can tell Mr. Daimler doesn\u2019t know whether I\u2019m deliberately baiting him or not.</p><p>He licks his lips nervously and runs a hand through his hair. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heart.\u201d I pull myself up so I\u2019m sitting on the corner of his desk, my skirt riding up almost to my underwear. My heart is beating so fast it\u2019s a hum. I feel like I\u2019m skimming above the air. \u201cAm I breaking it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He looks down, fiddles with one of his sleeves. \u201cTake a seat, Sam. It\u2019s time to get started.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were enjoying the view.\u201d I lean back a little and stretch my arms above my head. There\u2019s a kind of electricity in the air, a zipping, singing tension running in all directions; it feels like the moment right before a thunderstorm, like every particle of air is extracharged and vibrating. A student in the back of the class laughs and another one mutters, \u201cJesus.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s my imagination, but I think I recognize Kent\u2019s voice.</p><p>Mr. Daimler looks at me, his face dark. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d I swivel off the edge of the desk and move around to his chair, then sit down and cross my legs slowly, folding my hands in my lap. Little giggles and gasps erupt around the classroom, bursts of sound. I don\u2019t know where this is coming from, this feeling of complete and total control. Up until a few months ago, I still turned to Jell-O whenever a guy talked to me, including Rob. But this feels easy, natural, like I\u2019ve slipped into the skin that belongs to me for the first time in my life.</p><p>\u201cIn your own chair.\u201d Mr. Daimler\u2019s practically growling and his face is dark red, almost purple. I\u2019ve made him lose it\u2014probably a first in Thomas Jefferson history. I know that in whatever game we\u2019re playing I\u2019ve just won a point. The idea makes my stomach drop a little\u2014not in a bad way, more like at the moment right before you reach the highest part of the roller coaster, when you know that at any second you\u2019ll be at the very top of the park, looking down over everything, pausing there for a fraction of a second, about to have the ride of your life. It\u2019s the dip in your stomach right before everything goes flying apart in a blast of wind, and screaming, right before you let go completely. The laughter in the room grows to a roar. If you were standing outside, you might mistake it for applause.</p><p>For the rest of the class I keep quiet, even though people keep whispering and breaking out into giggles, and I get three notes sent my way. One of them is from Becca and says, You are awesome; one of them is from Hanna Gordon and says, He\u2019s soooo hot. Another one lands in my lap, all balled up like trash, before I can see who threw it in my direction. It says, Whore. For a moment I feel a hot flush of embarrassment, like nausea or vertigo. But it passes quickly. None of this is real anymore. I\u2019m not even real anymore.</p><p>A fourth note arrives just before class ends. It\u2019s in the form of a miniature airplane, and it literally sails to me, landing with a whisper on my desk just as Mr. Daimler turns back from writing an equation on the board. It\u2019s so perfect I hate to touch it, but I unfold its wings, and there\u2019s a message written in neat block letters.</p><p>You are too good for that.</p><p>Even though there\u2019s no signature, I know it\u2019s from Kent, and for a second something sharp and deep goes through me, something I can\u2019t understand or describe, a blade running up under my ribs and making me almost gasp for breath. I shouldn\u2019t be dead. It shouldn\u2019t be me.</p><p>I take the note very carefully and tear it in half, then I tear it in half again.</p><p>We\u2019ve been restless all class and Mr. Daimler gives up two minutes before the bell rings.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget: test on Monday. Limits and asymptotes.\u201d He goes to his desk and leans on it, looking tired. There\u2019s a mass exhalation, a collective sigh of coats rustling and chairs scraping against the linoleum. \u201cSamantha Kingston, please see me after class.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not even looking at me, but the tone of his voice makes me nervous. For the first time it occurs to me that I could really be in trouble. Not that it matters, but if Mr. Daimler makes me sit through a lecture about responsibility I\u2019ll die of embarrassment. I\u2019ll die again.</p><p>Good luck, Becca mouths to me on her way out. We\u2019re not even friends\u2014Lindsay calls her the TurkeyJerk, because she eats turkey sandwiches every single day\u2014but the fact that she says it makes the knot ease up in my stomach.</p><p>Mr. Daimler waits until the last student files out of the classroom\u2014I see Kent hovering at the doorway out of the corner of my eye\u2014and then walks slowly to the door and closes it. Something about the way the door clicks\u2014so final, so quick\u2014makes my heart skip a beat. I close my eyes for a second, feeling like I\u2019m back in the car with Lindsay on Fallow Ridge Road with the misty headlights of a second car bearing down on us in the darkness, an accusation. They always swerve first, she\u2019d said, but at that second I understand with total and perfect clarity that that\u2019s not why she did it\u2014why she does it. She does it for that one thrilling moment when you don\u2019t know, when you come up against someone who doesn\u2019t swerve and instead find yourself plummeting off the road into the darkness.</p><p>When I open my eyes Mr. Daimler has his hands on his hips. He\u2019s staring at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>The harshness in his voice startles me. I\u2019ve never been cursed at by a teacher.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d My voice comes out sounding thinner, younger, than I wanted it to.</p><p>\u201cThe shit back there\u2014right there, in front of everybody. What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>I stand up so I\u2019m not just sitting there looking up at him like a little kid. My legs are wobbly, and I have to steady myself with one hand against the desk. I take a deep breath, trying to pull it together. It doesn\u2019t matter: all of it will be erased, cleaned away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, feeling a little bit stronger. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Did I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>He looks toward the door and a muscle twitches in his jaw. Just that, that little twitch, returns all my confidence. I want to reach out and touch him, put my fingers in his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou could get in a lot of trouble, you know,\u201d he says, not looking at me. \u201cYou could get me in a lot of trouble.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first bell rings: class is officially over now. The singing feeling returns to my blood, to the air. I step carefully around my desk and walk straight to the front of the classroom. I stop when we\u2019re only a few feet away from each other. He doesn\u2019t back away. Instead he finally looks at me. His eyes are so deep and full of something it almost frightens me off. But it doesn\u2019t.</p><p>I lean casually against Becca\u2019s desk, tipping backward and resting on my elbows so I\u2019m totally laid out in front of him, chest, legs, everything. My head feels like it has floated away from my body; my body feels like it has floated away from my blood, like I\u2019m just dissolving into energy and vibration.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind trouble,\u201d I say in my sexiest voice.</p><p>Mr. Daimler is staring into my eyes, not looking at the rest of me, but somehow I know that it\u2019s an effort. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>My skirt is riding so high I know my underwear is showing. It\u2019s a pink lace thong, one of the first I\u2019ve ever owned. Thongs always make me feel like there is a rubber band up my butt, but last year Lindsay and I bought the same pair at Victoria\u2019s Secret and swore to wear them.</p><p>The words come to me from a script, from a movie: \u201cI can stop if you want.\u201d My voice comes out breathy but not because I\u2019m trying. I am no longer breathing\u2014everything, the whole world, freezes in that moment while I wait for his response.</p><p>But when he speaks he sounds tired, annoyed\u2014not at all what I was expecting. \u201cWhat do you want, Samantha?\u201d</p><p>The tone of his voice startles me, and for a second my mind spins blankly. He\u2019s staring at me with a look of impatience now, as if I\u2019ve just asked him to change my grade. The second bell rings. I feel like at any moment he\u2019ll dismiss me, remind me about the quiz on Monday. I\u2019ve somehow lost control of the situation and I don\u2019t know how to fix it. The vibration in the air is still there, but now it feels ominous, like the air is full of sharp things getting ready to drop.</p><p>\u201cI...I want you.\u201d I don\u2019t mean for it to come out so uncertain. This is what I want. This is what I\u2019ve been wanting: Mr. Daimler. My mind keeps spinning in a blind panic, and I can\u2019t remember his first name, and I feel like laughing hysterically; I\u2019m stretched out half naked in front of my math teacher and I don\u2019t know his name. Then it comes to me. Evan. \u201cI want you, Evan,\u201d I say, a little more boldly. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever used his first name.</p> <p>He stares at me for a long time. I start to get nervous. I want to look away or pull down my skirt or cross my arms, but I force myself to stay still.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d I finally ask, but instead of answering he just walks straight to me and puts his arms on my shoulders, pushing me backward so I tip over onto Becca\u2019s desk. Then he\u2019s bending over me, kissing me and licking my neck and ear and making little grunting noises that remind me of Pickle when he has to pee. Pressed against him I feel tiny; his arms are strong, groping all over my shoulders and arms. He slides one hand up my shirt and squeezes my boobs one after the other, so hard I almost cry out. His tongue is big and fat. I think, I\u2019m kissing Mr. Daimler, I\u2019m kissing Mr. Daimler, Lindsay will never believe it, but it doesn\u2019t feel anything like I\u2019ve imagined. His five o\u2019clock shadow is rough on my skin, and I have this horrible thought that this is what my mom feels when she kisses my dad.</p><p>When I open my eyes I see the plain speckled ceiling tiles of the classroom\u2014the ceiling tiles I\u2019ve spent hours and hours staring at this semester\u2014and my mind starts circling around them, counting, like I\u2019m a fly buzzing somewhere outside my body. I think, How can the same ceiling still be here while this is happening? Why isn\u2019t the ceiling coming down? All of a sudden it\u2019s not fun anymore: all those sharp glittery things drop out of the air at once, and at the same time something drops deep inside of me. I feel like I\u2019m sobering up after drinking all night.</p><p>I put my hands on his chest and try to push him off, but he\u2019s too heavy, too strong. I can feel his muscles under my fingertips\u2014he used to play lacrosse in high school, Lindsay and I found out\u2014and above that, a fine layer of fat. He\u2019s leaning on me with his full weight and I can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m crushed underneath him, my legs split apart on either side of his hips, his stomach warm and fat and heavy on mine. I wrestle my mouth away from his. \u201cWe\u2014we can\u2019t do this here.\u201d</p><p>The words just pop out without my meaning them to. What I wanted to say was, We can\u2019t do this. Not here. Not anywhere.</p><p>What I wanted to say was, Stop.</p> <p>He\u2019s breathing hard, still staring at my mouth. There\u2019s a tiny bead of sweat at his hairline, and I watch it trace its way across his forehead and down to the tip of his nose. Finally he pulls away from me, rubs his hand over his jaw, and nods.</p><p>The moment he\u2019s off me I scrabble up to my feet and tug down my skirt, not wanting him to see that my hands are shaking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he says slowly. He gives a quick shake of his head, as though trying to rouse himself from sleep. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He takes a few steps backward and turns his back to me. For a second we just stand there, not speaking. My brain is all static. He\u2019s only a few feet away from me, but he looks hopelessly, impossibly far, like someone you can just make out distantly, a silhouette in the middle of a blizzard.</p><p>\u201cSamantha?\u201d Finally he turns back to me, rubbing both eyes and sighing, like I\u2019ve exhausted him. \u201cListen, what happened here...I don\u2019t think I need to tell you that this has to stay strictly between you and me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s smiling at me, but it\u2019s not his normal, easy smile. There\u2019s no humor in it. \u201cThis is important, Samantha. Do you understand?\u201d He sighs again. \u201cEveryone makes mistakes....\u201d He trails off, watching me.</p><p>\u201cMistakes,\u201d I repeat, the word pinging around in my head. I\u2019m not sure whether he thinks he made a mistake, or I did. Mistake, mistake, mistake. A strange word: stinging, somehow.</p><p>Mr. Daimler\u2019s mouth, eyes, nose\u2014his whole face seems to be rearranging itself into unfamiliar patterns, like a Picasso painting. \u201cI need to know that I can count on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d I hear myself say, and he looks at me, relieved, like if he could, he would pat me on the head and say, Good girl.</p><p>After that I just stand there for a bit. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s going to come around and kiss me or give me a hug\u2014it seems insane just to leave, to pick up my stuff and go as though nothing\u2019s happened. But after he blinks at me for a bit, he finally says, \u201cYou\u2019re late for lunch,\u201d and now I know I really am being dismissed. So I grab my bag and go.</p><p>As soon as I\u2019m out in the hall I lean up against a wall, grateful for the feeling of the stone against my back. Something bubbles up inside me, and I don\u2019t know whether I should jump up and down or laugh or scream. Fortunately the halls are empty. Everybody\u2019s already at lunch.</p><p>I take out my phone to text Lindsay, but then I remember that we\u2019re in a fight. There\u2019s no text from her asking if I want to go to Kent\u2019s party. She must still be mad. I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m fighting with Elody, too. Remembering what I said in the car makes me feel horrible.</p><p>I think about texting Ally\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not mad at me, at least\u2014and I spend a long time trying to figure out how to word it. It feels weird to write I kissed Mr. Daimler, but if I write Evan she won\u2019t know who I\u2019m talking about. Evan Daimler feels wrong too, and besides, we did more than just kiss. He was on top of me.</p><p>In the end I drop my phone back into my bag without writing anything. I figure I\u2019ll just wait until I\u2019ve made up with Lindsay and Elody and tell them in person. It\u2019ll be easier that way, easier to make it sound better than it was, and I\u2019ll get to see their faces. The thought of how jealous Lindsay will be makes the whole thing more than worth it. I put some concealer on my chin to cover the red spots where Mr. Daimler\u2019s face gave me an exfoliation I didn\u2019t need, and then I head to lunch.</p><p>YOU CAN\u2019T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS STEEL-TOED COMBAT BOOTS</p><p>When I march into the cafeteria ten minutes late, our usual table is empty, and I know that I have been officially and deliberately ditched.</p><p>For a fraction of a second I can feel everyone\u2019s eyes lift in my direction, staring. I bring my hand up to my face without meaning to, suddenly terrified that everyone will see the rawness on my chin and know what I\u2019ve been doing.</p><p>I duck out into the hall again. I need to be alone, need to pull it together. I head for the bathrooms, but as I get close, two sophomores (Lindsay calls them s\u2019mores because they\u2019re always stuck together and more than two will get you sick) come bursting out of the door, giggling, arm-in-arm. Lunch is prime bathroom traffic time\u2014everyone needs to reapply lip gloss, complain about feeling fat, threaten to upchuck in one of the stalls\u2014and the last thing I need right now is a steady stream of stupid.</p><p>I head to the old bathroom at the far end of the science wing. Hardly anyone uses it since a newer bathroom\u2014with toilets that don\u2019t clog 24/7\u2014was installed last year between the labs. The farther I get from the cafeteria, the more the roar of voices drops away, until they sound just like the ocean from far away. I get calmer with every step. My heels beat a steady rhythm on the tile floor.</p><p>The science wing is empty, as expected, and smells, as always, like chemical cleaners and sulfur. Today there\u2019s something else, though: the smell of smoke and something earthier, more pungent. I push against the bathroom door and for a second nothing happens. I push harder and there\u2019s a grating sound; I jam my shoulder against the door, and finally it swings open, carrying me inside with it. Instantly I hit my knee on a chair that has been propped up against the doorknob and pain shoots up my leg. The smell in the bathroom is much stronger.</p><p>I drop my bag and lean over, clutching my knee. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>The voice makes me jump. I didn\u2019t realize there was anyone else in the bathroom. I look up and Anna Cartullo\u2019s standing there, holding a cigarette in one hand.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I say. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI scared you?\u201d She leans up against the counter and taps her ashes in the sink. \u201cYou, like, forced your way in. Don\u2019t you know how to knock?\u201d Like I\u2019ve just broken into her house.</p><p>\u201cSorry I ruined your party.\u201d I make a halfhearted move for the door.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She holds up a hand, looking nervous. \u201cAre you going to tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout this.\u201d She inhales and blows a cloud of smoke. The cigarette she\u2019s smoking is extra thin and it looks like she rolled it herself. Then it hits me: it\u2019s a joint. The weed must be mixed with a lot of tobacco because I didn\u2019t recognize the smell immediately, and I come home with my clothes reeking of it after every party. Elody once said it was lucky my mom never came into my room, or she would think I was dealing pot out of my dirty laundry hamper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo what? You just come in here and smoke your lunch?\u201d I\u2019m not saying it to be mean, but it comes out that way. Her eyes dart to the floor for a second, and then I notice an empty sandwich bag and a half-eaten bag of chips sitting on the tiles. It occurs to me I\u2019ve never once seen her in the cafeteria. She must eat her lunch here every day.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I like the d\u00e9cor.\u201d She sees me looking at the sandwich bag, stubs out the joint, and crosses her arms. \u201cWhat are you doing here, anyway? Don\u2019t you have...?\u201d She stops herself, but I know what she\u2019s about to say. Don\u2019t you have friends?</p><p>\u201cI had to pee,\u201d I say. This is obviously a lie since I\u2019ve made zero effort to use the toilet, but I\u2019m too tired to come up with a different excuse, and she doesn\u2019t ask me for one.</p><p>We stand there in awkward silence for a bit. I\u2019ve never spoken a word to Anna Cartullo in my life, at least in the life I had before the car crash\u2014beyond one time when I said, \u201cDon\u2019t call her an evil wench,\u201d after she called Lindsay an evil wench. But I\u2019d rather stay here with her than go out into the hall. Finally I think, Screw it, and I sit down in the chair and prop my leg up on one of the sinks. Anna\u2019s eyes are slightly unfocused now, and she\u2019s more relaxed, slouching up against one of the walls. She nods at my knee. \u201cLooks swollen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, somebody stuck a chair right inside the door.\u201d</p><p>She starts giggling. She\u2019s definitely stoned. \u201cNice shoes.\u201d She raises her eyebrows at my feet, which are dangling over one of the circular sinks. I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s being sarcastic. \u201cHard to walk in, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk,\u201d I say, too quickly. Then I shrug. \u201cShort distances, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She snorts and then covers her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI bought them as a joke.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I feel the need to defend myself to Anna Cartullo, but I guess nothing is the way it\u2019s supposed to be today. All the rules have pretty much gone out the window. Anna\u2019s relaxing, too. She acts like it\u2019s not weird that we\u2019re hanging out in a bathroom the size of a prison cell when we should be at lunch.</p> <p>She hops up on the counter and wiggles her feet in my direction. Unsurprisingly, she\u2019s not wearing anything Cupid Day\u2013related. She has on a couple of layered black tank tops and an open hoodie. Her jeans are fraying at the hem and have a safety pin through the fly where they\u2019re missing a button. She\u2019s wearing enormous wedge round-toe boots that kind of look like Doc Martens on crack.</p><p>\u201cYou need a pair of these.\u201d She clicks her heels together, a punked-out Dorothy trying to get home from Oz. \u201cMost comfortable shoes I ever owned.\u201d</p><p>I look at her like, Yeah, right. She shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t knock \u2019em till you try \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, pass them over.\u201d</p><p>Anna looks at me for a long second, like she\u2019s not sure if I\u2019m serious.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d I kick my shoes off. They hit the ground with a clatter. \u201cWe\u2019ll trade.\u201d</p> <p>Anna bends over wordlessly, unzips her boots, and wiggles out of them. Her socks are rainbow-striped, which surprises me. I would have expected skulls or something. She peels these off next and balls them up in one hand, starting to pass them to me.</p><p>\u201cEw.\u201d I wrinkle my nose. \u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019d rather go commando.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, laughing. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>When I zip into her boots I realize she\u2019s right. They are super comfortable, even without socks. The leather is cool and very soft. I admire them on my feet.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I should be terrorizing children.\u201d I knock the bulging steel-tipped toes together, which make a satisfying clicking sound.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I should be turning tricks.\u201d Anna has maneuvered her way into my heels and is now teetering experimentally around the bathroom, arms out like she\u2019s on a tightrope.</p><p>\u201cSame size feet,\u201d I point out, though it\u2019s obvious.</p><p>\u201cEight and a half. Pretty common.\u201d She glances over her shoulder at me, like she\u2019s considering saying something else, then reaches under the sink and pulls out her bag, a beat-up patchwork hobo thing that looks like she made it herself. She extracts a small Altoids tin. Inside there\u2019s a dime bag of weed\u2014I guess Alex Liment is good for something\u2014rolling papers, and a few cigarettes.</p> <p>She starts rolling another spliff, carefully balancing her life studies packet on her lap to use as a tray. (Side note: so far I\u2019ve seen the life studies packet used as (1) an umbrella, (2) a makeshift towel, (3) a pillow, and now this. I have never actually seen anyone study with it, which either means that everyone who graduates from Thomas Jefferson will be totally unprepared for life or that certain things can\u2019t be learned in bullet-point format.) Her fingers are thin and move quickly.</p><p>She\u2019s obviously had practice. I wonder if that\u2019s what she and Alex do together after they\u2019ve had sex, just lie there side by side, smoking. I wonder if she ever thinks about Bridget when they\u2019re doing it. I\u2019m tempted to ask.</p><p>\u201cStop staring at me,\u201d she says without looking up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d I tilt my head back and stare at the vomit-colored ceiling, am reminded of Mr. Daimler, and look back at her. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many other options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one asked you to come in here.\u201d Some of the edge returns to her voice.</p><p>\u201cPublic property.\u201d There\u2019s a split second when her face goes dark and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to freak out and this will be the end of our shiny, happy time together. I rush on, \u201cIt\u2019s seriously not that bad in here. For a bathroom, you know.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me suspiciously, like she\u2019s sure I\u2019m only baiting her so I can make fun of her afterward.</p><p>\u201cYou could get some pillows for the floor.\u201d I look around. \u201cDecorate a bit or something.\u201d</p><p>She ducks her head, concentrating on her fingers. \u201cThere\u2019s this artist I\u2019ve always liked\u2014the guy who does all the stairs going up and down at the same time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cM. C. Escher?\u201d</p><p>She glances up, obviously surprised I know who she\u2019s talking about. \u201cYeah, him.\u201d A smile flits across her face. \u201cI was thinking of, I don\u2019t know, hanging one of his prints in here. Just taping it up, you know, for something to look at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, like, ten of his books in my house,\u201d I blurt out, glad she\u2019s not going to stay mad and kick me out of the bathroom. \u201cMy dad\u2019s an architect. He\u2019s into that stuff.\u201d</p><p>Anna rolls up the joint, licks the seam, and finishes it off with a few twists of her fingers. She nods at the chair. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to sit in that you can at least block the door. That way it\u2019s private property.\u201d</p><p>The chair grates against the tile floor as I scoot backward against the door, and both of us wince, catch ourselves wincing, and laugh. Anna pulls out a purple lighter with flowers on it\u2014not the lighter I expected of her\u2014and tries to spark the joint. The lighter sputters a few times and she throws it down, cursing. The next time she rummages through her bag she pulls out a lighter in the shape of a naked female torso. She presses on the head and little blue flames come shooting out the nipples. Now that is the kind of lighter I would expect Anna Cartullo to have.</p><p>Anna\u2019s face gets serious, and she takes a long pull of the joint, then stares at me through the cloud of blue smoke.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she says, \u201cwhy do you guys hate me?\u201d</p><p>Of all the things I expect her to say, it\u2019s not this. Even more unexpected, she holds the spliff out in my direction, offering me some.</p><p>I hesitate for only a second. Hey, just because I\u2019m dead doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a saint.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t hate you.\u201d It doesn\u2019t come out convincingly. The truth is I\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t hate Anna, really; Lindsay\u2019s always said she does, but it\u2019s hard to know what Lindsay\u2019s reasons are for anything. I take a hit off the joint. I\u2019ve only smoked weed once before, but I\u2019ve seen it done a hundred times. I inhale and my lungs are full of smoke: a heavy taste like chewing on moss. I try to hold my breath, the way you\u2019re supposed to, but the smoke tickles the back of my throat. I start coughing and hand the joint back.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the reason?\u201d She doesn\u2019t say, For all the shitty things you\u2019ve done. For the bathroom graffiti. For the fake email blast sophomore year: Anna Cartullo has chlamydia. She doesn\u2019t have to. She passes the joint back to me.</p><p>I take another hit. Already things are warping, certain objects blurring and others sharpening, like someone\u2019s messing with the focus on a camera. No wonder people still talk to Alex, even though he\u2019s a douche. He deals good stuff. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Because it\u2019s easy. \u201cI guess you need to take things out on somebody.\u201d</p><p>The words are out of my mouth before I realize they\u2019re true. I take another hit and pass the joint back to Anna. I feel like everything\u2019s been amplified, like I can feel the heaviness of my arms and legs and hear my heart pumping and blood tumbling through my veins. And at the end of the day it will all be silenced, at least until time skips back on its wheel and starts again.</p><p>The bell rings. Lunch is over. Anna says, \u201cShit, shit, I have to be somewhere,\u201d and begins trying to gather up her stuff. She accidentally knocks over the Altoids tin. The bag of weed goes flying under the sink, and the papers flit and flutter everywhere. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d I say. We both get down on our hands and knees. My fingers feel numb and bloated, and I\u2019m having trouble peeling the papers off the ground. This strikes me as hilarious, and Anna and I both start laughing, leaning on each other, gasping for breath. She keeps saying \u201cShit\u201d at intervals.</p><p>\u201cBetter hurry,\u201d I say. All of the anger and pain from the past few days is lifting, leaving me feeling free and careless and happy. \u201cAlex will be pissed.\u201d</p><p>She freezes. Our foreheads are so close we\u2019re almost touching.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was meeting Alex?\u201d she says. Her voice is clear and low.</p><p>I realize too late that I\u2019ve screwed up. \u201cSeen you sneaking back through Smokers\u2019 Lounge after seventh once or twice,\u201d I say vaguely, and she relaxes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell anyone, are you?\u201d she asks, biting her lower lip. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d She stops herself and I wonder if she\u2019s going to say something about Bridget. But she just shakes her head and continues gathering up the papers, working quickly now.</p><p>The idea of telling on Anna Cartullo for sleeping with Alex after what I\u2019ve just done\u2014after Mr. Daimler\u2014is hilarious. I\u2019ve got no right to say anything to anybody. I\u2019m smoking weed in a bathroom, I have no friends, my math teacher stuck his tongue down my throat, my boyfriend hates me because I won\u2019t sleep with him. I\u2019m dead, but I can\u2019t stop living. The absurdity of everything really hits me in that second and I start laughing again. Anna\u2019s gotten serious. Her eyes are big bright marbles.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she says. \u201cAre you laughing at me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head, but I can\u2019t respond right away. I\u2019m laughing too hard to breathe. I\u2019ve been kind of squatting next to her, but I\u2019m shaking so hard, the laughter heaving through me, that I tumble backward, landing on my butt with a loud thump. Anna cracks a smile again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d she says, giggling.</p><p>I take a few gasping breaths. \u201cLeast I don\u2019t barricade myself in bathrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeast I don\u2019t get stoned off half a joint.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeast I don\u2019t sleep with Alex Liment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeast I don\u2019t have bitchy friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeast I have friends.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re going back and forth, laughing harder and harder. Anna cracks up so hard she bends to the side and supports herself on one elbow. Then she rolls over all the way so she\u2019s just lying there on the bathroom floor making these hilarious yelping noises that remind me of a poodle. Every so often she snorts, which just makes me go off again.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d I say, as soon as I can get the words out.</p> <p>\u201cHear, hear.\u201d Anna pretends to pound a gavel and then snorts into her palm.</p><p>I love the feeling of thickness around me. I\u2019m swimming in murk. The green walls are water. \u201cI kissed Mr. Daimler.\u201d As soon as I say it I die laughing again. Those must be the four most ridiculous words in the English language.</p><p>Anna heaves herself up on one elbow. \u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh.\u201d I bob my head up and down. \u201cWe kissed. He put his hand up my shirt. He put his hand...\u201d I gesture between my legs.</p><p>She shakes her head from side to side. Her hair whips around her face, reminding me of a tornado. \u201cNo way. No way. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God.\u201d</p> <p>She leans forward, so close I can smell her breath on my face. She\u2019s been sucking on an Altoid. \u201cThat is sick. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick, sick, sick. He went to high school here, like, ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight. We checked.\u201d</p><p>She lets out a loud howl of laughter, and for a second she lays her head down on my shoulder. \u201cThey\u2019re all perverts,\u201d she says, the words quiet and directed straight into my ear. Then she pulls away and says, \u201cShit! I\u2019m so dead.\u201d</p><p>She stands up, steadying herself with one hand on the wall. She teeters for a moment as she stands in front of the mirror, smoothing down her hair. She takes a small bottle from her back pocket and squeezes a couple of drops into each eye. I\u2019m still on the floor, staring up at her from below. She seems to be miles and miles away.</p><p>I blurt out, \u201cYou\u2019re too good for Alex.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s already stepped over me on her way to the door. I see her back stiffen and I think she\u2019s going to be angry. She pauses, one hand resting on the chair.</p> <p>But when she turns around she\u2019s smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re too good for Mr. Daimler,\u201d she says, and we both crack up again. Then she shoves the chair out of the way and tugs the door open, slipping into the hall.</p><p>After she\u2019s gone I sit with my head back, enjoying the way the room feels like it\u2019s doing loops. This is what it\u2019s like to be the sun, I think, and then I think how stoned I am, and then I think how funny it is to know that you\u2019re stoned but not be able to stop thinking stoned thoughts.</p><p>I see something white peeking out from underneath the sink: a cigarette. I lean down and find another one. Anna forgot to pick them up. Just then there\u2019s a sharp knock on the door, and I snatch both cigarettes up and get to my feet. As soon as I stand the circling and the feeling of being underwater gets worse. It seems to take me forever to push the chair out of the way. Everything is so heavy.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot these,\u201d I say, holding the cigarettes up between two fingers as I open the door.</p><p>It\u2019s not Anna, though. It\u2019s Ms. Winters, standing in the hallway with her arms crossed and her face pinched up so tightly it looks like her nose is a black hole and the rest of her face is getting slowly sucked into it.</p><p>\u201cSmoking on school property is forbidden,\u201d she says, pronouncing each word carefully. Then she smiles, showing all of her teeth.</p><p>THE PUGS</p><p>In the Thomas Jefferson High School R &amp; R (Rules and Regulations Handbook), it says that any student caught smoking on school property is subject to three days\u2019 suspension. (I know this by heart because all the smokers like to tear this page out of the handbook and burn it at the Lounge, sometimes crouching and sticking their cigarettes in the flames to catch a light, as the words on the page curl and blacken and smoke into nothing.)</p><p>But I get off with only a warning. I guess the administration makes exceptions for students who have dirt on a certain vice principal and a certain gym teacher/soccer coach/mustache fan. Ms. Winters looked like she was going to have a massive coronary when I\u2019d started going off about role models and my poor impressionable mind\u2014I love that expression, as though everyone under the age of twenty-one has all the brain power of dental plaster\u2014and the administration\u2019s responsibility to set an example, especially when I\u2019d reminded her about page sixty-nine in the R &amp; R: it is forbidden to engage in lewd or sexually inappropriate acts in or around school property. (That one I know because the page has been torn out and hung up about a thousand times in various bathrooms on campus, the margins decorated with drawings of a decidedly lewd and sexually inappropriate nature. The administration was totally asking for it, though. Who puts a rule like that on page sixty-nine?)</p><p>At least the hour and a half I spent with Ms. Winters has sobered me up. The last bell has just rung, and all around me students are sweeping out of classrooms, making way more noise than is necessary\u2014shrieking, laughing, slamming lockers, dropping binders, shoving one another\u2014a jittery, mindless, restless noise unique to Friday afternoons. I\u2019m feeling good, and powerful, and I\u2019m thinking, I have to find Lindsay. She won\u2019t believe it. She\u2019ll die laughing. Then she\u2019ll put her arm around my shoulder and say, \u201cYou\u2019re a rock star, Samantha Kingston,\u201d and everything will be fine. I\u2019m keeping an eye out for Anna Cartullo, too\u2014while I was sitting in Ms. Winters\u2019s office it occurred to me that we never switched shoes again. I\u2019m still wearing her monster black boots.</p><p>I swing out of Main. The cold makes my eyes sting, and a sharp pain shoots up my chest. February really is the worst month. A half dozen buses are idling in a line next to the cafeteria, engines choking and coughing, letting up a thick black wall of exhaust. Through the dirt-filmed windows the pale faces of a handful of underclassmen\u2014all slouched in their seats, hoping not to be seen\u2014are featureless and interchangeable. I start cutting across the faculty lot toward Senior Alley, but I\u2019m only halfway there when I see a big-ass silver Range Rover\u2014its walls thudding with the bass of \u201cNo More Drama\u201d\u2014tear out of the alley and start gunning it toward Upper Lot. I stop, all of the good buzzy feeling draining out of me quickly and at once. Of course, I didn\u2019t really expect Lindsay to be waiting for me, but deep down I guess I was hoping for it. Then it hits me: I have no ride, nowhere to go. The last place I want to be is at home. Even though I\u2019m freezing, I feel prickles of heat rising up from my fingers, crawling up my spine.</p><p>It\u2019s the weirdest thing. I\u2019m popular\u2014really popular\u2014but I don\u2019t have that many friends. What\u2019s even weirder is that it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve noticed.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d</p><p>I turn around and see Tara Flute, Bethany Harps, and Courtney Walker coming toward me. They always travel in a pack, and even though we\u2019re kinda-friends with all of them, Lindsay calls them the Pugs: pretty from far away, ugly up close.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tara always has a perma-smile, like she\u2019s constantly auditioning for an ad for Crest toothpaste, and she turns it on me now. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, a thousand degrees below zero.\u201d</p><p>I toss my hair over one shoulder, trying to look nonchalant. The last thing I need is for the Pugs to know I\u2019ve been ditched. \u201cI had to tell Lindsay something.\u201d I gesture vaguely in the direction of Senior Alley. \u201cShe and the girls had to jet out without me\u2014some community-service thing they do once a month. Lame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo lame,\u201d Bethany says, nodding vigorously. As far as I can tell, her only role in life is to agree with whatever has just been said.</p><p>\u201cCome with us.\u201d Tara slips her arm in mine and squeezes. \u201cWe\u2019re headed to La Villa to shop. Then we thought we\u2019d hit up Kent\u2019s party. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>I briefly run through my other options: home is obviously out. I won\u2019t be welcome at Ally\u2019s. Lindsay has made that clear. Then there\u2019s Rob\u2019s...sitting on the couch while he plays Guitar Hero, making out a little bit, pretending not to notice when he tears another bra because he can\u2019t figure out the clasp. Making conversation and waving while his parents pack up the car for the weekend. Pizza and lukewarm beer from the garage stash as soon as they\u2019re gone. Then more making out. No, thank you.</p><p>I scan the parking lot once more, looking for Anna. I feel kind of bad about taking off with her boots\u2014but then again, it\u2019s not exactly like she\u2019s made an effort to find me. Besides, Lindsay always said a new pair of shoes could change your life. And if I was ever in need of a serious life change\u2014or afterlife change, whatever\u2014it\u2019s now.</p><p>\u201cSounds perfect,\u201d I say, and if possible Tara\u2019s smile gets a little wider, teeth so white they look like bone.</p><p>As we leave school I tell the Pugs\u2014I can\u2019t help but think of them that way\u2014about my trip to the office, and how Ms. Winters has been getting her freak on with Mr. Otto, and how I got off without a detention, because I promised her I would destroy a camera-phone pic of one of her love sessions in Otto\u2019s office (fabricated, obviously\u2014there\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever hang on to evidence of their coupling, much less in high-digital format). Tara is gasping she\u2019s laughing so hard, and Courtney\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019ve just cured cancer or developed a pill that makes you grow a cup size, and Bethany covers her mouth and says, \u201cHoly mother of Lord Cocoa Puffs.\u201d I\u2019m not exactly sure what that means, but it\u2019s definitely the most original thing I\u2019ve ever heard her say. It all makes me feel good and confident again, and I remind myself that this is my day: I can do whatever I want.</p><p>\u201cTara?\u201d I squinch forward. Tara\u2019s car is a tiny two-door Civic, and Bethany and I are crushed in the backseat. \u201cCan we stop at my house for a second before we hit the mall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d There\u2019s her smile again, reflected in the rearview like a piece of sky. \u201cNeed to drop something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed to get something,\u201d I correct her, shooting her my biggest smile back.</p><p>It\u2019s almost three o\u2019clock, so I figure my mom should be back from yoga, and sure enough her car is in the driveway when we pull up to the house. Tara starts to pull in behind the Accord, but I tap her shoulder and gesture for her to keep going. She inches her car along the road until we\u2019re hidden behind a cluster of evergreens my mom had the landscaper plant years ago, after she discovered that our then-neighbor, Mr. Horferly, liked to take midnight strolls on his property totally in the buff. This is pretty much the answer to every problem you encounter in suburbia: plant a tree, and hope you don\u2019t see anyone\u2019s privates. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hop out of the car and loop around the side of the house, praying my mom isn\u2019t looking out one of the windows in the den or my dad\u2019s study. I\u2019m banking on the fact that she\u2019s in the bathroom, taking one of her infamously long showers before going to pick up Izzy at gymnastics. Sure enough, when I slide my key in the back door and slip into the kitchen, I hear the patter of water upstairs and a few high, warbling notes: my mom is singing. I hesitate for a split second, long enough to place the tune\u2014Frank Sinatra, \u201cNew York, New York\u201d\u2014and say a prayer of thanks that the Pugs aren\u2019t witness to my mom\u2019s impromptu performance. Then I tiptoe into the mudroom, where, as usual, my mom has deposited her enormous purse. It is sagging on its side. Several coins and a roll of breath mints have spilled out onto the washing machine, and a corner of her green Ralph Lauren wallet is just peeking out from under the thick leather loop of a shoulder strap. I remove the wallet carefully, listening, all the while, to the rhythm of the water upstairs, ready to cut and run if it stops flowing. My mom\u2019s wallet is a mess, too, crammed with photos\u2014Izzy, me, me and Izzy, Pickle wearing a Santa\u2019s costume\u2014receipts, business cards. And credit cards.</p><p>Especially credit cards.</p><p>I fish out the Amex carefully. My parents only use it for major purchases so there\u2019s no way my mom will notice it\u2019s missing. My palms are prickly with sweat and my heart is beating so hard it\u2019s painful. I carefully close up the wallet and slip it back into the purse, making sure it\u2019s in the exact same position as before.</p><p>Above me, there\u2019s a final rush of water, a screeching sound as the pipes shudder dry, and then silence. My mom\u2019s Sinatra rendition drops off. Shower over. For a second I\u2019m so terrified I can\u2019t get my feet to move. She\u2019ll hear me. She\u2019ll catch me. She\u2019ll see me with the Amex in hand. Then the phone starts ringing, and I hear her footsteps heading out of the bathroom, crossing the hallway, hear her singsonging, \u201cComing, coming.\u201d</p> <p>In that second I\u2019m gone, slipping out of the mudroom, crossing the kitchen, out the back door\u2014and running, running, running around the side of the house, the frost-coated grass biting my calves, trying to keep from laughing, clutching the cold plastic Amex so hard that when I open my palm later, I see it\u2019s left a mark.</p><p>Normally at the mall I have a very strict spending limit: twice a year my parents give me five hundred dollars for new clothes, and on top of that I can spend whatever I make babysitting for Izzy or doing other servant-type things my parents ask me to do, like wrap presents for our neighbors at Christmastime or rake the leaves in November or help my dad unclog the storm drains. I know five hundred dollars sounds like a lot, but you have to keep in mind that Ally\u2019s Burberry galoshes cost almost that\u2014and she wears those in the rain. On her feet. So I\u2019ve never been that big into shopping. It\u2019s just not that fun, particularly when you\u2019re best friends with Ally Endless-Limit-Credit-Card Harris and Lindsay My-Stepdad-Tries-to-Buy-My-Affection Edgecombe.</p><p>Today, that problem is solved.</p><p>First stop is Bebe, where I pick up a gorgeous spaghetti-strap dress that\u2019s so tight I have to suck all the way in just to squeeze into it. Even then Tara has to duck into the dressing room and help me zip up the last half inch. I kind of like how Anna\u2019s boots look with the dress, actually, sexy and tough, like I\u2019m a video-game assassin or an action hero. I make Charlie\u2019s Angels poses at the mirror for a bit, shaping my fingers into a gun, pointing at my reflection, and mouthing, Sorry. Pulling the trigger, and imagining an explosion.</p><p>Courtney nearly loses it when I hand over my credit card without even looking at the total. Not that I don\u2019t catch a glimpse. It\u2019s pretty hard to miss the big green $302.10 flashing on the register, blinking up at me like it\u2019s accusing me of something. My stomach gives a little hula performance as the saleswoman slides over the receipt for me to sign, but I guess all those years of forging my own doctor\u2019s notes and tardy excuses pays off because I give a perfect, looping imitation of my mom\u2019s script, and the saleswoman smiles and says, \u201cThank you, Ms. Kingston,\u201d like I\u2019ve just done her a favor. And just like that I walk out with the world\u2019s most perfect black dress nestled in tissue paper at the bottom of a crisp white shopping bag. Now I understand why Ally and Lindsay love shopping. It\u2019s much better when you can have whatever you want.</p> <p>\u201cYou are so lucky your parents give you a credit card,\u201d Courtney says, trotting after me as we leave the store. \u201cI\u2019ve been begging mine for years. They say I have to wait until I\u2019m in college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t exactly give it to me,\u201d I say, raising one eyebrow at her. Her mouth falls open.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Courtney shakes her head so fast her brown hair whips back and forth in a blur. \u201cNo way. You did not\u2014are you saying you stole\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh.\u201d La Villa Mall is supposed to be Italian-themed, all big, marble fountains and flagstone walkways. The sound gets bounced and zipped and mixed around so it\u2019s impossible to make out what people are saying unless they\u2019re standing right next to you, but still. No point in pushing it now that I\u2019m on a roll. \u201cI prefer to think of it as borrowing, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents would strangle me.\u201d Courtney\u2019s eyes are so wide I\u2019m worried her eyeballs will pop out. \u201cThey would kill me until I was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d Bethany says.</p> <p>We hit the MAC store next, and I get a full-on makeover from a guy named Stanley who\u2019s skinnier than I am, while the Pugs try on different shades of eyeliner and get yelled at for breaking into the unopened lip glosses. I buy everything Stanley uses on me: foundation, concealer, bronzing powder, eye shadow prep, three shades of eye shadow, two shades of eyeliner (one white for under the eye), mascara, lip liner, lip gloss, four different brushes, one eyelash curler. It\u2019s so worth it. I leave looking like I\u2019m a famous model, and I can feel people staring at me as we walk through La Villa. We pass a group of guys who must be in college at least, and one of them mutters, \u201cHot.\u201d Tara and Courtney are flanking me and Bethany trails behind. I think: This is how Lindsay must feel all the time.</p><p>Next is Neiman Marcus: a store I never go into unless Ally drags me, since everything costs a billion dollars. Courtney tries on weird old-lady hats, and Bethany takes pictures of her and threatens to post them online. I pick up this amazing forest green faux-fur shrug that makes me look like I should be partying on a private jet somewhere, and a pair of silver-and-garnet chandelier earrings.</p><p>The only snag comes when the woman at the cashier\u2014Irma, according to her name tag\u2014asks to see my ID.</p><p>\u201cID?\u201d I blink at her innocently. \u201cI so never keep it on me. Last year my identity was stolen.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me for a long time like she\u2019s thinking about letting it slide, then pops her gum and gives me a tight smile. She pushes the shrug and the earrings back across the counter. \u201cSorry, Ellen. ID required for all purchases over two hundred and fifty dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer Ms. Kingston, actually.\u201d I give her a tight smile right back. Bitch. That gum-popping trick? Lindsay invented it.</p><p>Then again, I\u2019d be a bitch too if my parents had named me Irma.</p><p>Suddenly inspired, I root around in my purse until I fish out my membership card to Hilldebridge Swim and Tennis, my mom\u2019s gym. I swear, security there is tighter than an airport\u2014like obesity in America is somehow a terrorist plot, and the next big thing to go will be the nation\u2019s elliptical machines\u2014and the card features a tiny picture of me, a membership ID number, and my last name and initials: KINGSTON, S. E.</p> <p>Irma screws up her face. \u201cWhat does the S stand for?\u201d</p><p>My mind does that thing where it hiccups and then goes totally blank. \u201cUm\u2014Severus.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me. \u201cLike in Harry Potter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s German, actually.\u201d I should never have offered to read those stupid books to Izzy. \u201cYou can see why I go by my middle name.\u201d</p><p>Irma\u2019s still hesitating, biting the corner of her lip. Tara\u2019s standing right next to me, running her fingers over my Amex like some of the credit line will rub off on her. She leans forward and giggles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you understand.\u201d Tara squints a little, like she\u2019s trying hard to make out the name tag from a distance of six inches. \u201cIt\u2019s Irma, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Courtney comes up behind us, wearing a wide-brimmed hat with a gigantic feathered robin sprouting out of its side. \u201cDid people ever call you Worma when you were little? Or Squirma?\u201d</p><p>Irma folds her mouth into a thin white line, reaches for my card, and swipes.</p><p>\u201cGuten Tag,\u201d I say as we leave: the only German I know.</p><p>Tara and Co. are still laughing about Irma as we pull out of the parking lot of La Villa. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Courtney keeps repeating, leaning forward to look at me, like I\u2019m suddenly going to disappear. This time they\u2019ve given me shotgun automatically. I didn\u2019t even have to call it. \u201cI can\u2019t freaking believe it.\u201d</p><p>I allow myself a small smile as I turn to the window, and am momentarily startled by the reflection I see there: huge dark eyes, smoke and shadow, full red lips. Then I remember the makeup. For a second I didn\u2019t recognize myself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so awesome,\u201d Tara says, then palms the steering wheel and curses as we just miss the light.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I wave the air vaguely. I\u2019m feeling pretty good. I\u2019m almost glad Lindsay and I got into a fight this morning.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, no way.\u201d Courtney beats on my shoulder as a huge Chevy Tahoe, vibrating with bass, pulls up next to us. Even though it\u2019s freezing, all the windows are down: it\u2019s the college guys from La Villa, the ones who checked us out earlier. Who checked me out. They\u2019re laughing and fighting over something in the car\u2014one of them yells, \u201cMike, you\u2019re a pussy\u201d\u2014pretending not to see us, the way guys do when they\u2019re just dying to look.</p><p>\u201cThey are so hot,\u201d Tara says, leaning over me to get a clearer view, then ducking quickly back to the wheel.</p><p>\u201cYou should get their number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello? There are four of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir numbers, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna flash them,\u201d I say, and am suddenly thrilled with the perfect, pure simplicity of it: I\u2019m going to do it. So much easier and cleaner than Maybe I should or Won\u2019t we get in trouble? or Oh my God, I could never. Yes. Three letters. I twist around to Courtney. \u201cDo you dare me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are doing that bug thing again. Tara and Bethany stare at me like I\u2019ve sprouted tentacles.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Courtney says.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Tara says.</p><p>\u201cI can, I would, and I\u2019m going to.\u201d I roll down the window, and the cold slams me, blots out everything, numbs my whole body so I just feel myself in bits and pieces, an elbow bobbing here, a thigh cramping, fingers tingling. The music pumping from the boys\u2019 car is so loud it makes my ears hurt, but I can\u2019t hear any words or melody, just the rhythm, throbbing, throbbing\u2014so loud it\u2019s not even sound anymore, just vibration, feeling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d At first I can only croak the word out, so I clear my throat and try again. \u201cHey.

I can hardly focus I\u2019m so keyed up, but in that second I see he\u2019s not that cute, actually\u2014he has kind of crooked teeth and a rhinestone stud in one ear, like he\u2019s a rapper or something\u2014but then he says, \u201cHey, cutie,\u201d and I see his three friends lean over toward the window to look, one, two, three heads popping up like jacks-in-the-box, like the Whack-a-Mole game at Dave &amp; Buster\u2019s, one, two, three, and I\u2019m lifting my shirt, and there\u2019s a roar and a rushing, singing sound in my ears\u2014laughter? screaming?\u2014and Courtney\u2019s yelling, \u201cGo, go, go.\u201d Then our tires screech, and the car lurches forward, sliding a bit, the wind biting my face, and the smell of scorched rubber and gasoline stinking up the air. My heart sinks slowly back from my throat to my chest, and the warmth and feeling comes back to my body. I roll up the window. I can\u2019t explain the feelings going through me, a rush like you get from laughing too hard or spinning too long in a circle. It\u2019s not exactly happiness, but I\u2019ll take it.</p><p>\u201cPriceless! Legendary!\u201d Courtney\u2019s thumping the back of my seat, and Bethany\u2019s just shaking her head and reaching forward to touch me, eyes wide, amazed, like I\u2019m a saint and she\u2019s trying to cure herself of a disease. Tara\u2019s screaming with laughter. She can barely watch the road, her eyes are tearing up so badly. She chokes out, \u201cDid you see their faces? Did you see?\u201d and I realize I didn\u2019t see. I couldn\u2019t see anything, couldn\u2019t feel anything but the roaring around me, heavy and loud, and it occurs to me that I\u2019m not sure whether this is what it\u2019s like to be really, truly alive or this is what it\u2019s like to be dead, and it strikes me as hilarious. Courtney thumps me one more time, and I see her face rising behind me in the rearview mirror, red as a sun, and I start laughing too, and the four of us laugh all the way back to Ridgeview\u2014over eighteen miles\u2014while the world streaks past us in a smear of blacks and grays, like a bad painting of itself.</p><p>We stop at Tara\u2019s house so everyone can change. Tara helps get me into my dress again, and after I slip on the fur shrug and the earrings and let my hair down\u2014which is all wavy from being twisted up in a half-knot all day\u2014I turn to the mirror and my heart actually reindeer-prances in my chest. I look at least twenty-five. I look like somebody else. I close my eyes, remember standing in the bathroom when I was little as the steam from my shower retreated from the mirrors, praying for a transformation. I remember the sick taste of disappointment every time my face reemerged, as plain as it ever was. But this time when I open my eyes it works. There I am: different and gorgeous and not myself.</p> <p>Dinner\u2019s on me, of course. We go to Le Jardin du Roi, this super expensive French restaurant where all the waiters are hot and French. We pick the most expensive bottle of wine on the menu, and nobody asks to see our IDs, so we order a round of champagne. It\u2019s so good, we ask for another round even before the appetizers come. Bethany gets drunk right away and starts flirting with the waiters in bad French, just because last year she spent the summer in Provence. We must order half the menu: tiny melt-in-your-mouth cheese puffs, thick slabs of p\u00e2t\u00e9 that probably have more calories than you\u2019re supposed to eat in a day, goat cheese salad and mussels in white wine and steak b\u00e9arnaise and a whole sea bass with its head still attached and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and mousse au chocolat. I think it\u2019s the best food I\u2019ve ever tasted, and I eat until I can hardly breathe, and if I take one more bite I really will bust my dress. Then, as I\u2019m signing the check, one of the waiters (the cutest one) brings over four miniature glasses of sweet pink liquor for the digestion, except, of course, he says it for ze deejestee-on.</p><p>I don\u2019t realize how much I\u2019ve had to drink until I stand up and the world swings wildly for a second, like it\u2019s struggling to find its balance, and I think maybe the world\u2019s drunk, not me, and start to giggle. We step out into the freezing air and it helps sober me up a little.</p><p>I check my phone and see that I have a text from Rob. What\u2019s up w u? We had a plan 4 2nite.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sam,\u201d Courtney calls. She and Bethany have climbed into the backseat of the Civic. They\u2019re waiting for me to take shotgun again. \u201cParty time.\u201d</p><p>I quickly write a text back to Rob. We\u2019re on. C u soon.</p> <p>Then I get in the car, and we head to the party.</p><p>The party\u2019s just getting started when we arrive, and I beeline for the kitchen. Since it\u2019s still early and pretty clear of people I notice a ton of details in the rooms I haven\u2019t seen before. The place is so stocked with little carved wood statues and funky oil paintings and old books it could be a museum.</p><p>The kitchen is brightly lit and everything here looks sharp and separate. There are two kegs lined up directly inside the doorway, and most of the people are gathered here. It\u2019s basically guys at this point, plus some sophomores. They\u2019re huddled in clumps, gripping their plastic cups like they contain their whole life force, and their smiles are so forced I can tell their cheeks are hurting.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d Rob sees me and does a double take as soon as I come in. He shoulders his way toward me, then backs me up against the wall, leaning a hand on either side of my head so I\u2019m penned in. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were gonna show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I was coming.\u201d I put my hands on his chest, feeling his heartbeat skip under my fingers. It makes me sad for some reason. \u201cDid you get my text?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cYou were acting weird all day. I thought maybe you didn\u2019t like my rose.\u201d</p> <p>Luv ya. I\u2019d forgotten about that; forgotten about how upset I was. None of that matters now. They\u2019re just words, anyway. \u201cThe rose was fine.\u201d</p><p>Rob smiles and puts one hand on my head, like I\u2019m a pet. \u201cYou look hot, babe,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want a beer?\u201d</p><p>I nod. The wine I had at the restaurant is already wearing off. I feel way too sober, too aware of my whole body, my arms hanging there like dead weights. Rob has started to turn away when he suddenly stops, staring down at my shoes. He looks up at me, half amused, half puzzled. \u201cWhat are those?\u201d He points at Anna\u2019s boots.</p><p>\u201cShoes.\u201d I point one of my toes and the leather doesn\u2019t even budge. This pleases me for some reason. \u201cYou like them?\u201d</p><p>Rob makes a face. \u201cThey look like army boots or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I like them.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cThey don\u2019t look like you, babe.\u201d</p><p>I think of all the things I\u2019ve done today that would shock Rob: cutting all my classes, kissing Mr. Daimler, smoking pot with Anna Cartullo, stealing my mom\u2019s credit card. Things that aren\u2019t like me. I\u2019m not even sure what that means; I\u2019m not sure how you know. I mentally try to add up all the things I\u2019ve done in my life, but no clear picture emerges, nothing that will tell me what kind of person I am\u2014just a lot of haziness and blurred edges, indistinct memories of laughing and driving around. I feel like I\u2019m trying to take a picture into the sun: all of the people in my memories are coming back featureless and interchangeable.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything about me,\u201d I say.</p><p>He gives a half laugh. \u201cI know you look cute when you\u2019re mad.\u201d He taps a finger between my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t frown so much. You\u2019ll get wrinkles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about that beer?\u201d I say, grateful when Rob turns away. I was hoping that seeing him would relax me, but instead it\u2019s making me jumpy.</p><p>When Rob comes back with my beer, I take my cup and go upstairs.</p><p>At the top of the stairs I almost collide with Kent. He takes a quick step backward when he sees me.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d we both say at the same time, and I can feel myself blushing.</p><p>\u201cYou came,\u201d he says. His eyes look greener than ever. There\u2019s a weird expression on his face\u2014his mouth is all twisted like he\u2019s chewing on something sour.</p><p>\u201cSeems like it\u2019s the place to be.\u201d I look away, wishing he would stop staring at me. Somehow I know he\u2019s going to say something awful. He\u2019s going to say that he can see through me again. And I get this crazy urge to ask him what he sees\u2014like he can help me figure out me. But I\u2019m afraid of his answer.</p><p>He looks at his feet. \u201cSam, I wanted to say...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I hold up a hand. Then it hits me: he knows what happened with Mr. Daimler. He can tell. I know I\u2019m being paranoid, but the certainty is so strong it makes my head spin, and I have to reach out and grab on to the banister. \u201cIf this is about what happened in math, I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>He looks up at me again, his mouth set in a line. \u201cWhat did happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Once again I feel Mr. Daimler\u2019s weight pressing into me, the heat of his mouth clamped over mine. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaimler\u2019s a dirtbag, you know. You should stay away from him.\u201d He looks at me sideways. \u201cYou\u2019re too good for that.\u201d</p><p>I think of the note that sailed onto my desk earlier. I knew it was from him. The thought of Kent McFuller feeling sorry for me, looking down on me, makes something break inside.</p><p>My words come out in a rush. \u201cI don\u2019t have to explain anything to you. We\u2019re not even friends. We\u2019re\u2014we\u2019re nothing.\u201d</p><p>Kent takes a step back, lets out a noise that\u2019s halfway between a snort and a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re really unbelievable, you know that?\u201d He shakes his head, looking disgusted or sad, or maybe both. \u201cMaybe everyone\u2019s right about you. Maybe you are just a shallow\u2014\u201d He stops.</p><p>\u201cWhat? A shallow what?\u201d I feel like slapping him to get him to look at me, but he keeps his eyes turned toward the wall. \u201cA shallow bitch, right? Is that what you think?\u201d</p><p>His eyes click back on mine, clear and dull and hard, like rock. Now I wish he hadn\u2019t looked at me at all. \u201cMaybe. Maybe it\u2019s like you said. We\u2019re not friends. We\u2019re not anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, at least I don\u2019t walk around pretending to be better than everybody else.\u201d It explodes out of me before I can stop it. \u201cYou\u2019re not perfect, you know. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done bad things. I\u2019m sure you do bad things.\u201d As soon as I say it, though, I get the feeling it\u2019s not true. I just know it somehow. Kent McFuller doesn\u2019t do bad things. At least, he doesn\u2019t do bad things to other people.</p><p>Now Kent does laugh. \u201cI\u2019m the one who pretends to be better than everybody?\u201d He narrows his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s really funny, Sam. Anyone ever tell you how funny you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201d I\u2019m balling my fists up against my thighs. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so angry at him, but I could shake him, or cry. He knows about Mr. Daimler. He knows all about me, and he hates me for it. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make people feel bad just because they\u2019re not, like, perfect or whatever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth falls open. \u201cI never said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I can\u2019t be like you, okay? I don\u2019t get up in the morning thinking the world is one big shiny, happy place, okay? That\u2019s just not how I work. I don\u2019t think I can be fixed.\u201d I mean to say, I don\u2019t think \u201cit\u201d can be fixed, but it comes out wrong, and suddenly I\u2019m on the verge of crying. I have to take big gulping breaths to try to keep the tears down. I turn away from Kent so he won\u2019t see.</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of silence that seems to last forever. Then Kent rests his hand on my elbow just for a second, his touch like the wings of something brushing me. Just that one little touch gives me the chills.</p><p>\u201cI was going to tell you that you look beautiful with your hair down. That\u2019s all I was going to say.\u201d Kent\u2019s voice is steady and low. He moves around me to the head of the stairs, pausing just at the top. When he turns back to me he looks sad, even though he\u2019s smiling the tiniest bit.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be fixed, Sam.\u201d He says the words, but it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even hear them; it\u2019s like they go through my whole body at the same time, like I\u2019m absorbing them from the air. He must know it\u2019s untrue. I open my mouth to tell him so, but he\u2019s already disappearing down the stairs, melting into the crowd of people flowing into the house. I\u2019m a nonperson, a shadow, a ghost. Even before the accident I\u2019m not sure that I was a whole person\u2014that\u2019s what I\u2019m realizing now. And I\u2019m not sure where the damage begins.</p><p>I take a big swig of beer, wishing I could just go blotto. I want the world to drop away. I take another big gulp. The beer is cold, at least, but tastes like moldy water.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d Tara\u2019s coming up the stairs, her smile like the beam of a flashlight. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d When she gets to the top she pants a little, putting her right hand on her stomach and bending over. In her left hand she\u2019s holding a cigarette, half smoked. \u201cCourtney did recon. She found the good stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhiskey, vodka, gin, cassis, the works. Booze. The good stuff.\u201d</p> <p>She grabs my hand and we go back down the stairs, which are slowly getting clogged with people. Everyone\u2019s moving in the same direction: from the entrance to the beer and then up the stairs. In the kitchen we push through the clot of people gathered by the keg. On the opposite side of the kitchen there\u2019s a door with a handwritten sign on it. I recognize Kent\u2019s handwriting.</p><p>It says: PLEASE DO NOT ENTER.</p><p>There\u2019s a footnote written in tiny letters along the bottom of the page: SERIOUSLY, GUYS. I\u2019M HOSTING THE PARTY AND IT\u2019S THE ONE THING I ASK. LOOK! THERE\u2019S A KEG BEHIND YOU!</p><p>\u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I start to say, but Tara has already slipped through the door so I follow her.</p><p>It\u2019s dark on the other side of the door, and cold. The only light comes from two enormous bay windows that face out onto the backyard.</p><p>I hear giggling from somewhere deeper in the house, then the sound of someone bumping into something. \u201cCareful,\u201d someone hisses, and then I hear Courtney say, \u201cYou try to pour in the dark.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Tara whispers. It\u2019s weird how people\u2019s voices get softer in the dark, like they can\u2019t help it.</p><p>We\u2019re in the dining room. There\u2019s a chandelier drooping from the ceiling like an exotic flower, and heavy curtains pooling at either side of the windows. Tara and I skirt around the dining room table\u2014my mom would have a coronary from excitement, it must seat at least twelve\u2014and out into a kind of alcove. This is where the bar is. Beyond the alcove is another dark room: from the sofas and bookshelves I can just make out, it looks like a library or a living room. I wonder how many rooms there are. The house seems to extend forever. It\u2019s even darker here, but Courtney and Bethany are rooting around in some cabinets.</p><p>\u201cThere must be fifty bottles in here,\u201d Courtney says. It\u2019s too dark to read labels, so she opens each bottle and sniffs it, guessing at the contents. \u201cThis is rum, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreaky house, huh?\u201d Bethany says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind it,\u201d I say quickly, not sure why I feel defensive. I bet it\u2019s beautiful during the day: room after room of light. I bet Kent\u2019s house is always quiet, or there\u2019s always classical music playing or something.</p><p>Glass shatters next to me and something wet splatters on my leg. I jump as Courtney whispers, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me,\u201d I say as Tara says, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that a vase?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEw. Some of it got on my shoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just take the bottle and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>We slip back into the kitchen just as RJ Ravner yells, \u201cFire in the hole!\u201d Matt Dorfman takes a cup of beer and starts chugging it. Everyone laughs and Abby McGail claps when he\u2019s drained the cup. Someone turns up the music, and Dujeous comes on and everyone starts singing along. All MCs in the house tonight, if your lyrics sound tight then rock the mic....</p><p>I hear high-pitched laughter. Then a voice from the front hallway: \u201cGod, I guess we came at the right time.\u201d</p><p>My stomach jumps into my throat. Lindsay\u2019s here.</p><p>THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU NEVER SAY</p><p>Here\u2019s Lindsay\u2019s big secret: when she came back from visiting her stepbrother at NYU our junior year, she was awful for days\u2014snapping at everybody, making fun of Ally for having weird food issues, making fun of Elody for being such a lush and a pushover, making fun of me for always being the last to do things, from picking up on trends to going to third base (which I didn\u2019t do until late sophomore year). Elody, Ally, and I knew something must have happened in New York, but Lindsay wouldn\u2019t tell us when we asked her, and we didn\u2019t push it. You don\u2019t push things with Lindsay.</p><p>Then one night toward the end of the school year, we were all at Rosalita\u2019s, this crappy Mexican restaurant one town over where they don\u2019t card, having margaritas and waiting for our dinners to come. Lindsay wasn\u2019t really eating\u2014hadn\u2019t really been eating since returning from New York. She wouldn\u2019t touch the free chips, saying she wasn\u2019t hungry, and instead kept dipping a finger into the salt that was rimming her margarita glass and eating the crystals one by one.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember what we were talking about, but all of a sudden Lindsay blurted out, \u201cI had sex.\u201d Just like that. We all stared at her in silence, and she leaned forward and told us in a breathless rush how she\u2019d been drunk and how because her stepbrother wasn\u2019t ready to leave the party the guy\u2014the Unmentionable\u2014offered to walk her back to the dorm where she was staying with her stepbrother. They\u2019d had sex on her stepbrother\u2019s twin long bed with Lindsay fading in and out, and the guy\u2014the Unmentionable\u2014was gone even before Lindsay\u2019s brother got back from the party.</p><p>\u201cIt was only, like, three minutes,\u201d she said at the end, and I knew then she was already filing it away under Things We\u2019ll Never Talk About, tucking it back in some far corner of her mind and building other, alternate stories on top of it, better stories: I went to New York and had a great time. I\u2019m totally going to move there one day. I kissed a guy, and he wanted to come home with me, but I wouldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>Right after that our food came. Lindsay was hugely relieved after telling us\u2014even though she swore us on pain of death to absolute secrecy\u2014and her whole mood changed instantly. She sent back the salad she\u2019d ordered (\u201cLike I want to choke down that rabbit crap\u201d) and ordered cheese-and-mushroom quesadillas, pork-stuffed burritos with extra sour cream and guacamole, an order of chimichangas for the table to split, and another round of margaritas. It was like a weight had been lifted, and we had the best dinner we\u2019d had in years. All of us were stuffing our faces, even Ally, and drinking margarita after margarita in different flavors\u2014mango, raspberry, orange\u2014and laughing so loudly at least one table asked to be moved to a different part of the restaurant. I don\u2019t remember what we were even talking about, but at one point Ally took a picture of Elody wearing a flour tortilla on her head and holding up a bottle of hot sauce. In the corner of the frame, you can see a third of Lindsay\u2019s profile. She\u2019s doubling over, cracking up, her face a bright purple. One hand is clutching her stomach.</p><p>After dinner Lindsay threw down her mom\u2019s credit card to pay for the whole thing. She\u2019s only supposed to use it for emergencies, but she leaned forward over the table and made us all grab hands like we were praying. \u201cThis, my friends, was an emergency,\u201d she said, and we all laughed because she was being melodramatic as usual. The plan was to go off to a party in the arboretum: a tradition on the first warm weekend of the year. We had the whole night ahead of us. Everyone was in a good mood. Lindsay was being normal again.</p><p>Lindsay went to the bathroom to fix her makeup, and five seconds after she left the table, all those margaritas and all that laughing hit me at once: I\u2019d never had to pee so bad in my life. I sprinted to the bathroom, still laughing, while Elody and Ally pegged me with half-eaten chips and crumpled napkins and yelled, \u201cSend us a postcard from the Niagara Falls\u201d and \u201cIf it\u2019s yellow, keep it mellow!\u201d so that yet another table asked to be moved.</p><p>The bathroom was single-person, and I leaned up against the door, calling for Lindsay to let me in, rattling the handle at the same time. I guess she\u2019d been in a rush to get in there because she hadn\u2019t locked the door correctly and it opened as I was leaning against it. I tumbled into the bathroom, still laughing, expecting to find Lindsay standing in front of the mirror with her lips puckered, applying two coats of MAC Vixen lip gloss.</p><p>Instead she was kneeling on the floor in front of the toilet, and the remains of the quesadillas and the pork-stuffed burrito were floating on the surface of the water. She flushed but not quickly enough. I saw two whole undigested tomato pieces swirl down the toilet bowl.</p><p>All the laughter left me instantly. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked, even though it was obvious.</p><p>\u201cShut the door,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>I closed it quickly, the noise of the restaurant vacuumed away, leaving silence.</p><p>Lindsay got up from her knees slowly. \u201cWell?\u201d she said, looking at me like she was already preparing her arguments\u2014like she expected me to accuse her of something.</p><p>\u201cI had to pee,\u201d I said. It\u2019s so lame, but I couldn\u2019t think of anything else. There was a tiny piece of food clinging to a strand of hair and seeing it made me feel like bursting into tears. She was Lindsay Edgecombe: she was our armor.</p><p>\u201cPee then,\u201d she said, looking relieved, though I thought I saw a flicker of something else\u2014maybe sadness.</p><p>I did. I peed while Lindsay bent over the sink, cupping her hands and sipping water from them, rolling it around in her mouth and gargling. That\u2019s a funny thing: you think, when awful things happen, everything else just stops, like you would forget to pee and eat and get thirsty, but it\u2019s not really true. It\u2019s like you and your body are two separate things, like your body is betraying you, chugging on, idiotic and animal, craving water and sandwiches and bathroom breaks while your world falls apart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watched Lindsay fish out a Listerine strip and place one in her mouth, grimacing slightly. Then she went to work with her makeup, touching up her mascara and reapplying her lip gloss. The bathroom was small, but she seemed very far away.</p><p>Finally she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a habit or anything. I think I just ate too quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, and forever afterward I didn\u2019t know if she was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Al or Elody, okay? I don\u2019t want them freaking out over nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously,\u201d I said.</p><p>She paused, pressed her lips together, puckered them at the mirror. Then she turned toward me. \u201cYou guys are my family. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She said it casually, as though she were complimenting my jeans, but I knew that it was one of the most sincere things she\u2019d ever said to me. I knew that she really meant it.</p><p>We went to the party in the arboretum as planned. Elody and Ally had a great time, but I got a stomachache and had to double up on the hood of Ally\u2019s car. I\u2019m not sure if it was the food or what, but it felt like something was trying to claw its way out of my stomach.</p><p>Lindsay had a great night: that night she kissed Patrick for the first time. Three months later, at the tail end of the summer, they had sex. When she told us about losing her virginity to her boyfriend\u2014the candles, the blanket on the floor, the flowers, the whole nine yards\u2014and how great it was that her first time was so romantic, none of us even batted an eyelash. We all rushed in and congratulated her, asked her for details, told her we were jealous. We did it for Lindsay, to make her happy. She would have done it for us.</p> <p>That\u2019s the thing about best friends. That\u2019s what they do. They keep you from spinning off the edge.</p><p>WHERE IT BEGINS</p><p>Lindsay, Elody, and Ally must head upstairs as soon as they arrive\u2014considering they\u2019re packing their own vodka, it\u2019s a safe bet\u2014because I don\u2019t see them again until an hour or so later. I\u2019ve had three shots of rum and it all hits me at once: the room is a spinning, blurring world of color and sound. Courtney has just finished off the bottle of rum so I get a beer. I have to concentrate on every step, and when I get to the keg I stand there for a second, forgetting what I\u2019ve come for.</p><p>\u201cBeer?\u201d Matt Dorfman fills a cup and holds it out to me.</p><p>\u201cBeer,\u201d I say, pleased the word comes out so clear, pleased that I remembered that this is what I wanted.</p><p>I make my way upstairs. Things register in short bursts, a movie reel that\u2019s been chopped up: the feel of the rough wood banister; Emma McElroy leaning back against a wall, her mouth open and gasping\u2014maybe laughing?\u2014like a fish on a hook; Christmas lights winking, blurred light. I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019m going or who I\u2019m looking for, but all of a sudden there\u2019s Lindsay across the room and I realize I\u2019ve made it all the way to the back of the house, the cigarette room. Lindsay and I look at each other for a second and I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll smile at me, but she just looks away. Ally\u2019s standing next to her. She bends forward and whispers something to Lindsay, then makes her way over to me.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have to ask permission to talk to me?\u201d These words don\u2019t come out so clearly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a bitch.\u201d Ally rolls her eyes. \u201cLindsay\u2019s really upset about what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Elody mad?\u201d Elody\u2019s in the corner with Steve Dough, swaying against him while he talks to Liz Hummer like she\u2019s not even there. I want to go over and hug her.</p><p>Ally hesitates, looks at me from under the fringe of her bangs. \u201cShe\u2019s not mad. You know Elody.\u201d</p><p>I can tell Ally\u2019s lying, but I\u2019m too drunk to pursue it.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call me today.\u201d I hate that I\u2019ve said it. It makes me feel like an outsider again, like someone trying to break into the group. It\u2019s only been a day, but I miss them: my only real friends.</p><p>Ally takes a sip of the vodka she\u2019s holding, then winces. \u201cLindsay was freaking out. I told you, she was really upset.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true though, isn\u2019t it? What I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s true.\u201d Ally shakes her head at me. \u201cShe\u2019s Lindsay. She\u2019s ours. We\u2019re each other\u2019s, you know?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never really thought of Ally as smart, but this is probably the smartest thing I\u2019ve heard in a long time.</p><p>\u201cYou should say you\u2019re sorry,\u201d Ally says.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d I\u2019m definitely slurring now. My tongue is thick and weighty in my mouth. I can\u2019t make it do what I want it to. I want to tell Ally everything\u2014about Mr. Daimler and Anna Cartullo and Ms. Winters and the Pugs\u2014but I can\u2019t even think of the words.</p><p>\u201cJust say it, Sam.\u201d Ally\u2019s eyes have started to roam around the party. Then suddenly she takes a quick step backward. Her mouth goes slack and she brings a hand to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she says, staring over my shoulder. Her mouth\u2019s curving up into a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>It feels like time freezes as I turn around. I read once that at the edge of a black hole, time stops completely, so if you ever sailed into it, you\u2019d just be stuck there at the lip forever, forever being torn apart, forever dying. That\u2019s what it feels like in that second. The crush of people circled around me, an endless lip, more and more people.</p><p>And there she is standing in the doorway. Juliet Sykes. Juliet Sykes\u2014who yesterday blew her brains out with her parents\u2019 handgun.</p><p>Her hair is tied up in a ponytail and I can\u2019t help it; I picture it knotted and clotted with blood, a big gaping hole directly underneath her little flip of hair. I\u2019m terrified of her: a ghost in the door, the kind of stuff you have nightmares about when you\u2019re a kid, the kind of thing they make horror movies about.</p><p>A phrase comes back from a news show I had to watch about the convicts on death row for my ethics and issues elective: dead man walking. I thought it was awful when I first heard it, but now I really understand it. Juliet Sykes is a dead man walking. I guess I am too, in a way.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, without meaning to say it out loud. I take a step backward, and Harlowe Rosen squeals and says, \u201cThat\u2019s my foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Ally says again, but it sounds far away. She\u2019s already turning away from me, calling out to Lindsay over the music. \u201cLindsay, did you see who it is?\u201d</p><p>Juliet sways in the doorway. She looks calm, but her hands are balled into fists.</p><p>I throw myself forward, but everyone chooses that moment to press even closer around me. I can\u2019t watch it again. I don\u2019t want to see what happens next. I\u2019m not very steady on my feet, and I keep getting knocked back and forth, rocketing between people like a pinball, trying desperately to get out of the room. I know I\u2019m stepping on people and throwing elbows in their backs, but I don\u2019t care. I need out.</p><p>Finally I break through the knot of people. Juliet is blocking the doorway. She\u2019s not even looking at me. She\u2019s standing as still as a statue, her eyes locked some distance over my shoulder. She\u2019s looking at Lindsay. I understand then that it\u2019s Lindsay she really wants\u2014it\u2019s Lindsay she hates the most\u2014but it doesn\u2019t make me feel any better.</p><p>Just as I\u2019m about to push past her, a tremor runs through her body and she locks eyes with me.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she says to me, and puts a hand on my wrist. It\u2019s as cold as ice.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I pull away from her and keep going, stumbling forward, nearly choking on my fear. Jumbled images of Juliet keep flashing in my mind: Juliet doubled over, hands outstretched, drenched in beer and stumbling; Juliet lying on a cold floor in a pool of blood. I\u2019m not thinking clearly, and in my head the two images merge and I see her roving around the room while everyone laughs, her hair soaked, dripping, drenched in blood.</p><p>I\u2019m so distracted I don\u2019t see Rob in the hallway until I\u2019ve run straight into him.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Rob is drunk now. He has an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips. \u201cHey, you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRob...\u201d I press myself against him. The world is spinning. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, okay? We\u2019ll go to your house. I\u2019m ready now, just me and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, cowgirl.\u201d One half of Rob\u2019s mouth ticks slowly upward, but the other doesn\u2019t quite manage to join it. \u201cAfter the cigarette.\u201d He starts moving toward the back of the house. \u201cThen we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I nearly scream it.</p><p>He turns back to me, swaying, and before he can react, I\u2019ve already plucked the cigarette out of his mouth and I\u2019m kissing him, my hands cupped on either side of his face, shoving my body into his. It takes him a second to realize what\u2019s happening, but then he starts pawing me over my dress, rolling his tongue around in circles, groaning a little bit.</p><p>We\u2019re both staggering back and forth in the hallway, almost like we\u2019re dancing. I feel the floor buckle and roll, and Rob accidentally pushes me hard against the wall and I gasp.</p><p>\u201cSorry, babe.\u201d His eyes cross, uncross.</p><p>\u201cWe need a room.\u201d From the back of the house I can just hear the chanting starting. Psycho, Psycho. \u201cWe need a room now.\u201d</p><p>I take Rob\u2019s hand and we stumble down the hall, forcing our way against the tide of people moving in the other direction. They\u2019re all going to see what the noise is about.</p><p>\u201cIn here.\u201d Rob slams as hard as he can against the first closed door he comes to, the one with all the bumper stickers. There\u2019s a popping sound and we both tumble inside. I kiss him again and try to lose myself in the feeling of the closeness of our bodies and his warmth, try to block out the rising howls of laughter from the back room. I pretend I\u2019m just a body with a mind as blank and fuzzy as a TV full of snow. I try to shrink myself down, center myself in my skin, like the only feeling that exists is in Rob\u2019s fingers.</p><p>Once the door is shut it\u2019s pitch-black. The darkness around us hasn\u2019t let up at all\u2014either there are no windows here or they\u2019re curtained off. It\u2019s so dark it\u2019s almost heavy-looking, and I get a sudden hysterical fear that we\u2019re stuck in a box. Rob\u2019s lurching on his feet so much by this point, his arms locked around me, it makes me dizzy. I feel a wave of nausea, and I push him backward until we encounter something soft: a bed. He tips over and I climb on top of him.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this what you wanted?\u201d I whisper. Even now I can hear the sounds of laughter and the screaming\u2014Psycho, Psycho\u2014piping thinly over the music. I kiss Rob harder and he wrestles with the zipper of my dress. I hear fabric ripping but I don\u2019t care. I slide the dress down to my waist, and Rob starts his attack on my bra.</p><p>\u201cAre you shure about this?\u201d Rob slurs in my ear.</p><p>\u201cJust kiss me.\u201d Psycho, Psycho. The voices are echoing down the hall. I slide my hands under Rob\u2019s fleece and wrestle it over his head, then start kissing his neck and underneath the collar of his polo shirt. His skin tastes like sweat and salt and cigarettes, but I keep kissing while his hands move over my back and down toward my butt. An image of Mr. Daimler on top of me\u2014and the speckled ceiling\u2014rises out of the darkness, but I push it away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I take Rob\u2019s shirt off so now we\u2019re pressed chest-to-chest. Our skin keeps making these weird, slurpy, suctiony sounds as our stomachs come together and then pop apart. At a certain point his hands fall away. I\u2019m still kissing him, moving down his chest, feeling the fuzz of hair scattered there. Chest hair has always grossed me out; it\u2019s another thing I don\u2019t think about tonight.</p><p>Rob\u2019s gotten quiet. He\u2019s probably shocked. I\u2019ve never even done this much with him before. Normally when we hook up he\u2019s the one who takes charge. I\u2019ve always been afraid I\u2019ll do something wrong. It feels so awkward to act like you know what you\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve never even been totally naked with him.</p><p>\u201cRob?\u201d I whisper, and he moans quietly. My arms are shaking from holding my weight up for so long so I stand up. \u201cDo you want me to take my dress off?\u201d</p><p>Silence. My heart is beating fast, and even though the room is cold, sweat is tickling my underarms. \u201cRob?\u201d I repeat.</p> <p>All of a sudden he lets out an enormous, honking snore and rolls over. The snores continue, long waves of them.</p><p>For a while I just stand there and listen to it. When Rob snores it\u2019s always reminded me of when I was little and used to sit on the front porch and watch my dad make narrow circles on the back of his six-year-old Sears ride-on mower, which growled so badly I had to cover my ears. I never went inside, though. I loved to watch the neat little compact tracks of green my dad left in his wake, hundreds of tiny blades of grass spinning through the air like ballerinas.</p><p>It\u2019s so dark in the room it takes me forever to find my bra and stupid fur thing; I have to grope on my hands and knees for them. I\u2019m not upset. I\u2019m not feeling much of anything, not really thinking, just ticking off things I have to do. Find the bra. Hitch up the dress. Get out the door.</p><p>I slip into the hallway. The music\u2019s pumping at a normal volume, and people are flowing in and out of the back room. Juliet Sykes is gone.</p><p>A couple of people give me weird looks. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m a mess but don\u2019t have the energy to care. It\u2019s amazing how well I\u2019m holding it together, actually, and even though my brain is foggy I think that very clearly: It\u2019s amazing how well you\u2019re holding it together. I think, Lindsay would be proud.</p> <p>\u201cYour dress isn\u2019t zipped.\u201d Carly Jablonski giggles at me.</p><p>Behind her someone says, \u201cWhat were you doing in there?\u201d</p><p>I ignore them. I just keep moving\u2014floating, really, without really knowing where I\u2019m headed\u2014drifting down the stairs and out onto the wraparound porch and, when the cold hits me like a punch, back into the house and into the kitchen. Suddenly the idea of the dark, quiet house lying peacefully beyond the DO NOT ENTER sign, full of moonlit squares and the quiet tickings of old clocks, seems appealing. So I go that way, beyond the door, through the dining room, through the alcove where Tara spilled the vase, my boots crunching on the glass, into the living room.</p><p>One wall is almost all windows. It faces out onto the front lawn. Outside, the night looks silvery and frosted, all the trees wrapped in a shroud of ice, like they\u2019ve been built out of plaster. I begin to wonder if everything in this world, the world I\u2019m stuck in, is just a replica, a cheap imitation of the real thing. Then I sit down on the carpet\u2014in the exact center of a perfect square of moonlight\u2014and I begin to cry. The first sob is almost a scream.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m there\u2014at least fifteen minutes, since I manage to pretty much cry myself out. In the process I snot all over myself and completely ruin my fur shrug with mascara and face gunk. But at a certain point I become aware that there\u2019s someone else in the room.</p><p>I get very still. Parts of the room are lost in shadow, but I can sense something moving at its periphery. A checkered sneaker flickers in and out of view.</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you been standing there?\u201d I ask, wiping my nose for the fortieth time on the back of my arm.</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d Kent\u2019s voice is very quiet. I can tell he\u2019s lying, but I don\u2019t mind. It actually makes me feel better to know I wasn\u2019t alone this whole time.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He takes a few steps into the room so the moonlight hits him and turns him silver. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re obviously not okay, but I just wanted to know if, you know, there\u2019s anything I could do or something you want to talk about or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKent?\u201d I interrupt him. He always did have a habit of launching into tangents, even when we were little.</p><p>He stops. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2014could I maybe have a glass of water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Give me a sec.\u201d He sounds relieved to do something, and I hear the whisper of his sneakers on the carpet. He\u2019s back in under a minute with a tall glass of water. It has just the right amount of ice cubes.</p><p>After I take a few long gulps I say, \u201cSorry for being back here. The sign and everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Kent sits cross-legged on the carpet next to me, not so close that we\u2019re touching but close enough that I can feel him sitting there. \u201cI mean, the sign was pretty much for other people. You know, to keep people from breaking my parents\u2019 shit or whatever. I\u2019ve never really had a party before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you have one now?\u201d I say, just to keep him talking.</p><p>He gives a half laugh. \u201cI thought if I had a party, you would come.\u201d</p><p>I feel a rush of embarrassment, heat spreading up from my toes. His comment is so unexpected I don\u2019t know what to say. He doesn\u2019t seem embarrassed though. He just sits there looking at me. So typical Kent. He never understood that you can\u2019t just say something like that.</p><p>The silence has lasted a couple beats too long. I grasp for something to say. \u201cThis room must get a lot of light during the day.\u201d</p><p>Kent laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in the middle of the sun.\u201d</p><p>Silence again. We can still hear the music, but it\u2019s muffled, like it has to travel miles before it reaches us. I like that.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d Just trying to say what I want to say makes a lump swell up in my throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about earlier. I really\u2014thanks for making me feel better. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve always been...\u201d At the last second I can\u2019t say it after all. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve always been awful. I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s something wrong with me.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said earlier,\u201d Kent says quietly. \u201cAbout your hair.\u201d</p><p>He shifts slightly\u2014a fraction of an inch, moving closer\u2014and it hits me then that I\u2019m sitting in the middle of a moonlit room with Kent McFuller.</p><p>\u201cI should go.\u201d I stand up. I\u2019m still not very steady on my feet, and the room tilts with me.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Kent gets up, reaching out a hand to steady me. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d It occurs to me I don\u2019t know where to go and I have no body to get me there, anyway. I can\u2019t stand the thought of Tara grinning at me, and Lindsay\u2019s obviously out. At this point it\u2019s so awful it\u2019s funny, and I let out a short laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d</p><p>Kent doesn\u2019t ask why. I\u2019m grateful for that. He just shoves his hands in his pockets. The outlines of his face are touched with light, like he\u2019s glowing.</p><p>\u201cYou could...\u201d He swallows. \u201cYou could always stay here.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. Thank God it\u2019s dark. I have no idea what my face looks like.</p><p>He quickly stutters, \u201cNot, like, stay with me. Obviously not. I just meant\u2014well, we have a couple guest rooms, with sheets already on the beds and stuff. Clean sheets, obviously, it\u2019s not like we leave them on after people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014use them, that would be gross. We actually have a housekeeper who comes twice a week and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKent? I said okay. I mean, I\u2019d like to stay. If you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He stands there for a second with his mouth hanging open as though he\u2019s sure he\u2019s misheard me. Then he takes his hands out of his pockets, curls them and uncurls them, lifts them and drops them against his thighs. \u201cSure, yeah, no, that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>But for another minute he doesn\u2019t move. He just stares at me. The hotness returns, only this time it\u2019s moving into my head, making everything seem cloudy and remote. My eyes are suddenly heavy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d he says, and his voice is soft again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He reaches out his hand and without thinking I take it. It\u2019s warm and dry, and as he leads me deeper into the house, away from the music, into the shadows, I close my eyes and remember how he used to slip his hand in mine and whisper, Don\u2019t listen to them. Just keep walking. Keep your head up. It almost feels like no time has passed. It doesn\u2019t feel crazy that I\u2019m holding hands with Kent McFuller and I\u2019m letting him lead me somewhere\u2014it feels normal.</p><p>The music fades away altogether. Everything is so quiet. Our feet barely make a sound on the carpets, and each room is a web of shadow and moonlight. The house smells like polished wood and rain and just a little bit like chimney smoke, like someone\u2019s recently had a fire. I think, This would be a perfect house to get snowed into.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Kent says. He pushes open a door\u2014it creaks on its hinges\u2014and I hear him fumbling for a light switch on the wall.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say.</p><p>He hesitates. \u201cNo light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo light.\u201d</p><p>Very slowly he guides me inside the room. Here it\u2019s almost completely dark. I can barely make out the outline of his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThe bed\u2019s over here.\u201d</p><p>I let him pull me over to him. We\u2019re only inches away, and it\u2019s like I can feel his impression in the darkness, like it\u2019s taking on a form around him. We\u2019re still holding hands, but now we\u2019re face-to-face. I never realized how tall he was: at least four inches taller than I am. There\u2019s the strangest amount of warmth coming off him. It\u2019s everywhere, radiating outward, making my fingers tingle.</p><p>\u201cYour skin,\u201d I say, barely a whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always this way,\u201d he says. Something rustles in the dark and I know he has moved his arm. His fingers hover half an inch from my face, and it\u2019s like I can see them, burning hot and white. He drops his arm, taking the warmth with him.</p><p>And it\u2019s the weirdest thing, but standing there with Kent McFuller in a room so pitch-black it could be buried somewhere, I feel the tiniest of tiny things spark inside me, a little flame at the very bottom of my stomach that makes me unafraid.</p><p>\u201cThere are extra blankets in the closet,\u201d he says. His lips are right by my cheek.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>He stays until I\u2019ve gotten into bed, and then he draws up the blankets around my shoulders like it\u2019s normal, like he\u2019s been putting me to bed every night of my whole life. Typical Kent McFuller.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>You see, I was still looking for answers then. I still wanted to know why. As though somebody was going to answer that for me, as though any answer would be satisfying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not then, but afterward, I started to think about time, and how it keeps moving and draining and flowing forever forward, seconds into minutes into days into years, all of it leading to the same place, a current running forever in one direction. And we\u2019re all going and swimming as fast as we can, helping it along.</p><p>My point is: maybe you can afford to wait. Maybe for you there\u2019s a tomorrow. Maybe for you there\u2019s one thousand tomorrows, or three thousand, or ten, so much time you can bathe in it, roll around in it, let it slide like coins through your fingers. So much time you can waste it.</p><p>But for some of us there\u2019s only today. And the truth is, you never really know.</p><p>I wake up gasping, the alarm bringing me out of darkness, as if it has brought me up from the depths of a lake. It is the fifth time I\u2019ve woken up on February 12, but today I\u2019m relieved. I switch off the alarm and lie in bed, watching the milky white light steal slowly over the walls, waiting for my heartbeat to go back to normal. A swath of sunlight ticks upward over the collage Lindsay made for me. In the bottom she\u2019s written in pink glittery ink, Love you 4ever. Today Lindsay and I are friends again. Today no one\u2019s angry at me. Today I didn\u2019t kiss Mr. Daimler or sit bawling my eyes out alone at a party.</p> <p>Well, not totally alone. I imagine the sun filling Kent\u2019s house slowly, frothing upward like champagne.</p><p>As I lie there I start making a mental list of all the things I\u2019d like to do in my life, as though they\u2019re still possible. Most of them are just plain crazy, but I don\u2019t think about that, just go on listing and listing like it\u2019s as easy as writing up what you need from the grocery store. Fly in a private jet. Eat a fresh-baked croissant from a bakery in Paris. Ride a horse all the way from Connecticut to California but stay in only the best hotel rooms along the way. Some of them are simpler: take Izzy to Goose Point, a place I discovered the first and only time I\u2019d ever tried to run away. Order the Fat Feast at the diner\u2014a bacon cheese-burger, a milk shake, and an entire plate of cheese fries\u2014and eat it without stressing, like I used to do on my birthday every single year. Run around in the rain. Have scrambled eggs in bed.</p><p>By the time Izzy slinks into my room and hops up into bed with me, I\u2019m actually feeling calm.</p><p>\u201cMommy says you have to go to school,\u201d Izzy says, head-butting my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to school.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s it: that\u2019s how it starts. One of the best\u2014and worst\u2014days of my life starts with those five words.</p><p>I grab Izzy\u2019s stomach and tickle her. She still insists on wearing her old Dora the Explorer T-shirt, but it\u2019s so small it leaves the big pink stripe of her belly\u2014the only fat on her body\u2014exposed. She squeals with laughter, rolling away from me.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Sam. I said, Stop it!\u201d</p><p>Izzy is shrieking and laughing and thrashing around when my mom comes to the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s six forty-five.\u201d She stands in the doorway, keeping both of her feet neatly aligned just behind the flaking red line from all those years ago. \u201cLindsay will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>Izzy slaps my hands away and sits up, her eyes shining. I\u2019ve never noticed it before, but she really does look like my mom. It makes me sad for a minute. I wish she looked more like me. \u201cSam was tickling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSam\u2019s going to be late. You too, Izzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s not going to school. And I\u2019m not either.\u201d Izzy puffs out her chest like she\u2019s prepared to do battle over it. Maybe she\u2019ll look like me when she\u2019s older. Maybe when time starts marching forward again\u2014even if I get swept out with it, like litter on a tide\u2014her cheekbones will get high and she\u2019ll have a growth spurt and her hair will turn darker. I like to think it\u2019s true. I like to think that later on people will say, Izzy looks just like her sister, Sam.</p><p>They\u2019ll say, You remember Sam? She was pretty. I\u2019m not really sure what else they could say: She was nice. People liked her. She was missed. Maybe none of those things.</p><p>I push the thought out of my mind and return to my mental list. A kiss that makes my whole head feel like it\u2019s exploding. A slow dance in the middle of an empty room to really great music. A swim in the ocean at midnight, with no clothes on.</p><p>My mom rubs her forehead. \u201cIzzy, go get your breakfast. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s ready by now.\u201d</p><p>Izzy scrambles over me. I squeeze the chub of her stomach and get one last squeal out of her before she jumps off the bed and dashes out the door. The one thing that can get Izzy moving that quickly is a toasted cinnamon raisin bagel with peanut butter, and I imagine being able to give her a cinnamon raisin bagel with peanut butter every single day for the rest of her life, filling a whole house with them.</p><p>When Izzy\u2019s gone my mom looks at me, hard. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about, Sam? You feel sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d One thing that is not on my wish list is to spend even one second in a doctor\u2019s office.</p> <p>\u201cWhat, then? There must be something. I thought Cupid Day was one of your favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Or, I mean, it was.\u201d I sit up on my elbows. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s kind of stupid, if you think about it.\u201d</p><p>She raises her eyebrows.</p><p>I start rattling on, not really thinking about what I want to say before I say it, but afterward I realize it\u2019s true. \u201cThe whole point is just to show other people how many friends you have. But everybody knows how many friends everybody else has. And it\u2019s not like you actually get more friends this way or, I don\u2019t know, get closer to the friends you do have.\u201d</p><p>My mom smiles a tiny bit, one side of her mouth cocking upward. \u201cWell, you\u2019re lucky to have very good friends, and to know it. I\u2019m sure the roses are very meaningful to some people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, the whole thing is kind of sleazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like the Samantha Kingston I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, maybe I\u2019m changing.\u201d I don\u2019t mean those words either, until I hear them. Then I think that they might be true, and I feel a flicker of hope. Maybe there\u2019s still a chance for me, after all. Maybe I have to change.</p><p>My mom stares at me with this expression on her face like I\u2019m a recipe she can\u2019t quite master. \u201cDid something happen, Sam? Something with your friends?\u201d</p><p>Today I\u2019m not so annoyed at her for asking. Today it strikes me as kind of funny, actually. I so wish that the only thing bothering me was a fight with Lindsay, or something dumb Ally said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my friends.\u201d I grasp for something that\u2019ll make her cave. \u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s Rob.\u201d</p><p>My mom wrinkles her brow. \u201cDid you have a fight?\u201d</p><p>I slump a little farther down into the bed, hoping it makes me look depressed. \u201cHe...he dumped me.\u201d In some ways it\u2019s not a lie. Not like he broke up with me, exactly, but like maybe we weren\u2019t ever serious serious in the way I believed for so long. Is it even possible to go out with someone seriously who doesn\u2019t really know you?</p><p>It works even better than I expected. My mom brings her hand up to her chest. \u201cOh, sweetie. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted different things, I guess.\u201d I fiddle with the edge of my comforter, thinking of all those nights alone with him in the basement, bathed in blue light, feeling sheltered from the whole world. It\u2019s not so much of a stretch to look upset when I think about that, and my bottom lip starts to tremble. \u201cI don\u2019t think he ever really liked me. Not really really.\u201d This is the most honest thing I\u2019ve said to my mother in years, and I suddenly feel very exposed. I have a flashback then of standing in front of her when I was five or six and having to strip naked while she checked me all over for deer ticks. I shove down farther into the covers, balling up my fists until my nails dig into my palms.</p><p>Then the craziest thing in the world happens. My mom steps straight over the flaking red line and strides over to the bed, like it\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019m so surprised I don\u2019t even protest as she bends over me and plants a kiss on my forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sam.\u201d She smoothes my forehead with her thumb. \u201cOf course you can stay home.\u201d</p><p>I expected more of an argument and I\u2019m left speechless.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stay home with you?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I try to give her a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to stay home with Sam!\u201d Izzy has come to the door again, this time halfway dressed for school. She\u2019s in a yellow-and-pink phase\u2014not a flattering combination, but it\u2019s kind of hard to explain color palettes to an eight-year-old\u2014and has pulled on a mustard yellow dress over a pair of pink tights. She\u2019s also wearing big, scrunchie yellow socks. She looks like some kind of tropical flower. A part of me is tempted to freak out at my mom for letting Izzy wear whatever she wants. The other kids must make fun of her.</p><p>Then again, I guess Izzy doesn\u2019t care. That\u2019s another thing that strikes me as funny: that my eight-year-old sister is braver than I am. She\u2019s probably braver than most of the people at Thomas Jefferson. I wonder if that will ever change, if it will get beaten out of her.</p><p>Izzy\u2019s eyes are enormous and she clasps her hands together like she\u2019s praying. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>My mom sighs, exasperated. \u201cAbsolutely not, Izzy. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling sick,\u201d Izzy says. This is made slightly unbelievable by the fact that she\u2019s hopping and pirouetting from foot to foot as she says it, but Izzy\u2019s never been a great liar.</p><p>\u201cDid you eat your breakfast yet?\u201d My mom crosses her arms and makes her \u201cstrict parent\u201d face.</p><p>Izzy bobs her head. \u201cI think I have food poisoning.\u201d She doubles over, grabs her stomach, then immediately straightens up and begins hopping again. I can\u2019t help it; a little giggle escapes.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mom,\u201d I say. \u201cLet her stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, please don\u2019t encourage her.\u201d My mom turns to me, shaking her head, but I can tell she\u2019s wavering.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in third grade,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they actually learn anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes we do!\u201d Izzy crows, then claps her hand over her mouth when I give her a look. My little sister: apparently not a champion negotiator, either. She shakes her head and quickly stutters. \u201cI mean, we don\u2019t do that much.\u201d</p><p>My mom lowers her voice. \u201cYou know she\u2019ll be bugging you all day, right? Wouldn\u2019t you rather be alone?\u201d</p><p>I know she\u2019s expecting me to say yes. For years that\u2019s been the buzzword of the house: Sam just wants to be left alone. Want some dinner? I\u2019ll bring it up to my room. Where you headed? Just want to be alone. Can I come in? Just leave me alone. Stay out of my room. Don\u2019t talk to me when I\u2019m on the phone. Don\u2019t talk to me when I\u2019m listening to music. Alone, alone, alone.</p><p>Things change after you die, though\u2014I guess because dying is about the loneliest thing you can do.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d I say, and I mean it. My mom throws up her hands and says, \u201cWhatever,\u201d but even before it\u2019s out of her mouth, Izzy\u2019s charging through my room and has belly flopped on top of me, throwing her arms around my neck and screeching, \u201cCan we watch TV? Can we make mac and cheese?\u201d She smells like coconut as usual, and I remember when she was so small we could fit her in the sink to give her a bath, and she would sit there laughing and smiling and splashing like the best place in the world to be was in a 12\" \u00d7 18\" square of porcelain, like the sink was the biggest ocean in the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mom gives me a look that says, You asked for it.</p><p>I smile over Izzy\u2019s shoulder and shrug.</p><p>And it\u2019s as easy as that.</p><p>INTO THE WOODS</p> <p>It\u2019s weird how much people change. For example, when I was a kid I loved all of these things\u2014like horses and the Fat Feast and Goose Point\u2014and over time all of them just fell away, one after another, replaced by friends and IMing and cell phones and boys and clothes. It\u2019s kind of sad, if you think about it. Like there\u2019s no continuity in people at all. Like something ruptures when you hit twelve, or thirteen, or whatever the age is when you\u2019re no longer a kid but a \u201cyoung adult,\u201d and after that you\u2019re a totally different person. Maybe even a less happy person. Maybe even a worse one.</p><p>Here\u2019s how I first discovered Goose Point: one time before Izzy was born my parents refused to buy me this little purple bike with a pink flowered basket on it and a bell. I don\u2019t remember why\u2014maybe I already had a bike\u2014but I flipped out and decided to run away. Here are the basic two rules of running away successfully:</p><p>Go somewhere you know.</p><p>Go somewhere nobody else knows.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know these two rules then, obviously, and I think my goal was the opposite: to go somewhere I didn\u2019t know and then be discovered by my parents, who would feel so bad they\u2019d agree to buy me whatever I wanted, including the bike (and maybe a pony).</p> <p>It was May, and warm. Every day the light lasted longer and longer. One afternoon I packed my favorite duffel bag and snuck out the back door. (I remember thinking I was smart for avoiding the front yard, where my father was doing yard work.) I also remember exactly what I packed: a flashlight; a sweatshirt; a bathing suit; an entire package of Oreos; a copy of my favorite book, Matilda; and an enormous fake pearl-and-gold necklace my mom had given me to wear on Halloween that year. I didn\u2019t know where I was going, so I just went straight, over the deck and down the stairs and across the backyard, into the woods that separated our property from our neighbor\u2019s. I followed the woods for a while, feeling really sorry for myself and half hoping that some hugely rich person would spot me and take pity on me and adopt me and buy me a whole garage full of purple bicycles.</p><p>But then after a while, I got kind of into it, the way kids do. The sun was hazy and gold. All the leaves looked like they were haloed in light, and there were tiny birds darting everywhere, and layers and layers of velvet-green moss under my feet. All of the houses dropped away. I was deep in the woods, and imagined I was the only person who\u2019d ever come this far. I imagined I would live there forever, sleeping on a bed of moss, wearing flowers in my hair and living in harmony with the bears and foxes and unicorns. I came to a stream and had to cross it. I climbed an enormous, high hill, as big as a mountain.</p><p>At the top of the hill was the biggest rock I\u2019d ever seen. It curved upward and out from the hillside like the potbellied hull of a ship, but it had a top as flat as a table. I don\u2019t remember much about that first trip other than eating Oreos, one after another, and feeling like I owned that whole portion of the woods. I also remember that when I came home, my stomach cramping from all the cookies, I was disappointed my parents hadn\u2019t been more worried about me. I was positive I\u2019d stayed away for hours and hours and hours, but the clock showed I\u2019d been gone less than forty minutes. I decided then that the rock was special: that time didn\u2019t move there.</p><p>I went there a lot that summer, whenever I needed to escape, and the summer after that. One time I was lying stretched out on top of the rock, staring at the sky all pink and purple like the stretch taffy at carnivals, and I saw hundreds of geese migrating, a perfect V. A single feather floated down through the air and landed directly next to my hand. I christened the place Goose Point, and for years kept the feather in a small, decorative box wedged into one of the stone ridges running along its underbelly. Then one day the box was gone. I figured it had been blown away during a storm, and searched through the leaves and undergrowth for hours and, when I couldn\u2019t find it, cried.</p><p>Even after I quit horseback riding, I climbed up to Goose Point sometimes, though I went less and less. I went there one time in sixth grade after all the boys in gym class rated my butt as \u201ctoo square.\u201d I went there when I wasn\u2019t invited to Lexa Hill\u2019s sleepover birthday party, even though we\u2019d been partners in science class and spent four months giggling over how cute Jon Lippincott was. Each time I came back home, less time had passed than I expected. Each time, I still told myself, though I knew it was stupid, that Goose Point was special.</p><p>Then one day Lindsay Edgecombe came into Tara Flute\u2019s kitchen when I was standing there and put her face to mine and whispered, \u201cDo you want to see something?\u201d and in that moment my life changed forever. Since that day I\u2019d never once been back.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s why I decide to take Izzy there, even though it\u2019s absolutely freezing outside. I want to see if it\u2019s still the same at all, or if I am. It\u2019s important to me, for some reason. And besides, of all the things on my mental checklist, it\u2019s the easiest. It\u2019s not like a private jet\u2019s just going to park itself outside my house. And skinny-dipping now will get me arrested or give me pneumonia or both.</p><p>So I guess this is the next best thing. And I guess that\u2019s when it starts to hit me: the whole point is, you do what you can.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is the right way?\u201d Izzy\u2019s bobbing next to me, wrapped in so many layers she looks like the abominable snowman. As usual she has insisted on accessorizing, and is wearing pink-and-black leopard-spotted earmuffs and two different scarves.</p><p>\u201cThis is the right way,\u201d I say, even though at first I was positive we were in the wrong place. Everything is so small. The stream\u2014a thin, frozen black trickle of water, and cobwebbed all over with ice\u2014is no wider than a single step. The hill beyond it slopes gently upward, even though in my memory it\u2019s always been a mountain.</p><p>But the worst part is the new construction. Someone bought the land back here, and there are two houses in different stages of completion. One of them is just a skeleton, rising out of the ground, all bleached wood and splinters and spikes, like a shipwreck washed up onto land. The other one is nearly finished. It\u2019s enormous and blank-looking, like Ally\u2019s house, and it squats there on the hill like it\u2019s staring at us. It takes me a while to realize why: there are no blinds on any of the windows yet.</p><p>I feel heavy with disappointment. Coming here was obviously a bad idea, and I\u2019m reminded of something my English teacher, Mrs. Harbor, once said during one of her random tangents. She said that the reason you can never go home again\u2014we were studying a list of famous quotes and discussing their meaning, and that was one of them, by Thomas Wolfe, \u201cYou can\u2019t go home again\u201d\u2014isn\u2019t necessarily that places change, but that people do. So nothing ever looks the same.</p><p>I\u2019m about to suggest we turn around, but Izzy has already leaped across the stream and is scampering up the hill.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d she yells back over her shoulder. And then, when she\u2019s only another fifty feet from the top, \u201cI\u2019ll race you!\u201d</p> <p>At least Goose Point is as big as I remember it. Izzy hoists herself up onto the flat top, and I climb up after her, my fingers already numb in my gloves. The surface of the rock is covered with brittle, frozen leaves and a layer of frost. There\u2019s enough room for both of us to stretch out, but Izzy and I huddle close together so we\u2019ll stay warm.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d I say. \u201cYou think it\u2019s a good hiding place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best.\u201d Izzy tilts her head back to look at me. \u201cYou really think time goes slower here?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI used to think that when I was little.\u201d I look around. I hate how you can see houses from here now. It used to feel so remote, so secret. \u201cIt used to be a lot different. A lot better. There weren\u2019t any houses, for one. So you really felt like you were in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this way if you have to pee, you can go and knock on someone\u2019s door and just ask.\u201d She lisps all of her s\u2019s: thith, thomeone, jutht, athk.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d We sit for a second in silence. \u201cIzzy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo\u2014do the other kids ever make fun of you? For how you talk?\u201d</p><p>I feel her stiffen underneath her layers and layers. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you do something about it?\u201d I say. \u201cYou could learn to talk differently, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this is my voice.\u201d She says it quietly but with insistence. \u201cHow would you be able to tell when I was talking?\u201d</p><p>This is such a weird Izzy-answer I can\u2019t think of a response to it, so I just reach forward and squeeze her. There are so many things I want to tell her, so many things she doesn\u2019t know: like how I remember when she first came home from the hospital, a big pink blob with a perma-smile, and she used to fall asleep while grabbing on to my pointer finger; how I used to give her piggyback rides up and down the beach on Cape Cod, and she would tug on my ponytail to direct me one way or the other; how soft and furry her head was when she was first born; that the first time you kiss someone you\u2019ll be nervous, and it will be weird, and it won\u2019t be as good as you want it to be, and that\u2019s okay; how you should only fall in love with people who will fall in love with you back. But before I can get any of it out, she\u2019s scrambling away from me on her hands and knees, squealing.</p><p>\u201cLook, Sam!\u201d She slides up close to the edge and pries at something wedged in a fissure of rock. She turns around on her knees, holding it out triumphantly: a feather, pale white, edged with gray, damp with frost.</p><p>I feel like my heart is breaking in that second because I know I\u2019ll never be able to tell her any of the things I need to. I don\u2019t even know where to begin. Instead I take the feather from her and zip it into one of the pockets of my North Face jacket. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it safe,\u201d I say. Then I lie back on the freezing stone and stare up at the sky, which is just beginning to darken as the storm moves in. \u201cWe should go home soon, Izzy. It\u2019s going to rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d She lies down next to me, putting her head in the crook of my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAre you warm enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s actually not so cold once we\u2019re huddled next to each other, and I unzip my jacket a little at the neck. Izzy rolls over on one elbow and reaches out, tugging on my gold bird necklace.</p><p>\u201cHow come Grandma didn\u2019t give me anything?\u201d she says. This is an old routine.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t alive yet, birdbrain.\u201d</p><p>Izzy keeps on tugging. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Grandma nice?\u201d This is also part of the routine.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she was nice.\u201d I don\u2019t remember much about her either, actually\u2014she died when I was seven\u2014except the motion of her hands through my hair when she brushed it, and the way she always sang show tunes, no matter what she was doing. She used to bake enormous orange-chocolate muffins, too, and she always made mine the biggest. \u201cYou would have liked her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Izzy blows air out between her lips. \u201cI wish nobody ever died,\u201d she says.</p><p>I feel an ache in my throat, but I manage to smile. Two conflicting desires go through me at the same time, each as sharp as a razorblade: I want to see you grow up and Don\u2019t ever change. I put my hand on the top of her head. \u201cIt would get pretty crowded, Fizz,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d move into the ocean,\u201d Izzy says matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cI used to lie here like this all summer long,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019d come up here and just stare at the sky.\u201d</p> <p>She rolls over on her back so she\u2019s staring up as well. \u201cBet this view hasn\u2019t changed much, has it?\u201d</p><p>What she says is so simple I almost laugh. She\u2019s right, of course. \u201cNo. This looks exactly the same.\u201d</p><p>I suppose that\u2019s the secret, if you\u2019re ever wishing for things to go back to the way they were. You just have to look up.</p><p>THROUGH THE DARK</p><p>I check my phone when I get home: three new text messages. Lindsay, Elody, and Ally have each texted me the exact same thing: Cupid Day &lt;3 U. They were probably together when they sent it. That\u2019s a thing we sometimes do, type up and send the exact same messages at exactly the same time. It\u2019s stupid, but it makes me smile. I don\u2019t reply, though. In the morning I sent Lindsay a text letting her know she should go to school without me, but even though we\u2019re not fighting today, I felt weird tacking our usual \u201cxxo\u201d at the end. Somewhere\u2014in some alternate time or place or life or something\u2014I\u2019m still mad at her and she\u2019s mad at me.</p> <p>It amazes me how easy it is for things to change, how easy it is to start off down the same road you always take and wind up somewhere new. Just one false step, one pause, one detour, and you end up with new friends or a bad reputation or a boyfriend or a breakup. It\u2019s never occurred to me before; I\u2019ve never been able to see it. And it makes me feel, weirdly, like maybe all of these different possibilities exist at the same time, like each moment we live has a thousand other moments layered underneath it that look different.</p><p>Maybe Lindsay and I are best friends and we hate each other, both. Maybe I\u2019m only one math class away from being a slut like Anna Cartullo. Maybe I am like her, deep down. Maybe we all are: just one lunch period away from eating alone in the bathroom. I wonder if it\u2019s ever really possible to know the truth about someone else, or if the best we can do is just stumble into each other, heads down, hoping to avoid collision. I think of Lindsay in the bathroom of Rosalita\u2019s, and wonder how many people are clutching secrets like little fists, like rocks sitting in the pits of their stomachs. All of them, maybe.</p><p>The fourth text is from Rob and it just says, R u sick? I delete it and then shut off my phone.</p><p>Izzy and I spend the rest of the afternoon watching old DVDs, mostly old Disney and Pixar movies we both love, like The Little Mermaid and Finding Nemo. We make popcorn with extra butter and Tabasco sauce, the way my dad always makes it, and hunker down in the den with all the lights off while the sky outside grows darker and the trees start to whip around in the wind. When my mom comes home we petition her for a Formaggio Friday\u2014we used to go to the same Italian restaurant every Friday night and that\u2019s what we called it, because the restaurant (which had checked red-and-white plastic tablecloths and an accordion player and fake plastic roses on the tables) was so cheesy\u2014and she says she\u2019ll think about it, which means we\u2019re going.</p><p>It\u2019s been forever since I\u2019ve been at home on a weekend night, and when my dad comes home and sees Izzy and me piled on the couch, he staggers through the door, clutching at his heart like he\u2019s having a heart attack.</p><p>\u201cIs it a hallucination?\u201d he says, setting down his briefcase. \u201cCould it be? Samantha Kingston? Home? On a Friday?\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Did you do a lot of acid in the sixties? Could be a flashback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was two years old in 1960. I came too late for the party.\u201d He leans down and pecks me on the head. I pull away out of habit. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not even going to ask how you know about acid flashbacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an acid flashback?\u201d Izzy crows.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d my dad and I say at the same time, and he smiles at me.</p><p>We do end up going to Formaggio\u2019s (official name: Luigi\u2019s Italian Home Kitchen), which actually isn\u2019t Formaggio\u2019s (or Luigi\u2019s) anymore and hasn\u2019t been for years. Five years ago a sushi restaurant moved in and replaced all of the fake art-deco tiles and glass lanterns with sleek metal tables and a long oak bar. It doesn\u2019t matter, though. It will always be Formaggio\u2019s to me.</p><p>The restaurant is super crowded, but we get one of the best tables, right next to the big tanks of exotic fish that sit next to the windows. As usual my dad makes a bad joke about how much he loves see-food restaurants, and my mother tells him to stick to architecture and leave comedy to the professionals. At dinner my mom\u2019s extra nice to me because she thinks I\u2019m going through breakup trauma, and Izzy and I order half the menu and wind up full on edamame and shrimp shumai and tempura and seaweed salad before the meal even comes. My dad has two beers and gets tipsy and entertains us with stories about crazy clients, and my mom keeps telling me to order whatever I want, and Izzy puts a napkin over her head and pretends to be a pilgrim tasting California rolls for the first time.</p><p>Up until then it\u2019s a good day\u2014one of the best. Close to perfect, really, even though nothing special happened at all. I guess I\u2019ve probably had a lot of days like this, but somehow they\u2019re never the ones you remember. That seems wrong to me now. I think of lying in Ally\u2019s house in the dark and wondering whether I\u2019ve ever had a day worth reliving. It seems to me like living this one again and again wouldn\u2019t be so bad, and I imagine that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do\u2014just go on like this, over and over, until time winds completely down, until the universe stops.</p><p>Just before we get our dessert, a big group of freshmen and sophomores I recognize from Jefferson come filing in. A few of them are still wearing JV swim jackets. They must have had a late meet. They seem so young, hair scraped away from their faces, ponytails, no makeup\u2014totally different from the way they look when they show up to our parties, when it looks like they\u2019ve just spent an hour and a half getting freebies at the MAC counter. A couple of them catch me staring and drop their eyes.</p> <p>\u201cGreen tea and red bean ice cream.\u201d The waitress sets down a big bowl and four spoons in front of us. Izzy goes to town on the red bean.</p><p>My dad groans and puts a hand on his stomach. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can still be hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrowing girl.\u201d Izzy opens her mouth, showing off the ice cream mushed on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cGross, Izzy.\u201d I pick up my spoon and scoop a little bit from the green-tea side.</p><p>\u201cSykes! Hey! Sykes!\u201d</p><p>I whip around at the sound of her name. One of the swim-team girls is half standing out of her chair, waving. I scan the restaurant, looking for Juliet, but there\u2019s only one person at the door. She\u2019s thin and pale and very blond, and she\u2019s standing and shaking her shoulders to get the rain off her jacket. It takes me a second to recognize her, but as she turns a complete circle, looking for her friends, I do: the Cupid from math class\u2014the angel who delivered my roses.</p><p>When she sees the rest of her teammates, she raises her hand briefly and gives a quick flutter of her fingers. Then she starts threading her way over to them, and as she moves past our table, I catch a glimpse of her neon-blue-and-orange swim jacket and it\u2019s like the whole room goes still and only those five letters remain, lit up like signs.</p><p>SYKES.</p><p>Juliet\u2019s little sister.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Sammy.\u201d Izzy is poking me with the butt end of her spoon. \u201cYour ice cream\u2019s getting melty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hungry anymore.\u201d I put my spoon down and push away from the table.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Mom reaches out and puts her hand on my wrist, but I barely feel it.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes.\u201d And then I\u2019m walking over to the swim-team table, the whole time staring at the pale girl and her heart-shaped face. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see the resemblance before. They\u2019ve got the same wide-spaced blue eyes, the same translucent skin and pale lips. Then again, until recently I\u2019ve never really looked at Juliet, even though I must have seen her ten thousand times.</p><p>The swim-team girls have gotten their menus, and they\u2019re laughing and swatting each other. I distinctly hear one of them say Rob\u2019s name\u2014probably saying how cute he looks in his lacrosse jersey (I should know; I used to say it all the time). I\u2019ve never cared less about anything. When I\u2019m about four feet away from the table one of them spots me and instantly the whole table goes silent. The girl who was talking about Rob goes the color of the menu she\u2019s holding.</p><p>Little Sykes is squeezed in at the very end of the table. I walk directly up to her.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Now that I\u2019m standing here I\u2019m not exactly sure why I came over. The funniest part about it is that I\u2019m the one who\u2019s nervous. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...did I do something?\u201d Her voice is actually trembling. The rest of the girls aren\u2019t helping. They\u2019re looking at me like they expect at any second I\u2019m going to lunge forward and swallow her head or something.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I just...\u201d I give her a small smile. Now that I see it, the resemblance between her and Juliet unnerves me. \u201cYou have an older sister, right?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth tightens into a thin line, and her eyes go cloudy, like she\u2019s putting up a wall. I don\u2019t blame her. She probably thinks I\u2019m going to pick on her for having a freak for a big sister. It must happen a lot.</p><p>But she tilts up her chin and stares at me straight in the eye. It kind of reminds me of something Izzy would do. Sam\u2019s not going to school, and I\u2019m not going either. \u201cYeah. Juliet Sykes.\u201d Then she waits patiently, waits for me to start laughing.</p><p>Her eyes are so steady I look down. \u201cYeah. I, um, know Juliet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d She raises her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWell, kind of.\u201d All the girls are staring at me now. I have a feeling they\u2019re having a hard time keeping their jaws from dropping open. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2014she\u2019s kind of my lab partner.\u201d</p><p>I figure this is a safe bet. Science is mandatory, and everybody gets assigned lab partners.</p><p>Juliet\u2019s sister\u2019s face relaxes a little bit. \u201cJuliet\u2019s really good at bio. I mean, she\u2019s really good at school.\u201d She lets herself smile. \u201cI\u2019m Marian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Marian is a good name for her: a pure name, somehow. My palms are sweating. I wipe them on my jeans. \u201cI\u2019m Sam.\u201d</p><p>Marian drops her eyes and says shyly, \u201cI know who you are.\u201d</p><p>Two arms circle around my waist. Izzy has come up behind me. The point of her chin pokes me in the side.</p><p>\u201cIce cream\u2019s almost gone,\u201d she says. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want any?\u201d</p><p>Marian smiles at Izzy. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d Izzy says proudly, then sags a little. \u201cBut everybody calls me Izzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was little everybody called me Mary.\u201d Marian makes a face. \u201cBut now everybody calls me Marian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind Izzy that much,\u201d Izzy says, chewing on her lip like she\u2019s just decided it.</p><p>Marian looks up at me. \u201cYou have a little sister too, huh?\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly I can\u2019t stand to look at her. I can\u2019t stand to think about what will happen later. I know: the stillness of the house, the gunshot.</p><p>And then...what? Will she be the first one down the stairs? Will that final image of her sister be the one that lasts, that wipes out whatever other memories she\u2019s stored up over the years?</p><p>I go into a panic, trying to think what kind of memories Izzy has of me\u2014will have of me.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Izzy. Let\u2019s let the girls eat.\u201d My voice is trembling, but I don\u2019t think anyone notices. I pat Izzy on the head and she gallops back toward our table.</p><p>The girls at the table are getting more confident now. Smiles are sprouting up, and they\u2019re all looking at me in awe, like they can\u2019t believe how nice I\u2019m being, like I\u2019ve given them a present. I hate it. They should hate me. If they knew what kind of person I was, they would hate me, I\u2019m sure of it.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know why Kent pops into my head right then, but he does. He would hate me too if he knew everything. The realization makes me strangely upset.</p><p>\u201cTell Juliet not to do it,\u201d I blurt out, and then can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve said it.</p><p>Marian wrinkles her forehead. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScience-project thing,\u201d I say quickly, and then add, \u201cshe\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Marian\u2019s beaming at me. I start to turn away, but she calls me back. \u201cSam!\u201d</p><p>I turn around, and she claps her hand over her mouth and giggles, like she can\u2019t believe she had the courage to say my name.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to tell her tomorrow,\u201d she says. \u201cJuliet\u2019s going out tonight.\u201d She says it like she\u2019s saying, Juliet\u2019s going to be valedictorian. I can just picture the scene. Mom and dad and sister downstairs, Juliet locked in her bedroom as usual, blasting music, alone. And then\u2014miracle of miracles\u2014she descends, hair swept back, confident, cool, announcing she is headed to a party. They must have been so happy, so proud. Their lonely little girl making good at the end of senior year.</p><p>To Kent\u2019s party. To find Lindsay\u2014to find me. To be pushed and tripped and soaked with beer.</p><p>The sushi\u2019s not sitting so well with me all of a sudden. If they had any idea...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely tell her tomorrow, though.\u201d Marian beams at me, a headlight bearing down at me through the dark.</p><p>All the way home I\u2019m trying to forget Marian Sykes. When my dad wishes me good night\u2014he\u2019s always ready to pass out after a beer, and tonight he had (gasp!) two\u2014I\u2019m trying to forget Marian Sykes. When Izzy comes in half an hour later, showered and clean-smelling in her ratty Dora pj\u2019s, and plants a sloppy wet kiss on my cheek, I\u2019m trying to forget her; and an hour after that, when my mother stands at my door and says, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Sam,\u201d I\u2019m still thinking of her.</p><p>My mother goes to bed. Silence fills the house. Somewhere in the deep darkness a clock is ticking, and when I close my eyes I picture Juliet Sykes coming toward me calmly, her shoes tapping against a wood floor, blood flowing from her eyes....</p><p>I sit up in bed, heart pounding. Then I get up, find my North Face in the dark.</p><p>This morning I swore that there was nothing in the world that could make me go back to Kent\u2019s party, but here I am, tiptoeing down the stairs, edging along in the dark hallways, sneaking my mom\u2019s keys off the shelf in the mudroom. She\u2019s been amazingly human today, but the last thing I need to deal with is some big conversation of the what-makes-me-think-I-can-cut-school-and-then-go-out variety.</p> <p>I try to tell myself that Juliet Sykes isn\u2019t really my problem, but I keep imagining how horrible it would be if this were her day. If she had to live it over and over again. I think pretty much everybody\u2014even Juliet Sykes\u2014deserves to die on a better day than that.</p><p>The hinges on the back and front door squawk so loudly they might as well be alarm clocks (sometimes I think my parents have engineered this deliberately). In the kitchen I carefully spill some olive oil on a paper towel, and I rub this onto the hinges on the back door. Lindsay taught me this trick. She\u2019s always developing new, better ways to sneak out, even though she has no curfew, and it doesn\u2019t matter one way or the other when she leaves and when she comes home. I think she misses that, actually. I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s always meticulous about the details\u2014she likes to pretend that she has to be.</p><p>The door with its Italian-seasoned hinges swings open with barely a whisper, and I\u2019m out.</p><p>I haven\u2019t really thought through why I\u2019m heading to Kent\u2019s, or what I\u2019m going to do once I\u2019m there, and instead of driving there directly, I find myself turning on random streets and dead-end cul-de-sacs, circling up and down. The houses are mostly set back from the street, and lit windows appear magically in the dark like hanging lanterns. It\u2019s amazing how different everything looks at night\u2014almost unrecognizable, especially in the rain. Houses sit hulking back on their lawns, brooding and alive. It looks so different from the Ridgeview of the day, when everything is clean and polished and trimmed neatly, when everything unfolds in an orderly way, husbands heading to their cars with coffee mugs, wives following soon after, dressed in pilates gear, tiny girls in Baby Gap dresses and car seats and Lexus SUVs and Starbucks cups and normalcy. I wonder which one is the true version.</p><p>There are hardly any cars on the road. I keep crawling along at fifteen miles per hour. I\u2019m looking for something, but I don\u2019t know what. I pass Elody\u2019s street and keep going. Each streetlamp casts a neat funnel of light downward, illuminating the inside of the car briefly, before I\u2019m left again in darkness.</p><p>My headlights sweep over a crooked green street sign fifty feet ahead: Serenity Place. I suddenly remember sitting in Ally\u2019s kitchen freshman year while her mom chattered on the phone endlessly, pacing back and forth on the deck in bare feet and yoga pants. \u201cShe\u2019s getting her daily dose of gossip,\u201d Ally had said, rolling her eyes. \u201cMindy Sachs is better than Us Weekly.\u201d And Lindsay had put in how ironic it was that Mrs. Sachs lived on Serenity Place\u2014like she doesn\u2019t bring the noise with her\u2014and it was the first time I really understood the meaning of the word ironic.</p><p>I yank my wheel at the last second and brake, rolling down Serenity Place. It\u2019s not a long street\u2014there are no more than two dozen houses on it\u2014and like many streets in Ridgeview, ends in a cul-de-sac. My heart leaps when I see a silver Saab parked neatly in one of the driveways. The license plate reads: MOM OF4. That\u2019s Mrs. Sachs\u2019s car. I must be close.</p><p>The next house down is number fifty-nine. It is marked with a tin mailbox in the shape of a rooster, which stretches up from a flowerbed that is at this point in the year no more than a long patch of black dirt. SYKES is printed along the rooster\u2019s wing, in letters so small you have to be looking before you can see them.</p><p>I can\u2019t really explain it, but I feel like I would have known the house anyway. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it\u2014it\u2019s no different from any other house, not the biggest, not the smallest, decently taken care of, white paint, dark shutters, a single light burning downstairs. But there\u2019s something else, some quality I can\u2019t really identify that makes it look like the house is too big for itself, like something inside is straining to get out, like the whole place is about to bust its seams. It\u2019s a desperate house, somehow.</p><p>I turn into the driveway. I have no business being here, I know that, but I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s like something\u2019s tugging me inside. The rain is coming down hard, and I grab an old sweatshirt from the backseat\u2014Izzy\u2019s, probably\u2014and use it to shield my head as I sprint from the car to the front porch, my breath clouding in front of me. Before I can think too much about what I\u2019m doing, I ring the doorbell.</p><p>It takes a long time for someone to answer the door, and I do a little jog, my breath steaming out in front of me, trying to stay warm. Finally there\u2019s a shuffling sound from inside, and then a scraping of hinges. The door swings open, and a woman stands there, blinking at me confusedly: Juliet\u2019s mother. She is wearing a bathrobe, which she holds closed with one hand. She is as thin as Juliet and has the same clear blue eyes and pale skin as both of her daughters. Looking at her, I am reminded of a wisp of smoke curling up into the dark.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Her voice is very soft.</p><p>I\u2019m kind of thrown. For some reason I expected Marian would be the one to come to the door. \u201cMy name is Sam\u2014Samantha Kingston. I\u2019m looking for Juliet.\u201d Because it worked the first time I add, \u201cShe\u2019s my lab partner.\u201d</p><p>From inside, a man\u2014Juliet\u2019s father, I guess\u2014shouts, \u201cWho is it?\u201d The voice is barking and loud, and so different from Mrs. Sykes\u2019s voice I unconsciously shuffle backward.</p><p>Mrs. Sykes jumps a little, and turns her head quickly, inadvertently swinging the door open an extra couple of inches. The hallway behind her is dark. Swampy blue and green shadows dance up one wall, images projected from a television in a room I can\u2019t see. \u201cIt\u2019s no one,\u201d she says quickly, her voice directed into the darkness behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s for Juliet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuliet? Someone\u2019s here for Juliet?\u201d He sounds exactly like a dog. Bark, bark, bark, bark. I fight a wild, nervous urge to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Mrs. Sykes turns back to me. Again, the door swings closed with her movement, as though she is leaning on it for support. Her smile doesn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. \u201cJuliet\u2019s not home right now. Is there something I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um, missed school today. We had this big assignment....\u201d I trail off helplessly, starting to regret having come. Despite my North Face, I\u2019m shivering like a maniac. I must look like a maniac too, hopping from foot to foot, holding a sweatshirt over my head for an umbrella.</p><p>Mrs. Sykes seems to notice, finally, that I\u2019m standing in the rain. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in,\u201d she says, and steps backward into the hall. I follow her inside.</p><p>An open door to the left leads directly off the hall: that\u2019s where the television is. I can just make out an armchair and the silhouette of someone sitting there, the edge of an enormous jaw touched with blue from the screen. I remember what Lindsay said then, about Juliet\u2019s dad being an alcoholic. I vaguely remember hearing that same rumor, and something else too\u2014that there\u2019d been an accident, something about semi-paralysis or pills or something. I wish I\u2019d paid more attention.</p><p>Mrs. Sykes catches me looking and walks quickly over to the door, pulling it shut. It is now so dark I can barely see, and I realize I\u2019m still cold. If the heat is on in the house, I can\u2019t feel it. From the TV room I hear the sounds of a horror-film scream, and the steady syncopated rhythm of machine gun fire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now I\u2019m definitely regretting coming. For a second I have this wild fantasy that Juliet comes from a whole family of crazy serial killers, and that at any second Mrs. Sykes is going to go Silence of the Lambs on me. The whole family\u2019s wacked, that\u2019s what Lindsay had said. The darkness is pressing all around me, stifling, and I almost cry out with gratitude when Mrs. Sykes switches on a light and the hall appears lit up and normal, and not full of dead human trophies or something. There\u2019s a dried flower arrangement on a side table decorated with lace, next to a framed family photo. I wish I could look at it more closely.</p><p>\u201cWas it important, this assignment?\u201d Mrs. Sykes asks, almost in a whisper. She shoots a nervous glance in the direction of the TV room, and I wonder if she thinks she\u2019s being too loud.</p><p>\u201cI just...I kind of promised Juliet I would pick up some stuff for our makeup presentation on Monday.\u201d I try to lower my voice, but she still winces. \u201cI thought Juliet said she would be home tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuliet went out,\u201d she says, and then, as if she\u2019s unused to saying the words and is testing them on her tongue, repeats, \u201cShe went out. But maybe she left it for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could look for it,\u201d I say. I want to see her room, I realize: that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I need to see it. \u201cShe probably just dumped it on her bed or something.\u201d I try to sound casual, like Juliet and I are on really good terms with each other\u2014like it\u2019s not weird for me to waltz into her house at ten thirty on a Friday night and try to weasel my way into her bedroom.</p><p>Mrs. Sykes hesitates. \u201cMaybe I can call her cell phone,\u201d she says, and then adds apologetically, \u201cJuliet hates to have anyone in her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to call her,\u201d I say quickly. Juliet will probably tell her mom to sic the cops on me. \u201cIt\u2019s not that important. I\u2019ll pick it up tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I\u2019ll call her. It will just take a second.\u201d Juliet\u2019s mom is already disappearing into the kitchen. It\u2019s amazing how quickly and soundlessly she moves, like an animal slipping in and out of the shadows.</p><p>I consider jetting out while she\u2019s in the kitchen. I think about going home, crawling into bed, watching old movies on my computer. Maybe I\u2019ll make a pot of coffee and sit up all night long. If I never go to sleep, maybe today will have to turn into tomorrow. I wonder idly how long I can go without sleep before I flip my shit and start running down the street in my underwear, hallucinating purple spiders.</p> <p>But instead I just stand there, waiting. There\u2019s nothing else to do, so I take a few steps forward and bend down to look at the photograph on the table. For a second I\u2019m confused: it\u2019s a picture of an unfamiliar woman, probably twenty-five or thirty, with her arms wrapped around a good-looking guy in a flannel shirt. The colors are all saturated and Technicolor-bright, and the couple looks perfect, sparkling, all white teeth and dazzling smiles and beautiful brown hair. Then I see the words printed in the lower bottom corner of the picture\u2014ShadowCast Images, Inc.\u2014and realize that this isn\u2019t even a real family photo. It\u2019s one of the generic pictures that gets sold along with the picture frame, a shiny, happy advertisement for all the shiny, happy moments you can capture forever inside the 5\" \u00d7 7\" sterling silver frame with butterfly detail. No one has bothered to replace it.</p><p>Or maybe the Sykes family doesn\u2019t have too many shiny, happy moments to remember.</p><p>I pull away quickly, wishing I hadn\u2019t looked. Even though it\u2019s just a picture of two models, I feel, weirdly, like I\u2019ve seen something way too personal, like I\u2019ve accidentally caught a glimpse of someone\u2019s inner thigh or nose hairs or something.</p><p>Mrs. Sykes still isn\u2019t back so I wander out of the hall into the living room on the right. It is mostly dark, and it\u2019s all plaids and lace and dried flowers. It looks as though it hasn\u2019t been redecorated since the fifties.</p><p>There\u2019s a single, dull light shining near the window, casting a circular reflection on the black pane of glass, a version of the room appearing in miniature there.</p><p>And a face.</p> <p>A screaming face pressed up against the window.</p><p>I let out a squeak of fear before I realize that this, too, is a reflection. There\u2019s a mask mounted on a table just in front of the window, facing outward. I go over to it and lift it carefully from its perch. It\u2019s a woman\u2019s face crafted from newspaper and red stitching, which is crisscrossed over the skin like horrible scars. Words run up the bridge of the nose and across the forehead, certain headlines visible or halfway visible, like BEAUTY REMEDY and TRAGEDY STRIKES, and little scraps of paper are unfurling from various places on her face, like she\u2019s molting. The mouth and the eyes are cut completely away, and when I lift the mask to my face, it fits well. The reflection in the window is awful; I look like something diseased, or a monster from a horror movie. I can\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cJuliet made that.\u201d</p><p>The voice behind me makes me jump. Mrs. Sykes has reappeared and is leaning against the door, frowning at me.</p><p>I pop the mask off, return it quickly to its perch. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I saw it and...I just wanted to try it on,\u201d I finish lamely.</p><p>Mrs. Sykes comes over and rearranges the mask, straightening it, making sure it\u2019s aligned correctly. \u201cWhen Juliet was younger she was always drawing, always sketching or painting something or sewing her own dresses.\u201d Mrs. Sykes shrugs, flutters a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s very interested in that stuff now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Juliet?\u201d I ask nervously, waiting for her to kick me out.</p><p>Mrs. Sykes blinks at me several times, as though trying to squeeze me into focus. \u201cJuliet...\u201d she repeats, and then shakes her head. \u201cI called her phone a couple of times. She didn\u2019t answer. She doesn\u2019t usually go out on the weekends....\u201d Mrs. Sykes looks at me helplessly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine,\u201d I say as cheerfully as I can, feeling like each word is a knife going down into my stomach. \u201cShe probably didn\u2019t hear her phone.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the thing I want most of all is to get out of there. I can\u2019t stand to lie to Mrs. Sykes. She looks so sad, standing in her nightgown, ready for bed\u2014as though she\u2019s already asleep, sort of. That\u2019s what the whole house feels like, as though it\u2019s wrapped up in a heavy sleep, the kind that stifles you, won\u2019t let you wake, drags you back into the sheets, drowning, even when you fight it.</p><p>I imagine Juliet sneaking up to her room in the dark, and the silence, through the atmosphere of sleep so thick it feels solid, the lullaby of creaking floorboards and quietly hissing radiators, the slow revolutions of people orbiting wordlessly around one another.... And then...</p><p>Bang.</p><p>Mrs. Sykes walks me back to the front hall. \u201cYou can come by tomorrow,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sure Juliet will have everything ready by then. She\u2019s usually very responsible. A good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Tomorrow.\u201d I don\u2019t even like to say the word, and I wave a quick good-bye before dashing once again through the dark to my car.</p><p>It\u2019s even colder than it was earlier. The rain, half ice, pings off the hood of my car as I sit there waiting for the engine to warm up, blowing on my hands and shivering, grateful to be out of there. As soon as I\u2019m out of the house, a weight eases up off my chest, like the atmosphere and pressure inside is different, heavier. My first impression was right: it really is a desperate house. I see Juliet\u2019s mom silhouetted by the window. I wonder if she\u2019s waiting for me to leave or for her daughter to come home.</p><p>That\u2019s when I make a decision. I know what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll go to Kent\u2019s house and I\u2019ll catch Juliet, and if I have to, I will hit her in the face. I\u2019ll make her see how stupid the whole death idea is. (It\u2019s certainly no picnic for me.) If it comes down to it, I\u2019ll tie her up in the back of my car so she can\u2019t get her hands on the gun.</p><p>I realize I\u2019ve never really done something good for someone else, at least not for a while. I volunteer sometimes for Meals on Wheels, but that\u2019s because colleges like that kind of thing; BU especially mentioned charity on the application portion of their website. And obviously I\u2019m nice to my friends, and I give great birthday gifts (I once spent a month and a half collecting cow-shaped saltshakers to give to Ally, because she loves cows and salt). But I don\u2019t usually do good things just for the hell of it. This will be my good thing.</p><p>Then I have a glimmer of an idea. I remember when we were studying Dante in English, and Ben Gowan kept asking if the souls in purgatory ever got cast down into hell (Ben Gowan once got suspended for three days for drawing a picture of a bomb blowing up our cafeteria and all of these decapitated heads flying everywhere, so for him the question was normal), and Mrs. Harbor went off on one of her tangents and said that no, that wasn\u2019t possible, but that some modern Christian thinkers believed you could go up from purgatory into heaven once you\u2019d done enough time there. I\u2019ve never really believed in heaven. It always sounded like a crazy idea: everybody happy and reunited, Fred Astaire and Einstein doing a tango on the clouds, that kind of stuff.</p><p>But then again, I never really believed I\u2019d have to relive one day forever, either. It\u2019s no crazier than what\u2019s already happened to me. Maybe the whole point is I have to prove that I\u2019m a good person. Maybe I have to prove that I deserve to move on.</p><p>Maybe Juliet Sykes is the only thing between me and an eternity of chocolate fountains and perfect love and guys who always call when they say they will and banana sundaes that actually help you burn calories.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s my ticket out.</p><p>UNFASHIONABLY LATE</p><p>I don\u2019t even bother pulling into Kent\u2019s driveway. I\u2019m not planning on being here long, and I don\u2019t want to get blocked in. Besides, something about tramping through the woods in the rain appeals to me. It\u2019s a trial, another way I can sacrifice myself. And from my very limited memories of Sunday school (my mom gave up the fight after I threw a tremendous tantrum when I was seven and threatened to convert to voodoo, even though I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what that was), I know that that\u2019s how it works: you have to sacrifice something.</p><p>I pull over onto the shoulder of Route 9, grabbing Izzy\u2019s sweatshirt again, which is now soaking wet. Still, it\u2019s better than nothing. I drape it over my head and get out of the car, pausing for just a second. The road is empty, stretches of black interspersed with weak pools of yellow light from the streetlamps. I try to locate the exact spot where Lindsay\u2019s car went spiraling off the road that first night, but it all looks the same. It could have been anywhere. I reach back once more for some memory of life beyond the collision, beyond the blackness, but I get nothing.</p><p>I grab a flashlight from the trunk and set off through the woods.</p><p>It\u2019s a longer walk than I would have thought, and the ground alternates between a thin coat of hard ice and slurpy gloop that sucks at my purple New Balances like quicksand. After a few minutes I can hear the faint throb of music from the party, pulsing through the darkness like it belongs there, like its rhythm is part of the night. It\u2019s another ten minutes before I see the faint twinkle of lights flashing sporadically beyond the trees\u2014thank God, since I was beginning to think I was walking in circles\u2014and another five before the woods thin out and I can see the house, a big pile of ice-cream cake sitting on that lawn, shimmering in and out as the rain bends and splits the lights from the porch. I\u2019m totally freezing, and 100 percent regretting my decision to come on foot. That\u2019s the whole problem with sacrifice. It\u2019s a pain, literally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as I walk through the door, two girls giggle and a whole group of juniors goes totally gape-jawed. I don\u2019t blame them. I know I must look like shit. Before leaving the house, I didn\u2019t even bother to change out of my lounge pants\u2014a pair of way oversized velour sweats my mom gave me back when they were still in.</p><p>I don\u2019t waste any time on the juniors, though. I\u2019m already worried I may have arrived too late.</p><p>Tara is coming down the stairs as I\u2019m pushing my way up, and I grab her, leaning into her ear. \u201cJuliet Sykes!\u201d I have to yell it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she yells back, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cJuliet Sykes! Is she here?\u201d</p><p>Tara taps her ear to show she can\u2019t hear me. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for Lindsay?\u201d</p><p>Courtney is behind Tara and leans forward, flopping her chin on Tara\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe found the secret stash\u2014rum and stuff. Tara broke a vase.\u201d She giggles. \u201cYou want some?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I\u2019ve never been this sober around people this wasted, and I say a brief prayer that I\u2019m not half as annoying as they are when I\u2019m drunk. I continue up the stairs as Tara yells, \u201cLindsay\u2019s in the back.\u201d</p><p>Before I\u2019m totally out of earshot I hear Courtney shriek, \u201cDid you see what she\u2019s wearing?\u201d</p> <p>I take a deep breath and tell myself it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is finding Juliet. I can at least do that one thing.</p><p>But with every step I\u2019m losing hope. The upstairs hallway is totally packed, and unless she hasn\u2019t come to the party at all\u2014which seems like too much to hope\u2014it seems unlikely that she hasn\u2019t already left.</p><p>Still, I push on, finally making it to the very back room. Lindsay catapults on me as soon as I get into the room\u2014she actually leaps over five people\u2014and for a second I\u2019m so grateful to see her, happy and drunk and my best friend, and to get treated to one of her famous super-squish hugs, that I forget why I\u2019m here.</p><p>\u201cBad girl.\u201d She slaps my hand as she pulls away. \u201cYou cut school but come out to party? Naughty, naughty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for someone,\u201d I say. I scan the room: Juliet\u2019s not here. Not that I expected her to be, I don\u2019t know, sitting on the couch and chatting it up with Jake Somers, but it\u2019s instinct\u2014and wishful thinking\u2014to look.</p><p>\u201cRob\u2019s downstairs.\u201d Lindsay steps back and holds up her hand, framing me in the angle between her thumb and forefinger. \u201cYou look like the homeless man who stole Wal-Mart. Are you trying not to get laid or something?\u201d</p> <p>Irritation flares up again. Lindsay, who always has something to say.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Juliet Sykes?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Lindsay stares at me for a split second and then bursts out laughing. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>A feeling of enormous relief washes over me. Maybe she never showed. Maybe she had car trouble, or lost her nerve, or\u2014</p><p>\u201cShe called me a bitch.\u201d In that moment Lindsay shatters me. She did come. \u201cCan you believe it?\u201d Lindsay\u2019s still cracking up. She loops one arm around my shoulder and calls out, \u201cElody! Ally! Sammy\u2019s here! And she\u2019s looking for her best friend, Juliet!\u201d</p><p>Elody doesn\u2019t even turn around; she\u2019s too busy with Steve Dough. But Ally swings in my direction, smiles, yells, \u201cHi, sweetie!\u201d and then holds up the empty bottle of vodka.</p><p>\u201cIf you see Juliet,\u201d she calls out, \u201cask her what she did with the rest of my drink!\u201d She and Lindsay think this is hilarious, and Lindsay calls back, \u201cPsychotini!\u201d</p><p>I am too late. The realization makes me feel sick, and my anger at Lindsay comes rushing back.</p> <p>\u201cMy best friend?\u201d I repeat. \u201cThat\u2019s funny. I thought you were the one who was buddy-buddy with Juliet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Lindsay\u2019s face gets serious.</p><p>\u201cChildhood friends. Best friends. Rug rats. Sand bunnies.\u201d Lindsay looks like she\u2019s about to say something again, but I cut her off. \u201cI saw the pictures. So what happened? Did she catch you farting or something? See you blow a snot rocket? Discover that the famous Lindsay Edgecombe isn\u2019t perfect after all? What did she do that was so bad?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay opens her mouth and then closes it. \u201cShe\u2019s a freak,\u201d she whispers fiercely, but I see something in her eyes I\u2019ve never seen before, an expression I can\u2019t quite identify.</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I have to find Juliet Sykes.</p><p>I fight my way back downstairs, ignoring the people calling my name, tapping my shoulder, and whispering about the fact that I\u2019ve shown up in public looking like I\u2019m about to go to sleep\u2014which is, of course, exactly what happened. I figure if I\u2019m quick enough I can catch Juliet on the way out. She must have parked somewhere. She\u2019s probably blocked in. It will take an hour to get people to move their cars (if she can even convince anybody to help at all, which is doubtful) and even longer if she decides to hoof it home.</p><p>Thankfully I make it downstairs without a run-in with Rob. The last thing I need is to explain myself to him. There\u2019s a group of sophomores standing near the entryway, looking terrified and more or less sober, so I take my shot with them.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Juliet Sykes?\u201d</p><p>They stare at me blankly.</p><p>I sigh, swallowing my frustration. \u201cBlond hair, blue eyes, tall.\u201d They\u2019re still looking at me vacantly, and I realize I\u2019m not exactly sure how to describe her. Loser, I almost say\u2014I would have said three days ago. But now I can\u2019t get it out. \u201cPretty,\u201d I say, testing the word. When that doesn\u2019t work I squeeze my fists into my palms. \u201cProbably soaking wet.\u201d</p><p>Finally the girls\u2019 faces light up with recognition. \u201cBathroom,\u201d one of them says, pointing to a little alcove just before the kitchen. There\u2019s a line of people gathered in front of a closed door. One of them is crossing her legs and hopping up and down. One of them keeps rapping on the door. One of them points to her watch and says something I can\u2019t hear, but she looks pissed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been in there for, like, twenty minutes,\u201d a sophomore says. My stomach drops to my feet and I almost get sick right there.</p><p>Bathrooms have pills. Bathrooms have razors. People lock themselves in bathrooms when they want to do bad things, like have sex or throw up. Or kill themselves.</p><p>It\u2019s not supposed to go this way. I\u2019m supposed to save you. I elbow over to the bathroom, shoving through the line of people crowded there.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d I say to Joanne Polerno, and she drops her hand immediately and steps aside.</p><p>I press my ear to the door, listening for sounds of crying or retching or anything. Nothing. My stomach does another dip. Then again, it\u2019s almost impossible to hear, with the music pounding so loudly.</p><p>I knock softly and call out, \u201cJuliet? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Chrissy Walker says. I shoot her a look that I hope will communicate how stupidly unhelpful that comment is.</p><p>I knock again, mashing my face against the door. It\u2019s hard to tell whether I hear a faint moan from inside\u2014at that second the music shrieks even louder, drowning out everything else. But I can imagine her there, fading, just beyond the door, wrists hacked up and blood everywhere....</p><p>\u201cGet Kent,\u201d I say, sucking in a long breath.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Joanne says.</p><p>\u201cI have to pee,\u201d Rachel says, hopping up and down.</p><p>\u201cKent McFuller. Now. Do it,\u201d I bark at Joanne, and she looks startled but scurries off into the hallway. Every second feels like an eternity. It\u2019s the first time I really understand what Einstein said about relativity, how time bends around and stretches out like a gummy bear.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care, anyway?\u201d Rachel says, grumbling just loud enough so I can hear.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. The truth is I have no answer, really. I have to save Juliet\u2014I feel that. It\u2019s my good thing. I have to save myself.</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly not sure if that makes me better or worse than someone who does nothing, so I push the thought out of my mind.</p><p>Joanne comes back with Kent in tow. He looks worried, his forehead crinkly underneath the shaggy brown hair that\u2019s falling down over his eyes. My stomach does a flip. Yesterday we were in a dark room no more than two inches apart, so close I could feel the amazing heat of his skin.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d he says, and leans forward to grab my wrist, staring deep in my eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so surprised by the sudden touch I pull away just a fraction, and Kent takes back his hand. I don\u2019t know how to explain the way this makes my insides go hollow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, totally aware in that moment of how ridiculous I must look to him: the messed up hair, the sweatpants. He, by comparison, looks actually kind of put together. There\u2019s something scruffy-cute about his checkered sneakers and loose, low-belted khakis, and the sleeves of his oxford are rolled up, showing off a tan he got God-knows-where. Certainly not in Ridgeview in the past six months.</p><p>He looks confused. \u201cJoanne said you needed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do need you.\u201d It comes out weird and intense-sounding, and I feel a furious fit of blushing coming on. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t need you. I just need\u2014\u201d I take a deep breath. I think I see a momentary spark in Kent\u2019s eyes and it distracts me. \u201cI\u2019m worried Juliet Sykes is locked in the bathroom.\u201d Just after I say it, I wince. I sound ridiculous. He\u2019ll probably tell me I\u2019m being insane. After all, he doesn\u2019t know what I know.</p><p>The spark dies and his face gets serious. He steps beyond me and tries the door, then he pauses for a second, thinking. He doesn\u2019t tell me I\u2019m crazy or paranoid or anything. He simply says, \u201cThere\u2019s no key. I could try to pick the lock. We can always break it open if we have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pee upstairs,\u201d Rachel announces, then turns on her heel and wobbles off.</p><p>Kent reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a handful of safety pins. \u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d he says when I raise my eyebrows. I hold up my hands and don\u2019t push the issue. I\u2019m grateful he\u2019s taking charge without asking questions.</p><p>He squats down, bends the safety pin backward, and uses it to jimmy the lock. He\u2019s keeping his ear pressed to the door like he\u2019s listening for a click. Finally my curiosity gets the better of me.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an after-school job robbing banks or something?\u201d</p><p>He grimaces, tries the door, slips the safety pin back in his pocket, and selects a credit card from his wallet. \u201cHardly.\u201d He wedges the credit card in the crevice between the frame and the door and wiggles. \u201cMy mom used to keep the junk food locked behind our pantry door.\u201d</p><p>He straightens up and twists the handle. The door opens an inch, and my heart flies up into my throat. Part of me is hoping that Juliet\u2019s face will appear, furious, or that the door will be slammed closed again from inside. That\u2019s what I would do if someone tried to open the bathroom door when I was inside. That is, if I was still awake\u2014alive\u2014to close it.</p><p>But the door just sits there, open that little inch. Kent and I just look at each other at first. I think we\u2019re both scared to open it any farther. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then Kent nudges the door with his toe, calling \u201cJuliet?\u201d as the door swings open\u2014again, time stretches; it seems to take forever\u2014and in that second, or half second, I somehow have the time to conjure up every horrible possibility, to imagine her body crumpled on the ground.</p><p>And then the door finishes swinging, and the bathroom is there: perfectly clean, perfectly normal, and perfectly empty. The lights are on, and there\u2019s a damp hand towel draped over the sink. The only thing slightly out of the ordinary is the window. It\u2019s wide open, and rain has been battering in onto the tiles below.</p><p>\u201cShe went out the window,\u201d Kent says at the same time I\u2019m thinking it. I can\u2019t quite place his tone. It\u2019s half sad, half admiring.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Of course. After a humiliation like that, she would have looked for the easiest escape possible, the one that would attract the least attention. The window looks out onto a sloping side lawn and, of course, the woods. She must have made a dash for it, planning to loop around back toward the driveway.</p> <p>I hurtle out of the bathroom. Kent calls, \u201cWait!\u201d but I\u2019m already down the hall and out the door, pushing onto the porch.</p><p>I grab my flashlight and the sweatshirt from behind a planter where I\u2019d left them and head out across the lawn. The rain isn\u2019t so bad just at the moment, more of a freezing mist falling in solid layers from above, but it\u2019s the kind of cold that goes right through you. I keep my flashlight trained on the ground as I sweep around to the side of the house. I\u2019m not exactly a master tracker, but I\u2019ve read enough old mysteries to know that you should always look for footprints. Unfortunately, the mud is so gross and damp that everything looks churned up. Still, at the base of the bathroom I find a deep indent, where she must have landed, and a series of scuffly-looking marks going, as I suspected, straight to the woods.</p><p>I wrap my sweatshirt more tightly around me and plunge in after her. I can\u2019t see anything but a few feet of light extending in a bouncing circle in front of me. I\u2019ve never been scared of the dark exactly, but the endless scrapings and groanings of the trees and the constant patter of rain through the branches make it sound like the woods are alive and babbling away, like one of those crazy people you see in New York City who are always pushing grocery carts filled with empty bags.</p><p>There\u2019s no point in trying to follow Juliet\u2019s footprints. They\u2019re totally invisible in the soggy paste of decaying leaves, mud, and rotting bark. Instead I strike out in what I hope is the general direction of the road, hoping to catch her on her walk home. I\u2019m pretty sure this is what she intends to do. If you\u2019re so desperate to ditch a party\u2014and the people in it\u2014that you climb out a window, it\u2019s hardly likely that you\u2019ll stroll back minutes later and ask people to move their Hondas.</p><p>The rain starts coming down harder, rattling through the icy branches, the sound of bone on bone. My chest aches from the cold, and even though I\u2019m moving as fast as I can, my fingers feel numb and I\u2019m having trouble holding on to the flashlight. I can\u2019t wait to get to my car and turn the heat on full blast. Then I\u2019ll drive the streets looking for her. If worse comes to worse I\u2019ll intercept her at her house. If only I make it out of these freaking woods.</p> <p>I push myself forward even faster, half jogging now, trying to stay warm. Every few moments I call out \u201cJuliet!\u201d but I don\u2019t expect to get an answer. The patter of the rain is getting heavier and more constant, big fat drops of it splashing on the back of my neck and making me gasp.</p><p>\u201cJuliet! Juliet!\u201d</p><p>The patter turns into a rush. Daggers of icy water slice into me. I keep up the jog, the flashlight like lead in my hand. I can\u2019t feel my toes anymore; I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m going in the right direction. I could be running around in circles, for all I know.</p><p>\u201cJuliet!\u201d</p><p>I start to get scared. I turn a full circle, sweeping my flashlight through the darkness: nothing but dense trees pressing in on either side of me. It didn\u2019t take me this long to walk through the woods on the way to Kent\u2019s, I\u2019m sure of it. My fingers feel like they\u2019re twice the size they should be, and as I\u2019m spinning, the flashlight flies out of my hand. There\u2019s a crash and the sound of splintering. The light sputters and dies, and I\u2019m left totally in darkness.</p><p>\u201cShit. Shit, shit, shit.\u201d Cursing out loud makes me feel better.</p> <p>I take a few hesitant steps in the direction of the flashlight, keeping my arms out in front of me so I don\u2019t collide with anything. After a few shuffling steps I drop to my knees, instantly destroying my house pants as wetness seeps through the fabric. I rake my hands in the sludge in front of me, trying hard not to think too much about what I\u2019m touching. Rain is driving into my eyes. My fleece is clinging to my skin, and it smells like wet dog. I\u2019m shivering uncontrollably. This is what happens when you try to help people. You get screwed. I feel a lump building in my throat.</p><p>In order to keep from a total meltdown, I think about what Lindsay would say if she were stuck with me in the middle of the night in the middle of woods that extend who knows how many miles in the middle of a monsoon, if she saw me tearing at the ground like a deranged mole, completely covered in mud.</p><p>\u201cSamantha Kingston,\u201d she would say, smiling, \u201cI always knew deep down you were a very dirty girl.\u201d</p><p>The thought only cheers me up for a second. Lindsay\u2019s not here with me. Lindsay\u2019s probably making out with Patrick in a toasty warm and very dry room right now, or passing a joint back and forth and wondering out loud to Ally why I\u2019ve been acting so freak-tastic. I\u2019m completely lost, completely miserable, and completely alone. The ache in my throat intensifies until I feel like there\u2019s an animal trying to claw its way out of my throat.</p><p>And I\u2019m suddenly angry at Juliet\u2014so angry I could punch her. I don\u2019t see how she can be so selfish. No matter what\u2014no matter how bad things are\u2014she has a choice. Not all of us are so lucky.</p><p>That\u2019s when I hear the most beautiful sound I\u2019ve ever heard in the entirety of my seventeen years of life (plus five days of life-after-death).</p><p>I hear honking.</p><p>The sound is far away, and it fades almost as soon as it begins\u2014a low wail through the night as someone speeding by leans on the horn. I\u2019m closer to the road than I thought.</p> <p>I scramble to my feet and go as quickly as I can toward the source of the sound, keeping my arms outstretched like a mummy, slapping away branches and the slick touch of the evergreens. My heart is pounding with excitement, and I strain for a noise\u2014any other noise\u2014to guide me. After a minute or so I hear another honk, this one closer. I could sob with relief. Another minute and I hear the thudding bass of a stereo system, tuning in and then out again as a car speeds away. Another minute and I can see, faintly through the trees, the glimmer of the light from the streetlamps. I\u2019ve found the road.</p><p>As the lights get closer and the trees thin, I can see a little better, and I start booking it. I\u2019m so busy fantasizing about piles and piles of blankets\u2014I\u2019ll take every single one I can find in the house\u2014and hot chocolate and warm slippers and showers that I don\u2019t see Juliet Sykes until the last minute, when I nearly trip over her.</p><p>She\u2019s huddled seven or eight feet from the road, her arms wrapped around her knees. Water has turned her white top totally transparent, and I can see her bra\u2014striped\u2014and all the bones of her spine. I\u2019m so surprised to come across her like that, I forget, momentarily, that she\u2019s the whole reason I\u2019m out here in the first place.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I say, loudly over the rain.</p><p>She looks up at me. The streetlamps light up her face. Her eyes are dull. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she parrots back at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, um, looking for you actually.\u201d Her face doesn\u2019t register any emotion\u2014no surprise, no shock, no anger, nothing. It throws me. \u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, just barely, and keeps staring at me with those dull, tired eyes. This isn\u2019t nearly how I pictured it would be. I thought she would be happy that I\u2019ve come to look for her\u2014grateful, even. Or maybe she would be mad. In any case, I thought she would be something.</p><p>\u201cListen, Juliet\u2014\u201d I can hardly talk, my teeth are chattering so badly. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, almost one o\u2019clock in the morning, and it\u2019s freezing out here. Do you maybe want to come over to my house for a bit? And talk? I know what happened in there\u201d\u2014I nod back in the direction of Kent\u2019s house\u2014\u201cand I feel really bad about it.\u201d I just want her to get in the damn car, but it\u2019s true; I do feel bad.</p><p>Juliet stares at me for a long, hard second, the rain blurring the few feet between us. She starts to stand, and I feel sure that\u2019s done it, but instead she turns away and takes several steps toward the road.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she says. Her voice isn\u2019t apologetic, though. It\u2019s flat.</p><p>I reach out and grab her wrist. It feels impossibly tiny in my hand, like this one time I found a baby bird near Goose Point, and I picked it up and it died there, taking its final, gasping, fluttering breaths in my palm. Juliet doesn\u2019t pull away, but she stares at my hand like it\u2019s a snake about to bite her.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I try again. \u201cListen. I know this is going to sound crazy, but...\u201d The wind rushes through the trees and releases a new volley of rain. \u201cI have a feeling that we have something in common, you and me. If we could just go somewhere and talk about it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Juliet says. She stares out at the road, and I think I see a small, sad smile playing on her lips. Then it\u2019s gone.</p><p>I\u2019ve been outside too long. My mind is grinding to a halt. Nothing\u2019s making sense anymore. Weird images keep flashing through my head, a bizarre fantasy reel of warm things. A pool filled with steaming hot chocolate. A stack of blankets piled all the way to the roof of my house. And part of me just thinks, Screw it. Let her do what she\u2019s going to do. Tomorrow there will be a big rewind anyway.</p><p>But there\u2019s a bigger part of me\u2014my inner bull, my mom used to call it\u2014that says she owes me this. I\u2019m covered in mud; I\u2019m absolutely freezing; and half the population of Thomas Jefferson thinks I\u2019m a pajama-wearing freak.</p><p>\u201cHow about we go to your house?\u201d I figure she\u2019ll have to go back there eventually. She gives me a strange look, and for a second I feel like she\u2019s staring straight through me.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she says.</p><p>I have to yell even louder than before. Cars are starting to pull out of Kent\u2019s driveway, zooming by us on the wet road. \u201cI\u2014I want to help you.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, an infinitesimal gesture. \u201cYou hate me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s edging closer and closer to the road, and it\u2019s making me extremely nervous. A car roars by us, bass pumping. It glitters when it passes under the streetlamp, and I can just make out the silhouette of someone laughing. Somewhere to my right I think I hear my name, but it\u2019s hard to tell over the pounding rain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you. I don\u2019t know you. But I\u2019d like to change that. Start over.\u201d I\u2019m almost screaming now. I\u2019m not sure if she can still hear me.</p><p>She says something I don\u2019t hear. Another car goes flashing by, a silver bullet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Juliet turns her head a fraction of an inch and says, louder, \u201cYou\u2019re right. You don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p> <p>Another car. Laughter rings out as it passes. Someone throws a beer bottle into the woods and it shatters. Then I\u2019m sure I hear someone calling my name, though I can\u2019t tell exactly which direction it comes from. The wind shrieks, and I suddenly realize that Juliet\u2019s only a half inch from the road, teetering on the thin line where the pavement begins, like she\u2019s balancing on a tightrope.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should come away from the road,\u201d I say, but all the time in the back of my head, there\u2019s an idea growing and swelling, a horrible, sickening realization, massing up and taking shape like clouds on the horizon. Someone calls my name again. And then, still in the distance, I hear the throaty wail of \u201cSplinter\u201d by Fallacy pumping from someone\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cSam! Sam!\u201d I recognize it as Kent\u2019s voice now.</p><p>Last night for the last time...you said you would be mine again...</p><p>Juliet turns to face me then. She\u2019s smiling, but it\u2019s the saddest smile I\u2019ve ever seen.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe next time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut probably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuliet,\u201d I try to say, but the name catches in my throat. I feel like fear has turned me to stone. I want to say something, to move, to reach out and grab her, but time goes so quickly, and then the realization bursts and explodes as the music from the speakers gets louder and a silver Range Rover rockets out of the darkness. Like a bird or an angel\u2014like she\u2019s throwing herself off a cliff\u2014Juliet lifts her arms and hurtles onto the road, and there\u2019s a scream piercing the air and a sickening crunch, and it\u2019s not until Juliet\u2019s body flies sideways off the hood of Lindsay\u2019s car and lands crumpled facedown in the road, and the Range Rover sails into the woods and crashes, splintering, crumpling against a tree, and long ribbons of smoke and flame begin licking the air, that I realize I\u2019m the one screaming.</p><p>BEFORE I WAKE</p><p>Kent catches up to me then. \u201cSam,\u201d he says breathlessly, eyes searching my face. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsay,\u201d I whisper. It\u2019s the only thing that I can think to say. \u201cLindsay and Elody and Ally are in that car.\u201d</p><p>He turns to the road. Black pillars of smoke are rising out of the woods. From where we\u2019re standing we can just see the battered metal bumper, rising like a finger over the dip of the earth.</p> <p>\u201cWait here,\u201d he says. It\u2019s a miracle, but he sounds calm. He runs into the road, whipping his phone out, and I hear him yelling directions to someone on the other end. There\u2019s been an accident. Fire. Route nine, just past Devon Drive. He kneels by Juliet\u2019s body. At least one person hurt.</p><p>Other cars are squealing to a halt now. People climb out of their cars uncertainly, everyone suddenly sober, everyone speaking in whispers, staring at the tiny crumpled body in the road, at the smoke and fire licking up from the woods. Emma McElroy pulls over and gets out with her hands cupped over her mouth, eyes bugging out of her head, leaving the door to her Mini hanging open and the radio blasting. Jay-Z\u2019s \u201c99 Problems\u201d booms through the night, and the normalcy of it is the most horrible thing of all. Someone shrieks, \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Emma, shut that off.\u201d Emma scrambles back to her car, and then there\u2019s silence except for the pounding of the rain, and the sounds of someone sobbing loudly.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m in a dream. I keep trying to move, but I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t even feel the rain anymore. I don\u2019t feel my body.</p><p>There\u2019s only one thought revolving around and around and around in my head: the flash of white just before we pin-wheeled into the yawning mouth of the woods, Lindsay yelling something I couldn\u2019t quite make out.</p><p>Not sit or shit or sight.</p><p>Sykes.</p><p>Then a long, piercing wail comes from the other side of the woods, and Lindsay stumbles up to the road, her mouth open and tears streaming down her face. Kent is there, supporting Ally, who\u2019s limping and coughing but looks okay.</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s screaming, \u201cHelp! Help! Elody\u2019s still in there! Somebody help her! Please!\u201d She\u2019s so hysterical her words swell together, transforming into an animal howl. She sinks down on the pavement and sobs, her head in her hands. Then another wailing joins in: sirens in the distance.</p> <p>Nobody moves. Everything starts happening in short, choppy bursts\u2014at least, that\u2019s what it seems like to me\u2014like I\u2019m watching a movie while a strobe light goes on and off. More and more students massing in the rain, standing as still and silent as statues. The police sirens turning, lighting the scene up red, then white, then red, then white. Figures in uniform\u2014an ambulance\u2014a stretcher\u2014two stretchers. Juliet\u2019s body laid out neatly, tiny and fragile, just like the bird all those years ago. Lindsay throwing up as the second stretcher bears a body up from the totaled car, and Kent rubbing her back. Ally sobbing with her mouth open, which is weird, because I don\u2019t hear a sound. At some point I lift my eyes to the sky and see that the rain has transformed into snow\u2014fat, white flakes swirling out of the darkness as if by magic. I have no idea how long I\u2019ve been standing there. I\u2019m surprised to see that when I look back at the road there\u2019s hardly anyone left there at all, just a few stragglers and a solitary police car and Kent, jumping up and down to keep warm, talking to an officer. The ambulances are gone. Lindsay\u2019s gone. Ally\u2019s gone.</p><p>Then Kent\u2019s standing in front of me though I didn\u2019t see him move. How did you do that? I try to say, but nothing comes out.</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d Kent\u2019s speaking to me, and I get the feeling he\u2019s said my name more than once. I feel a squeezing sensation and it takes me a second to realize he has his hands on my arms. It takes me a second to realize I still have arms, and in that moment it\u2019s like I slam back into my body, and the force of everything I\u2019ve seen hits me and my legs buckle and I slump forward. Kent catches me, holds me up.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I whisper, dazed. \u201cIs Elody...? Is Juliet...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d His lips are close to my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go find Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out here for over an hour. Your hands are like ice.\u201d He shrugs out of the heavy sweater he\u2019s wearing and drapes it over me. There are white snowflakes caught in his lashes. He places his hands gently under my elbows and steers me back toward the driveway. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get you warm.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have the strength to argue. I let him lead me to the house. His hands never leave me, and even though he\u2019s barely grazing my back, I feel like without him I would fall.</p><p>It seems like we\u2019re back at Kent\u2019s house without even moving. Then we\u2019re in the kitchen, and he\u2019s pulling out a chair and putting me in it. His lips are moving and his tone is comforting, but I can\u2019t understand what he\u2019s saying. Then there\u2019s a thick blanket over my shoulders and a shooting pain in my fingers and toes as the feeling comes back to them, as though someone\u2019s sticking hot, sharp needles in me. Still, I can\u2019t stop shivering. My teeth are clacking together with a noise like dice rattling in a cup.</p><p>The kegs are still in the corner, and there are half-empty cups everywhere, and cigarette butts swimming in them, but the music\u2019s off and the house feels totally different without any people in it. My mind is focusing on a bunch of tiny details, ricocheting from one to the other like a Ping-Pong ball: the embroidered sign above the sink that says MARTHA STEWART DOES NOT LIVE HERE; the snapshots posted on the refrigerator, of Kent and his family on the beach somewhere, of relatives I don\u2019t know, of old postcards from Paris, Morocco, San Francisco; rows of mugs displayed behind the glass cabinets, with slogans on them like CAFFEINE OR BUST and IT\u2019S TEA TIME.</p><p>\u201cOne marshmallow or two?\u201d Kent is saying.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My voice comes out croaky and weird. All my other senses come online in a rush: I hear the hissing of milk heating in a pot; Kent\u2019s face comes into focus, sweet and concerned, bits of snow melting out of his shaggy brown hair. The blanket around my shoulders smells like lavender.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just put in a couple,\u201d Kent says, turning back to the stove. In a minute there\u2019s an oversized mug (This one says HOME IS WHERE THE CHOCOLATE IS) steaming in front of me, filled with foamy hot chocolate\u2014the real kind, not the kind you get from a package\u2014and big, bobbing marshmallows. I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ve asked for this out loud or whether he\u2019s just read my mind.</p><p>Kent sits across from me at the table and watches me take a sip. It\u2019s delicious, just sweet enough and full of cinnamon and something else I can\u2019t identify, and I put the mug down with slightly steadier hands.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lindsay?\u201d I say as the scene comes back to me: Lindsay on her knees in front of everyone, throwing up. She must have been out of her mind\u2014Lindsay would never do something like that in public. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>Kent nods, his eyes fixed on my face. \u201cLindsay\u2019s fine. She had to go to the hospital to be checked out for shock and stuff. But she\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014Juliet came so fast.\u201d I close my eyes, envisioning the white blur, and when I open them, Kent looks like his insides are getting torn out. \u201cIs she...I mean, is Juliet...?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head once. \u201cThere was nothing they could do,\u201d he says, so quietly if I didn\u2019t know what he was going to say I would never have heard him.</p><p>\u201cI saw her...\u201d I start to speak and find I can\u2019t. \u201cI could have grabbed her. She was so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident.\u201d Kent looks down. I\u2019m not sure whether he really believes it.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t, I want to say. I think of her strange half smile as she said, Maybe next time, but probably not, and close my eyes, willing the memory away.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ally? Is she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlly\u2019s fine. Not even a scratch.\u201d Kent\u2019s voice gets stronger, but there\u2019s a pleading sound to it, and I understand he\u2019s trying to get me to stop talking\u2014he doesn\u2019t want me to ask what I\u2019m about to ask.</p><p>\u201cElody?\u201d My voice comes out in a whisper.</p><p>Kent looks away. A muscle works in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cShe was sitting in the front seat,\u201d he says finally, as though each and every word hurts, and I think of Elody leaning forward and whining, Why does Sam always get shotgun? \u201cThe passenger side took most of the impact.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if that\u2019s how they would have explained it to my parents at the hospital\u2014collision, passenger side, impact. \u201cIs she...?\u201d I can\u2019t say the word.</p><p>He looks at me like he\u2019s about to cry. He looks older than I\u2019ve ever seen him, his eyes dark and full and sad. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sam,\u201d he says quietly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you telling me?\u201d I ball my fists up so tightly I can feel my nails dig into my skin. \u201cAre you saying she\u2019s\u2014that she\u2019s\u2014\u201d I break off, still unable to say it. Saying it will make it real.</p><p>Kent looks like each word is something sharp he has to bring up from his stomach. \u201cIt was\u2014it would have been instant. Painless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPainless?\u201d I repeat, my voice shaking. \u201cPainless? You don\u2019t know that. You can\u2019t know that.\u201d There\u2019s a fist in my throat. \u201cIs that what they said? They said it was painless? Like it was peaceful? Like it was okay?\u201d</p><p>Kent reaches for my hand across the table. \u201cSam...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I scrape my chair back from the table and stand up. My whole body is vibrating with rage. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s going to be okay. Don\u2019t tell me it didn\u2019t hurt her. You don\u2019t know\u2014you have no idea\u2014none of you have any idea how much it hurts. It hurts\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure whether I\u2019m talking about Elody or myself. Kent stands up and wraps his arms around me. I find myself with my head buried in his shoulder, sobbing. He keeps me pressed tightly to him, and he\u2019s making little noises into my hair, and before I totally let go of everything and succumb to the blackness washing through me, I have the strangest, dumbest thought\u2014that my head fits perfectly in Kent\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Then the thought of Elody and Juliet becomes too much, and a heavy veil drops down over my mind, and I cry. It\u2019s the second night in a row I\u2019ve totally lost it in front of Kent, though, of course, he couldn\u2019t know that. I should be grateful he doesn\u2019t remember that only last night we sat together in a dark room with our knees almost touching, but instead it makes me feel even more alone. I\u2019m lost in a fog, in a mist, and at some point when I start to come back to myself I realize that Kent is literally holding me up. My feet are barely skimming the ground.</p><p>His mouth is buried in my hair and I feel his breath close to my ear. A zip of electricity goes through me, which makes me feel awful and more confused than ever. I pull away, putting a little bit of space between us. He keeps his arms on either side of mine, though, bracing me, and I\u2019m glad. He\u2019s solid and warm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still freezing,\u201d he says. He puts the back of his hand against my cheek for one millisecond, but when he pulls away I can feel the outline of his hand, like it\u2019s scalded me. \u201cYour clothes are soaking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnderwear,\u201d I blurt out.</p><p>He wrinkles his forehead. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy...um, underwear. I mean, my pants and fleece and underwear...it\u2019s all full of snow. Well, mostly melted water now. It\u2019s really cold.\u201d I\u2019m too exhausted to care about being embarrassed. Kent just bites his lip and nods.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd drink up.\u201d He nods to the hot chocolate.</p><p>He guides me back into the chair and disappears. I\u2019m still shivering, but at least I can hold the mug without slopping it all over the table. I don\u2019t think about anything but the motion of the mug to my lips and the taste of the cocoa, the ticking of a cat-tailed clock, and the drifting white outside the windows. In a few seconds Kent\u2019s back with an enormous fleece, faded sweatpants, and folded striped boxers.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re mine,\u201d he says, and then turns bright red. \u201cI mean, not mine. I didn\u2019t wear them yet or anything. My mom bought them for me\u2014\u201d He catches himself and swallows. \u201cI mean, I bought them for myself, like, Tuesday. Tags still on and everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKent?\u201d I interrupt him.</p><p>He sucks in a breath. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but...do you mind being quiet?\u201d I gesture to my head. \u201cMy brain is full of fuzz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He exhales. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I wish...I wish that there was more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. I know he\u2019s making an effort and I manage a weak smile.</p><p>He lays the clothes down on the table, along with a big, fluffy white towel. \u201cI didn\u2019t know...I thought if you were still cold you could take a shower.\u201d He blushes at the word shower.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI really just want to sleep.\u201d I\u2019ve forgotten about sleep, and I feel a huge lift when I say it: all I have to do is sleep.</p><p>As soon as I fall asleep this nightmare will be over.</p> <p>Still, a twittering feeling of anxiety rises up inside me. What if the day doesn\u2019t rewind this time? What if this is it? I think of Elody and feel the hot chocolate coming back up in my throat.</p><p>Kent must see the expression on my face because he crouches down so we\u2019re at eye level. \u201cCan I do anything? Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, trying not to cry again. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019s just...the shock.\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cI just want to...I want to rewind, you know?\u201d</p><p>He nods once, and puts his hand over mine. I don\u2019t pull it away. \u201cIf I could make it better I would,\u201d he says.</p><p>In some ways it\u2019s a stupid, obvious thing to say, but the way he says it, so honest and simple like it\u2019s the truest thing there is, makes tears prick in my eyes. I take the clothes and the towel and go out into the hall to the bathroom we broke into to find Juliet. I go in and shut the door. The window\u2019s still open and flurries of snow whirl in from outside. I shut the window. It makes me feel better already, like I\u2019m already starting the process of erasing everything that\u2019s happened tonight. Elody will be fine.</p><p>After all, I was the one who was supposed to be in the front seat.</p><p>I hang the hand towel Juliet left by the sink and strip out of my clothes, shaking. The shower is too hard to resist after all, and I turn the water on as high and as hot as it can go and get in. It\u2019s one of those rain-forest showers where the water pours on you straight from above in a long, heavy stream. When it hits the marble tiles under my feet, it lets up big clouds of steam. I stay in the shower so long my skin gets pruny.</p><p>I put on Kent\u2019s fleece, which is supersoft and smells like laundry detergent and, for some reason, freshly mowed grass. Then I snap the tags off the boxers and slip my legs into them. They\u2019re too big on me, obviously, but I like how clean and crisp they feel on my skin. The only other boxers I\u2019ve seen are Rob\u2019s, usually crumpled up on his floor or shoved under his bed and stained with things I have no desire to identify. Last, I put on the sweatpants, which pool over my feet. Kent has given me socks, too, the big fluffy kind. I ball up all of my clothes and leave them just outside the bathroom door.</p><p>When I go back in the kitchen, Kent\u2019s standing there, exactly as I left him. Something flickers in his eyes when I come in, but I\u2019m not sure what it is.</p><p>\u201cYour hair\u2019s wet,\u201d he says softly, but he says it like he\u2019s actually saying something else.</p><p>I look down. \u201cI showered, after all.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretches between us for a few beats. Then he says, \u201cYou\u2019re tired. I\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I say it more forcefully than I meant to, and Kent looks startled.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I mean, I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to go home right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents...\u201d Kent trails off.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I don\u2019t know which would be worse: if my parents have already heard and are sitting there, waiting for me, waiting to grill me and ask me questions and talk about hospitals in the morning and therapists to help me deal\u2014or if they haven\u2019t heard yet and I come home to a dark house.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a guest room here,\u201d Kent says. His hair is finally drying into little wisps and waves.</p><p>\u201cNo guest rooms.\u201d I shake my head resolutely. \u201cI want to be in a room room. A lived-in room.\u201d</p><p>Kent stares at me for a second and then says, \u201cCome with me.\u201d He reaches for my hand as he passes and I let him take it. We go up the stairs and down the hall and to the bedroom with all the bumper stickers on it. I should have known it was his. He fiddles with the door\u2014\u201cIt sticks,\u201d he explains\u2014and finally pops it open. I inhale sharply. The smell is just the same as it was last night when I was here with Rob, but everything is different\u2014the darkness looks softer, somehow.</p><p>\u201cGive me a second.\u201d Kent squeezes my hand and pulls away. I hear the rustling of the curtains and I gasp: suddenly three enormous windows, stretching from floor to ceiling and taking up one entire wall, are revealed. He hasn\u2019t turned on a light, but he may as well have. The moon is huge and luminous and bounces through all the dazzling white snow, growing brighter. The whole room is bathed in a beautiful, silver light.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d I say. I breathe out; I didn\u2019t even realize I was holding my breath.</p><p>Kent smiles quickly. His face is silhouetted in moonlight. \u201cIt\u2019s great at night. Not so great at sunrise, though.\u201d He starts to draw the curtains closed.</p><p>\u201cLeave them open,\u201d I cry out, and then add, \u201cplease.\u201d I suddenly feel shy.</p><p>Kent\u2019s room is enormous, and smells like that same incredible mixture of Downy laundry detergent and grass shavings. It\u2019s the freshest smell in the world, the smell of open windows and crisp sheets. Last night I couldn\u2019t make out anything but the bed. Now I see the room is lined completely with bookshelves. There\u2019s a desk in the corner, stacked with a computer and more books. There are pictures framed on the walls, blurred figures moving, but I can\u2019t make out the details. A monster beanbag chair squats in one corner and Kent catches me staring at it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had it since seventh grade,\u201d he says. He sounds embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI used to have one like that,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t add why I chucked it: because Lindsay said it looked like a lumpy boob. I can\u2019t think about Lindsay now, or Ally. I definitely can\u2019t think about Elody.</p><p>Kent draws the blankets down on his bed and then stands back, turning away so I have some privacy. I climb into the bed and lie down, my limbs heavy and achingly stiff, feeling a little self-conscious, but so numb with exhaustion I don\u2019t care. There\u2019s a curved wooden headboard and a matching footboard, and as soon as I\u2019m stretched out, I\u2019m reminded of being in a sleigh. I tilt my head so I can see the snow drifting down, and then close my eyes, imagining that I\u2019m flying through a forest on my way to somewhere good: a trim little white house in the distance, candles burning in its windows.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Kent whispers. He\u2019s so quiet I\u2019d forgotten he was standing there.</p><p>I snap my eyes open and sit up on one elbow. \u201cKent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you maybe stay with me a bit?\u201d</p><p>He nods, and rolls the desk chair over to the side of the bed without speaking. He tucks his knees up to his chin and looks at me. The moonlight coming in through the windows turns his hair a soft silver.</p><p>\u201cKent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s weird that I\u2019m here with you?\u201d I close my eyes when I say it so I don\u2019t have to look at his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the editor in chief of the Tribulation,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I once went three hundred and sixty-five days wearing Crocs. I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s weird.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI forgot about the Crocs phase,\u201d I say. I\u2019m finally warm under the covers, and I feel sleep creeping up on me, like I\u2019m standing on a hot beach with a gentle tide pulling at my toes. \u201cKent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s quiet for so long I begin to think he won\u2019t answer. I imagine I can hear the snow drifting to earth, covering over the day, erasing it clean. I\u2019m too frightened to open my eyes, terrified that I\u2019ll break the spell, terrified he\u2019ll look angry or hurt.</p> <p>\u201cRemember the time in second grade right after my grandfather died?\u201d he says finally, speaking in a low, quiet voice. \u201cI burst into tears in the lunchroom and Phil Howell called me a faggot. That only made me cry harder, even though I didn\u2019t know what a faggot was.\u201d He laughs softly.</p><p>I keep my eyes squeezed shut, coasting on his voice. Last year Phil Howell was found half naked with Sean Trebor in the back of his dad\u2019s BMW. It\u2019s funny how things turn out.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, when I told him to leave me alone he smacked my tray, and food went flying everywhere. I\u2019ll never forget: we were having mashed potatoes and turkey burgers. And you went up and scooped the potatoes off the floor with your hands and shoved them straight into Phil\u2019s face. And then you picked up the turkey burger and crumbled it down Phil\u2019s T-shirt. You said, You\u2019re worse than the hot lunch.\u201d He laughs again. \u201cThat was a big insult in second grade. And Sean was so surprised, and he looked so ridiculous standing there with mashed potato and chives smeared all over him, that I just started laughing and laughing, and it was the first time I\u2019d laughed since I\u2019d heard the news about\u2014about my grandfather.\u201d He pauses. \u201cDo you remember what I said to you that day?\u201d</p><p>The memory is there, a balloon swelling from somewhere so far inside me I thought it was lost, the whole scene clear and perfect now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my hero,\u201d we both say at the same time. I don\u2019t hear Kent move, but all of a sudden his voice is closer, and he\u2019s found my hands in the dark, and he\u2019s cupping them in his.</p> <p>\u201cI vowed after that day that I would be your hero too, no matter how long it took,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>We stay like that for what feels like hours, and all the time sleep is dragging at me, pulling me away from him, but my heart is fluttering like a moth, beating back the dreams and the darkness and the fog crowding my brain. Once I sleep, I lose him. I lose this moment forever.</p><p>\u201cKent?\u201d I say, and my voice seems to have to rise from inside the fog, taking forever to get from my brain to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise you\u2019ll stay here with me?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he whispers.</p> <p>And then, just at that moment, when I\u2019m no longer sure if I\u2019m dreaming or awake or walking some valley in between where everything you wish for comes true, I feel the flutter of his lips on mine, but it\u2019s too late, I\u2019m slipping, I\u2019m gone, he\u2019s gone, and the moment curls away and back on itself like a flower folding up for the night.</p><p>SIX</p><p>This time, when I dream, there is sound. As I fall through the darkness there\u2019s a tinkly, jangly song playing, like the kind of music you hear in doctors\u2019 offices and elevators, and without knowing how I know, I realize that the music is piping all the way from the guidance counselor\u2019s office at Thomas Jefferson.</p><p>As soon as I realize this, little bright spots start exploding through the darkness, a zooming gallery of all the annoying inspirational posters my guidance counselor, Mrs. Gardner, keeps on her walls, except in my dream they\u2019re all blown up by about a hundred times, each the size of a house. In one, Einstein is pictured over the words GRAVITY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR FALLING IN LOVE. There\u2019s a poster with Thomas Edison\u2019s quote: GENIUS IS 1 PERCENT INSPIRATION AND 99 PERCENT PERSPIRATION. I\u2019m thinking of trying to grab one of them and worrying about whether it will hold my weight when I spin past a picture of a striped cat hanging off the branch of a tree by its nails. It says HANG IN THERE.</p><p>And it\u2019s the funniest thing: as soon as I see it, the whistling in my ears stops and the feeling of terror drains away, and I realize this whole time I haven\u2019t been falling at all. I\u2019ve been floating.</p><p>The alarm that wakes me is the sweetest sound I\u2019ve ever heard. I sit up, a bubble of laughter rising inside me. I have the urge to touch everything in my room\u2014the walls, the window, the collage, the photos cluttering my desk, the Tahari jeans strewn across my floor and my bio textbook and even the dull light just creeping over the windowsill. If I could cup it in my hands and kiss it, I would.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s in a good mood,\u201d my mom says when I come downstairs. Izzy\u2019s at the table in front of her peanut butter bagel, taking slow, careful bites, as usual.</p><p>\u201cHappy Cupid Day,\u201d my father says. He\u2019s standing at the stove burning eggs for my mom\u2019s breakfast.</p> <p>\u201cMy favorite,\u201d I say, scooting in to steal a bite from Izzy\u2019s bagel. Izzy squeals and slaps at my hand. I plant a big, sloppy kiss on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cStop slobbering on me,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cSee you later, Fizzy Lizard,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me Lizard.\u201d Izzy sticks a peanut butter\u2013coated tongue out at me.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a lizard when you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want any breakfast, Sam?\u201d my mom asks. I never eat breakfast at home, but my mom still asks me every day\u2014when she catches me before I duck out, anyway\u2014and in that moment I realize how much I love the little everyday routines of my life: the fact that she always asks, the fact that I always say no because there\u2019s a sesame bagel waiting for me in Lindsay\u2019s car, the fact that we always listen to \u201cNo More Drama\u201d as we pull into the parking lot. The fact that my mom always cooks spaghetti and meatballs on Sunday, and the fact that once a month my dad takes over the kitchen and makes his \u201cspecial stew,\u201d which is just hot-dog pieces and baked beans and lots of extra ketchup and molasses, and I would never admit to liking it, but it\u2019s actually one of my favorite meals. The details that are my life\u2019s special pattern, like how in handwoven rugs what really makes them unique are the tiny flaws in the stitching, little gaps and jumps and stutters that can never be reproduced.</p><p>So many things become beautiful when you really look.</p><p>\u201cNo breakfast. Thanks, though.\u201d I go to my mom and wrap my arms around her. She yelps, surprised. I guess it has been a couple of years since we\u2019ve hugged, except the mandatory two-second squeeze on birthdays. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>When I pull away she stares at me as though I\u2019ve just announced I\u2019m quitting school to become a contortionist in the circus.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d my dad says, dumping a pan in the sink and wiping his hands on the dishtowel. \u201cNo love for your old man?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. I hate it when my dad tries to \u201cteen-speak,\u201d as he calls it, but I don\u2019t call him out on it. Nothing can get me down today.</p><p>\u201cBye, Dad.\u201d I let him wrap me in one of his infamous bear hugs. I\u2019m filled with love from the top of my head to the bottom of my toes, a bubbly feeling like someone\u2019s shaken my insides up like a Coke bottle. Everything\u2014the dishes in the sink, Izzy\u2019s bagel, my mom\u2019s smile\u2014looks sharp, like it\u2019s made out of glass or like I\u2019m seeing it for the first time. It\u2019s dazzling, and again I have the desire to go around and touch it all, make sure that it\u2019s real. If I had time I would, too. I would put my hands around the half-eaten grapefruit on the counter and smell it. I would run my fingers through Izzy\u2019s hair.</p><p>But I don\u2019t have time. It\u2019s Cupid Day, and Lindsay\u2019s outside, and I have business to take care of. Today I\u2019m going to save two lives: Juliet Sykes\u2019s, and mine.</p><p>LET THERE BE LIGHT</p><p>\u201cBeep, beep!\u201d Lindsay shouts out her window as I scurry down the icy walkway, sucking the cold air into my lungs, loving the way it burns, loving even the bitter stink of Lindsay\u2019s cigarette and the exhaust that\u2019s clotting the air. \u201cHot mama! How much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have to ask,\u201d I say, sliding into the passenger seat, \u201cyou can\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p><p>She grins and hands me my coffee before I can reach for it. \u201cHappy Cupid Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy Cupid Day,\u201d I say, and we clink Styrofoam cups.</p><p>She too looks clearer to me than ever before. Lindsay, with her angel\u2019s face and messy, dirty blond hair and chipped black nail polish and battered leather Dooney &amp; Bourke bag that always has a film of tobacco and half-unwrapped Trident Original at the bottom. Lindsay, who hates being bored, always moving, always running. Lindsay, who once said\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s the world against us, babes\u201d\u2014drunk and looping her arms around our shoulders when we were out in the arboretum and really meaning it. Lindsay, mean and funny and ferocious and loyal and mine.</p><p>I lean over impulsively and kiss her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, lesboing out much?\u201d Lindsay shrugs a shoulder up to her cheek and wipes off my lip gloss. \u201cOr just practicing for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe both,\u201d I say, and she laughs long and loud.</p><p>I take a sip of my coffee. It\u2019s scalding and has to be the best coffee in all of Ridgeview, in all the world. God bless Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.</p><p>Lindsay chatters about how many roses she expects to get and whether Marcy Posner will, as usual, break down and cry in the bathroom during fifth period because Justin Streamer dumped her three years ago on Cupid Day, thus permanently sealing her fate as only medium-popular, and I look out the window and watch Ridgeview go by in a blur of gray. I try to imagine how, in only a few months, the trees will shoot their tiny stems into the sky, the barest spray of flowers and green breathed over everything like a mist. And then, a few months after that, the whole town will be an explosion of green: so many trees and so much grass it will look like a painting still dripping wet. I can imagine it waiting under the surface of the world, like the slides just have to be flipped in the projector and summer will be here.</p><p>And there\u2019s Elody, teetering down the lawn in her shoes with no jacket on and her arms wrapped around her chest. When I see her, radiant and alive, the relief is so huge I let out a tremendous shriek of laughter. Lindsay raises her eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll freeze,\u201d I gasp, by way of explanation.</p><p>Lindsay twirls her finger by her ear. \u201cShe\u2019s totally cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone say Cocoa Puffs?\u201d Elody says, getting into the car. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>I twist around to look at her. It\u2019s all I can do to keep from climbing into the backseat and jumping on her. I feel an overwhelming urge to touch her, make sure she\u2019s really real and here and alive. In some ways she\u2019s the bravest and most delicate of all of us. I wish I could somehow tell her this.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Elody scrunches up her nose at me, and I realize I\u2019m staring. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do I have toothpaste on my face or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, and again the laughter bubbles out of me, a surge of happiness and relief. I think; I could stay forever in this one moment. \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lindsay giggles, checks Elody out in the rearview. \u201cThere are some bagels under your butt, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, butt bagels.\u201d Elody reaches into the bag and pulls out a bagel, half squashed, then makes a big deal of taking an enormous bite out of it. \u201cTastes like Victoria\u2019s Secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTastes like thong floss,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cTastes like crack,\u201d Lindsay says.</p> <p>\u201cTastes like fart,\u201d Elody says, and Lindsay spits coffee on the dashboard, and I start laughing and can\u2019t stop, and all the way to school we\u2019re thinking of flavors for butt bagels, and I\u2019m thinking that this\u2014my life, my friends\u2014might be weird or screwy or imperfect or damaged or whatever, but it\u2019s never seemed better to me.</p><p>As we\u2019re pulling into the school\u2019s parking lot, I scream for Lindsay to brake. She slams to a stop and Elody curses as coffee slops all over her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Lindsay puts a hand on her chest. \u201cYou scared me to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014um. Sorry. I thought I saw Rob.\u201d Up ahead I\u2019m watching Sarah Grundel\u2019s Chevrolet turn into Senior Alley fifteen seconds ahead of us. The parking space is a small thing, a detail, but today I\u2019m not going to do anything wrong. I don\u2019t want to take any chances. It\u2019s like the game we used to play when we were little, where we had to avoid all the cracks in the sidewalk or else it meant we\u2019d kill off our mothers. Even if you didn\u2019t believe in it, you made sure you were stepping correctly, just in case. \u201cSorry. My bad.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay rolls her eyes and steps on the gas again. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not going psycho stalker.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeave her alone.\u201d Elody leans forward and pats my shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s just nervous about tonight.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip to keep from giggling. If Lindsay and Elody had any clue at all about what was actually running through my head, they would probably have me committed. All morning, whenever I close my eyes, I keep imagining the feeling of Kent McFuller\u2019s lips brushing against mine, as light as butterfly wings; of the crown of light surrounding his head and the way his arms felt when he was keeping me on my feet. I lean my head against the window. My smile is reflected back at me, growing wider and wider as Lindsay drives up and down Senior Alley, cursing because Sarah Grundel took the very last parking space.</p><p>Instead of following Elody and Lindsay into Main, I break off and head toward Building A, where the nurses\u2019 office is, muttering an excuse about a headache. That\u2019s where the roses are stored on Cupid Day, and I have some adjustments to make. Okay, so maybe lying isn\u2019t 100 percent kosher on the Good Deeds Scale (especially lying to your best friends), but it\u2019s for a very, very good cause.</p><p>The nurses\u2019 office is long and narrow. Normally a double row of cots runs its length, but the cots have been cleared out and replaced by huge folding tables. The heavy curtains that usually keep the place movie theater\u2013dark have all been drawn back, and the room is literally sparkling with light. Light bounces off the metal wall fixtures and zigzags crazily over the bright white walls. There are roses everywhere\u2014overflowing their trays, stashed in corners, a few of them even scattered across the ground, petals trampled\u2014and if you didn\u2019t know that there was actually an organizing principle to all of it, and a purpose, you would just think that someone had set off some kind of a rose bomb.</p><p>Ms. Devane, who usually oversees Cupid Day, isn\u2019t around, but there are three Cupids standing over one of the bins, giggling. They jump and scoot backward when I come in. They\u2019ve been reading the notes, obviously. It\u2019s strange to think about\u2014those little scraps of paper, snippets of words, half compliments and backhanded compliments and broken promises and semi-wishes and almost expressions of what you really want to say: they never tell the full story, or even half of it. A room full of words that are nearly the truth but not quite, each note fluttering off the stem of its rose like a broken butterfly wing. None of the girls talks to me as I start walking the aisle, scanning the labels on the trays, looking for the S\u2019s. I doubt that anybody else has ever barged in on the Rose Room, especially not a senior. Finally I find the tray labeled: St\u2013Ta. There are five or six roses for Tamara Stugen and another half dozen for Andrew Svork and three for a Burt Swortney, who has the most unfortunate name I\u2019ve heard of in a long time. And there it is: the single rose for Juliet Sykes with a note looped delicately around its stem. MAYBE NEXT YEAR, BUT PROBABLY NOT. Maybe next time, but probably not.</p><p>\u201cUm...can I help you with something?\u201d One of the girls inches forward a couple of feet. She\u2019s twisting her hands together and looks absolutely petrified.</p> <p>Juliet\u2019s rose is thin and young, delicately tinged with pink. All of its petals are closed. It hasn\u2019t bloomed yet.</p><p>\u201cI need roses,\u201d I say. \u201cLots of them.\u201d</p><p>CORRECTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS</p><p>I leave the Rose Room feeling keyed up and energetic, like I\u2019ve just had three mocha lattes from Caffeine Rush in the mall. I replaced Juliet\u2019s single rose with an enormous bouquet\u2014I shelled out forty bucks for two dozen\u2014and a note printed in block letters that says FROM YOUR SECRET ADMIRER. I only wish I could be around when she receives them. I\u2019m positive it\u2019s going to make her day. More than that: I\u2019m positive it\u2019s going to make things right. She\u2019ll have even more roses than Lindsay Edgecombe. I start thinking about Lindsay\u2019s eyes bugging out of her head when she sees that Juliet Sykes has beaten her for the title of Most Valograms this year, and I let out a huge snort of laughter right in the middle of AP American History. Everyone whips around and stares at me, but I don\u2019t care. This must be what it\u2019s like to do drugs: the feeling of coasting over everything, of everything looking new and fresh and lit up from inside. Except without the next-day guilt and the hangover. And possible prison sentence.</p><p>When Mr. Tierney distributes his pop quiz, I spend the whole twenty minutes drawing hearts and balloons around the questions, and when he comes around to collect the papers I give him a smile so bright he actually winces, like he\u2019s not used to people looking happy.</p><p>Between classes I scour the hallways, looking for Kent. I\u2019m not even sure what I\u2019ll say to him when I see him. I can\u2019t really say anything. He doesn\u2019t know that we\u2019ve spent the past two nights together, that both nights we were so close that if one of us had breathed we would have ended up kissing, that last night I think we might have. But I have this incredible urge just to be around him, to see him doing those familiar, Kent-like things: flipping his hair out of his eyes, smiling his lopsided smile, shuffling his ridiculous checkered sneakers, and tucking his hands into the over-long cuffs of his button-downs. My heart shoots into my throat every time I think I see his loping walk, or catch sight of some floppy brown hair on a boy\u2014but it\u2019s never him, and each time it isn\u2019t, my heart does a reverse trajectory down into the very pit of my stomach.</p><p>I\u2019m guaranteed to see him in calc, at least. After life skills, I stop in the bathroom, and spend the three minutes before bell primping in front of the mirror, ignoring the s\u2019mores chattering on either side of me, and trying hard not to focus on the fact that I\u2019ll come face-to-face with Mr. Daimler in less than five minutes. My stomach\u2019s been performing its roller-coaster move so often\u2014a combination of waiting for Juliet to get the roses, hoping to see Kent, and being disappointed\u2014I\u2019m not sure it can withstand forty-five minutes of having to watch Mr. Daimler smirk and wink and grin at the class. I will away the memory of his tongue inside my mouth, wet and sloppy.</p><p>\u201cSuch a slut.\u201d One of the sophomores is coming out of a bathroom stall, shaking her head.</p> <p>For one paranoid second I\u2019m sure she\u2019s talking about me\u2014that somehow she has just read my mind\u2014but then her friends explode with laughter, and one of them says, \u201cI know. I hear she had sex with, like, three people on the basketball team,\u201d and I realize they\u2019re talking about Anna Cartullo. The stall door is swinging open and Lindsay\u2019s scrawl is obvious. AC=WT. And underneath it: Go back to the trailer, ho.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t believe everything you hear,\u201d I blurt out, and all three girls instantly shut their mouths and stare at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d I say, feeling bolder now that I have such a captive audience. \u201cYou know how most rumors start?\u201d</p><p>The girls shake their heads. They\u2019re standing so close I think for a second their skulls are going to knock together.</p><p>\u201cBecause somebody feels like it.\u201d</p><p>The bell rings then, and the sophomores scurry for the door like they\u2019ve been let out of class. I stand there, willing my feet out the door and down the hall and down a flight of stairs and to the right and into calc, but nothing happens. Instead I\u2019m fixated by the writing on the stall door, how Ally laughed and pointed to the copycat artists elsewhere. AC=WT. I\u2019m pretty sure Lindsay wrote it on a whim\u2014four measly letters, stupid, meaningless\u2014probably to test out a new marker and see how much ink it had. It would have been better, almost, if she\u2019d meant it. It would be better if she really hated Anna. Because it matters. It has mattered.</p><p>Without thinking about the fact that at this point I\u2019m going to be late to calc, I dampen a strip of paper towel, just as an experiment, and begin scrubbing at the writing on the stall door. It doesn\u2019t budge. But then, because I\u2019ve started, I can\u2019t stop. I look under the sink and find a dried-out Brillo pad and a can of Comet. I have to brace the door with one arm and lean hard with the other, scrubbing furiously, but after a little while the graffiti on the door has lightened, and after a little while longer you can hardly see the letters at all. I feel so good once I\u2019ve gotten them off that first door, I go down the row and scrub the remaining two, even though my arm is aching and cramping and I\u2019ve actually started to sweat a little bit in my tank top, mentally cursing Lindsay the whole time for her whims, for using permanent marker.</p><p>When all three stalls are finished I turn the doors out and look at their reflections in the mirror: blank, clean, featureless, the way stall doors should be. And for some reason it fills me with such pride and happiness I do a little dance right there, tapping my heels on the tile floor. It feels like I\u2019ve reached back in time and corrected something. I haven\u2019t felt so alive, so capable of doing things, in I don\u2019t know how long.</p><p>By now I really have ruined my makeup. Little pricks of sweat are beading across my forehead and the bridge of my nose. I splash cold water on my face and dry off with a scratchy paper towel, starting all over again with the mascara and cream blush in Rose Petal that Lindsay and I both use religiously. My heart is looping crazily in my chest, partly from exhilaration, partly from nerves. Next period is lunch, and lunchtime is showtime.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop doing that?\u201d Elody leans forward and presses my fingers\u2014which have been tapping\u2014flat against the table. \u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not turning rexi, are you, Sam?\u201d Lindsay gestures to my sandwich, which I\u2019ve only nibbled around the edges. Rexi is her word for anorexic, although I\u2019ve always thought it sounded like something you would name a dog. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for ordering the mystery meat.\u201d Ally makes a face at my roast beef, which I\u2019ve ordered despite the fact that it\u2019s borderline unacceptable. Things That Don\u2019t Matter When You\u2019ve Lived the Same Day Six Times and Died on at Least Two of Them: lunch meats and their relative coolness.</p><p>To my surprise Lindsay sticks up for me. \u201cIt\u2019s all mystery meat, Al. The turkey tastes like shoe bottoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNasty,\u201d Elody agrees.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always hated the turkey here,\u201d Ally admits, and we all look at one another and burst out laughing.</p> <p>It feels good to laugh, and the knot in my shoulders relaxes. Still, my fingers start up their involuntary drumming again, moving all on their own. I\u2019m scanning every single person who enters the cafeteria, looking alternately for Kent\u2014it\u2019s like, what, he doesn\u2019t eat now?\u2014and Juliet\u2019s shock of white blond hair. So far, nada.</p><p>\u201c...to Juliet?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been totally zoning out, thinking about Juliet, that for a second when I hear her name I think I\u2019ve only imagined it\u2014or worse, said it aloud myself. But then I see that Lindsay\u2019s looking at Ally, a strange smile curling on her lips, and I know she must have just asked about whether Juliet got our rose. I totally forgot that Ally and Juliet have biology together, and I\u2019m suddenly breathless. The room seems to tilt as I wait for Ally to respond. Oh my God, you guys, it was the weirdest thing...she got the biggest bouquet of flowers...she actually smiled.</p><p>Ally claps a hand over her mouth, her eyes bugging out. \u201cOh my God, you guys. I totally forgot to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hands clamp down over my eyes and I\u2019m so wound up I let out a little squeal. The hands smell like grease and\u2014of course\u2014lemon balm. Lindsay, Ally, and Elody crack up as Rob pulls his hands off my eyes. When I look up at him he\u2019s smiling, but there\u2019s a tightness around his eyes and I can tell he\u2019s unhappy.</p> <p>\u201cYou avoiding me now?\u201d he says, snapping the strap of my tank top like he\u2019s five.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d I say, trying to sound pleasant. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He jerks his head back toward the soda machine. \u201cI\u2019ve been standing over there for, like, fifteen minutes.\u201d His voice is low; he\u2019s clearly not happy to be having this conversation in front of my friends. \u201cYou haven\u2019t looked over or come over or anything.\u201d</p><p>You made me wait longer than that, I want to say, but obviously he wouldn\u2019t get it. Besides, as I watch him shuffling his scuffed-up New Balance sneakers, I realize he\u2019s not really so horrible. Yeah, he\u2019s selfish and not-so-smart and drinks too much and flirts with other girls and can\u2019t take off a bra for the life of him, not to mention what comes afterward, but someday he\u2019ll grow up a little and make a girl really happy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ignoring you, Rob, it\u2019s just...\u201d I blow air out of my cheeks, stalling. I\u2019ve never broken up with anybody before, and all the clich\u00e9s keep running through my head. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me. (No\u2014it is him. And me.) We\u2019re better off friends. (We were never friends.) \u201cThings between us have been...\u201d</p><p>He squints at me like he\u2019s trying to read in a different language. \u201cYou got my rose, right? Fifth period? You read the note?\u201d</p> <p>Like this will make it better. \u201cActually,\u201d I say, trying to keep the impatience out of my voice, \u201cI didn\u2019t get your rose. I cut fifth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Kingston.\u201d Across the table, Elody puts her hand to her chest and pretends to be shocked. \u201cI am very disappointed in you.\u201d More giggling.</p><p>I shoot her a look and turn back to Rob. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the point. The point is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a rose from you,\u201d Rob says, and I can see him very slowly starting to put it together: something is wrong. When Rob thinks, you can almost see gears shifting together in his brain.</p><p>This morning I made one other change in the Rose Room. I stopped by the C\u2019s and carefully rifled through Rob\u2019s roses\u2014skipping over the rose from Gabby Haynes, his ex-girlfriend, which said, When are we going to hang out like you promised, sexy?\u2014and removed the one from me, with the little note I spent hours agonizing over.</p><p>Lindsay slaps at Rob\u2019s arm, still thinking this is all a joke. \u201cBe patient, Rob,\u201d she says, winking at him. \u201cYour rose is coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatient?\u201d Rob scowls as though the word tastes bad in his mouth. He crosses his arms and stares at me. \u201cI get it. There is no rose, right? Did you forget or something?\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice makes my friends finally get it. They go silent, staring back and forth from Rob to me, me to Rob.</p> <p>Let me rephrase: someday he\u2019ll make a sorority girl really happy, a blonde named Becky with D boobs who doesn\u2019t mind getting man-handled like meat in a marinade.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t forget\u2014\u201d I start to say, but he cuts me off.</p><p>His voice is calm, very low, but I can hear the anger running underneath it\u2014hard and cold and cutting. \u201cYou make such a huge deal about Cupid Day. And then you don\u2019t keep up your end of the bargain. Typical.\u201d</p><p>Inside, my stomach is working like it\u2019s trying to digest a whole cow, but I lift my chin, staring at him. \u201cTypical? What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know.\u201d Rob passes a hand over his eyes and looks suddenly mean, reminding me of this trick my dad used to do where he would bring his hand down over his face, changing all of his features from happy to sad, then from sad back to happy, in an instant. \u201cYou don\u2019t exactly have a perfect history of keeping your promises\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsycho alert,\u201d Lindsay shouts out, probably hoping to diffuse the tension.</p><p>It works, kind of. I stand up so quickly I knock over my chair. Rob looks at me, disgusted, then taps the chair with his toe\u2014not hard, but enough so that it\u2019s loud\u2014and says, \u201cFind me later.\u201d</p><p>He stalks off into the cafeteria, but I\u2019m not watching him anymore. I\u2019m watching Juliet float, drift, skim into the room. Like she\u2019s already dead and we\u2019re just seeing her flickering back to life in patches, imperfectly.</p><p>She\u2019s not carrying anything, either, not a single stem, just a lumpy brown paper bag as always. My disappointment is so heavy and real I can taste it, a bitter lump in the back of my throat.</p><p>\u201c...And then one of the Cupids came in, and I swear, she had, like, three dozen flowers, all for Juliet.\u201d</p><p>I whip around. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Ally frowns a little at my tone of voice, but she repeats, \u201cShe just got, like, this huge bouquet of roses delivered to her. I\u2019ve never seen so many roses.\u201d She starts to giggle. \u201cMaybe Psycho has a stalker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what happened to our rose,\u201d Lindsay says, pouting. \u201cI specifically told them third period, bio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do with them?\u201d I interject.</p><p>Ally, Elody, and Lindsay stare at me. \u201cDo with what?\u201d Ally says.</p><p>\u201cThe roses. Did she\u2014did she throw them out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d Lindsay wrinkles her nose.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s just...\u201d They\u2019re all staring at me blankly. Elody has her mouth open and I can see mushed-up french fries in it. \u201cI think it\u2019s nice, okay? If someone sent her all those roses...I don\u2019t know. I just think it\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably sent them herself,\u201d Elody says, starting to giggle again.</p><p>I finally lose my temper. \u201cWhy? Why would you say that?\u201d</p><p>Elody jerks back like I\u2019ve hit her. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014it\u2019s Juliet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, exactly. It\u2019s Juliet. So what\u2019s the point? Nobody gives a shit about her. Nobody pays any attention.\u201d I lean forward, pressing both hands on the table, my head pounding from anger and frustration. \u201cWhat\u2019s. The. Point?\u201d</p><p>Alley frowns at me. \u201cIs this because you\u2019re upset about Rob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Lindsay folds her arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that anyway? Are you guys okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Rob,\u201d I say, squeezing the words out through gritted teeth.</p><p>Elody jumps in. \u201cIt was a joke, Sam. Yesterday you said you were scared Juliet would bite you if you went too close. You said she probably had rabies.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what really breaks me\u2014right then, when Elody says that. Or rather, when she reminds me that I said that: yesterday, six days ago, a whole different world ago. How is it possible, I think, to change so much and not be able to change anything at all? That\u2019s the very worst thing about all of this, a feeling of desperate hopelessness, and I realize my question to Elody is the question that\u2019s been tearing me up all along. What\u2019s the point? If I\u2019m dead\u2014if I can\u2019t change anything, if I can\u2019t fix it\u2014what\u2019s the point?</p><p>\u201cSam\u2019s right.\u201d Lindsay winks at me, still not getting it. \u201cIt\u2019s Cupid Day, you know? A time of love and forgiveness, even for the psychos of the world.\u201d She raises a rose like it\u2019s a glass of champagne. \u201cTo Juliet.\u201d</p><p>Ally and Elody lift their roses, giggling. \u201cTo Juliet,\u201d they say in unison.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d Lindsay raises an eyebrow. \u201cCare to toast with us?\u201d</p><p>I spin around and head to the back of the senior section, to the door that leads directly to the parking lot. Lindsay shouts something, and Ally calls, \u201cShe didn\u2019t throw them out, okay?\u201d</p><p>I keep going anyway, threading past tables piled with food and roses and bags, everyone talking and laughing, oblivious. I get a pang in my stomach that feels like regret. Everything looks so stupidly, happily normal: everyone just wasting time because they have so much of it to waste, minutes slipping by on who\u2019s with who and did you hear.</p><p>On the horizon is the black line of clouds, just sitting there, a curtain about to be closed. I scan the parking lot, looking for Juliet, bouncing up and down on my toes to keep warm. Music blares from a car in Senior Alley and I recognize Krista Murphy\u2019s silver Taurus gun up toward the exit. Otherwise the parking lot is still. Juliet has melted away somewhere into the landscape of metal and pavement.</p><p>I take a breath and exhale a cloud, enjoying the sharp sting of the air on my throat. I\u2019m almost relieved that Juliet is gone. I\u2019m not sure exactly what I would have said to her. And she didn\u2019t throw out the flowers, after all. That\u2019s a good sign. I stand there for a second more, bouncing on my toes, thinking, Tonight\u2019s the night I\u2019m going to get free of this thing. Thinking of all the things I\u2019m going to do more of in my life. Go up to Goose Point with Izzy, until she\u2019s too old to stand it. Hang out with Elody one-on-one. Drive into New York and go to a Yankees game with Lindsay, and stuff my face with hot dogs and catcall all the players.</p><p>Kiss Kent. Really kiss him, slow and long, somewhere outside\u2014maybe while it\u2019s snowing. Maybe standing in the woods. He\u2019ll lean forward and he\u2019ll have little snowflakes on his eyelashes again and he\u2019ll brush the hair away from my face and put a warm hand behind my neck, so warm it\u2019s almost burning\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, Sam.\u201d Kent\u2019s voice.</p><p>I spin around with a squeak, tripping on my own feet. Just like with Juliet Sykes, I\u2019m so lost in fantasy about Kent that his actual appearance seems like a dream or wishful thinking. He\u2019s wearing an old corduroy blazer with patches sewn onto the elbows like a deranged\u2014and adorable\u2014English teacher. The corduroy looks soft and I get the urge to reach out and touch it, an urge that has nothing to do with my general sense of today and the preciousness of things.</p><p>Kent\u2019s hands are buried in his pockets, and his shoulders are shrugged toward his ears like he\u2019s trying to stay warm. \u201cNo calculus today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...no.\u201d I\u2019ve been waiting to run into him all day, but now my mind is a blank.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d Kent grins at me, jogging on his feet. \u201cYou missed some roses.\u201d He whips his bag over one shoulder and unzips it, pulling out the cream-and-pink-swirled rose with a gold note card fluttering from one end. \u201cA few of them went back to the office, I think. But I\u2014uh, I wanted to bring this one to you myself. It\u2019s a little crushed. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not crushed,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He bites the edge of his lip\u2014the cutest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. I think he might be nervous. His eyes are flitting over my face and then away, and each time they land on me it feels like the world is falling away and it\u2019s just the two of us in the middle of a bright, green field.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t miss anything in math,\u201d he says, and I recognize a Kent McFuller babble coming on. \u201cI mean, we went over some of the stuff from Wednesday\u2019s homework because some people were, like, freaking out about the quiz on Monday. But mostly everyone was a little bit antsy, I think because of Cupid Day, and Daimler didn\u2019t really care that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKent?\u201d</p> <p>He blinks and shuts up. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you send me this?\u201d I hold up the rose. \u201cI mean, is it from you?\u201d</p><p>His smile gets so big it\u2019s like a huge beam of sunshine. \u201cI\u2019ll never tell,\u201d he says, winking.</p><p>I\u2019ve unconsciously taken several steps toward him, so I can feel the heat coming off his body. I wonder what he would do if I pulled him to me right now, brushed my lips against his the way he did\u2014the way I hope he did\u2014last night. But even the idea sends a flurry of butterflies upward from my stomach, my whole body feeling quivery and uncertain.</p><p>At that moment I remember what Ally said to us on the first day, the day it all started: that if a group of butterflies takes off in Thailand it can cause rainstorms in New York. And I think of all the thousands of billions of steps and missteps and chances and coincidences that have brought me here, facing Kent, holding a pink-and-cream-swirled rose, and it feels like the biggest miracle in the world.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I blurt out, and quickly add, \u201cyou know...for bringing me this.\u201d</p> <p>He ducks his head, looking pleased and embarrassed. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um, hear you\u2019re having a party tonight?\u201d I\u2019m mentally kicking myself for sounding so lame. In my head, this played out so much easier. In my head, he would lean down and do the thing with his lips again, the soft fluttery thing. I\u2019m desperate to make it all go right again, desperate to get back to that feeling I had last night\u2014we had last night, he must have felt it\u2014but I\u2019m afraid that anything I say could screw it up. A temporary sadness for what I\u2019ve lost overwhelms me. Somewhere in the endless spinning of eternity that one, tiny, fraction of a second where our lips met is lost forever.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His face lights up. \u201cParents out of town, you know. Are you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d I say, so forcefully he looks kind of startled. \u201cI mean,\u201d I continue at a normal volume, \u201cit\u2019s going to be the place to be, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope so.\u201d Kent\u2019s voice is slow and warm, like syrup, and I wish I could close my eyes and just listen to it. \u201cI got two kegs.\u201d He twirls his finger in the air like, whoop-dee-doo.</p><p>\u201cI would come anyway.\u201d I mentally kick myself: what does that even mean?</p><p>Kent looks like he gets it, though, because he blushes. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says. \u201cI was hoping you would. I mean, I figured you would because you\u2019re always at parties, you know, out and stuff, but I didn\u2019t know if there was another party or something, or maybe you and your friends do something different on Fridays\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKent?\u201d</p> <p>He does that adorable quick stop of his mouth. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>I lick my lips, unsure of how to say what I want to, squeezing my hands into fists.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He puckers his forehead. Adorable\u2014how did I not realize how adorable he is?\u2014and not making it any easier.</p><p>Deep breaths, in and out. \u201cIt\u2019s going to sound completely insane, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He leans even closer, until our lips are less than four inches apart. I can smell peppermint candy on his breath, and my head starts spinning wildly like it\u2019s been turned into a gigantic merry-go-round.</p><p>\u201cI, um, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d</p><p>Kent and I both instinctively take one step back as Lindsay shoulders her way out of the cafeteria door, my messenger bag and hers slung over one arm. I\u2019m actually grateful for the interruption, since I was either about to confess that I died a few days ago or that I was falling for him.</p><p>Lindsay lumbers over, being really melodramatic about the fact that she\u2019s carrying two bags, like they\u2019re both made out of iron. \u201cSo are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flit momentarily over Kent, but other than that she doesn\u2019t even acknowledge him. She plants herself almost directly in front of him like he\u2019s not even there, like he\u2019s not worth her time, and when Kent looks away and pretends not to notice I feel sick. I want to convey, somehow, that she isn\u2019t me\u2014that I know he\u2019s worth my time. He\u2019s better than my time.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to The Country\u2019s Best Yogurt or what?\u201d She puts a hand on her stomach and makes a face. \u201cI swear to God, those fries gave me bloat that can only be solved by chemical deliciousness.\u201d</p><p>Kent gives me a quick nod and starts to walk away, no good-bye, no nothing, just trying to get out of there as fast as he can.</p><p>I duck around Lindsay and call out, \u201cBye, Kent! See you later!\u201d</p><p>He turns around quickly, surprised, and gives me a huge smile. \u201cLater, Sam.\u201d He touches his head, a salute, like one of those guys in an old black-and-white movie, and then he lopes off back into Main.</p><p>Lindsay watches him for a minute, then looks at me and narrows her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that? Kent stalk you into submission yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, because I don\u2019t care what Lindsay thinks. I\u2019m buzzing from his smile and being so close to him. I feel light and invincible, the best kind of tipsy.</p><p>She stares at me for one beat longer and then just shrugs. \u201cNothing says \u2018I love you\u2019 like a brick through the window.\u201d Then she slips her arm through mine. \u201cYogurt?\u201d</p><p>And that, for all her million and one faults, is why I love Lindsay Edgecombe.</p><p>THE ROOT AND BUD</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sam.\u201d Lindsay\u2019s looking up at Kent\u2019s house greedily, like it\u2019s made out of chocolate. \u201cYour face looks fine.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m checking my makeup for the fiftieth time in the flip-down mirror. I put a final slick of lip gloss on and fish a gummy piece of mascara from the corner of my eyelashes, practicing the speech I\u2019ve rehearsed in my head. Listen, Kent, this may sound random, but I was wondering if you, you know, wanted to hang out sometime....</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d Ally leans forward from the backseat, her Burberry puffy jacket crackling. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to do it with Rob, what are you freaking out about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not freaking out,\u201d I say. Despite the fact that I\u2019ve put on cream blush and moisturizer with a slight tint, I look vampire-pale.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re freaking out,\u201d Lindsay, Elody, and Ally say at the same time, and then start laughing.</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want a shot?\u201d Ally pokes my shoulder with the vodka bottle.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d I\u2019m too nervous to drink, weirdly. Besides, this is the first day of my new beginning. From now on I\u2019m going to do things right. I\u2019m going to be a different person, a good person. I\u2019m going to be the kind of person who would be remembered well, not just remembered. I\u2019ve been repeating this over and over, and just the idea of it is giving me strength, something solid I can hold on to, a lifeline.</p><p>It\u2019s helping me beat back the fear and the buzzing sense somewhere deep inside me that I\u2019ve forgotten to do something, that something\u2019s off.</p><p>Lindsay puts her arms around me and plants a kiss on my cheek. Her breath smells like vodka and Tic Tacs. \u201cOur very own designated driver,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like an after-school special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an after-school special,\u201d Elody says. \u201cThe warning kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk, slutsky,\u201d Lindsay says, turning around to peg Elody with a tube of lip gloss. Elody catches it and squeals triumphantly, then dabs some on her lips.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m the freezing kind,\u201d Ally says. \u201cCan we go in, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame?\u201d Lindsay turns to me, flourishing her hand and bowing slightly.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d I keep on running lines in my head: You know, catch a movie, or go get something to eat or whatever...I know it\u2019s been a couple of years since we really talked....</p><p>The party is loud, a giant roar. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m sober, but everyone looks ridiculously packed together, hot and uncomfortable, and for the first time in a long time, I feel shy walking in, like people are staring at me. I keep my mind on what I\u2019m here to do: find Kent.</p><p>\u201cCrazy.\u201d Lindsay leans forward and circles her hand in the air, gesturing to all the people smashed together, moving an inch at a time, like they\u2019re all connected by an invisible rope.</p><p>We push our way upstairs. Everyone\u2019s eyes look bright, like dolls\u2019 eyes, from alcohol and maybe other stuff. It\u2019s kind of creepy, actually. Even though I\u2019ve been in school with all these people forever, they look different, unfamiliar, and when they smile at me I just see teeth everywhere, like piranhas getting ready to eat something. I feel like a curtain has dropped away and I\u2019m seeing people for who they really are, different and sharp and unknowable. For the first time in days, I think about the dream I was having for a while, where I\u2019m walking through a party and everyone looks familiar except for one thing, something off. I wonder if the real point of that dream was not that other people were transforming, but that I was. Lindsay keeps one finger jabbed into the small of my back, encouraging me to keep moving, and I\u2019m glad for it. That little point of connection gives me courage.</p><p>I push my way into the first room at the top of the stairs, one of the biggest, and my heart drops all the way into my stomach: Kent. He\u2019s standing in the corner talking to Phoebe Rifer, and instantly my mind goes fuzzy, a big useless snowstorm. My mouth feels like it\u2019s stuffed with cotton and I totally regret not taking at least one shot, just so I won\u2019t be so aware of how weird and tall and awkward I feel, like I\u2019m Alice in Wonderland and have gotten too big for the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I whirl around to say something to Lindsay\u2014I don\u2019t know what, but I need to be talking to someone, not just standing there gaping like some kind of overgrown vegetable\u2014but she\u2019s vanished. Of course. She must have gone to find Patrick. I ball my hands into fists and close my eyes. That means any second now, in three, two, one...</p><p>\u201cSam.\u201d Rob doesn\u2019t put his arms around me, and when I turn around, he\u2019s looking down his nose at me like I smell. It\u2019s insane, but I\u2019ve actually forgotten he was going to be at the party. I haven\u2019t been thinking about him at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were going to show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d I fold my arms across my chest after Rob flicks his eyes not so subtly down to my boobs.</p><p>\u201cYou were acting all crazy today.\u201d There it is: the slur coming out. \u201cSo what? Are you going to apologize?\u201d He grins, lazy and sloppy. \u201cWe can figure out a way for you to make it up to me.\u201d</p> <p>Anger bubbles up inside of me. He\u2019s looking me up and down like his eyes are fingers and he\u2019s trying to touch all of me at once. I can\u2019t believe how many nights I spent on his basement couch, letting him slobber on me. Years and years of fantasy fall away in that one second.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d I\u2019m struggling to control my temper, but I can\u2019t keep the edge out of my voice. Fortunately, Rob\u2019s too drunk to notice. \u201cI\u2019d like that. To make it up to you, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Rob\u2019s face lights up and he takes a step closer to me, wraps his arms around my waist. I shudder inwardly but force myself to stay put.</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d I dance my fingers up his chest, sneaking a glance at Kent, who\u2019s still talking to Phoebe. I\u2019m momentarily distracted\u2014Phoebe has the personality of a freaking noodle, for God\u2019s sake\u2014but I snap my eyes back to Rob\u2019s face and force myself to flirt. \u201cI think we need a little one-on-one time, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d Rob lurches a little to one side. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p> <p>I reach up on my tiptoes so I\u2019m whispering in his ear. \u201cThere\u2019s a bedroom on this floor. Bumper stickers all over the door. Go inside and wait for me. Wait for me naked.\u201d I pull away, giving him my sexiest smile. \u201cAnd I promise to give you the best apology ever.\u201d</p><p>Rob\u2019s eyes are nearly bugging out of his head. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He detaches himself from me and takes a stumbling step in the direction of the hallway, then something occurs to him and he spins around. \u201cYou\u2019ll be there soon, right?\u201d</p><p>This time there\u2019s nothing forced about my smile. \u201cFive minutes,\u201d I say, holding up my right hand with my fingers splayed. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>When I turn away from Rob it\u2019s a struggle to keep from bursting out laughing, and all the nervousness I feel about talking to Kent dissipates. I\u2019m ready to march right up to him and shove my tongue down his throat if I have to.</p> <p>Except that he\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no way for a lady to talk.\u201d Ally comes up behind me, raising her eyebrows as she takes a swig from the bottle. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Attack of the Cokran Crisis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d I rub my forehead. \u201cHave you, um, seen Kent McFuller?\u201d</p><p>Ally squints at me. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKent. McFuller,\u201d I say a little louder, and two sophomores whip around and stare at me. I stare right back until they look away.</p><p>\u201cThe host with the most.\u201d Ally raises her bottle. \u201cWhy, did you break something already? It\u2019s a pretty good party, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good party.\u201d I try not to roll my eyes. She\u2019s too tipsy to be useful. I gesture toward the back of the house. Lindsay and Elody should be in the back room, and Kent must be close. \u201cLet\u2019s circulate.\u201d</p> <p>Ally takes my arm. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I spot Amy Weiss\u2014probably the biggest gossip in the entire school\u2014making out with Oren Talmadge in the doorway like she\u2019s starving and his mouth is stuffed with Cheetos. I drag Ally toward them.</p><p>\u201cYou want to circulate with Amy Weiss?\u201d Ally hisses in my ear. Freshman year Amy spread the rumor that Ally let Fred Dannon and two other boys touch her boobs behind the gym in exchange for a month\u2019s worth of math homework. I\u2019ve never been sure whether the story was true or not\u2014Ally swears it wasn\u2019t, Fred swears it was, and Lindsay guesses that Ally only let them look, not touch\u2014but in any case Ally and Amy have been unofficial archnemeses since then.</p><p>\u201cPit stop.\u201d I tap Amy\u2019s shoulder and she extricates herself from Oren\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sam.\u201d Her face lights up. She glances quickly at Ally, then back to me, snaking her arms around Oren\u2019s neck. Oren looks extremely confused, probably wondering what happened to the suckfish on his face. \u201cSorry. Am I blocking the hallway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust your butt is,\u201d Ally says cheerfully. I squeeze her arm and she yelps. The last thing I need is for Amy and Ally to get into it.</p><p>\u201cYou know there\u2019s a much better spot,\u201d I say, \u201cif you and Oren want...you know, more privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want privacy,\u201d Oren pipes up.</p><p>I smile at him. \u201cOpen bedroom. Bumper stickers on the door. Extra-soft bed.\u201d I raise my fingers to my lips, blow a kiss to Amy. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Ally explodes as soon as we\u2019re out of earshot. \u201cSince when are you and Amy BFF?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story.\u201d I\u2019m feeling good, powerful, and in control. Things are turning out the way they should. I put my hand on the door to Kent\u2019s room as I pass it. Sorry, Rob.</p><p>Ally and I weave through the hallway. I\u2019m scanning the crowd for Kent, ducking into various side rooms, getting more and more frustrated when I don\u2019t see him.</p><p>We hear someone scream and then there\u2019s an explosion of laughter. For a moment my heart stops and I think, It can\u2019t be, not tonight, not again, not Juliet, but then I hear Oren yell, \u201cDude, pull your pants up, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d Ally pokes her head out of the doorway of the room we\u2019re in and looks back in the direction of Kent\u2019s room. Her eyes get so big and round she looks like a cartoon character.</p><p>\u201cUm, Sam? You might want to see this.\u201d</p><p>I peek out into the hallway. Rob is booking it toward the stairs\u2014or trying to, at least. It\u2019s a little hard for him to move quickly since he\u2019s (a) absolutely surrounded by people gaping at him and (b) more than a little unsteady on his feet\u2014wearing nothing but his boxer shorts and his New Balance sneakers with mismatched socks. And his hat, of course. He\u2019s clutching the rest of his clothes in front of his crotch and keeps barking at people, \u201cWhat the hell are you looking at?\u201d</p><p>I would feel bad for him if it weren\u2019t for the sneakers. Like what, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to take them off? He was too busy planning his method of attack on my bra or something? Plus, when he\u2019s almost at the stairs, he lurches accidentally into a sophomore, but instead of pulling away he wraps her in a drunken hug. I can\u2019t hear what he says, but when she untangles herself I can see she\u2019s giggling, like getting mauled by a half-naked, sweaty senior who\u2019s blitzed out of his mind is the best thing that\u2019s happened to her all day.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d I say to Ally. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely broken up. It\u2019s official.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s looking at me strangely. \u201cKent.\u201d</p><p>My heart flutters. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kent.\u201d</p><p>My brain taps out again. She knows. It\u2019s obvious that I\u2019ve been completely obsessing over him; maybe Lindsay said something after she found us together outside the cafeteria. \u201cI\u2014the Rob thing has nothing to do with\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ally shakes her head, jabs a finger over my shoulder. \u201cKent. Behind you. Weren\u2019t you looking for him earlier?\u201d</p><p>Relief washes over me. She doesn\u2019t know. Then a tiny twinge of disappointment too. She doesn\u2019t know because there\u2019s nothing to know. He doesn\u2019t even know. I spin around and search the hall for him.</p><p>\u201cIn there.\u201d Ally points to a door ten feet down the hall. From our angle it\u2019s impossible to see more than a few feet into the room, which, from the huge desk blocking over half of the doorway, looks to be a storage space or a study. People are flowing in and out.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I haul Ally off again, but she breaks free.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go find Lindsay.\u201d She\u2019s clearly tired of whatever mission I\u2019m on. I nod and she scoots off toward the back room, using the vodka bottle like a cattle prod, poking people out of her way. A hand clamps down on my arm and I jump.</p><p>I turn around: Bridget McGuire and Alex Liment.</p><p>\u201cYou have Mrs. Harbor for English, right?\u201d She doesn\u2019t wait for me to answer before launching into her spiel. \u201cDo you know if she handed out the essay assignments for Macbeth? Alex missed. Doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d</p><p>Because I didn\u2019t go with Lindsay for frozen yogurt after all\u2014something was tugging at me, making me want to stay close to school, to the center of things\u2014I\u2019d almost forgotten about Bridget and Anna and Alex. And now the look on Alex\u2019s face\u2014the little, crooked smile that used to creep onto Rob\u2019s face whenever he\u2019d successfully gotten an extension from one of his teachers for some completely fabricated reason\u2014makes me want to smack him. I think of Anna with her coal-black eye makeup and her improvised lunchroom on the floor of the abandoned bathroom. Even Bridget isn\u2019t so bad. Annoying, yes, but pretty and nice and the type of person who probably spends her free time volunteering with sick children.</p><p>I can\u2019t take it. I can\u2019t let him get away with it.</p><p>Bridget\u2019s still babbling about Alex\u2019s mom being a health nut. I interrupt her. \u201cDoes anybody smell Chinese food?\u201d</p><p>Bridget wrinkles her nose, clearly disappointed that I haven\u2019t been listening. \u201cChinese food?\u201d</p><p>I make a big show of sniffing. \u201cYeah. Like, like\u201d\u2014I stare directly at Alex\u2014\u201clike a big bowl of orange beef.\u201d</p><p>His smile droops a little, but he shrugs and says, \u201cI don\u2019t smell anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Bridget cups a hand in front of her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s not my breath, is it? I totally had Chinese food last night.\u201d</p><p>I keep staring at Alex. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d I ask, not even bothering to keep the edge out of my voice.</p><p>He blinks. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Bridget looks confused, and for a moment the three of us stand there, not saying anything. Alex and I have locked eyes, and Bridget is looking back and forth between us so rapidly I\u2019m worried her neck\u2019s going to snap off.</p><p>Then I smile. \u201cYou know, health-wise. Why did you have to go to the doctor?\u201d</p><p>Alex relaxes visibly. \u201cNo big deal. My mom wanted me to get some weird shot. And you know, just a general checkup and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmmm. I hope they were thorough.\u201d I shoot a pointed glance at his crotch. Fortunately Bridget is staring at him, watching him turn red, and doesn\u2019t see. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm. Y-yeah. Pretty much.\u201d He squints at me like he\u2019s just noticed me for the first time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for a doctor,\u201d I breeze on. I feel bad for Bridget, but at the same time, she deserves to know what her lame excuse for a boyfriend is up to. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to find a good one, you know? Especially one that doubles as a restaurant with a $4.99 lunch special. That\u2019s rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Bridget\u2019s voice is a squeak. She whips back to Alex. \u201cWhat is she talking about?\u201d</p><p>A muscle is ticking in Alex\u2019s jaw. I can tell he wants to curse me out but knows that would make it worse, so he just stands there glaring.</p> <p>I put my hand on Bridget\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Bridget. But your boyfriend is really a slimeball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is she talking about?\u201d</p><p>Bridget\u2019s voice shoots up another octave, and as I walk away I hear Alex start trying to calm her down, no doubt feeding her lies as quickly as he can come up with them. I should feel good about what I\u2019ve done\u2014he deserves it, after all, and in a weird way I\u2019m only setting things right\u2014but as soon as I walk away I feel strangely deflated. The feeling of control vanishes and in its place comes a tingly feeling of anxiety. I flip back through the day\u2019s events like I\u2019m scrolling down a computer screen, trying to find some lapse, something I\u2019ve forgotten to do or say. Maybe I should have gone to Juliet\u2019s house earlier, to check up on her. Then again, I\u2019m not really sure what I would have said. Hi. Can you verify for me that you\u2019re not going to throw yourself in front of any cars tonight? That would be great. No explosives, either. This is my life you\u2019re playing with.</p><p>The music\u2019s so loud, the notes are hardly distinguishable from one another. I fantasize about taking Kent\u2019s hand and pulling him away somewhere quiet and dark. The room downstairs, maybe, or the woods, or someplace farther. Maybe we\u2019ll just get in the car and drive.</p><p>\u201cSam! Sam!\u201d</p> <p>I look up. In the back room Lindsay\u2019s climbed onto one of the couches, waving at me over the tide of bobbing heads. Ally\u2019s next to her, and several feet beyond them I see Elody whispering something to Steve Dough.</p><p>I hesitate, a sense of hopelessness washing over me. It\u2019s ridiculous for me to talk to Kent. I have no words to describe how wrong I\u2019ve been about him, about Rob, about everyone. I don\u2019t think I can explain to him how I\u2019ve been changing. And maybe it\u2019s all a lie, anyway. Maybe it\u2019s impossible to change.</p><p>In that moment, while I\u2019m teetering between two doorways, the people around me get all quiet and hushed, faces growing slack. Up on the couch Lindsay falters, her hand flapping uselessly to her side. Next to her, Ally begins opening and shutting her mouth like a fish. The buzzing is all through my body now, like the hum of an electrical wire.</p><p>And there she is, marching down the hallway. After all that: Juliet Sykes on a mission.</p><p>In a second the despair, the hopelessness, the sense of forgetting things or missing the point somehow, all gets transformed into rage. When she sees Lindsay she stops and opens her mouth, going straight into her \u201cyou\u2019re a bitch\u201d routine, but I don\u2019t even let the first word escape from her mouth before I\u2019m charging forward, grabbing her arm, and half dragging her backward down the hallway. She\u2019s too surprised to fight me.</p><p>I pull her into the nearest bathroom\u2014\u201cOut,\u201d I order two girls who are primping in front of the mirror\u2014and slam the door and lock it. When I turn around to face her she\u2019s staring at me like I\u2019m the psychopath.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She must misunderstand my question. \u201cIt\u2019s a party,\u201d she says with soft insistence. When she\u2019s not busy freaking out and calling me a bitch she has a nice voice, musical like Elody\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to be here like everybody else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head, pressing fingers to my temples to keep them from pounding. \u201cI mean, what are you really doing? Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flutter to the doorknob behind me. I move over so it\u2019s wedged into my lower back. If she wants to get out, she\u2019ll have to move me out of the way.</p><p>Apparently she doesn\u2019t like her chances, because she takes a long, slow breath. \u201cI came to tell you something. You, and Lindsay, and Elody, and Ally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch,\u201d she says quietly, not like an accusation at all, more like something she\u2019s sorry about.</p><p>At the same time she says it, I say it with her. \u201cI\u2019m a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>She stares at me.</p><p>\u201cListen, Juliet\u201d\u2014I rake my hands through my hair\u2014\u201cI know we haven\u2019t always been nice to you or whatever. And I really feel bad about it\u2014I do.\u201d I try to gauge what she\u2019s thinking, but it\u2019s like something has shut down behind her eyes, a button switching off, and she just stands there staring at me dully. I rush on, \u201cThe thing is, we never really meant anything by it, you know? I don\u2019t think I\u2014we\u2014really thought about it. It\u2019s just the kind of thing that happens. People used to make fun of me all the time.\u201d She\u2019s making me nervous, just staring like that, and I lick my lips. \u201cAll the time. And, like, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really because people are mean or bad or whatever. I just think...I just think...\u201d I\u2019m fighting to find the words. Memories are colliding in my head: the sound of people singing as I walked down the hall, the smell of ice cream on Lindsay\u2019s breath the day we threw Beth\u2019s tampons out the window, riding a horse through a blur of trees. \u201cI just think that people don\u2019t think. They don\u2019t know. We\u2014I\u2014didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I feel pretty proud of myself for getting all of that out. But Juliet hasn\u2019t moved or smiled or even freaked out. She\u2019s so still she could be carved out of stone. Finally a little tremor goes through her, a personal earthquake, and her eyes seem to focus on me.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t always been that nice to me?\u201d she says dully, and my stomach sinks. She didn\u2019t hear a word I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014yeah. And I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids flutter. \u201cIn seventh grade you and Lindsay stole all my clothes from the locker room so I had to walk around in my sweaty gym clothes for the rest of the day. Then you called me Stinky Sykes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t remember that.\u201d The way she\u2019s staring at me is awful, like she\u2019s seeing in and through and beyond me to some void.</p><p>\u201cThat was before you came up with Psycho, of course.\u201d Juliet\u2019s voice has lost its musical quality. It\u2019s completely toneless. She raises her arm and mimes slashing a knife through the air, emitting a series of high-pitched shrieks that send chills up and down my arms, and for a moment I think maybe she is crazy. Then she drops her arm. \u201cReal funny. Psycho killer, qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est. Catchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople used to tell this really dumb joke about me. Kind of sing it when I walked by. What\u2019s red and white and weird all over...\u201d I\u2019m hoping to make her laugh or twitch or something, but she just keeps staring at me with that dumb, animal look on her face, a blank.</p><p>\u201cI never sang it,\u201d she says, and then, like she\u2019s forced to keep reciting everything we ever did, continues. \u201cYou took pictures of me when I was showering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Lindsay,\u201d I say automatically, getting more and more uncomfortable. If she would get angry, it would be one thing\u2014but it\u2019s like she\u2019s not even seeing me, like she\u2019s just reading off a list she\u2019s looked at a million times.</p><p>\u201cYou posted the pictures all over the school. Where teachers could see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe took them down in, like, an hour.\u201d I\u2019m ashamed as soon as I say the words. As though the fact that we took them down makes it better.</p><p>\u201cYou hacked into my Yahoo account. You published my\u2014my private emails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t us,\u201d I say quickly, feeling a rush of relief that this, at least, was not our fault. To this day I\u2019m not sure who did hack her account, and circulate email exchanges between Juliet and some guy named Path2Pain118 she\u2019d obviously met in a chat room. There were dozens of emails, all of them long rants about how much high school sucked and how awful everybody was. The hacker had forwarded the emails to almost everyone in school after giving them a new subject line: Future School Shooters of America. I shiver, thinking about how easy it is to be totally wrong about people\u2014to see one tiny part of them and confuse it for the whole, to see the cause and think it\u2019s the effect or vice versa. And though I\u2019ve now been at Kent\u2019s house five times in six days I feel disoriented, confused by the bright bathroom light and Juliet\u2019s impassive face and the sounds of the party coming through the door.</p><p>Juliet keeps going on like I didn\u2019t even speak. \u201cYou started the rumor that I lost my virginity for a pack of cigarettes.\u201d</p><p>Ally. That was Ally. I can\u2019t say it. It doesn\u2019t matter, anyway. It was us. It was all of us. Everyone who repeated the story and whispered \u201cslut\u201d and made a smoker\u2019s hacking cough whenever she walked by.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even smoke.\u201d She says this with a smile, like this is the funniest thing in the world. Like this, her whole life, is one big joke.</p><p>\u201cJuliet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister heard that rumor. She told my parents. I\u2014\u201d Finally she loses it a little, balling her hands into fists and squeezing them against her thighs. \u201cI\u2019ve never even kissed anyone.\u201d This comes out as a fierce whisper\u2014a confession\u2014and the intensity of it, the sadness and regret, makes a black well of anger break somewhere inside of me.</p><p>\u201cI know, okay? I know we did horrible things. I know we\u2019ve been shitty and things are bad and\u2014\u201d I break off, the words getting tangled in my throat. I\u2019m on the verge of tears, full of blind fury that hits me like a cloud, blots out everything but a single burning point of frustration: I can\u2019t make her see, can\u2019t make her see that I\u2019m trying to make things right. I feel like I\u2019m watching both of our lives swirl down the drain, mine and hers, wrapped around each other. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, I want to make it up to you. I\u2019m trying to apologize. Things\u2014things are going to get better.\u201d</p><p>She presses her lips together, staring at me mute and white-faced, and I have to tense every muscle in my arms to keep from reaching out and grabbing her shoulders, shaking her.</p><p>\u201cI mean...\u201d I\u2019m going on blindly now, groping, grabbing at words and ideas as they come buzzing up to me through my anger, trying to get through to her. \u201cYou got those roses today, right? Like a whole bunch of them?\u201d</p><p>An enormous shudder goes through her. And now a light snaps on in her eyes again, but instead of gratitude, there\u2019s hatred burning there.</p><p>\u201cI knew it. I knew it was you.\u201d Her voice is so full of rage and pain I rear back like she\u2019s hit me. \u201cWhat was that? Another one of your little jokes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her reaction is so unexpected it takes me a few seconds to think of a response. \u201cWhat? No. That wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor little Psycho.\u201d Juliet narrows her eyes, almost hissing at me. \u201cNo friends. No roses. Let\u2019s screw with her one more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to screw with you.\u201d I have no idea what\u2019s happening or how things have gone so badly wrong. \u201cIt was supposed to be nice.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know that she even hears me. She leans closer. \u201cSo what was the plan? What were you going to do with that \u2018secret admirer\u2019 crap? Bribe one of your friends so he\u2019d pretend to like me? Ask me out? Maybe even to go to prom? And then\u2014what? On the night that we\u2019re supposed to go, he just won\u2019t show up? And it will be so goddamned funny if I freak out, if I go crazy, if I cry or break down in the hallways when I see him in school.\u201d She jerks away. \u201cSorry to disappoint you, but you\u2019re repeating yourselves. Been there, done that. Eighth grade. Spring Fling. Andrew Roberts.\u201d</p> <p>She slumps forward as though her speech has exhausted her, the anger and the burning light disappearing simultaneously, all the expression going out of her face, her hands uncurling.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you didn\u2019t have a plan,\u201d she says, this time quietly, almost sweetly. \u201cMaybe there was no point to it at all. Maybe you just wanted to remind me that I have nobody, no friends, no secret admirers. \u2018Maybe next year, but probably not,\u2019 right?\u201d She smiles at me again, and it\u2019s much worse than her anger.</p><p>By this point I\u2019m so frustrated and bewildered I have to fight back tears. \u201cI swear, Juliet, that wasn\u2019t the point. I just\u2014I thought it would be nice. I thought it would make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me feel better?\u201d She repeats the words as though she\u2019s never heard them before, and now her eyes have a dreamy, faraway look. Every trace of anger and emotion is gone. She looks peaceful, even, and I\u2019m struck by how beautiful she is\u2014up close, just like a supermodel, with that ghostly pale skin and those huge blue eyes, the color of the sky very early in the morning.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d she says in little more than a whisper. \u201cYou never knew me. And you can\u2019t make me better. Nobody can make me better.\u201d</p> <p>This reminds me of what I said to Kent only two days ago\u2014I don\u2019t think I can be fixed\u2014but now I know I was wrong. Everyone can be fixed; it has to be that way, it\u2019s the only thing that makes sense. I\u2019m trying to figure out a way to tell Juliet this, to convince her of it, but very calmly, and with that floating grace she\u2019s always had, she puts her hand on one of my arms and moves me gently but firmly out of the way, and I find myself stepping aside and letting her reach for the door handle. The tears are pushing at the back of my throat, and I\u2019m still struggling for words, and the whole time it\u2019s like her face is growing paler and paler, glowing almost, like the sheer white point of a flame; and I have this idea that I\u2019m already seeing her sputter out, her life flickering in front of me, a TV on static.</p><p>She pauses with her hand on the door, staring directly in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I used to be friends with Lindsay.\u201d She\u2019s still speaking in that horrible, calm voice, as though she\u2019s talking from a distance of miles and miles. \u201cWhen we were younger we did everything together. I still have a friendship necklace she gave me, one of those hearts split down the middle. When you put them together the necklace spelled \u2018Best Friends Forever.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I want to ask what happened, why they stopped being friends, but the words are stuck behind the lump in my throat. And I\u2019m scared of interrupting. As long as Juliet\u2019s talking to me, she\u2019s safe.</p><p>\u201cThat was right before her parents got divorced.\u201d Juliet shoots a quick glance in my direction, but her eyes seem to go directly over my face without actually registering it. \u201cShe was so sad all the time. I used to go to her house for sleepovers, and her parents would be arguing so badly we\u2019d have to hide under her bed and stuff pillows everywhere to muffle the sound. She called it \u2018building a fort.\u2019 She was always like that, you know, always trying to make the best of things. But when she thought I was asleep, she would cry and cry and cry. She started having nightmares, too. Really bad ones. She\u2019d wake up screaming in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>Juliet\u2019s staring at the door again, smiling a little. I wish I could walk back into her memories and see what she\u2019s seeing, fix whatever is broken there. \u201cShe started to wet her bed again, you know? Because everything was so bad with her mom and dad. She was humiliated, of course. She swore me to secrecy\u2014said she\u2019d never speak to me again if I told anybody. We used to wake up in the morning and some of the pillows in the fort would be damp. I would pretend not to notice. One morning I came into the bathroom to brush my teeth, and she was sitting in the tub, scrubbing a pillow with so much bleach it made my eyes sting. She must have been scrubbing for half an hour. The pillow was all white-splotched and ruined, and her fingers were raw and red. They were burned, almost. But it\u2019s like she couldn\u2019t even see it. She just wanted it to be clean.\u201d</p> <p>I close my eyes, feeling the floor sway underneath me, remembering coming into the bathroom of Rosalita\u2019s and seeing Lindsay on her knees, the chunks of food in the toilet. The mixture of shame and anger and defiance on her face.</p><p>\u201cOne time the fighting got so bad we even ran away from her house. We were only seven or eight, but we walked all the way to my house. It was March and pretty cold. The plan was for Lindsay to move into my room. I wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone, just keep her safe and bring her food. Mostly she wanted gummy bears and Snickers bars. She loved chocolate then, and candy. Anything sweet, really.\u201d</p><p>Without meaning to, I let out a little, strangled sound. I don\u2019t know if I can listen anymore. I have the feeling that this is it: this bathroom, this story. That this is the root and bud of it all, the beginning and the end.</p><p>But Juliet keeps going in that strange, measured tone, as though we have all the time in the world. \u201cOf course it didn\u2019t work. We got upstairs and into the bedroom, but then we started arguing about who should sleep in the little trundle bed and who should get the big one, and my mom heard us. She was horrified that we\u2019d walked all that way. She was screaming and crying that we could have been kidnapped or killed or whatever. I remember being really embarrassed.\u201d Juliet turns her hands upward, stares at her palms. \u201cIt was nothing compared to Lindsay\u2019s freak-out, though, when my mom said she had to go home. I\u2019ve never heard anyone scream that loudly.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s silent for so long I think she\u2019s done. Her words keep buzzing in my head, flitting around and arranging themselves like clues in a crossword puzzle. She was always like that, you know, always trying to make the best of things.... She must have been scrubbing for half an hour.... Her fingers were raw and red. I feel like I\u2019m on the verge of understanding something I\u2019m not sure I want to know. The room feels tiny and stifling. There\u2019s a crushing weight on my chest. I\u2019m tempted to make a run for it, push past her into the party and go get a beer and forget about Juliet, forget about everything. But I\u2019m rooted where I am. I can\u2019t move. I keep seeing the endless darkness of my dream rising in front of me. I can\u2019t go back to it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny when you think about it,\u201d Juliet says. \u201cWe did everything together, Lindsay and me. We even joined Girl Scouts together. It was her idea. I didn\u2019t want to do all that\u2014cookies and campfires and stuff. We went away on a camping trip at the beginning of fifth grade. We slept in the same tent, of course.\u201d</p><p>I watch Juliet\u2019s hands. They\u2019re trembling ever so slightly but so quickly you can barely see it, like the wings of a hummingbird. Out of the corner of her eye Juliet catches me looking, and she brings her hands down to her thighs, gracefully but with finality.</p><p>\u201cYou remember the name they gave me in fifth grade, right? The name Lindsay gave me? Mellow Yellow?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cI used to dream that name, I heard it so often. Sometimes I forgot what my real name was.\u201d</p> <p>She turns to me and her face is radiant, almost glowing, gorgeous. \u201cThe funny thing is, it wasn\u2019t even me. Lindsay was the one who wet her sleeping bag. In the morning the whole tent smelled. But when Ms. Bridges came in and asked what had happened Lindsay just pointed her finger at me and screamed, She did it. I\u2019ll never forget her face when she screamed it\u2014She did it! Terrified. Like I was a wild dog and I was going to bite her.\u201d</p><p>I press back against the door, grateful for something to lean on. It makes perfect sense, of course. It all makes perfect sense now: Lindsay\u2019s anger, the way she always held up her fingers in the shape of a cross to ward Juliet Sykes off. She doesn\u2019t hate her. She\u2019s afraid of her. Juliet Sykes, the keeper of Lindsay\u2019s oldest, maybe her worst, secret.</p><p>And it all seems absurd now, the chance and randomness of it. One person shoots up and the other spirals downward\u2014random and meaningless. As simple as being in the right place, or the wrong place, or however you want to look at it. As simple as getting a craving for Diet Pepsi one day at a pool party, and getting swept away; as simple as not saying no.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d I ask, even though I already know the answer. My voice comes out hoarse from the effort of swallowing back tears.</p><p>Juliet shrugs. \u201cShe was my best friend, you know? She was always so sad back then.\u201d Juliet makes a noise that could be a laugh or a whimper. \u201cBesides,\u201d she says more quietly, \u201cI thought it would pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuliet\u2014\u201d I start to say.</p><p>She shakes her shoulders like she\u2019s brushing off the weight of everything, the conversation, the past. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now,\u201d she says quickly, and just like that she snaps the door open and slips out.</p><p>\u201cJuliet!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a huge clot of people standing by the door, and when I come out I\u2019m pressed backward momentarily as two juniors scuffle for the bathroom, both of them yelling, drunk. \u201cI was here first!\u201d \u201cNo, I was!\u201d \u201cYou just got here!\u201d A few people give me dirty looks, and then Bridget McGuire charges past all of them, face red and blotchy and tear-streaked. When she sees me she sobs out, \u201cYou\u2014\u201d but she doesn\u2019t finish her sentence, just swoops around the juniors and locks herself in the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, not again,\u201d someone yells.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pee my pants,\u201d one of the juniors moans, crossing her legs and hopping up and down.</p><p>Alex Liment is right behind Bridget. He pushes up to the bathroom door and begins rapping on it, calling for her to come out. I still haven\u2019t moved. I\u2019m pressed up against the wall, penned in by people, paralyzed by how wrong everything is. I remember a story I once heard about drowning: that when you fall into cold water it\u2019s not that you drown right away but that the cold disorients you and makes you think that down is up and up is down, so you may be swimming, swimming, swimming for your life in the wrong direction, all the way toward the bottom until you sink. That\u2019s how I feel, as though everything has been turned around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re really unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly aware that Alex is talking to me. His lips are curled back, showing all his teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou know what you are?\u201d He puts one hand on either side of my head so he\u2019s blocking me in. I can see sweat on his forehead and smell weed and beer on his breath. \u201cYou, Samantha Kingston, are a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that jolts me, wakes me up. I have to focus. Juliet is off somewhere in the woods, in the cold. She\u2019s probably making for the road. I can still find her, talk to her, get her to see.</p> <p>I put both hands on Alex\u2019s chest and shove him. He stumbles backward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it before,\u201d I say. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>I force my way through the hallway and am halfway down the stairs when someone calls my name. I stop dead so that the people behind me bump each other like dominoes and start cursing at me.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, what?\u201d I whirl around and see Kent, who leapfrogs over the banister and swings down onto the stairs, nearly taking out Hanna Gordon.</p><p>\u201cYou came.\u201d He lands two stairs above me, a little out of breath. His eyes are bright and happy. His hair is falling over his forehead, picking up light from the Christmas bulbs strung everywhere, bits of it the color of chocolate and some of it caramel. I have an almost uncontrollable urge to reach over and push it back behind his ears.</p> <p>\u201cI said I would, didn\u2019t I?\u201d There\u2019s a dull pain unfurling in my stomach. All I wanted all night\u2014all day\u2014was to be standing this close to him. And now I have no time. \u201cListen, Kent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, I thought you were probably here when I saw Lindsay, et al. You guys usually travel in packs, you know? But then I was looking for you\u2014\u201d He stops himself, blushes. \u201cI mean, not actively looking. Really just kind of perusing the crowd, you know, as I was walking around socializing. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do when you host. Socialize. So I was just keeping an eye out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKent.\u201d My voice comes out sharp, mean, and I close my eyes just for a second, imagining what it felt like to lie with him in total darkness, imagining the touch of his hand on mine. It suddenly occurs to me how impossible all of this is\u2014with me and him. When I open my eyes he\u2019s just standing there, waiting, a little crease in his forehead: so adorable and normal, the kind of guy who deserves the kind of girl who wears cashmere sweaters and is really good at crossword puzzles, or plays the violin, or volunteers at soup kitchens. Someone nice and normal and honest. The pain in my stomach intensifies, as though something\u2019s caught in there, snapping away at my insides. I could never be good enough for him. Even if I lived the same day into infinity, I could never be good enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I force myself to say. \u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t talk to you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d He tucks his hands into the cuffs of his shirt, looking uncertain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d It\u2019s better, I almost say, but I figure there\u2019s no point. I don\u2019t look back, either, even though I can feel him watching me.</p> <p>Outside I pull on my fleece, zipping it all the way up to my chin. The rain drives down my neck and spots my leggings immediately. At least tonight I\u2019m wearing flats. I stick to the driveway. The pavement is icy and I have to reach out and brace myself against the cars as I pass. The cold tears at my lungs, and it\u2019s so strange, but in the middle of all this I have the stupidest, simplest thought\u2014I should really jog more\u2014and as soon as I think it I almost come undone, torn with the dual desire to laugh and to cry. But the thought of Juliet crouching by Route 9, watching the cars whiz past, waiting for Lindsay, keeps me going.</p><p>Eventually the sounds of the party drop away, and then it\u2019s silent except for the driving rain, like thousands of tiny shards of glass falling on the pavement, and my footsteps ringing out. It\u2019s dark, too, and I have to slow down, moving from one car to the next with my hands, the metal so cold under my fingers it feels hot. When I find the Tank, hulking above all the others, I fish through my bag until my fingers close around cold metal and a rhinestone-encrusted key chain that reads BAD GIRL. Lindsay\u2019s car keys. I blow air out of my cheeks. This, at least, is a good thing. There\u2019s no way Lindsay can leave without me. Her car won\u2019t be on the road tonight, no matter how long Juliet waits. Still, I lock and double-lock the doors.</p><p>Then the cars drop away, too, and I shuffle forward at a crawl, mentally cursing myself for not bringing a flashlight, cursing February 12, cursing Juliet Sykes. I see now that the roses were a stupid idea, an insult, even. I think of Juliet and Lindsay all those years ago in a tent, when Lindsay raised a finger and pointed, terrified, humiliated, and it all began. And for years Juliet kept Lindsay\u2019s secret. I thought it would pass.</p><p>At the same time the more I think about it\u2014the rain beating furiously\u2014the angrier I get. This is my life: the whole big, sprawling mess of my life in all its possibilities\u2014first kisses and last kisses and college and apartments and marriage and fights and apologies and happiness\u2014brought to a point, a second, an edge of a second, razored off in that final moment by Juliet\u2019s last act: her revenge against us, against me. The farther I get from the party, the more I think, No. It can\u2019t happen this way. No matter what we did, it can\u2019t happen this way.</p><p>Then the driveway opens up suddenly, and Route 9 is there, shining ahead of me like a river, liquid silver lit up by pools of light. I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019ve been holding my breath until I exhale and I\u2019m gasping, grateful for the light.</p><p>I wipe the rain out of my eyes and turn left, scanning the edge of the woods for Juliet. A little part of me is hoping that talking to me did make her feel better\u2014maybe she went home, after all, maybe it meant something. At the same time, the way that she spoke in that low, flat voice comes back to me, and I know that wherever she was in that bathroom, it wasn\u2019t with me. She was lost somewhere, trapped in a fog, maybe of memories, maybe of all the things that could have happened differently.</p><p>A car roars behind me, making me jump. On the landing I lose my footing and go on hands and knees to the ice as the car speeds by, followed closely by a second car, its engine as loud as thunder. Then honking, waves of sound rolling toward me, getting louder and louder. I look up and see the headlights of a car bearing down on me. I try to move and can\u2019t. I try to scream and can\u2019t. I\u2019m frozen, the headlights growing as big as moons, floating there. At the last second the car swerves a little, passing so close to me I can feel the heat of the engine and smell the exhaust and hear a line of music pumping from the radio. Light it, blaze it, tear it up. Then it\u2019s gone, still honking, passing away into the night as the bass from the speakers grows dimmer and dimmer, a distant pulse.</p><p>My palms are cut up from the pavement, and my heart is pounding so quickly I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s going to leap out of my chest. Slowly, shaking, I stand up. Another car passes on the other side of the road, this one at a crawl, water from its tires pinwheeling in both directions.</p> <p>And then, fifty feet ahead of me, I see a figure in white emerge from the woods, unfolding from a crouch like a long, pale flower. Juliet. I start going toward her, slowly now, trying to avoid the slick patches of dark ice. She stands there, perfectly still, like she doesn\u2019t even feel the rain. At a certain point she even lifts up her arms, parallel to the ground, as though preparing to take a dive off the high board. There\u2019s something beautiful and terrifying about seeing her in that position. It reminds me of when I was little and we would go to church on Christmas and Easter, and I was always afraid to look at the pulpit, where there was a wooden statue of Jesus mounted on the cross.</p><p>\u201cJuliet!\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t respond; I\u2019m not sure if she doesn\u2019t hear or is just ignoring me. I\u2019m fifteen feet away, then ten. There\u2019s a low rumbling behind me. I turn and see a big truck bearing down through the darkness. Again I have a random thought\u2014he should totally have his license suspended, he\u2019s going way too fast\u2014and when I turn around again I see that Juliet is staring up the road, tensed, arms at her thighs, and she reminds me of something, but it takes me a second to realize what it is, just like it takes me a second to realize what\u2019s going on\u2014she looks like a dog about to go after a bird\u2014and then everything clicks together, and as she begins to move, a white blur, I\u2019m moving too, running as fast as I can and closing the distance between us as she\u2019s sprinting out across the nearest lane. The truck blasts its horn, a sound so large it seems to fill the air with vibration, and then I slam into her with all my weight, and we roll, tumbling, backward into the woods. I\u2019m screaming and she\u2019s screaming and pain blooms in my shoulder. I roll over onto my back, the black branches overhead a thick net.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Juliet\u2019s yelling, and when I sit up her face has finally lost its composure and is twisted with anger. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d My anger flares up too. \u201cWhat are you doing? Jumping in front of random trucks\u2014I thought the whole point was to wait for Lindsay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsay? Lindsay Edgecombe?\u201d Juliet\u2019s anger drops away and she looks completely confused. She brings her hands up to her head, squeezing. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly uncertain. \u201cI\u2014I thought. You know, like this was your big revenge\u2014\u201d</p><p>Juliet laughs, but there\u2019s no humor in it. \u201cRevenge?\u201d She shakes her head, and again that veil seems to drop over her face. \u201cSorry, Sam. For once this isn\u2019t about you.\u201d She stands up, not bothering to wipe off the thick tracks of mud and leaves that are clinging to her. \u201cNow please leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>My head is spinning and I\u2019m having trouble focusing on her, like we\u2019re separated by miles instead of a few feet. The rain is coming down harder now, jagged pellets of it. Little snatches of things are whirling around in my head: Lindsay patting the hood of the Tank proudly, saying, \u201cI could go head-to-head with an eighteen-wheeler and never feel it\u201d the owner of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts calling out, \u201cThat\u2019s not a car, it\u2019s a truck\u201d the randomness of things, the way everything can change in a second; the right place at the right time, or at the wrong time; time; that enormous truck coming at us, its big metal grill shining like teeth, the impression of lights and hugeness. The only thing you can see: headlights, size, a sense of power. Not revenge. Chance. Stupid, dumb, blind chance. Just a part of the strange mechanism of the world, with its fits and coughs and starts and random collisions.</p><p>\u201cBut why...?\u201d I struggle to my feet. \u201cWhy did you come here? What was the point?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look at me, but she shrugs slightly. \u201cThere was no point, really. I just wanted to say it. I was always afraid to say it before\u2014what I really thought of you. I\u2019m not afraid anymore. Of you, of anybody, of anything. I\u2019m not even afraid of\u2014\u201d She breaks off, but I know what she was going to say. Not even afraid of dying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I know what she\u2019s saying isn\u2019t totally true. Her decision to come to the party was more than that. Things are clicking into place, making a horrible kind of sense: she needed us here, needed that final push. I close my eyes against the memory of a wet and stumbling Juliet being shoved from person to person like a pinball. And tonight, I guess, she just needed to tell her story\u2014needed to remember how bad things have been. I wonder if the day when we all slept over at Lindsay\u2019s\u2014the day that things ended differently for her, the day that they ended alone, with a gun\u2014it took her longer to work up the courage. If she came to the party, unnoticed, ignored, and found she didn\u2019t have the strength to go through with it. If later that night she sat and stared at the gun in her lap, and conjured up the faces of all the people who\u2019d tormented her over the years.</p><p>Vicky Hallinan\u2019s face hovers in the darkness suddenly, twisted into a grimace, and I snap my eyes open. Maybe before you die it\u2019s your ghosts that you see.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the way,\u201d I say weakly, feeling like the rain has seeped into my brain and made it soggy and useless. I can\u2019t remember anything I was planning to say to her. I repeat it a little louder. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Juliet says quietly. \u201cI just want to be alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your family?\u201d I say, my voice rising hysterically as I realize I\u2019m losing her again, losing my chance. \u201cWhat about your sister?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer me. She\u2019s staring at the road, still. The rain has soaked her shirt so I can see her shoulder blades jutting out of her back like the wings of a baby bird, and I think of the moment when Ally\u2019s mom came into the den and told us, \u201cJuliet Sykes shot herself,\u201d and I thought it was so wrong\u2014that she, of all people, should have jumped or leaped or fallen through the sky. I again have the fantasy I did then, that she\u2019ll suddenly sprout wings and go soaring up into the air, out of harm\u2019s way.</p><p>The road has been unusually clear of traffic, but now from both directions I make out the growl of engines. Loud ones. Big ones.</p><p>\u201cJuliet.\u201d I take a step forward and grab her arm tightly. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do this.\u201d</p><p>She turns to me, staring at me with eyes so empty it takes my breath away. They\u2019re pools, liquid, nothing. Looking at her reminds me of that stitched-together mask with the holes cut away for eyes: monstrous, deformed, patched together, with eyes that look into and look out at nothing. I\u2019m so startled I loosen my grip. There\u2019s a roaring in my ears, and I dimly have a sense of cars, but I\u2019m transfixed. I can\u2019t stop staring at her.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she says, and in that second when I\u2019m not holding on tightly enough she wrenches away from me and hurtles onto the road just as two vans converge, about to pass each other, and all I see is the shine of metal and something white suddenly launched into the air, and for a second I feel an overwhelming sense of joy, and I think she\u2019s done it, she\u2019s flying, and time seems to stop with her glittering in the air like a beautiful bird. But then time resumes, and the air doesn\u2019t hold her, and as she drops there\u2019s a piercing sound splitting the darkness and again it takes me a long time to realize it\u2019s me, screaming.</p><p>GHOSTS AND HEAVEN</p><p>An hour and a half later I\u2019m parked in Lindsay\u2019s driveway, and the two of us are watching the rain turn to snow, watching the world go quiet as, in a moment, thousands of raindrops seem to freeze in the air and come drifting silently to earth. I\u2019ve already dropped off Elody and Ally. On the way home from the party nobody spoke. Elody leaned back against the seat, pretending to sleep, but at one point I glanced in the rearview mirror and saw the glitter of her eyes, watching me.</p><p>\u201cJesus. What a night.\u201d Lindsay leans her forehead on the window. \u201cSo crazy, you know? I never would have thought...I mean, she was obviously screwed up, but I didn\u2019t ever think she would...\u201d She shivers, shoots a look at me. \u201cAnd you were there.\u201d</p><p>When the police came, and the ambulances\u2014followed by all the people at Kent\u2019s party, drifting through the woods, quiet, suddenly sober, attracted by the sound of the sirens like moths to a flame\u2014they found me standing by the side of the road, still staring. I\u2019d even been interviewed by a female police officer with a big mole exactly at the point of her chin, which I had focused on like a single star in a dark sky, something to orient me.</p><p>Was she drunk?</p> <p>No.</p><p>Was she on anything else? Don\u2019t be afraid to tell me.</p><p>No. At least\u2014I don\u2019t think so.</p><p>Lindsay licks her lips, fidgets her hands in her lap. \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t...she didn\u2019t, like, say anything? She didn\u2019t explain?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the same thing the police officer asked me earlier: the final question, maybe the only one that matters. Did she say anything to you? Anything at all to give you a sense of how she was feeling, what she was thinking?</p><p>I don\u2019t think she was feeling much of anything.</p><p>To Lindsay I say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s the kind of thing you can explain.\u201d</p><p>She keeps pressing it. \u201cBut I mean, she must have had problems, right? Stuff at home, right? People don\u2019t just do that.\u201d</p> <p>I think of Juliet\u2019s cold, dark house, the TV shadows climbing the walls, the unknown couple in the hard silver frame.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. I look at Lindsay, but she keeps her eyes averted. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll never know now.\u201d</p><p>I feel a sense of emptiness so deep it stops feeling like emptiness and starts feeling like relief. I imagine this is what it would be like to get carried off on a wave. This is what it would feel like in the moment that the thin, dark edge of shore ducks its head beyond the horizon, when you roll over and see only stars and sky and water, folding in on you like an embrace. When you spread your arms and think, Okay.</p><p>\u201cThanks for dropping me off.\u201d Lindsay puts her hand on the door handle, but makes no further motion to get out. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>I watch patterns of snow coming down at an angle as though flowing, cresting, breaking on a massive current, a tide that leaves the world glittering. It\u2019s beautiful. All I can think is that it\u2019s the first of many things Juliet won\u2019t see.</p><p>Lindsay is chewing on a nail, a habit she\u2019s always claiming to have kicked in third grade. The automatic garage light has clicked on and her features are all dark.</p><p>\u201cLindsay?\u201d</p><p>She jumps like we\u2019ve been silent for hours and she\u2019s shocked to see me still in the car. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember that time in Rosalita\u2019s? After you came back from New York? When I walked in on you in the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>She turns to stare at me, not saying anything. Her eyes are a deeper dark than the rest of her face, two spots of total blackness.</p><p>\u201cWas that really the only time?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She hesitates for just a second. \u201cOf course it was,\u201d she says, but her voice is a whisper and I know she\u2019s lying.</p><p>And now I realize Lindsay\u2019s not fearless. She\u2019s terrified. She\u2019s terrified that people will find out she\u2019s faking, bullshitting her way through life, pretending to have everything together when really she\u2019s just floundering like the rest of us. Lindsay, who will bite at you if you even look in her direction the wrong way, like one of those tiny attack dogs that are always barking and snapping in the air before they\u2019re jerked backward on the chains that keep them in one place.</p><p>Millions of individual snowflakes, spinning and twirling and looking, all together, like rolling waves of white. I wonder if it\u2019s true that they\u2019re all different. \u201cJuliet told me.\u201d I lean back against the headrest and squint so that everything disappears but the whiteness. \u201cAbout the Girl Scout trip. When you were in fifth grade\u2014when you were still friends.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s still not saying anything, but I can feel her trembling a little next to me.</p><p>\u201cShe told me it was really you who\u2014you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believed her?\u201d Lindsay says quickly, but she does it automatically, dully, as though she doesn\u2019t expect it to do any good.</p><p>I ignore her. \u201cRemember how everybody used to call her Mellow Yellow after that?\u201d I open my eyes and look at her. \u201cWhy did you tell everyone it was her? I mean, in the moment, okay, I get it, you were scared, you were embarrassed, but afterward...? Why did you tell everyone? Why did you spread it?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s shaking is getting worse now, and for a second I think she won\u2019t answer, or she\u2019ll lie. But her voice is steady when she speaks, steady and filled with something I don\u2019t recognize. Regret, maybe.</p><p>\u201cI always thought it wouldn\u2019t last.\u201d She sounds as if it still amazes her after all these years. \u201cI thought eventually she\u2019d tell everybody what really happened. That she would stick up for herself, you know?\u201d Her voice breaks a little, a note of hysteria creeping in. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she ever stick up for herself? Not once. She just\u2014she just took it. Why?\u201d</p><p>I think of all the years that Lindsay\u2019s been holding on to this secret knowledge, this secret self who cried every night and scrubbed pillows clean of pee\u2014the scariest secret of all, the past we\u2019re trying to forget.</p><p>And I think of all the times I sat in squirming silence, terrified I would say or do the wrong thing, terrified the dorky, lanky, horseback-riding loser inside me would rise up and swallow the new me, like a snake feasting on something. How I cleared the shelves of my trophies and dumped my beanbag chair and learned how to dress and never ate the hot lunch, and, above all, learned to stay away from the people who would drag me down, and carry me back to that place. People like Juliet Sykes. People like Kent.</p><p>Lindsay rouses herself and pops the door open. I cut the engine and get out of the car with her, throwing the keys over the roof. She catches them in one hand. Headlights flare to life, and I turn, squinting, holding up a hand in the general direction of the car idling behind me. I mouth, \u201cTwo minutes.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay nods toward Kent, who is parked behind us, waiting to drive me home. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re all good? To get home and everything, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I say. Despite everything that has happened tonight, the thought of sitting next to Kent for a whole twelve minutes on the way to my house fills me with warmth. Even though I know it\u2019s not right\u2014even if I know, somewhere deep inside me, that it won\u2019t work out, that it can\u2019t work out for me with anyone anymore.</p><p>Lindsay opens her mouth and closes it. I can tell she wants to ask about Kent but thinks better of it. She starts to walk up toward the house, hesitates, and turns.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m really sorry about...everything.\u201d</p><p>She wants me to tell her it\u2019s okay. She needs me to tell her that. I can\u2019t, though. Instead I say, quietly, \u201cPeople would like you anyway, Lindz.\u201d I don\u2019t say, if you stopped pretending so much, but I know she understands. \u201cWe\u2019d still love you no matter what.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She balls up her fists and squeezes out, \u201cThanks.\u201d Then she turns and heads up to the house. For a second the light falling on her face makes her skin look wet, but I\u2019m not sure whether she\u2019s crying or whether it\u2019s the snow.</p><p>Kent leans over and opens the door for me and I slide in. We back away from Lindsay\u2019s house and turn onto the main road in silence. He drives slowly, carefully, twin funnels of snow lit up by the headlights, both hands resting lightly on the steering wheel. There\u2019s so much I want to say to him, but I can\u2019t bring myself to speak. I\u2019m tired and my head hurts, and I just want to enjoy the fact that there\u2019s only a few inches separating our arms, the fact that his car smells like cinnamon, the fact that he has the heat on high for me. It makes me feel drowsy and heavy in my limbs, even as my insides are alive and fluttering and 100 percent aware of him, so close.</p><p>As we get near my house he slows down so we\u2019re barely crawling, and I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want the drive to end either. This is the moment for time to stop, right here\u2014for space to yawn open and fall away like it does at the lip of a black hole, so that time can do its endless loops and keep us forever going forward into the snow. But no matter how slowly Kent goes, the car moves forward.</p><p>Soon my street sign appears crookedly on the left, and then we\u2019re passing the darkened houses of my neighbors, and then we\u2019re at my house.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for driving me home,\u201d I say, turning to him as he turns to me and says, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be okay?\u201d</p><p>We both laugh nervously. Kent pushes his bangs away from his eyes, and they immediately flop back into place, making my stomach dip.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>It was my pleasure. Only Kent could say it and make it not sound like something cheesy from an old movie, and my heart aches frantically for a second as I think of all the time I wasted, seconds and hours spun out of my fingertips forever like snow into the dark.</p><p>We sit for a minute. I\u2019m desperate to say something, anything, so I don\u2019t have to get out of the car, but the words don\u2019t come and the seconds run by.</p> <p>Finally I blurt out, \u201cEverything tonight was awful except for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for what?\u201d</p><p>I tick my index finger once between us. You and me. Everything was awful except for this.</p><p>A light comes on in his eyes. \u201cSam.\u201d He says my name once, just breathes it, and I never knew that a single syllable could transform my whole body into a dancing, glowing thing. He reaches out suddenly and puts a warm hand on either side of my face, tracing my eyebrows, his thumb resting lightly for one single miraculous second on my bottom lip\u2014I\u2019m tasting cinnamon on his skin\u2014and then he drops his hand and pulls away, looking embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>\u201cNo...it\u2019s okay.\u201d My body is humming. He must be able to hear it. At the same time it feels like my head is going to lift off from my shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just...God, it\u2019s so awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so awful?\u201d My body abruptly stops humming and my stomach goes leaden. He\u2019s going to tell me he doesn\u2019t like me. He\u2019s going to tell me he sees through me again.</p><p>\u201cI mean, with everything that happened tonight...it\u2019s not the right time...and you\u2019re with Rob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not with Rob,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d He\u2019s staring at me so intensely I can see the stripes of gold alternating with the green in his eyes like spokes of a wheel.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d He\u2019s still staring at me like that, like he\u2019s the first and last person who will ever stare at me. \u201cBecause...\u201d His voice trails off, and his eyes travel slowly down to my lips, and there\u2019s so much heat roaring through my body I swear I\u2019m going to pass out.</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d I prompt him, surprised I can still speak.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t help it, and I really need to kiss you right now.\u201d</p><p>He puts one hand behind my neck and pulls me toward him. And then we\u2019re kissing. His lips are soft and leave mine tingling. I close my eyes, and in the darkness behind them I see beautiful blooming things, flowers spinning like snowflakes, and hummingbirds beating the same rhythm as my heart. I\u2019m gone, lost, floating away into nothingness like I am in my dream, but this time it\u2019s a good feeling\u2014like soaring, like being totally free. His other hand pushes my hair from my face, and I can feel the impression of his fingers everywhere that they touch, and I think of stars streaking through the sky and leaving burning trails behind them, and in that moment\u2014however long it lasts, seconds, minutes, days\u2014while he\u2019s saying my name into my mouth and I\u2019m breathing into him, I realize this, right here, is the first and only time I\u2019ve ever been kissed in my life.</p><p>He pulls away too soon, still cupping my face. \u201cWow,\u201d he says, out of breath. \u201cSorry. But wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d The word catches in my throat.</p><p>We stay there like that, staring at each other, and for once I\u2019m not feeling anxious or worried about what he\u2019s thinking. I\u2019m just happy, held in his eyes, buoyed up in a warm, bright place.</p><p>\u201cI really like you, Sam,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you too.\u201d Don\u2019t worry about tomorrow. Don\u2019t even think about it. I shut my eyes briefly, pushing away everything but this moment, his warm hands, those delicious green eyes, the lips.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He leans forward and kisses my forehead once, gently. \u201cYou\u2019re tired. You need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He gets out of the car and scoots around to the passenger side to open the door for me. The snow has begun to stick, a blanket over everything, blurring the edges of the world. Our footsteps are muffled as we make our way up the front path and onto the porch. My parents have left the porch light on, the only light in a dark house on a dark street\u2014maybe the only light in the world. In its glow the snow looks like falling stars.</p><p>\u201cYou have snow in your eyelashes.\u201d Kent traces a finger over my eyelids and over the bridge of my nose, making me shiver. \u201cAnd in your hair.\u201d A hand fluttering, the feel of fingertips, a cupped palm on my neck. Heaven.</p><p>\u201cKent.\u201d I wrap my fingers around the collar of his shirt. No matter how close he\u2019s standing, it isn\u2019t close enough. \u201cAre you ever afraid to go to sleep? Afraid of what comes next?\u201d</p><p>He smiles a sad little smile and I swear it\u2019s like he knows. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m afraid of what I\u2019m leaving behind,\u201d he says.</p><p>Then we\u2019re kissing again, our bodies and mouths moving together so seamlessly it\u2019s like we\u2019re not even kissing, just thinking about kissing, thinking about breathing, everything right and natural and unconscious and relaxed, a feeling not of trying but of complete abandonment, letting go, and right then and there the unthinkable and impossible happens: time does stand still after all. Time and space recede and blast away like a universe expanding forever outward, leaving only darkness and the two of us on its periphery, darkness and breathing and touch.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>The last time I have the dream it goes like this: I am falling, tumbling through the air, but this time the darkness is alive around me, full of beating things, and I realize that I\u2019m not surrounded by dark but have only had my eyes closed all this time. I open them, feeling silly, and at the same time a hundred thousand butterflies take off around me, so many of them in so many brilliant colors they are like a solid rainbow, temporarily obscuring the sun. But as they wing higher and higher they reveal a landscape below us, all green and gold and sun-drenched fields and pink-tinged clouds drifting underneath me, and the air around me is clear and blue and sweet smelling, and I\u2019m laughing, laughing, laughing as I spin through the air because, of course, I haven\u2019t been falling all this time.</p><p>I\u2019ve been flying.</p><p>And when I wake up it\u2019s wonderful, like I\u2019ve been carried quietly onto a calm, peaceful shore, and the dream, and its meaning, has broken over me like a wave and is ebbing away now, leaving me with a single, solid certainty. I know now.</p><p>It was never about saving my life.</p><p>Not, at least, in the way that I thought.</p><p>AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY</p><p>I remember I once saw this old movie with Lindsay; in it the main character was talking about how sad it is that the last time you have sex you don\u2019t know it\u2019s the last time. Since I\u2019ve never even had a first time, I\u2019m not exactly an expert, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s like that for most things in life\u2014the last kiss, the last laugh, the last cup of coffee, the last sunset, the last time you jump through a sprinkler or eat an ice-cream cone, or stick your tongue out to catch a snowflake. You just don\u2019t know.</p><p>But I think that\u2019s a good thing, really, because if you did know it would be almost impossible to let go. When you do know, it\u2019s like being asked to step off the edge of a cliff: all you want to do is get down on your hands and knees and kiss the solid ground, smell it, hold on to it.</p><p>I guess that\u2019s what saying good-bye is always like\u2014like jumping off an edge. The worst part is making the choice to do it. Once you\u2019re in the air, there\u2019s nothing you can do but let go.</p><p>Here is the last thing I ever say to my parents: See you later. I say, I love you, too, but that\u2019s earlier. The last thing I say is, See you later.</p><p>Or actually, to be completely accurate, the last thing I say to my father is, See you later. To my mother I say, Positive, because she\u2019s standing in the kitchen doorway holding the newspaper, her hair messy, her bathrobe hanging wrong, and she says, Are you sure you don\u2019t want breakfast? Like she always does.</p><p>I look back when I\u2019m at the front door. Behind her my father is at the stove, humming to himself and burning eggs for my mother\u2019s breakfast. He\u2019s wearing the striped pajama pants Izzy and I got him for his last birthday, and his hair is sticking out at crazy angles like he\u2019s just put a finger in an electrical socket. My mom puts a hand on his back while she squeezes past him, then settles at the kitchen table, shaking out the newspaper. He scoops the eggs onto a plate and sets it in front of her, saying, \u201cVoil\u00e0, madame. Extra crispy,\u201d and she shakes her head and says something I can\u2019t hear, but she\u2019s smiling, and he leans down and kisses her once on the forehead.</p><p>It\u2019s a nice thing to see. I\u2019m glad I was looking.</p><p>Izzy follows me to the door with my gloves, grinning at me and showing off the gap between her two front teeth. A feeling of vertigo overwhelms me when I look at her, a nauseous feeling lashing in my stomach, but I take a deep breath and think of counting steps, think of running leaps, and my dream of flying.</p><p>One, two, three, jump.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot your gloves.\u201d Lisping, smiling, wisps of golden hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat would I do without you?\u201d I crouch down and squeeze her in a hug, as I do seeing our whole life together: her tiny infant toes and scalp that smelled like baby powder; the first time she tottered over to me; the first time she rode a bike and fell and scraped her knee, and when I saw all that blood on her, I almost died from fright, and I carried her all the way home. And I see beyond it, strangely, glimpses of her in the other direction: Izzy grown tall and gorgeous with one hand resting on a steering wheel, laughing; Izzy wearing a long green dress and picking her way in heels toward a waiting limousine on her way to prom; Izzy loaded down with books as the snow swirls around her, ducking into a dorm, her hair a golden flame against the white. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She squeals and squirms away. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe! You\u2019re crushing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Fizzer.\u201d I reach back and unhook my grandma\u2019s bird necklace. Izzy\u2019s eyes go huge and round.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d I say, and for once she\u2019s totally quiet and does what I say with no complaints, standing perfectly still while I lift her hair and fix the charm around her neck. She turns back to me, her face very serious, waiting for my opinion.</p><p>I give the necklace a tug. It falls halfway down her chest, sitting just to the right of her heart. \u201cIt looks good on you, Fizz.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you giving it to me\u2014for real real? Or just for today?\u201d Her voice is a hush, like we\u2019re discussing state secrets.</p><p>\u201cIt looks better on you, anyway.\u201d I put a finger on her nose, and she twirls away with her hands in the air like a ballerina.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sammy!\u201d Except, of course, it comes out Thammy.</p><p>\u201cBe good, Izzy.\u201d I stand up, throat tight, an aching in my whole body. I have to fight the urge to get down on my knees and squeeze her again.</p><p>She puts her hands on her hips like our mom does, mock-offended, sticking her nose in the air. \u201cI\u2019m always good. I\u2019m the best.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe best of the best.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s already turned around, running and sliding in her slippered feet back toward the kitchen, yelling, \u201cLook what Sammy gave me!\u201d with one hand cupped around the charm. Tears are blurring my vision so I can\u2019t see her clearly, just the pink of her pajamas and the golden ring of her hair.</p><p>Outside the cold burns my lungs and makes the pain in my throat worse. I take a deep breath, sucking in the smells of wood fires and gasoline. The sun is beautiful, long and low on the horizon like it\u2019s stretching itself, like it\u2019s shaking off a nap, and I know underneath this weak winter light is the promise of days that last until eight P.M. and pool parties and the smell of chlorine and burgers on the grill; and underneath that is the promise of trees lit up in red and orange like flames and spiced cider, and frost that melts away by noon\u2014layers upon layers of life, always something more, new, deeper. It makes me feel like crying, but Lindsay\u2019s already parked in front of the house, waving her arms and yelling, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d so instead I just keep walking, one foot in front of the other, one, two, three, and I think about letting go\u2014of the trees and the grass and sky and the red-streaked clouds on the horizon\u2014letting it all drop away from me like a veil. Maybe there will be something spectacular underneath.</p><p>A MIRACLE OF CHANCE AND COINCIDENCE, PART I</p><p>\u201cAnd so, I was like, listen, I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s stupid, I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s, like, a holiday invented by Hallmark or whatever....\u201d Lindsay\u2019s rattling on about Patrick, punctuating her story by tapping the steering wheel with the heel of her hand. She\u2019s perfectly in control again, hair swept back in a ponytail just messy enough, lip gloss slicked on, a mist of Burberry Brit Gold clinging to the puffy jacket she\u2019s wearing. It\u2019s strange to see her this way after last night, but at the same time I\u2019m glad. She\u2019s cruel and frightened and proud and insecure, but she\u2019s still Lindsay Edgecombe\u2014the girl who freshman year took a key to Mari Tinsley\u2019s brand-new BMW after Mari called her a froshy prostitute, even though Mari had just been voted prom queen, and nobody, not even people in her own grade, would stand up to her\u2014and she\u2019s still my best friend, and despite everything I still respect her. And I know that however wrong she\u2019s been\u2014about a million things, about other people, about herself\u2014she\u2019ll figure it out. I know from the way she looked last night, with the shadows making a hollow of her face.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s just wishful thinking, but I like to believe, on some level, or in some world, what happened last night matters, that it didn\u2019t totally vanish. Sometimes I\u2019m afraid to go to sleep because of what I\u2019m leaving behind. Thinking about Kent\u2019s words makes shivers dance up and down my spine. This is the first time in my life I\u2019ve ever missed kissing someone; the first time I\u2019ve ever woken up feeling like I\u2019ve lost something important.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s freaking out because he\u2019s too into you,\u201d Elody pipes up from the backseat. \u201cDon\u2019t you think, Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I\u2019m savoring my coffee, drinking it slowly. A perfect morning, exactly how I would have chosen it: perfect coffee, perfect bagel, riding around in the car with two of my best friends, not really talking about anything, not really trying to talk about anything, just babbling on about the same stuff we always do, enjoying one another\u2019s voices. The only thing that\u2019s missing is Ally.</p><p>I suddenly get the urge to drive around Ridgeview for a little bit longer. Partly I don\u2019t want the ride to end. Partly I just want to look at everything one last time.</p><p>\u201cLindz? Can we stop at Starbucks? I, um, kind of want a latte.\u201d I take a few gulps of my coffee, trying to drain it, to make this more believable.</p><p>She raises her eyebrows. \u201cYou hate Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I got a sudden craving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it tastes like dog pee strained through a trash bag.\u201d</p><p>Elody gulps her coffee. \u201cEw\u2014hello? Drinking. Eating.\u201d She waves her bagel dramatically.</p> <p>Lindsay raises both hands. \u201cThat\u2019s a direct quote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m late to poly sci one more time I swear I\u2019ll get detention for life,\u201d Elody says.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll miss the chance to suck face with Muffin before first,\u201d Lindsay says, snickering.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Elody pegs her with a piece of bagel, and Lindsay squeals. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle you and Patrick haven\u2019t fused faces yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lindsay. Please?\u201d I bat my eyelashes at her, then twist around to Elody. \u201cPretty please?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay sighs heavily, locking eyes with Elody in the rearview mirror. She flicks on her turn indicator. I clap my hands and Elody groans.</p><p>\u201cSam gets to do what she wants today,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s her big day.\u201d She emphasizes the word big, then starts cracking up.</p><p>Elody picks up on it right away. \u201cI would say it was Rob\u2019s big day, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can only hope.\u201d Lindsay leans over and elbows me.</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d I say. \u201cPerverts.\u201d</p><p>Linday\u2019s on a roll now. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be loooong day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hard one,\u201d Elody adds.</p><p>Lindsay sprays some coffee out of her mouth and Elody shrieks. They\u2019re both snorting and laughing like maniacs.</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d I say, looking out the window, watching the houses begin to stream together as we come into town. \u201cVery mature.\u201d But I\u2019m smiling, feeling happy and calm, thinking, You have no idea.</p><p>There\u2019s a small parking lot behind the Starbucks in town, and we get the last spot, Lindsay slamming into it and nearly taking out the side mirrors of the two cars on either side of us, but still yelling, \u201cGucci, baby, gucci,\u201d which she claims is Italian for \u201cperfect.\u201d</p><p>In my head I\u2019ve been saying good-bye to everything, all these places I\u2019ve seen so often I start to ignore them: the deli on the hill with perfect chicken cutlets and the trinket store where I used to buy thread to make friendship bracelets and the Realtor\u2019s and the dentist\u2019s and the little garden where Steve King put his tongue in my mouth in seventh grade, and I was so surprised I bit down. I can\u2019t stop thinking about how strange life is, about Kent and Juliet and even Alex and Anna and Bridget and Mr. Otto and Ms. Winters\u2014about how complex and connected everything is, all threaded together like some vast, invisible netting\u2014and how sometimes you can think you\u2019re doing the right thing, but it\u2019s actually terrible and vice versa.</p><p>We head into Starbucks and I get a latte. Elody gets a brownie, even though she\u2019s just eaten, and Lindsay puts a stuffed bear on her head and then orders a water without blinking while the barista stares at her like she\u2019s crazy, and I can\u2019t help but throw my arms around her, and she says, \u201cSave it for the bedroom, babe,\u201d making the old woman behind us inch away. We come out laughing and I almost drop my coffee\u2014Sarah Grundel\u2019s brown Chevrolet is idling in the parking lot. She\u2019s drumming her hands on the wheel, checking her watch, waiting for a spot to open up. The last spot\u2014the spot we took.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be freaking kidding me,\u201d I say out loud. She\u2019ll definitely be late now.</p><p>Lindsay catches me staring and misunderstands me. \u201cI know. If I had that car I totally wouldn\u2019t rock it past the driveway. I think I\u2019d rather walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d I shake my head, realizing I can\u2019t explain. As we pass, Sarah rolls her eyes and sighs, like, Finally. The humor of the situation hits me and I start to laugh.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the latte?\u201d Lindsay asks as we climb back in the car.</p><p>\u201cLike dog pee strained through a trash bag,\u201d I say. We roll out of the spot, giving Sarah a little beep, and she huffs and zooms in as soon as we\u2019re out of the way.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her drama?\u201d Elody asks.</p><p>\u201cPNS,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cParking Need Syndrome.\u201d</p><p>As we pull out of the parking lot, it occurs to me that maybe it\u2019s not so complicated at all. Most of the time\u201499 percent of the time\u2014you just don\u2019t know how and why the threads are looped together, and that\u2019s okay. Do a good thing and something bad happens. Do a bad thing and something good happens. Do nothing and everything explodes.</p><p>And very, very rarely\u2014by some miracle of chance and coincidence, butterflies beating their wings just so and all the threads hanging together for a minute\u2014you get the chance to do the right thing.</p><p>Here\u2019s the last thing that occurs to me as Sarah recedes in the rearview mirror, slamming out of the car, jogging across the parking lot: if you\u2019re one tardy away from missing out on a big competition, you should probably make your coffee at home.</p><p>When we get to school I have a few things to take care of in the Rose Room, so I split up with Elody and Lindsay. Then, because I\u2019m already late, I decide to skip the rest of first period. I wander through the halls and the campus, thinking how strange it is that you can live your whole life in one place and never really look at it. Even the yellow walls\u2014what we used to call the vomit hallways\u2014strike me as pretty now, the slender bare trees in the middle of the quad elegant and sparse, just waiting for snow.</p><p>For most of my life it\u2019s always seemed like the school day dragged on forever\u2014except during quizzes and tests, when the seconds seemed to trip over themselves trying to run away quickly. Today it\u2019s like that. No matter how badly I want for everything to go slowly, time is pouring away, hemorrhaging. I\u2019ve barely made it into the second question of Mr. Tierney\u2019s quiz before he\u2019s yelling, \u201cTime!\u201d and giving all of us his fiercest scowl, and I have to turn in my quiz only partially completed. I know it doesn\u2019t matter, but I\u2019ve given it my best shot anyway. I want to have one last day when everything is normal. A day like a million other days I\u2019ve had. A day when I turn in my chem quiz and worry about whether Mr. Tierney will ever make good on his threat to call BU. But I don\u2019t regret the quiz for long. I\u2019m past regretting things now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When it\u2019s time for math I head down early, feeling calm. I slide into my seat a few minutes before the bell and take out my math textbook, centering it perfectly on my desk. I\u2019m the first student to arrive.</p><p>Mr. Daimler comes over and leans against my desk, smiling at me. I notice for the first time that one of his incisors is extra pointy, like a vampire\u2019s. \u201cWhat\u2019s this, Sam?\u201d He gestures at my desk. \u201cThree minutes early and actually prepared for class? Are you turning over a new leaf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d I say evenly, folding my hands on top of my textbook.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s Cupid Day treating you?\u201d He pops a mint in his mouth and leans closer. It grosses me out, like he thinks he can seduce me with fresh breath. \u201cAny big romantic plans tonight? Got someone special to cozy up next to?\u201d He raises his eyebrows at me.</p> <p>A week ago this would have made me swoon. Now I feel totally cold. I think about how rough his face was on mine, how heavy he felt, but it doesn\u2019t make me angry or afraid. I fixate on his hemp necklace, which is, as always, peeking out from under his shirt collar. For the first time he strikes me as kind of pathetic. Who wears the same thing for eight straight years? That would be like if I insisted on wearing the candy necklaces I loved when I was in fifth grade.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I say, smiling. \u201cWhat about you? Are you going to be all by your lonesome? Table for one?\u201d</p><p>He leans forward even more, and I stay perfectly still, willing myself not to pull away.</p><p>\u201cNow why would you assume that?\u201d He winks at me, obviously thinking that this is my version of flirting\u2014like I\u2019m going to offer to keep him company or something.</p><p>I smile even wider. \u201cBecause if you had a real girlfriend,\u201d I say, quietly but clearly, so he can hear every word perfectly, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t be hitting on high school girls.\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Daimler sucks in a breath and jerks backward so quickly he almost falls off the desk. People are coming into class, now, chattering and comparing roses, ignoring us. We could be talking about a homework assignment, or a quiz grade. He stares at me, his mouth opening and shutting. No words come out.</p><p>The bell rings. Mr. Daimler shakes his shoulders and stumbles away from the desk, still staring at me. Then he turns a complete circle as if he\u2019s lost. Finally he clears his throat.</p><p>\u201cOkay, everyone.\u201d His voice breaks and he coughs. When he speaks again it\u2019s a bark. \u201cEveryone. Seats. Now.\u201d</p><p>I have to bite the edge of my hand to keep from cracking up. Mr. Daimler shoots me a look of total disgust, which makes the urge to laugh even harder to resist. I look away, turning toward the door.</p><p>Right at the moment that Kent McFuller walks through it.</p><p>We lock eyes, and in that second it\u2019s like the classroom folds in two and all of the distance disappears between us. A zooming, rushing feeling comes over me, like I\u2019m being beamed up into his bright-green eyes. Time collapses, too, and we\u2019re back on my porch in the snow, his warm fingers brushing my neck, the soft pressure of his lips, the whisper of his voice in my ear. Nothing exists but him.</p> <p>\u201cMr. McFuller. Care to take a seat?\u201d Mr. Daimler\u2019s voice is cold.</p><p>Kent turns away from me and the moment is lost. He mumbles a quick sorry to Mr. Daimler and then heads for his seat. I turn around, following him with my eyes. I love the way he slides into his seat without touching his desk. I love the way, when he pulls out his math textbook, a bunch of crumpled sketches come with it. I love the way he keeps nervously fiddling with his hair, running his hands through it even though it swings back into his eyes immediately.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kingston. If I could trouble you for just a second of your precious time and attention.\u201d</p><p>When I turn back to the front of the room, Mr. Daimler is glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cI guess for a second,\u201d I say loudly, and everybody laughs. Mr. Daimler folds his mouth into a thin white line but doesn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>I flip open my math textbook, but I can\u2019t focus. I drum my fingers on the underside of the desk, feeling antsy and exhilarated now that I\u2019ve seen Kent. I wish I could tell him exactly how I feel. I wish I could explain it somehow, that he could know. I watch the clock anxiously. I can\u2019t wait for the Cupids to come.</p><p>Kent McFuller is getting an extra rose today.</p><p>After class I wait for Kent in the hall, butterflies making a mess of my stomach. When he comes out he\u2019s carefully holding the rose I\u2019ve sent him, like he\u2019s afraid it will break. He glances up, serious and thoughtful, his eyes searching my face.</p> <p>\u201cYou going to tell me what this is about?\u201d He doesn\u2019t smile, but there\u2019s a teasing lilt to his voice and his eyes are bright.</p><p>I decide to tease him right back, even though being so close to him is making it hard to think. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>He holds the rose out and flips the note open so I can read it, though, of course, I know what it says.</p><p>Tonight. Leave your phone on and your car out, and be my hero.</p><p>\u201cMysterious,\u201d I say, holding back a smile. He looks ten times more adorable when he\u2019s worried. \u201cSecret admirer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so secret.\u201d His eyes are still roving over my face like there\u2019s the answer to a puzzle written there, and I have to look away to keep from grabbing him and pulling him toward me. He pauses. \u201cI\u2019m having a party tonight, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I rush on. \u201cI mean, I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...?\u201d</p><p>I give up on playing with him. \u201cListen, I may need you to pick me up from somewhere. Twenty minutes, tops. I wouldn\u2019t ask unless it was important.\u201d</p><p>He crooks one side of his mouth into a smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d</p><p>I lean forward so my mouth is inches away from the perfect shell of his ear. The smell of him\u2014freshly cut grass and mint\u2014is addictive. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d I pull back. Otherwise I won\u2019t be able to stop myself from kissing his neck. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. I was never like this with Rob. I can barely keep my hands to myself around Kent. Maybe dying a few times messes with your hormones or something. I kind of like it.</p><p>His face gets serious again. \u201cWhat you wrote here...\u201d He fingers the note, folding it and unfolding it, his eyes dazzling, swirling with gold. \u201cThe last bit...the hero thing...how did you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>My heart is beating frantically, and for one second I think he knows\u2014I think he remembers. The silence is heavy between us, everything past and remembered and forgotten and wanted swinging there like a pendulum. \u201cHow did I what?\u201d I can barely breathe the words.</p><p>He sighs and shakes his head, gives me a weak smile. \u201cNothing. Forget it. It\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I realize I\u2019ve been holding my breath, and I exhale, looking away so he won\u2019t see how disappointed I am. \u201cThanks for your rose, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Of all the roses I\u2019ve gotten it\u2019s the only one I kept. It\u2019s my favorite, I\u2019d said, when Marian Sykes delivered it to me.</p><p>She looked up at me, startled, and then looked around, as though I couldn\u2019t possibly be talking to her. When she realized I was, she blushed and smiled.</p><p>You have so many, she said shyly.</p><p>The problem is I can never keep them alive, I said. I have, like, a black thumb.</p><p>You have to cut the stems on an angle, she said eagerly, then blushed again. My sister taught me that. She used to like to garden. She turned away, biting her lip.</p><p>You should take them, I said.</p><p>She stared at me for a second as though suspecting a joke. Like, to keep? she said, reminding me of Izzy.</p><p>I\u2019m telling you, I can\u2019t have any more flower homicides on my conscience, I said. You could take them home. Do you have a vase?</p><p>She paused for a fraction of a second more and then broke into a dazzling smile, transforming her whole face. I\u2019ll keep them in my room, she said.</p><p>Kent cocks one eyebrow. \u201cHow do you know that I\u2019m the one who sent it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cNo one else draws weird cartoons for a living.\u201d</p><p>He puts a hand on his chest, acting offended. \u201cNot for a living. For the love of it. Besides, they\u2019re not weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Then thanks for your totally normal note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He grins. We\u2019re standing close enough that I can feel the heat coming off him.</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to be my knight in shining armor or what?\u201d</p><p>Kent does a little bow. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t resist a damsel in distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I could count on you.\u201d The hallways are empty now. Everyone is at lunch. For a moment we just stand there smiling at each other. Then something softens in his eyes and my heart soars. Everything in me feels fluttering and free, like I could take off from the ground at any second. Music, I think, he makes me feel like music. Then I think, He\u2019s going to kiss me right here, in the math wing of Thomas Jefferson High School, and I almost pass out.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t, though. Instead he reaches out and touches my shoulder once, lightly. When he removes his fingers I can still feel them tingling on my skin. \u201cUntil tonight, then.\u201d A flicker of a smile. \u201cYour secret better be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, I promise.\u201d I wish I could memorize every single thing about him. I want to burn him into my mind. I can\u2019t believe how blind I was for so long. I start to back away before I do something wildly inappropriate, like jump on top of him.</p><p>\u201cSam?\u201d he stops me.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are doing that searching thing again, and now I understand why he told me before that he could see through me. He\u2019s actually been paying attention. I feel like he\u2019s reading my mind right now, which is more than a little embarrassing, since most of my thoughts for the moment involve how perfect his lips are.</p><p>He bites his lip and shuffles his feet a little. \u201cWhy me? For tonight, I mean. We haven\u2019t really talked in, like, seven years....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m making up for lost time.\u201d I keep backing away from him, skipping a little.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>I think of Kent holding my hand in the dark, leading me through rooms crisscrossed with moonlight. I think of his voice lulling me to sleep, carrying me off like a tide. I think of time stilling as he cupped my face and brought his lips to mine.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d I say, \u201cit can only be you.\u201d</p><p>SECOND CHANCES</p><p>Kent\u2019s Valogram was only the first of several adjustments I made in the Rose Room this morning, and as soon as I enter the cafeteria I can tell that Rob got his. He breaks away from his friends and lopes up to me before I can even make it over to the lunch line (where I\u2019m planning on ordering a double roast beef sandwich). As always, his stupid Yankees hat is barely balanced on his head, twisted around to the side like he\u2019s in some rap video from 1992.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe.\u201d He goes to put his arm around me, and I step away casually. \u201cGot your rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I got yours too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looks around, sees a single rose looped through the handle of my messenger bag, and frowns. \u201cIs that mine?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, smiling sweetly.</p><p>He rubs his forehead. He always does this when he\u2019s thinking, like the act of actually using his mind gives him a headache. \u201cWhat happened to all your roses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in storage,\u201d I say, which is kind of true.</p> <p>He shakes his head, letting it go. \u201cSo there\u2019s a party tonight....\u201d He trails off, then tips his head and smirks at me. \u201cI thought it would be fun to go for a bit.\u201d He reaches out and clomps a hand on my shoulder, massaging me hard. \u201cLike, you know, foreplay.\u201d</p><p>Only Rob would think that pounding foamy beer from a keg and screaming at each other counts as foreplay, but I decide to let it go and play along. \u201cForeplay?\u201d I say, as innocently as I can.</p><p>He obviously thinks I\u2019m being flirtatious. He smiles and tilts his head backward, looking at me through half narrowed eyes. I used to think it was the cutest thing when he did this; now it\u2019s a bit like watching a linebacker try to samba. He might have all the moves down, but it just doesn\u2019t look right.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cI really liked what you wrote in your note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d I make my voice a purr, thinking about what I scrawled out this morning. You don\u2019t have to wait for me anymore.</p> <p>\u201cSo I was thinking I\u2019d get to the party at ten, stay for an hour or two.\u201d He shrugs and adjusts his hat, back to business now that he got the flirting out of the way.</p><p>I feel suddenly tired. I\u2019d been planning to mess with Rob a little\u2014to get back at him for not paying attention, for not being there, for not caring about anything except partying and lacrosse and how he looks in his stupid Yankees hat\u2014but I can\u2019t keep up the game anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t really care what you do, Rob.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates. This was not the answer he was expecting. \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping over tonight, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>His hand flies up to his forehead again: more rubbing. \u201cBut you said...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said you didn\u2019t have to wait for me anymore. And you don\u2019t.\u201d I suck in a deep breath. One, two, three, jump. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out, Rob. I want to break up.\u201d</p> <p>He takes a step backward. His face goes completely white, and then he turns bright red from the forehead down, like someone\u2019s filling him with Kool-Aid. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m breaking up with you.\u201d I\u2019ve never done anything like this before, and I\u2019m surprised by how easy I\u2019m finding it. Letting go is easy: it\u2019s all downhill. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s working out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but\u2014\u201d he sputters at me. The confusion on his face is replaced by rage. \u201cYou can\u2019t break up with me.\u201d</p><p>I unconsciously shuffle backward, crossing my arms. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me like I\u2019m the dumbest person alive. \u201cYou,\u201d he says, almost spitting the word, \u201ccannot break up with me.\u201d</p><p>Then I get it. Rob does remember. He remembers that in sixth grade he said I wasn\u2019t cool enough for him\u2014remembers it, and still believes it. Any sympathy I still feel for him vanishes in that moment, and as he\u2019s standing there, bright red with his fists clenched, it amazes me how ugly I find him.</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d I say calmly. \u201cI just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I waited for you. I waited for you for months.\u201d He turns away and mutters something I don\u2019t hear.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He looks back at me, his face twisted with disgust and anger. This cannot be the same person who a week ago nestled against my shoulder and told me I was his personal blanket. It\u2019s like his face has dropped away and there\u2019s a totally different face underneath.</p><p>\u201cI said I should have screwed Gabby Haynes when she asked me to over break,\u201d he says coldly.</p><p>Something flares in my stomach, leftover pain or pride, but it passes quickly enough and is replaced again by a feeling of calm. I\u2019m already gone from here, already flying over this, and I can suddenly understand exactly what Juliet feels, must have felt for some time. Thinking about her brings my strength back, and I even manage to smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never too late for second chances,\u201d I say sweetly, and then I walk away to have my last lunch with my best friends.</p><p>Ten minutes later, when I\u2019m finally sitting down at our usual table\u2014scarfing an enormous roast beef sandwich with mayonnaise and a plate full of fries, hungrier than I\u2019ve been in a long time\u2014and Juliet comes through the cafeteria, I see she has placed a single rose in the empty water bottle that is strapped to the side of her backpack. She\u2019s looking around, too, her face cutting the curtain of her hair in two, checking each and every table she passes, searching, looking for clues. Her eyes are bright and alert. She\u2019s chewing her lip, but she doesn\u2019t look unhappy. She looks alive. My heart skips a beat: this is the important thing.</p><p>As she weaves past our table, I see a folded note fluttering just under the petals of her rose, and even though I\u2019m too far away to read it, I can see what\u2019s written there clearly, even when I close my eyes. A single phrase.</p><p>It\u2019s never too late.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up with you today?\u201d Lindsay asks on the way to The Country\u2019s Best Yogurt. We\u2019ve almost reached the Row, the line of small shops clustered at the crest of the hill like mushrooms. The blanket of dark clouds is being drawn over the horizon inch by inch, bringing the promise of snow.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d We\u2019re walking arm-in-arm, trying to stay warm. I wanted Ally and Elody to come along, but Elody had a Spanish test, and Ally insisted that if she missed another English class she\u2019d probably get suspended. I didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it.</p><p>A day like any other.</p><p>\u201cI mean, why are you acting so weird?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to formulate an answer and Lindsay goes on, \u201cLike, zoning out at lunch and stuff.\u201d She bites her lip. \u201cI got this text from Amy Weiss....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmy Weiss is obviously crazy, and I would never believe anything she says, especially about you,\u201d Lindsay qualifies quickly.</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d I say, amused, pretty sure I know where this is headed.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Lindsay sucks in a deep breath and says in a rush, \u201cShe says she was talking to Steve Waitman, who was talking to Rob, who said that you broke up?\u201d Lindsay shoots a glance at me and forces a laugh. \u201cI told her it was bullshit, obviously.\u201d</p><p>I pause, choosing my words carefully. \u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit. It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay stops walking and stares. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI broke up with him at lunch.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head like she\u2019s trying to dislodge the words from her brain. \u201cAnd, um, were you planning on sharing this little piece of news at some point? With your best friends? Or were you just counting on it to make the rounds eventually?\u201d</p><p>I can tell she\u2019s really hurt. \u201cListen, Lindsay, I was going to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She presses her hands to both ears, still shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. What happened? You guys were supposed to\u2014I mean, you told me you wanted to\u2014tonight.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cThis is why I didn\u2019t want to tell you, Lindz. I knew you\u2019d make a big deal out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it is a big deal.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s so outraged she\u2019s not even paying attention as we pass Hunan Kitchen: she\u2019s too busy glaring at me like she expects me to suddenly turn blue or combust, like I can never be trusted again.</p><p>It occurs to me she\u2019s really going to feel that way after I do what I\u2019m about to do, but it can\u2019t be helped. I turn to her, putting my arms on her shoulders. \u201cWait here for a second, okay?\u201d</p><p>She blinks at me. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to stop in Hunan Kitchen for a second.\u201d I brace myself, waiting for her to freak out. \u201cI kind of have something for Anna Cartullo.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m prepared for her to scream or stalk off or throw gummy bears at me or something, but instead her face goes totally blank like the power switch has been flipped off. I\u2019m kind of worried she may be going into shock, but the opportunity is too good to pass up.</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes,\u201d I say. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>I duck into Hunan Kitchen before Lindsay\u2014and her attitude\u2014can come back online. A bell jingles on the door as I walk in. Alex looks up, worried for a second, and then plasters a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Sam?\u201d he drawls. Idiot.</p><p>I ignore him and go straight to Anna. She has her head bent, pushing the food around her plate. It\u2019s a lot safer than eating it, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I\u2019m nervous for some reason. There\u2019s something unsettling about her quietness, the way she lifts her eyes and stares at me with no expression. It reminds me of Juliet. \u201cI just came by to give you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me something?\u201d She curls her lip back, skeptical, and the resemblance to Juliet is no longer so strong. She must think I\u2019m crazy. As far as she knows we\u2019ve never exchanged a word in our lives, and I can only imagine what she thinks I want to give her.</p><p>Alex is looking back and forth from Anna to me, as confused as she is. I\u2019m aware of Lindsay watching me through the grimy window, and the fact that three people are staring at me like I\u2019ve lost it is a little overwhelming. I reach into my bag, hands trembling a little bit.</p><p>\u201cYeah, listen, I know it\u2019s weird. I can\u2019t really explain it, but...\u201d I pull out a big book of M. C. Escher sketches and put it on the table next to the bowl of sesame chicken. Or orange beef. Or cooked cat. Or whatever.</p><p>Anna freezes, staring at the book like it\u2019s going to bite her.</p><p>\u201cIt just seemed like the kind of thing you\u2019d like,\u201d I say quickly, already backing away from the table. Now that the hard part is over I feel a thousand times better. \u201cThere\u2019s over two hundred drawings. You could even hang some of them up, if you had a place to put them.\u201d</p><p>Something tenses in Anna\u2019s face. She\u2019s still staring at the book on the table, her hands resting on her thighs. I can see how tightly she\u2019s curling her fists.</p><p>I\u2019m just about to turn and jet out the door when she glances up. Our eyes meet. She doesn\u2019t say anything, but her mouth relaxes. It\u2019s not quite a smile, but it\u2019s close, and I take it as a thank-you.</p><p>I hear Alex say, \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d and then I\u2019m out the door, the bell sounding a shrill note behind me.</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s still standing there exactly as I left her, eyes dull. I know she\u2019s been watching through the window.</p><p>\u201cNow I know you\u2019ve gone crazy,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d I feel exhilarated now that it\u2019s over with. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m fiending me some yogurt.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay doesn\u2019t budge. \u201cLost it. Flipped your lid. Gone bat shit. Since when do you bring Anna Cartullo presents?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cListen, it\u2019s not like I got her a friendship bracelet or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you even talk to Anna Cartullo?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. I can tell she\u2019s not going to give up on this. \u201cI talked to her for the first time a couple days ago, all right?\u201d Lindsay\u2019s still staring like the world is melting away before her eyes. I know the feeling. \u201cShe\u2019s actually pretty nice. I mean, I think you might like her if\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lindsay makes a high-pitched squealing noise and claps her hands over her ears again like the very words are torture. She keeps on shrieking like this while I sigh and check my watch, waiting for her to finish her performance.</p> <p>Eventually she calms down, her squealing dying away to a gurgling noise in the back of her throat. She squints at me. I can\u2019t help but giggle. She looks like a total freak.</p><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAre you back?\u201d She peels one hand off her ear tentatively, experimenting.</p><p>\u201cIs who back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha Emily Kingston. My best friend. My heterosexual life partner.\u201d She leans forward and raps once on my forehead with her knuckles. \u201cInstead of this weird lobotomized boyfriend-dumping Anna Cartullo\u2013liking pod who\u2019s impersonating her.\u201d</p> <p>I roll my eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t know everything about me, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apparently don\u2019t know anything about you.\u201d Lindsay crosses her arms. I tug on the sleeve of her jacket, and she trudges forward reluctantly. I can tell she\u2019s actually upset. I put my arms around her and squeeze. She\u2019s so much shorter than I am that I have to take mini-shuffling steps so our paces are matched up, but I let her set the rhythm.</p><p>\u201cYou know what my favorite flavor of yogurt is,\u201d I say, hoping to appease her.</p><p>Lindsay heaves a sigh. \u201cDouble chocolate,\u201d she grumbles, but she\u2019s not pushing me off of her, which is a good sign. \u201cWith crushed peanut butter cups and Cap\u2019n Crunch cereal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know you know what size I\u2019m going to get.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re at the door to The Country\u2019s Best Yogurt now, and I can already smell the deliciously sweet chemical-y aroma wafting out to us. It\u2019s like the smell of the bread baking at Subway. You know it\u2019s not the way nature or God intended it to smell, but something about it is addictive.</p> <p>Lindsay looks at me from the corner of her eye as I pull my arms off her. Her expression is so mournful it\u2019s funny, and I choke down another laugh.</p><p>\u201cBetter be careful, Miss Jumbo Queen,\u201d she says, tossing her hair. \u201cAll that artificial yumminess is going straight to your hips.\u201d</p><p>But her mouth is crooked up into a smile, and I know she\u2019s forgiven me.</p><p>FRIENDSHIP, A STORY</p><p>If I had to pick the top three things I love about each of my friends, here\u2019s what they would be.</p><p>ALLY:</p><p>Spent all of sophomore year collecting miniature porcelain cows and reading obscure facts about them online after one of them\u2014a real one, I mean\u2014wrapped its tongue around her wrist while she was on vacation in Vermont.</p><p>Cooks without recipes, and is totally going to have her own cooking show someday, and has promised we can all come on and be guests.</p> <p>Sticks her tongue out all the way when she yawns, like a cat.</p><p>ELODY:</p><p>Has perfect pitch and the clearest, richest voice you can imagine, like maple syrup pouring over warm pancakes, but doesn\u2019t ever show off and only sings on her own when she\u2019s in the shower.</p><p>Once went a whole school year wearing at least one green item of clothing every single day.</p><p>Snorts when she laughs, which always makes me laugh.</p><p>LINDSAY:</p><p>Will always dance, even when nobody else is, even when there\u2019s no music\u2014in the cafeteria, in the bathroom, in the mall food court.</p><p>Toilet papered Todd Horton\u2019s house every single day for a week after he told everyone that Elody was a bad kisser.</p><p>Once broke into a full-on sprint while we were cutting across the park, pumping her arms and legs and zooming across the fields in her jeans and Chinese Laundry boots. I started running too but couldn\u2019t catch up to her before we were both doubled over, huffing out the cold autumn air, my lungs feeling like they were going to explode, and when I laughed and said, \u201cYou win,\u201d she gave me the strangest look over her shoulder, not mean, just like she couldn\u2019t believe I was there, then straightened up and said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t racing you.\u201d</p><p>I think I understand that now.</p><p>I\u2019m thinking about all these things at Ally\u2019s house, feeling like I haven\u2019t said them enough, or at all, feeling like we\u2019ve spent too much time making fun of one another or bullshitting about things that don\u2019t matter or wishing things and people were different\u2014better, more interesting, cuter, older. But it\u2019s hard to find a way to say it now, so instead I just laugh along while Lindsay and Elody shimmy around the kitchen and Ally frantically tries to salvage something edible from two-day-old Italian pesto and some old packaged crackers. And when Lindsay throws her arms around my shoulders and then Ally\u2019s, and then Elody scoots around to Ally\u2019s other side, and Lindsay says, \u201cI love you bitches to death. You know that, right?\u201d and Elody yells, \u201cGroup hug!\u201d I just barrel in there and put my arms around them and squeeze until Elody breaks away, laughing, and says, \u201cIf I laugh any harder I\u2019m going to throw up.\u201d</p><p>THE SECRET</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get it.\u201d Lindsay\u2019s pouting in the front seat, halfway down Kent\u2019s driveway, where the line of cars ends. \u201cHow do you expect us to get home?\u201d</p><p>I sigh and explain it for the thousandth time. \u201cI\u2019ll get us a ride, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just come in with us now?\u201d Ally whines from the backseat, also for the thousandth time. \u201cJust leave the damn car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd let you drive home, Ms. Absolut World?\u201d I twist around and stare pointedly at the vodka bottle she\u2019s holding. She takes this as a cue to toss back another gulp.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive us home,\u201d Lindsay insists. \u201cHave you ever seen me drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t even drive sober.\u201d</p><p>Elody snorts and Lindsay wags a finger at her. \u201cWatch out or you\u2019ll be walking to school from now on,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we\u2019re missing the party.\u201d Ally finger-combs her hair, ducking so she can check herself out in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cGive me fifteen minutes, tops,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll be back before you even make it to the keg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will you get back here?\u201d Lindsay\u2019s still eyeing me suspiciously, but she opens the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d I say. \u201cI hooked up a ride earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t just drive us home later.\u201d Lindsay\u2019s grumbling, still unhappy about the arrangements, but she climbs out, and Ally and Elody follow. I don\u2019t bother answering. I\u2019ve already explained, and explained again, that I may be ducking out of the party early. I know all of them assume it\u2019s because Rob will be there and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll freak or something, and I don\u2019t correct them.</p><p>I\u2019m planning to drop the car in Lindsay\u2019s driveway, but after I pull out onto Route 9, I find that, without meaning to, I steer toward home. I\u2019m feeling calm, blank, like all of the darkness outside has somehow seeped in and turned everything off inside me. It\u2019s not an unpleasant feeling. It\u2019s kind of like being in a pool and kicking up onto your back until you find the perfect balance where you can float without thinking about it.</p><p>Most of the lights are off at my house. Izzy\u2019s gone to sleep several hours ago. There\u2019s a faint blue light glowing in the den. My father must be watching TV. Upstairs a bright square of light marks the bathroom. Through the shades I can see a figure moving around, and I imagine my mom dotting Clinique moisturizer on her face, squinting without her contacts, the tattered arm of her bathrobe fluttering, a bird wing. As usual they\u2019ve left the porch light on for me, so that when I come home I won\u2019t have to fumble in my bag for my keys. They\u2019ll be making plans for tomorrow, maybe wondering what to do for breakfast or whether to wake me up before noon, and for a moment grief for everything I am losing\u2014have lost already, lost days ago in a split second of skidding and tearing where my life ripped away from its axis\u2014overwhelms me, and I put my head down on the steering wheel and wait for the feeling to pass. It does. The pain ebbs away. My muscles relax, and once again I\u2019m struck by the rightness of things.</p><p>As I\u2019m driving back to Lindsay\u2019s, I think about something I learned years ago in science class, that even when birds have been separated from their flock they will still migrate instinctively. They know where to go without ever having been shown the way. Everyone was talking about how amazing that was, but now it doesn\u2019t seem so strange. That\u2019s how I feel right now: as though I am in the air, all alone, but somehow I know exactly what to do.</p><p>A few miles before Lindsay\u2019s driveway, I pull out my phone and punch in Kent\u2019s number. It occurs to me that he may have thought I was kidding earlier today. Maybe he won\u2019t pick up when he doesn\u2019t recognize the phone number, or maybe he\u2019ll be so busy trying to keep people from puking on his parents\u2019 Oriental carpets he won\u2019t hear it. I count the rings, getting more and more nervous. One, two, three.</p><p>On the fourth ring there\u2019s the sound of fumbling. Then Kent\u2019s voice, warm and reassuring: \u201cHunky Heroes, rescuing distressed women, captive princesses, and girls without wheels since 1684. How can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d I say.</p><p>There\u2019s a surge in the music and the swelling of voices. Then I hear Kent cup his hand over the phone and yell, \u201cOut!\u201d A door shuts and the background noise is suddenly muffled.</p><p>\u201cWho else would it be?\u201d he says, his voice sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cEveryone else is here.\u201d He readjusts something and his voice becomes louder. He must be pressing right up to the phone. The thought of his lips is distracting. \u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope your car\u2019s not blocked in,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause I\u2019m in desperate need of a ride.\u201d</p><p>On the way back to Kent\u2019s, we\u2019re mostly quiet. He doesn\u2019t ask me why I was standing in the middle of Lindsay\u2019s driveway, and he doesn\u2019t press the issue of why I\u2019ve chosen him to be my ride. I\u2019m grateful for that, and happy just to sit in silence next to him, watching the rain and the dark brushstrokes of the trees against the sky. As we turn into his driveway, which by this point is almost completely packed with cars, I\u2019m trying to decide exactly what the rain dancing in the headlights looks like. Not glitter, exactly.</p><p>Kent puts the car in park but leaves the engine on. \u201cI still haven\u2019t forgotten that you promised me a secret, by the way.\u201d He turns to look at me. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re getting off so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d I unbuckle my seat belt and inch closer to him, still watching the rain out of the corner of my eye. Like dust, kind of, but only if dust were made of solid white light. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kent folds his hands in his lap, staring at me expectantly, his mouth just curved into a smile. \u201cSo let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><p>I reach across Kent and pull the keys out of the ignition, cutting the lights. In the resulting darkness the sound of the rain seems much louder, washing all around us.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kent says softly, his voice making my heart soar again, making my whole body light. \u201cNow I can\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>His face and body are all shadow, darkness on darkness. I can just make out the lines of him, and, of course, feel the warmth from his skin. I lean forward, catching my chin on the roughness of his corduroy jacket, finding his ear, accidentally bumping it with my mouth. He inhales sharply and his whole body tenses. My heart is fluid, soaring. There\u2019s no longer any space between heartbeats.</p> <p>\u201cThe secret is,\u201d I say, whispering right into his ear, \u201cthat yours was the best kiss I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\u201d</p><p>He pulls back a little so that he can look at me, but our lips are still just inches away. I can\u2019t make out his expression in the dark, but I can tell that his eyes are searching my face again.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve never kissed you,\u201d he whispers back. Around us the rain sounds like falling glass. \u201cNot since third grade, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I smile, but I\u2019m not sure if he can see it. \u201cBetter get started, then,\u201d I say, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><p>He pauses for only a fraction of a second. Then he leans forward and presses his lips to mine, and the whole world powers off, the moon and the rain and the sky and the streets, and it\u2019s just the two of us in the dark, alive, alive, alive.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019re kissing. It seems like hours, but somehow when he pulls away, breathing hard, both hands holding my face, the clock glowing dully on the dashboard has only inched forward a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he says. I can feel his chest rising and falling quickly. We\u2019re both out of breath. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>I force myself to pull away, find the handle in the dark and pop the door open. The cold air and the rain whooshes in, helping me think. I suck in a deep breath. \u201cFor the ride and everything.\u201d</p><p>Even in the dark I can see his eyes sparkling like a cat\u2019s. I can hardly bring myself to look away. \u201cYou really saved my life tonight,\u201d I say, my little joke, and then before he can stop me, and even though he calls my name, I jump out of the car and jog along the driveway toward the house, for the very last party of my life.</p><p>\u201cYou made it!\u201d Lindsay squeals when I find her in the back room. As always the music and heat and smoke is impassable, a wall of people, perfume, and sound. \u201cI totally thought you would flake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d show,\u201d Ally says, reaching out and squeezing one of my hands. She drops her voice, which at this volume means she screams a little quieter. \u201cDid you see Rob?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s avoiding me,\u201d I say, which is true. Thank God.</p><p>Lindsay twists around, calling for Elody\u2014\u201cLook who decided to grace us with her presence!\u201d she screams, and Elody scans our faces before registering that I haven\u2019t been at the party the whole time\u2014and then turns to me, slipping her arm around my shoulders. \u201cNow it\u2019s officially a party. Al, give Sam a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d I wave away the bottle she offers me. I flip open my cell phone. Eleven thirty. \u201cActually, um, I think I\u2019m going to go downstairs for a bit. Maybe outside. It\u2019s really hot up here.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay and Ally exchange a glance.</p><p>\u201cYou just came from outside,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cYou just got here. Like five seconds ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking around for you guys for a while.\u201d I know I sound lame, but I also know that I can\u2019t explain.</p><p>Lindsay crosses her arms. \u201cUh-uh, no way. Something\u2019s going on with you, and you\u2019re going to tell us what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been acting weird all day.\u201d Ally bobbles her head.</p> <p>\u201cDid Lindsay tell you to say that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s been acting weird?\u201d Elody\u2019s just made her way over to us.</p><p>\u201cMe, apparently,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Elody nods. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsay didn\u2019t tell me to say anything.\u201d Ally puffs up her chest, getting offended. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re your best friends,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cWe know you.\u201d</p><p>I press my fingers against my temples, trying to block out the throbbing sounds of the music, and close my eyes. When I open them again, Elody, Ally, and Lindsay are all staring at me suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, okay?\u201d I\u2019m desperate to prevent a long conversation\u2014or worse, a fight. \u201cTrust me. It\u2019s just been a weird week.\u201d Understatement of the year.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re worried about you, Sam,\u201d Lindsay says. \u201cYou\u2019re not acting like yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d I say, and when they stare at me blankly, I sigh, leaning forward to wrestle them all into a group hug.</p><p>Elody squeals and giggles, \u201cPDA much?\u201d and Lindsay and Ally seem to relax too.</p><p>\u201cI promise nothing\u2019s the matter,\u201d I say, which isn\u2019t exactly true, but I figure it\u2019s the best thing to say. \u201cBest friends forever, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no secrets.\u201d Lindsay stares pointedly at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd no bullshit,\u201d Elody trumpets, which isn\u2019t part of our little routine, but whatever. She\u2019s supposed to say, \u201cand no lies,\u201d but I guess one works as well as the other.</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d Ally finishes, \u201cand till death do us part.\u201d</p><p>The last part falls on me to say, \u201cAnd even then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd even then,\u201d the three of them echo.</p><p>\u201cAll right, enough mushy crap.\u201d Lindsay breaks away. \u201cI, for one, came to get drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t get drunk,\u201d Ally says.</p><p>\u201cFigure of speech.\u201d</p><p>Ally and Lindsay start going back and forth, Ally dancing away with the vodka bottle (\u201cIf you don\u2019t get drunk, I don\u2019t see the point of drinking and wasting it\u201d) as Elody wanders back over to Muffin. At least the attention is off me.</p><p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d I say loudly to all of them in general, and Elody glances over her shoulder at me, but she may be looking at someone else. Lindsay flaps a hand in my direction, and Ally doesn\u2019t hear me at all. It reminds me of leaving my house for the last time this morning, how in the end it\u2019s impossible to understand the finality of certain things, certain words, certain moments. As I turn away my vision gets blurry, and I\u2019m surprised to find that I\u2019m crying. The tears come without any warning. I blink repeatedly until the world sharpens again, rubbing the wetness off my cheeks. I check my cell phone. Eleven forty-five.</p><p>Downstairs I stand just inside the door, waiting for Juliet, which is a bit like trying to stay on your feet in the middle of a riptide. People swarm around me, but hardly anybody looks my way. Maybe they\u2019re getting a weird vibe off me, too, or they can tell I\u2019m focused elsewhere. Or maybe\u2014and this makes me sad as soon as I think it\u2014they can sense, somehow, that I\u2019m already gone. I push the thought away.</p><p>Finally I see her slip through the front door, white sweater tied loosely around her, head stooped. Instantly I jump forward and put a hand on her arm. She starts, staring at me, and though she must have imagined coming face-to-face with me tonight, the fact that I\u2019ve found her, and not the other way around, throws her off guard.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say. \u201cCan I talk to you for a minute?\u201d</p><p>She opens her mouth, shuts it, then opens it again. \u201cActually, I, um, kind of have somewhere to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d In one movement I draw her away from the crowded entrance and toward a little recessed area in the hall. It\u2019s a little easier to hear each other here, though it\u2019s so squished we have to stand nearly pressed chest-to-chest. \u201cWeren\u2019t you looking for me, anyway? Weren\u2019t you looking for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014?\u201d She breaks off, sucks in a breath, and shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m not here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I stare at her, willing her to look at me, but she doesn\u2019t. I want to tell her that I get it, that I understand, but she\u2019s examining the tiling on the floors. \u201cI know it\u2019s bigger than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything,\u201d she says dully.</p><p>\u201cI know what you have planned for tonight,\u201d I say, very quietly.</p><p>Then she looks up. For a second our eyes meet, and I see fear flashing there, and something else\u2014hope, maybe?\u2014but she quickly drops her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know,\u201d she says simply. \u201cNobody knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that you have something to tell me,\u201d I say. \u201cI know that you have something you wanted to say to all of us\u2014to me, to Lindsay, to Elody, and Ally, too.\u201d</p><p>Again she looks up, but this time she holds my gaze, eyes wide, and we stare at each other. Now I know what the look on her face is, behind the fear: wonder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bitch,\u201d she whispers, so quietly I\u2019m not sure I even hear the words or am just remembering them, imagining them in her voice. She says it like she is reciting the lines to an old play, some long-neglected script she can\u2019t manage to forget.</p><p>I nod. \u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cI know I am. I know I have been\u2014we all have been. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She takes a quick step back, but there\u2019s nowhere to go, so she ends up bumping up against the wall. She flattens herself, hands braced against the plaster, breathing hard, like I\u2019m some kind of a wild animal that might attack her at any second. She\u2019s shaking her head quickly from side to side. I don\u2019t even think she knows she\u2019s doing it.</p><p>\u201cJuliet.\u201d I reach out, but she shrinks an extra half inch into the wall, and I drop my hand. \u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019m trying to tell you how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>She seems to break away from the wall with effort, like she\u2019s not sure she\u2019ll be able to stand without it. She tries to squeeze past me, but I shuffle around so we\u2019re face-to-face again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou said that.\u201d Now she\u2019s getting angry. I\u2019m glad. I think it\u2019s a good sign.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean...\u201d I take a deep breath, willing her to understand. This is how it\u2019s supposed to be. \u201cI have to come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she says. \u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. I can\u2019t.\u201d As we\u2019re standing there I realize we\u2019re almost exactly the same height. We must look like the dark and light sides of an Oreo cookie, and I think how just as easily it could have been the other way around. She could be blocking my path; I could be trying to slip around her into the dark.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014\u201d she starts, but I don\u2019t ever hear what she\u2019s about to say. At that second someone yells, \u201cSam!\u201d from the stairs, and as I turn around to look up at Kent, Juliet darts past me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJuliet!\u201d I whip around but not quickly enough. She\u2019s swallowed by the crowd, the gap that allowed her to break for the door closing just as quickly as it opened, a shifting Tetris pattern of bodies, and now I\u2019m running up against backs and hands and enormous leather bags.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d</p><p>Not now, Kent. I\u2019m fighting my way toward the door, every few steps being carried backward as people drive relentlessly toward the kitchen, holding up cups that need to be refilled. When I\u2019m almost at the door, the crowd thins and I surge forward. But then I feel a warm hand on my back, and Kent\u2019s spinning me around to face him, and despite the fact that I need to catch Juliet and the fact that we\u2019re standing in the middle of a billion people, I think about how good it would feel to dance with him. Really dance, not just grind up on each other like people do at homecoming\u2014dance the way people used to, with my hands on his shoulders and his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d He\u2019s out of breath and his hair is messier than usual. \u201cWhy did you run away from me before?\u201d</p> <p>He looks so confused and concerned I feel my heart somersault in my chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have time to talk about this right now,\u201d I say as gently as possible. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you later, okay?\u201d It\u2019s the easiest way. It\u2019s the only way.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sounds so emphatic I\u2019m momentarily thrown off guard.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, no.\u201d He stands in front of me, blocking my path to the door. \u201cI want to talk to you. I want to talk now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d I start to say, but he cuts me off.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t run away again.\u201d He reaches out and places his hands gently on my shoulders, but his touch makes a current of warmth and energy zip through me. \u201cDo you understand? You can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d</p><p>The way he\u2019s looking at me makes me feel weak. The tears threaten to come again. \u201cI never meant to hurt you,\u201d I croak out.</p><p>He releases my shoulders, pushing his hands through his hair. He looks like he wants to scream. \u201cYou act like I\u2019m invisible for years, then you send me this adorable little note, then I pick you up, and you kiss me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you kissed me, actually.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201c\u2014And you completely blow me away and rip my world up and everything else, and then you go back to ignoring me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI blew you away?\u201d I squeak out before I can stop myself.</p><p>He stares at me steadily. \u201cYou blew everything away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Kent.\u201d I look down at my palms, which are actually itching to reach out and touch him, to smooth his hair back and tuck it behind his ear. \u201cI meant everything that happened in the car. I meant to kiss you, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I kissed you.\u201d Kent\u2019s voice is even and I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s joking or not.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I meant to kiss you back.\u201d I try to swallow the lump in my throat. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can tell you right now. I meant it. More than I\u2019ve ever meant anything else in my life.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m glad I\u2019m staring down at my shoes because at that second the tears push out of my eyes and start running down my cheeks. I quickly wipe them away with the back of my hand, pretending to be rubbing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat about that other thing you said in the car?\u201d Kent doesn\u2019t sound angry, at least, though I\u2019m too scared to look at him. His voice is softer now. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t have much time. What did you mean?\u201d</p><p>Now that the tears have found a way out, there\u2019s no stopping them, and I keep my head bowed. One of them splatters on my shoe, leaving a mark in the shape of a star. \u201cThere are things going on right now....\u201d</p> <p>He puts two fingers under my chin and tilts my face up toward his. And then I really do stumble. My legs just give out underneath me, and he scoops one arm behind my back to keep me upright.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Sam?\u201d He brushes a tear away from the corner of my eye with his thumb, his eyes searching my face, doing the thing where I feel like he\u2019s turning me inside out and looking straight into my heart. \u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, unable to speak, and he rushes on, \u201cYou can tell me. Whatever it is, you can trust me.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m tempted to let myself stay this way, pressed against him; to kiss him over and over until it feels like I\u2019m breathing through him. But then I think of Juliet in the woods. I see two blinding beams of light cutting through the darkness, and the low sound of roaring, like a faraway ocean, an engine jumping to life. The roaring and the lights fill my head, pushing everything else out\u2014the fear, the regret, the sadness\u2014and I can focus again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in trouble. It\u2019s not about me. I\u2014I have to help someone.\u201d I break away from Kent gently, detaching his arm from my waist. \u201cI can\u2019t really explain. You have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and give him a final kiss\u2014just a peck, really, our lips hardly brushing together, but enough for me to feel that sense of soaring again, strength and power flowing through me. When I pull away I\u2019m expecting more argument, but instead he just stares at me for a beat longer and then whirls around and disappears toward the stairs. My stomach plummets and for one split second I ache for him so badly\u2014I miss him\u2014I feel like my whole chest has caved in. Then I think of the dark, and the lights, and the roaring, and Juliet, and before I can think of anything else, I fight the final few steps to the door and step out into the cold, where the rain is still coming down like shards of moonlight, or like steel.</p><p>A MIRACLE OF CHANCE AND COINCIDENCE, PART II</p><p>\u201cJuliet! Juliet!\u201d I know she\u2019s gotten a fair start and won\u2019t be able to hear me, but it makes me feel better to call her name, makes the darkness all around me not feel so close and heavy.</p><p>Of course I\u2019ve forgotten the flashlight. I begin my combo shuffle-run down the icy driveway, wishing I\u2019d decided to wear sneakers instead of my favorite olive leather wedge-heeled Dolce Vita boots. At the same time, these are shoes to die for\u2014to die in.</p><p>The lights of the house have winked out behind me, swallowed by the curves of the road and the tall spikes of the trees, when I think I hear someone calling my name. For a second I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve imagined it, or it\u2019s only the sound of the wind through the branches. I pause, hesitating, and then I hear it again. \u201cSam!\u201d It sounds like Kent.</p><p>\u201cSam! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>It is Kent.</p><p>This throws me. I was pretty sure when he stalked away from me at the party that that would be the end of it. I never expected he would actually follow me. I consider turning around and going back to him. But there\u2019s no time. Besides, I\u2019ve said everything I can. For a moment, standing there in the freezing cold with the air burning my lungs and the rain pouring into my collar and down my back, I close my eyes and remember being with him in the warm, dry car surrounded on all sides by pouring rain. I remember the kiss and a feeling of lifting, as though we were going to be swept away at any moment by a wave. When I hear him call my name again it sounds closer, and I imagine him cupping my face and whispering to me. Sam.</p><p>Someone screams. I snap my eyes open, my heart surging in my chest, thinking of Juliet. But then I hear a few voices calling to one another\u2014distant, still, a confusion of sounds\u2014and I could swear that among them I hear Lindsay\u2019s voice. But that\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m imagining things, and I\u2019m wasting time.</p><p>I keep going toward the road. As I get closer I hear the roar of vehicles, the hiss of wheels against asphalt, both sounding like waves on a beach.</p><p>When I find Juliet she\u2019s standing, drenched, her clothes clinging to her body, her arms floating loosely at her sides like the rain and the cold doesn\u2019t bother her at all.</p><p>\u201cJuliet!\u201d</p><p>She hears me then. She swivels her head sharply, like she\u2019s being called back to earth from somewhere else. I start jogging toward her, hearing the low rumbling of an approaching truck\u2014going way too fast\u2014behind me. She takes a quick step backward as I pick up speed, pinwheeling my arms to keep from toppling over on the ice, her face coming alive when she sees me, full of anger and fear and that other thing. Wonder.</p><p>The engine is louder now, a steady growl, and the driver leans on his horn. The noise is huge: rolling, blasting around us, filling the air with sound. Still Juliet hasn\u2019t moved. She\u2019s just standing there, staring at me, shaking her head a little bit, like we\u2019re long-lost friends in a random airport somewhere in Europe and have just bumped into each other. It\u2019s so weird to see you here.... Isn\u2019t it funny how life works? Small world.</p><p>I close the last few feet between us as the truck surges past, still blasting its horn. I grab onto her shoulders, and she takes a few stumbling steps backward into the woods, my momentum nearly carrying her off her feet. The sound of the horn ebbs away from us, taillights disappearing into the dark.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d I say, breathing hard. My arms are shaking.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She seems to snap into herself, trying to wrench away from me. \u201cAre you following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to...\u201d I nod toward the road, and I suddenly have the urge to hug her. She\u2019s alive and solid and real under my hands. \u201cI thought I wouldn\u2019t get to you in time.\u201d</p><p>She stops struggling and looks at me for a long second. There are no cars on the road, and in the pause I hear it sharply, definitively: \u201cSamantha Emily Kingston!\u201d It comes from the woods to my left, and there\u2019s only one person in the world who calls me by my full name. Lindsay Edgecombe.</p><p>Just then, like a chorus of birds rising up from the ground at the same time, come the other voices, crowding one another: \u201cSam! Sam! Sam!\u201d Kent, Ally, and Elody, all of them coming through the woods toward us.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Juliet looks really afraid now. I\u2019m so confused I loosen my grip on her shoulders and she twists away. \u201cWhy did you follow me? Why can\u2019t you leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuliet.\u201d I hold up my hands, a gesture of peace. \u201cI just want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d She turns away from me and stalks back up toward the road.</p><p>I follow her, feeling suddenly calm. The world around me sharpens and comes into clearer focus, and every time I hear my name bouncing through the woods it sounds closer and closer, and I think, I\u2019m sorry. But this is right. This is how it has to happen.</p><p>How it was supposed to happen all along.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Juliet,\u201d I say to her quietly. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not the right way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I have to do,\u201d she whispers back fiercely. \u201cYou don\u2019t know. You could never understand.\u201d She\u2019s staring at the road. Her shoulder blades are jutting out underneath her soaked T-shirt, and again I have the fantasy of a pair of wings unfurling behind her, lifting her away, carrying her out of danger.</p><p>\u201cSam! Sam! Sam!\u201d The voices are close now, and diagonal beams of light zigzag through the woods. I hear footsteps, too, and branches snapping underfoot. The road has been unusually clear of traffic, but now from both directions I make out the low growl of big engines. I close my eyes and think of flying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to help you,\u201d I say to Juliet, though I know that I can\u2019t make her understand, not like this.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get it?\u201d She turns to me, and to my surprise I see she\u2019s crying. \u201cI can\u2019t be fixed, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I think of standing on the stairs with Kent and saying exactly the same thing. I think of his beautiful light green eyes, and the way he said, You don\u2019t need to be fixed and the warmth of his hands and the softness of his lips. I think of Juliet\u2019s mask and how maybe we all feel patched and stitched together and not quite right.</p><p>I am not afraid.</p> <p>Dimly, I have the sense of roaring in my ears and voices so close and faces, white and frightened, emerging from the darkness, but I can\u2019t stop staring at Juliet as she\u2019s crying, still so beautiful.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she says.</p><p>And I say, \u201cIt\u2019s never too late.\u201d</p><p>In that split second she\u2019s launched herself into the road, but she looks back, startled, recognition lighting up her eyes. Then I\u2019m hurtling out behind her. I slam into her back, and she goes shooting forward, rolling toward the opposite shoulder, just as two vans converge, about to pass each other. There\u2019s a furious high whine and someone\u2014more than one person?\u2014screams my name and a feeling of heat all through my body and the sensation of being lifted, thrown, by a huge hand, a giant\u2019s hand; the earth revolves, turns upside down and sideways, and then a fog of darkness eats up the edges of the earth, turning everything to dream.</p><p>Floating images, moving in and out: bright green eyes and a field of sun-warmed grass, a mouth saying, Sam, Sam, Sam, making it sound like a song. Three faces blooming together like flowers on a single stem, names ebbing away from me, a single word: love. Red and white flashes, tree branches lit up like the vaulted ceiling of a church.</p> <p>And a face above mine, white and beautiful, eyes as large as the moon. You saved me. A hand on my cheek, cool and dry. Why did you save me? Words welling up on a tide: No. The opposite. Eyes the color of a dawn sky, a crown of blond hair, so bright and white and blinding I could swear it was a halo.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>They say that just before you die your whole life flashes before your eyes, but that\u2019s not how it happens for me.</p><p>I see only my greatest hits. The things I want to remember, and be remembered for. The time in Cape Cod when Izzy and I snuck down to the bay at midnight and tried to catch crabs with leftover hamburger meat, and the moon was so fat and round it looked like something you could sit on. When Ally tried to make a souffl\u00e9 and came marching into the kitchen with a roll of toilet paper on her head like a chef\u2019s hat, and Elody laughed so hard she peed a little bit and swore us all to secrecy. Lindsay throwing her arms around us and saying, \u201cLove you to death,\u201d and all of us echoing, \u201cAnd even then.\u201d Lying on the deck on hot August afternoons with the smell of grass shavings and flowers so heavy in the air, it\u2019s like you\u2019re tasting them. The time it snowed on Christmas, and my dad split up one of the old TV tables in the basement to use as firewood, and my mom made apple cider, and we tried to remember the words to \u201cSilent Night\u201d but ended up singing all our favorite show tunes.</p><p>And kissing Kent, because that\u2019s when I realized that time doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s when I realized that certain moments go on forever. Even after they\u2019re over they still go on, even after you\u2019re dead and buried, those moments are lasting still, backward and forward, on into infinity. They are everything and everywhere all at once.</p><p>They are the meaning.</p> <p>I\u2019m not scared, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering. The moment of death is full of sound and warmth and light, so much light it fills me, absorbs me: a tunnel of light shooting away, arcing up and up and up, and if singing were a feeling it would be this, this light, this lifting, like laughing...</p><p>The rest you have to find out for yourself. </p> </body></html>"]
